Your friends won't calling you to find out if you've fallen victim. Charitable organizations won't be formed to rush to your aid. No. If you're having fertility problems, you probably feel that you're completely alone in your struggle. Your reaction may be, "Why me? Everyone else is having babies. It's not fair." In my ten years of medical practice I have seen many infertile couples experience repeated disappointment, frustration, and disorientation. They cycle between guilt, anger, and despair�trapped in hope that with each new round of treatment they will conceive. When a course of therapy fails to produce a pregnancy, they experience all the stages of mourning�as though they had actually lost an infant. Over the years, however, I have seen many couples learn to deal with their trauma. They manage to get control of their lives and their feelings. They take an active part in their diagnosis and treatment. In fact, they seem to grow stronger and closer as a result of struggling with their fertility problem, It is because of these people that I decided to write this book. I want to tell you not only how these couples coped but also how they resolved their fertility problems. I hope that by sharing their experiences, you will gain insight into your parenting needs and be able to design a course of treatment and therapy that will meet those goals. In addition, you will avoid unnecessary procedures, unwarranted disappointments, and excess costs. Above all, you will feel less like a victim and, I hope, much less alone. I want to assure you that your fertility problems, your anger, your hypersensitivity, your feelings of inadequacy, and your eternal optimism aren't unique to just you. Fertility problems strike one in six American couples-4.5 million people. Each year over I million people consult physicians for infertility evaluation and treatment. The medical definition of infertility is "the inability to conceive after a year of unprotected intercourse or the inability to carry a pregnancy to term." However, if you already know or suspect that you have a fertility problem, you should seek an evaluation before waiting a year while trying to conceive. For example, a woman may suspect a problem if she suffers extreme pain with menstruation, has a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, or has few menstrual periods. A man may be concerned if he has ever contracted a sexually transmitted disease, has symptoms of genitourinary tract infection, or has an undescended or injured testicle. Infertility should not be confused with sterility, which is an irreversible condition. And it should not be referred to as subfertility, which connotes a borderline fertility problem that may not require treatment. All fertility problems, however, should be evaluated to determine their seriousness. Recently I have witnessed astounding progress in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Only a few years ago most couples with fertility problems had to turn to adoption or remain childless. But now, with the advances in pharmaceuticals, microsurgery, in vitro fertilization, micromanipulation, and egg donation, many viable options have opened up to infertile couples�with the result that "miracle babies" are being born almost every day. There is every reason for hope. I hope to help satisfy your thirst for medically sound information about your infertility�what may have caused it, what tests are available to diagnose the causes, what can be done to correct the problems, and most important, what your options are. Being informed of the most up-to-date medical technology will help you work with your physician to develop an effective, individualized course of treatment. It is not uncommon to find fertility problems in both partners. However, even when only one of you must be medically treated, I find that the fertility problem affects both of you because the couple loses control of their destiny, the couple undergoes fertility treatment, and the couple shares the emotional strain of dealing with friends and family. Infertility does not affect just one person�it affects the couple. Most people respond to infertility with disbelief and anger. As infertility becomes a reality, as they begin medical treatment, and if they experience repeated failures, their anxiety and frustration grow. All infertile couples suffer psychological trauma. All infertile couples feel cheated. All infertile couples feel that they've lost control of one of their most personal rights�the right to bear children. If you suffer from these symptoms, you are not alone. In this book I will help you rethink the myths that may be haunting you and interfering with your self-esteem, your sexuality, and your progress toward conception. I want to help you stabilize your life so that you can deal with other important, related aspects of your life�your marriage, your family, your friends, and your career. You are entitled to have the freedom to be yourself and to consider new options apart from what others expect or demand. You may even want to give your family and friends a copy of this book so they can become more sensitive to your needs. I will also inform you of the legal controversies surrounding the latest technologies for infertility treatment. You will learn why attorneys and lawmakers are concerned and even confused about parenting rights, fetal rights, and custody definitions when it comes to miracle baby making. With this information you will be able to sort through the moral and ethical decisions you may face regarding issues such as artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, egg donation, surrogacy and genetic counseling. I believe that by reading this book, you will find encouragement, understanding, comfort, practical solutions, and the courage to keep trying for your own miracle baby.

Although I investing a lot of energy and emotion into their problems, I was becoming more and more frustrated with the way they responded to my care. Many of my patients acted as if they didn't hear my instructions. For example, every time I told Lori I'd have her test results in three days, she'd call me the next morning for the results. When I tried to schedule an ultrasound examination for Debbie, she'd either cancel at the last minute or simply not show up. Bridgette wasn't able to maintain a basal temperature chart and Jennifer always forgot to bring her temperature chart to her appointment. I couldn't understand why these intelligent and highly motivated people acted so erratically. The reasons became clear once I discovered how my patients blossomed when they became a positive force in their infertility treatment. I'd like to share with you how I uncovered these secrets and how you can benefit from my formula for success. "I feel like a guinea piggy" Growing frustration forced me to rethink my approach with infertile couples. One day Cheryl said, "I feel like a guinea pig. This whole business is dehumanizing." She broke down and cried, and I wasn't sure what I could do for her. Moreover, I was completely surprised when her husband not only refused to cooperate but even blamed me for her inability to get pregnant! In retrospect, I realize that I not only underestimated the stress my patients were experiencing but I may have even contributed to their frustration. In my clumsy attempts to defuse their depression with humor, I remember saying such insensitive things as, "You can borrow my kid for the weekend," or, "At least you don't have trouble finding baby-sitters." I wasn't the only one who didn't know what to say to infertile couples. Their families, friends, and co-workers always seemed to be in error, too; even a concerned inquiry about their infertility treatment stirred anger and anxiety. I observed that as treatments extended into months and sometimes into years, my patients seemed to become less communicative and more paranoid. Some even went so far as to isolate themselves from others. In my quest for answers to these problems I instinctively turned to the literature for guidance. When I checked the local bookstores, I found that infertility books offered few concrete suggestions. Popular literature tended to be cold, technical reproductive biology texts or too generalized to be useful. My search continued until I saw a newspaper advertisement for an infertility seminar conducted by RESOLVE, Inc., and Serono Laboratories. RESOLVE is a nationwide, nonprofit support organization for infertile couples. What I learned from RESOLVE and subsequent studies changed my whole approach to infertility practice. I became aware that in the face of a diagnosis of infertility many people experience as much or more trauma than people who are told that they suffer from a life-threatening disease. Typical are Bret and Nancy L., who discovered they were infertile in their early thirties. Feeling trapped by circumstance, they became angry and depressed. They felt guilty about their use of birth control pills for ten years. The ten-year "delay" shortened the number of fertile years Nancy had for treatment, and her increased age reduced her chances for pregnancy even further. They had always had some problems communicating with each other, and their complex and demanding treatment regimen began to aggravate the strain. My requests for temperature charts, semen analyses, and scheduled intercourse only seemed to add to their frustrations. I realized that in order to establish a positive physician-patient relationship, I also had to address the emotional needs of patients like Bret and Nancy. Since I knew that much of their stress resulted from perceived loss of control, I developed a method that put them back in control of every stage of their infertility treatment. It was a method that improved their communications, provided feedback to my staffand me, and provided better treatment. Most of all, it was a method that improved their sense of self-worth. My Five-Point Strategy for Fertility Treatment Because victims make poor patients, I selected restoration of control as the starting point of my plan. To put my patients in charge of their infertility, I instituted the following procedures. I try to involve both partners in the initial discussions and planning. In these meetings we discuss their medical histories and family goals. We talk about diagnostic alternatives, medical resources, realistic timing, and emotional, time, and financial commitments. I answer their questions and give them the medical information that will help them think through their motives and alternatives. I want both of them to begin fertility treatment with realistic expectations and mutual understanding. I have found that this planning phase is so critical to successful fertility treatment that I've devoted several chapters of this book to showing how you can implement this process on your own. A jointly designed plan puts my patients back in control of their treatment, their bodies, and their immediate future. They no longer complain of being victims or guinea pigs. And they view me as a skilled partner or facilitator who is enhancing their effort to achieve pregnancy. I offer recommendations instead of rnandates. As their partner, I suggest diagnostic procedures and courses of treatment for consideration. I discuss alternatives, side effects, the odds for success, and other relevant issues. My patients choose their course of action. I tailor my testing and treatment to their emotional needs and budgets. Some patients want to proceed at breakneck speed, while others are more comfortable with a relaxed approach. I try to adjust my scheduling to their comfort level, and I always consult with them before altering our agreed-upon strategy. A number of patients find that they must adjust their treatment to accommodate their financial resources. An overextended budget only adds to their anxiety and usually isn't necessary for effective treatment. I also help them explore what expenses may be covered by insurance. I make certain that either my nurse practitioner or I am always accessible to answer questions and offer support. Together we can provide the time, information, and consulting skills that our patients need. I refer most of my patients to the local RESOLVE chapter for information, peer support, and, if desired, group counseling. I'm very impressed with the quality of information, printed material, and support offered by RESOLVE. The most important service it offers is understanding, companionship, and acceptance. Only in this kind of environment can infertile couples feel that they are not alone in the world and that their feelings are normal. And they can learn effective coping skills from others who are experiencing similar problems. You will learn many of these skills throughout this book. I know that this five-point approach will work for you because my patients have done so well. Once they see the difference the plan makes in their lives, they seldom experience the trauma I had so frequently observed when I dealt with infertile couples. I remember one patient saying, "I didn't know that I could deal with infertility treatment as just another one of life's hurdles. Our problems used to seem so monumental before Don and I put our goals and treatment plan on paper." The next few chapters will show you step by step how to lay the groundwork for such a successful plan. Successive chapters will help you: Become informed about the most up-to-date medical information so you will know how to choose the right physician and how to tell if you are getting the best treatment Develop an individualized treatment plan with your physician so you can take an active part in your diagnosis and medical care Get control of your life and feelings of anxiety so you can stop making impossible demands on yourself and others Become a positive force in your fertility treatment Identify your "happy ending" and pursue it So now let's begin to identify the ingredients for your happy ending.

You were happy, optimistic, and looking forward to the day when together you'd create a new life�when you would begin your family. For one reason or another you may have delayed starting one. You may have saved for a house, finished college, taken your dream vacation, or begun a career. You wanted the best possible start for your marriage before you settled down to enjoy having a family. Then the roof caved in. "I remember being surrounded by X rays. My mind wandered back to the day Mitch and I decided to wait to have a baby. I had wanted to start my public relations career. We had been able to buy our dream house where our babies could play in their own backyard. As the doctor pointed to the shadowy pictures, he explained how my blocked tubes were preventing my pregnancy. I don't remember much more after that�only my pain and disappointment." Jeanne is only one of my patients who, late in her reproductive life, discovered a fertility problem. Fortunately, soon after I repaired her damaged fallopian tubes with microsurgery, Jeanne and Mitch conceived and had a beautiful, normal baby boy. She's now pregnant with her second baby. In my practice I have found that many couples' problems aren't resolved as quickly as Jeanne's. Their diagnosis may be more elusive, their treatment more complex. For example, by the time Michael and Shelley T. came to me, they both were discouraged and worried. For two years they had been trying unsuccessfully to conceive. Their physician had already completed a fertility workup, performed painful tubal surgery, and prescribed powerful fertility drugs�all to no avail. When I first saw them, their quality of life had deteriorated to an unfortunate low. The advice that I gave Michael and Shelley worked for them and it will work for you, too. I'm going to show you how you can permanently improve your quality of life, even when faced with overwhelming odds. And I'm certain that as a couple you will grow closer and stronger from your efforts. Couples You Will Meet in This Book In this book you will become acquainted with four couples who took charge of their fertility problems and found their miracle babies: Michael and Shelley T. When her doctor recommended a hysterectomy, Shelley T. panicked. She was afraid that Michael would divorce her because she thought that having a baby was the most important thing a wife could do for him. By the time I saw them, all Michael could do was grumble about mounting medical bills; he thought all fertility specialists were "rip-off artists." Shelley was hurt, angry, and distrustful. She'd put her life and her career on hold, believing that "I'd get pregnant any day." The only reason she had requested a second opinion was the encouragement she received from the RESOLVE infertility support group when they heard that Michael had never had a semen analysis. By blindly accepting one test and treatment after another, this couple had forfeited their responsibility and control for their fertility. Michael's lack of interest and support not only added to Shelley's difficulties but, as it turned out, also prevented an accurate diagnosis�he had no sperm in his semen. She had undergone years of expensive treatment, but never had a chance for pregnancy. Their situation illustrates what can happen when you have unrealistic expectations and pursue no clear-cut treatment plan. In this book you will see how Shelley and Michael took control of their fertility treatment and their lives. And you will find out how they got their miracle baby, Tommy. Bryan and Debbie W. Debbie believed that until she had a baby she would not be a complete woman. When spontaneous bleeding disrupted her third month of pregnancy, Debbie became desperate: "I've already lost two babies. If I lose another, I don't know what I'll do." Unfortunately after her spontaneous abortion began, there wasn't much I could do to save their baby. But I could do a lot to keep her from losing their next baby. In later chapters you will learn how Debbie and Bryan coped with their loss and grief. And you'll learn how Debbie's exposure to DES, while she was still in her mother's womb, destined her for repeated abortions. When I secured Debbie's incompetent cervix during her next pregnancy, she was able to have a beautiful blue-eyed baby girl. Steven and Kathy S.Kathy's periods probably stopped because of the excess running she did to prepare for amateur competition. Running, however, was very important to Kathy's self-image. She wanted to maintain her life-style and have a baby, too. "Before we commit to a bunch of tests, we want to know what to expect," Kathy S. said on their first visit. "We want a baby, but we have our lives to live, too." Kathy and Steven wanted to understand the big picture: what tests I'd recommend, what the results would mean, how long it would take, what the odds were that she'd conceive, and what it would cost. After the initial workup, they were surprised to find that Steven had a poor semen analysis. I suspected that his varicocoele (varicose vein in the scrotum) might also be impairing their ability to have a child. As their story unfolds, you will find out how this couple's take-control attitude and their desire for having a fertility treatment plan led them on a direct path toward their goal. You will also find out how their persistence and hard work during ovulation induction treatment eventually paid off. Richard and Margaret B. Since graduating from college, Margaret had pursued a successful career. When she was thirty-one she and Richard decided that she should stop taking the Pill so they could begin their family. But nothing happened. Concerned about their progress, a year later Margaret came to me requesting a fertility evaluation. Although her physical examination revealed no obvious fertility problem, I was concerned about possible complications from the ruptured appendix she had suffered at twenty-three. The tubal X ray confirmed my suspicions: it revealed that both of Margaret's tubes were blocked. When I received the results of Richard's semen analysis, I became conconcerned that his consistent use of marijuana could be impairing his fertility potential. In this book you will find out how even though microsurgery restored Margaret's fallopian tubes, the surgery did not make her fertile. And you will learn how the miracle of in vitro fertilization gave them the son they wanted so much. Seeing how each of these couples managed their fertility problems will provide you with insight into the many options you have in coping with fertility and its treatment. The steps I recommend for planning a fertility treatment program make common sense and are easy to follow. As you learn more about your fertility and about your treatment, you will become less tense and anxious. You will be able to formulate a short-term plan and set long-term goals as well. Together with your physician, you will be able to take an active part in your individualized diagnosis and treatment. Dispelling the Eleven Worst Myths About Infertility Myth #1: Infertility Is the Woman's Problem For years physicians and infertile couples believed that fertility problems stemmed primarily from the woman. In fact, suspected barrenness was a man's grounds for divorce as well as a king's justification for beheading his wife. Today, however, we know that fertility problems are equally common in both men and women. Although the statistics vary some from study to study, the consensus is that it's the woman's problem about one-third of the time and the man's problem about one-third of the time. In 5 to 10 percent of the cases, the causes can't be clearly identified. The balance of the cases from deficiencies in both partners. This was most dramatically illustrated by Kathy, who had ovulatory problems, while her husband, Steven, had a varicocoele that interfered with his sperm production. We now know that performing surgery on a woman married to a man with dramatically low sperm count won't improve the odds for pregnancy. You can achieve pregnancy only when both partners are contributing the proper ingredients at the proper time. In the following chapters you will learn more about how this miracle occurs. Myth #2: Infertility Can Be Cured by Taking a Vacation Although stress and tension may interfere with your sexual desires and with your performance in the bedroom, there's no scientific evidence that your emotional state directly causes your fertility problem. While menstrual irregularities may be the result of stress and tension, these irregularities can be medically corrected, so that stress need not affect your fertility. Conversely, there's no reason why your fertility problem should affect your performance in the bedroom. I remember Steve and Kathy saying, Sex for pleasure? What's that?" Later in this book you will discover how they managed to restore pleasure to sex and how you can, too. Myth #3: If You're Fertile, You Should Get Pregnant in Two Months In a normal population of couples who are trying to conceive, each couple will have a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant the first month. Odds are funny: the remaining 80 percent who didn't conceive the first month have the same chances the next month�only 20 percent of that 80 percent will get pregnant. For example, if one hundred couples try to get pregnant in January, approximately twenty will conceive. That leaves eighty to try again in February. In February 20 percent, or sixteen, of them will be successful, leaving sixty-six who will have to try in March. In March, 20 percent of those will become pregnant (approximately fourteen), leaving fifty-two for April. So, in three months, roughly half of our hundred couples have conceived, but another half have not conceived. At this rate, after seven months twenty-two people still will not have conceived, and after two years 10 to 15 percent still will not have conceived. Unless they have reason to suspect there's a problem, I recommend to my patients under 35 years of age that they not be overly concerned about their fertility until they have been unsuccessful for a full year. For hose 35 years and older, I suggest beginning a fertility workup after attempting pregnancy for six months. In fact, it sometimes happens that a couple conceives during the fertility workup without my otherwise doing anything� I'm a benefactor of the odds, you might say. I enjoy this kind of surprise. The odds for conceiving are especially disconcerting to fertility patients whose problems have been corrected. For example, Steven and Kathy thought that their first artificial insemination treatment (using Steven's sperm) would do the trick. I had to caution them that it might take as many as four to six cycles for them to achieve a pregnancy. When I reflect on how complicated human reproduction is, I sometimes wonder how most women get pregnant. Nature did not design the human reproductive system so that a woman could get pregnant at the drop of a hat. Later in this book you will find out why our reproductive systems are so inefficient. You will also learn about the most up-to-date diagnostic procedures and corrective treatments available, including in vitro fertilization, frozen embryo transplants, and surrogate wombs. You have many options for improving your odds for conception. Myth #4: If You Adopt, You'll Get Pregnant Statistics show that 5 to 10 percent of adoptive couples conceive. I firmly believe, however, that these people would have conceived anyway, regardless of the adoption. As we already know, many couples with fertility problems eventually conceive without any medical intervention. Richard and Margaret almost opted for adoption until I convinced them that they were responding to an old wives' tale, because their secret hope was that adoption would "cause" a pregnancy. Some adoptive couples choose to continue with their fertility treatment. their adoptive child satisfies their parenting needs, but doesn't satisfy the couple desire to produce a genetic heir. These couples may also eventually achieve a pregnancy. Myth #5: Once You're Infertile, You're Always Infertile I have observed that when many couples receive the diagnosis of infertility they just give up. They don't think that the tests, drugs, surgery, and all of their effort will be worth it. About 5 to 10 percent of these people will conceive without medical intervention. However, 60 percent or more could benefit from fertility treatment. Making a miracle instead of waiting for a miracle is the answer if you really want a child. Myth #6: Fertility Is a Sign of Virility Many men feel that fertility problems threaten their manliness. In fact some husbands go so far as to refuse a simple semen analysis, as Michael T. had in the past. He was concerned about finding out that he "wasn't a man. Once he learned why the test was so important for diagnosing their fertility problem, he agreed to take it. Since in approximately two-thirds of my cases the man's fertility may be the cause, I insist that the male have a semen analysis. Fertility and sexual function are not necessarily related. In cases where severe hormone deficiencies, physical damage, physical deformity, medic; illness, or drug usage exist, sexual dysfunction may be the reason why pregnancy hasn't occurred. However, I find that this is relatively rare. Myth #7: You Caused Your Miscarriage We know that 10 to 15 percent of confirmed pregnancies will miscarry. When we examine the fetus, we find that 60 percent have one-time-ever genetic abnormalities. Sometimes a placenta develops, but no fetus is present (blighted ovum). This will produce a positive pregnancy test but obviously will not produce a baby. Miscarriage is nature's way of discarding a deformed embryo or fetus so a viable pregnancy can begin. The likelihood that a miscarriage will occur with the next pregnancy is once again 10 to 15 percent. I find that repeated pregnancy loss may indicate a pathological problem such as an incompetent cervix, fibroid tumors, hormonal problems, abnormalities of the immune system or adhesions (scar tissue) inside the uterus. Late chapters will tell you how I successfully treated Debbie W.'s problem with repeated pregnancy loss. Myth #8: Long-term Contraceptive Use Causes Infertility Many of you may be concerned that long-term use of oral contraceptive (birth control pills) or intrauterine devices (IUDs) may have impaired you fertility. I would like to address both of these issues. Since the risks of infection and intrauterine scarring may be increased with the use of an IUD, I no longer insert IUDs in women who have not yet had children or who have multiple partners. When IUD use results in infertility, as it did in Richard and Margaret B.'s case, we have a number of options for restoring fertility. You will learn how Richard and Margaret's treatment resulted in the birth of a healthy baby boy. With respect to using oral contraceptives, I advise my patients who have menstrual irregularity prior to using oral contraceptives that they may have an underlying fertility problem. This problem will probably grow no worse, but neither will it improve with the use of oral contraceptives. Studies have shown that after the cessation of birth control pills, up to 3 percent of women will experience ovulatory problems. These women usually respond very well to treatment. Problems conceiving that are often attributed to long-term use of the Pill are, in my opinion, more likely due to the fact that as women grow older, their odds for getting pregnant deteriorate naturally. Because Margaret and Richard waited until their mid-thirties to start their family, they had to face this problem. Some experts feel that the normal aging of the reproductive organs diminishes fertility. As you grow older the fertility potential of the eggs remaining in the ovaries decreases. Others feel that the longer you wait to conceive, the more you risk reducing fertility through infections, use of IUDs, or surgeries. In addition, with age you have an increased risk of developing endometriosis (a condition in which for unknown reasons pieces of uterine lining adhere to pelvic organs and "bleed" with each monthly cycle). In later chapters you will learn more about how each of these factors can affect your fertility. Table 2-1 shows what your odds are for pregnancy at various ages, assuming that you have no serious fertility problems. As you can see, regardless of the causes, fertility decreases with age. If you know that you may have a problem (for example, if your periods are irregular or you experience extreme pain during your periods), you shouldn't delay having a fertility evaluation. Myth #9: Therapeutic Abortions Frequently Cause Infertility Over 1 million abortions are performed in the United States each year. When abortions were illegal, performed by amateurs, and conducted in septic conditions, sterility and even death were common. However, with sterile conditions and professional medical supervision, the first-trimester abortion presents minimal risk for decreased fertility. Repeated abortions, however, may increase your likelihood for early pregnancy loss, premature birth, and failure to conceive.

This is not necessarily true. There is no evidence that having sex with multiple partners or having sex prior to marriage causes infertility. In fact, you may be surprised to know that as long ago as 1979, over two-thirds of never-married women had had sexual intercourse by the time were nineteen years old. However, having unprotected sex with multiple partners does increase your risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (AIDS, gonorrhea, chlamydia, ureaplasma, condyloma, etc.), which may cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). One million women will contract PID this year and a quarter of will require hospitalization due to the severity of the disease. If you contract PID once, you have up to a 20 percent chance of developing a fertility problem. This means that 150,000 to 200,000 women exposed to chlamydia or gonorrhea will become infertile this year. What makes these diseases so insidious is that you may not have any overt symptoms. So until you fail to get pregnant, you may not even know that your tubes have been severely scarred from infection. I recommend to my patients that they request a pelvic exam if they have any pain, midcycle bleeding, or other abnormal symptoms. Otherwise, as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends, I suggest that my patients have an annual pelvic exam which screens not only for cancer but also for gonorrhea. #11: A Rise in Your Basal Temperature Means You're Fertile Many of my patients report that they have been scheduling sexual intercourse to correspond to their rise in basal body temperature, as Margaret and Richard did. Having intercourse after Margaret's temperature rose, however, almost guaranteed that she would not get pregnant. In effect, they were practicing good rhythm birth control. They were having intercourse twenty hours too late! You are fertile for about twenty-four hours during each ovulatory cycle. A rise in your basal temperature signifies that your ovary is secreting progesterone�an event that occurs twenty-four hours after ovulation. For conception to take place, the sperm must be present immediately before or at the time of ovulation. Initially, I ask my patients to keep a temperature chart to help me verify that they actually are ovulating. Later, you will find out more about how you can predict when you are fertile and how we can detect what's really happening with your hormones, ovaries, and eggs. In addition, you'll learn how we can control these factors to optimize your chances for conception. An Infertility Management Plan Will Help Stabilize Your Life Your own physician is your best ally in the battle against infertility. To take full advantage of his or her skills, however, you must take an active part in your therapy: inform your physician of your symptoms, ask questions, make suggestions, and explore alternatives. Having done this, it becomes much easier to understand and better accept his or her recommendations. Help your physician understand what you're experiencing. "I should be happy, but I'm not." Your plan should address not only your fertility problems; it should also attend to your psychological needs�your depression, your anger, your frustration, your feelings of inadequacy. These feelings are absolutely normal. In fact, I'd think something was wrong with you if you didn't have them. I'll show you how other couples have overcome their disappointments and have learned to go on with their lives. Your plan should also help you deal with your well-meaning but often insensitive relatives, friends, and co-workers. How many times have you heard, "You should be happy. Look at how fortunate you are. You've go everything else anyone could want." Their attempts to comfort you only heighten your anger and widen the communication gap. I'll share with you how other couples have dealt with these people and how they've learned to live in a world full of babies and pregnant women. Think about your married life before you knew you were infertile. If you want to return to that happy, optimistic life, keep reading!

"I don't have anything in common with my friends who have children. Being different makes me uncomfortable." "A baby will make our marriage happier and more stable." "Fitting meetings, graduate school, and business trips into feedings, diapers, and baby-sitters would stifle me." "Pregnant women glow with their femininity." I have heard all of these statements and more from patients and friends� normal men and women with normal feelings and concerns. I find, however, that many of my fertility patients are afraid to explore or discuss their feelings, both positive and negative, about having children. They are so intent on resolving their fertility problems�on creating a pregnancy�that they lose sight that what they are really trying to do is make a baby. They seldom stop to ask themselves, "Why?" and, "How is this baby going to change our relationship and lives?" and, "Do I welcome those changes�or most of them�wholeheartedly?" A fertility treatment plan should lead to results that will satisfy your basic needs. Since the happy ending that's right for you may be different from the one that another may choose, it is vital at the outset that you both identify how having a baby will meet your needs. Will the baby carry on your family name and genes? Will having the baby make you feel like a complete person? Will the baby be your companion�someone to nurture and love? The answers to these and other questions will greatly influence your treatment options. If like Steven and Kathy you want a baby to carry on the family name and genes, donor artificial insemination will not be a happy ending for you. If like Debbie you want to carry a pregnancy to make your life experience complete, then adoption won't be a happy ending. But if you just want a baby to nurture and love, as Richard and Margaret did, you won't be as concerned with how you get your baby as with just getting one. Evaluating Your Desire to Have a Baby To help you identify your happy ending, I have developed an evaluation test for you and your spouse. I use it with my patients before we sit down to work out a fertility plan. Discussing your responses with one another will help you understand your motives, concerns, interests, attitudes, and feelings. You will both gain insight into why your fertility problems cause you pain and frustration. And you will be able to identify which happy ending will resolve your fertility problem. Even my patients who have been receiving fertility treatment for a year or more enjoy and benefit from taking this test. "When we discussed our answers to the test, it was the first time we'd talked about our problem when we weren't in the middle of a crisis," Shelley T. reported. "It was very refreshing." I recommend that my patients retake the evaluation every six months or so. This renews their dialogue and identifies significant changes in their attitudes. People like Michael and Shelley who at first completely rule out adoption, for example, will often find that it becomes more attractive after years of unsuccessful treatment. It's okay to change your mind. If you don't achieve your first goal, you may wish to reexamine your needs and select another. You probably didn't succeed at getting a date with your first love either, but that didn't stop you from trying again or finding an alternative. Besides, you may not have had all of the facts when you made your initial decisions. Once you have discussed your answers together, you will be better prepared to find medical and professional services that will meet your needs. Since you may wish to use the evaluation test several times throughout your fertility treatment, I suggest that you write your answers on a separate piece of paper. Number the sheet from I to 70 for your responses. By placing your completed answer sheet beside your spouse's, you can easily identify points of agreement and conflict. You may wish to save your answers and discuss them from time to time and compare them with future scores. When you respond to the statements, do not ponder too long on any one issue. I find that an initial response is often more accurate than one analyzed to death. You should be able to complete the test in just a few minutes. After that, I will tell you how to interpret your answers and what they mean to you, to your spouse, and to your fertility treatment. Examining each of these areas will help you understand how internal and external forces influence your reaction to infertility. By tuning in to these forces you can learn to accept your emotional responses, choose to accept or ignore the needs of others, discover your spouse's needs, and together control your future. An Evaluation:Why Is It so Important for You to Have a Baby? Instructions: Number a sheet of paper from 1 to 70. Beside each number rate how important each statement is to you. Zero (0) means that the statement is not very important or is least descriptive of you. Five (5) means that the statement is very important or very descriptive of you. Use the numbers between 0 and 5 to show gradations between these extremes. If the statement doesn't seem to apply to your situation, place an X beside it. There are no right or wrong answers. Have your spouse take the evaluation separately. Then compare the two answer sheets and discuss where you agree and differ. Children bring couples closer together. Couples without children eventually become less stable and dissatisfied. I want to see my spouse enjoying children. I want a baby because it's important to my spouse. I'm afraid our infertility may threaten our marriage. My spouse wants a child. Infertility makes me feel inadequate. Sometimes I fear pregnancy. Having a baby will demonstrate my virility/femininity. I want a baby so my genes will be immortal. I may someday regret not having done everything possible to have a baby. I want to create a new life in my image. Infertility makes me feel cheated. I want my child to achieve some of the things I haven't been able to. I want children so they can give me love and affection. Without children I feel lonely. Without children I'm bored. Without children life is meaningless. My infertility makes me feel powerless. Sometimes I feel that I'm too self-centered. I want a baby so I can quit my job. I want children because then there will never be a dull moment in my life. I sometimes wonder if we can afford a baby. Having a family is what life is all about. I want a baby because we live so far away from family and old friends. I want a child who can help with my business/housework/hobby. I feel that a woman's role should be mother and homemaker. I feel that a man's role should be father and breadwinner. I feel we are economically secure. I've looked forward to having children all my life. We frequently run out of money between paychecks. Both of us have full-time jobs we enjoy. Children will interfere with my career. Children will interfere with my freedom to travel, be spontaneous, and live in the style I'm accustomed to. I'm not sure I want the responsibility of a child for the next twenty years. There's never a "right" time for having a baby. I'm not sure what to do with my life if I don't have a baby. A child will not substantially affect our life-style. I want a baby so I can show my spouse/father/mother/siblings that I can be a good parent. I want a baby so my child will have a sibling. I feel I'm breaking tradition by not having children. People who can afford children should have children. Infertility keeps me from fulfilling my religious beliefs. I live in a community where everyone has children, a home, and a backyard. I live in a city crowded with high-rise apartments. I'll never really be perceived as an adult until I have children. The family will treat us better when we give them grandchildren. Having children will bring me respect and prestige. I don't want the family name to end with me. I can't face telling my family/friends about our infertility. Having and wanting children is natural. Not having and not wanting children is unnatural. Women have a maternal instinct that needs to be filled. Denying maternal instinct denies a woman's basic nature and function. Sacrificing for children is noble and unselfish. Deciding to remain childless is selfish and immature. Having children is a stage necessary for adult development. Good parents have a lot of children. People with a lot of money have more children. People who don't want children don't have anything to offer them. Infertility is God's/nature's way of limiting the population. My (our) parents want us to have children. I like to take care of children�feed, diaper, bathe, clothe, etc. I like to play with children. I want children so I can give them love and affection. I want a baby because I think I will make a good parent. I sometimes wonder if I will make a good parent. Children are stimulating, novel, and fun. I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with children. I like to direct and control children. Statements 1-6      Couple needs or considerations 7-20     Internal needs (ego needs) 21-38    Life-style needs 39-62    External pressures (needs of others) 63-70	 Parenting/nurturing needs Couple needs or considerations (Statements 1-6) I find that most couples with fertility problems care for each other very much�perhaps too much. For example, Bryan W. said in a private interview, "I really don't care that much about having a baby. But I want one for Debbie's sake." When I interviewed Debbie, she said, "I'm afraid Bryan will divorce me and find a woman who can bear his children." In this case each misinterpreted the other's desires and was more concerned about the other's needs than his or her own. Their lack of communication and understanding added to their stress and hampered their choice of a mutually satisfying treatment program. When Bryan and Debbie began to share their feelings, they became happier and even more committed to finding a happy ending that was right for them. Comparing your test responses to your spouse's will help you see what is important to each of you instead of trying to outguess one another, as this couple had been doing. The first six statements are designed to help you discover if you want a baby because you think your spouse wants one and/or because you think the success of your marriage depends upon having a baby. Believing that your marriage cannot survive without children is not unusual for an infertile couple. Shelley was so scared that she told me, "I will do anything to get pregnant�no questions asked." Shelley answered "5" to all six of these questions She was absolutely shocked, however, when Michael's answers indicated he wanted a baby for her, but that he did not feel their childlessness threatened their marriage. Shelley told me later, "This information helped us face and resolve some very basic communication problems." Marriages actually do survive without children. In fact, population statistics indicate that marriages sometimes become less stable when children are introduced The highest incidence of divorce occurs soon after the birth of the first child. I don't state this to frighten you, but to offer you some perspective. Children may add stress to a relationship because of their demands and impact on the couplets life-style. Moreover, the birth of a child will not stabilize an already rocky relationship. As with Michael and Shelley, the foundation of your marriage may be stronger than you think. Knowing this will help you cope with your treatment and with your fertility in less emotional and distressing terms. If you both can focus your energy on developing and implementing a fertility treatment plan instead of preserving a marriage that is not in jeopardy, your energy will be better directed. Internal Needs (Ego Needs) (Statements 7-20) Some women truly feel incomplete because of their fertility problem. Nor is it uncommon for infertile men to feel less virile. These reactions seem to be more common among men and women from a traditional background where male and female roles are strictly defined: where the man sees himself as husband, father, and provider and the woman sees herself as wife, mother, and nurturer. Infertility obviously prevents these couples from fulfilling the primary roles they have defined for their lives. Statements 7 through 20 will help you identify why you want or need a baby. Your answers will tell you, for example, if you want a baby so you can perpetuate your genes, so you can prove that you are virile or feminine, so you can bring meaning to your life, and/or so you can regain power over your body and destiny once more. Your motives are very important in choosing the "right" happy ending. As you evaluate your answers to this section, you may wish to examine some of your other answers to determine (I) whether your life-style needs fit the traditional role, (2) whether you may be responding to external pressures (the needs of others) more than to your own, and (3) whether you have strong parenting and nurturing needs. I find that people who see life without children as purposeless usually believe that they are responding to internal needs and personal goals. In actual fact, they may be placing a higher value on their family's and society's expectations than they are on their own needs. This was the situation in Debbie's case. Debbie told me that her mother had frequently said to her, "Something's wrong with you if you don't want your own children." (See "External Pressures" below.) If you understand the source of your motives, you will better understand the source of your discomfort and stress. If you truly feel powerless and that life is meaningless, you may need professional counseling to help you avoid episodes of anxiety and depression. Shelley told me, "I'm certain that Michael and I are still married today because of the help we received through our RESOLVE support group." Many of the answers in this section will help you decide which happy ending is best for you. Armed with this knowledge, you can design a plan with your physician that will best meet your needs. Life-style Needs (Statements 21-38) Our society tends to praise and value the traditional family and frown on a childfree life-style. In reality, however, life-style needs are as valid a concern as any basic biological need For some the arrival of a baby makes life complete. For others the rewards of parenting will never be as satisfying as the lives they led before having a baby: lives of spontaneity, of freedom, of personal control. However, few couples with fertility problems pause to ask themselves if they really want a baby or a pregnancy. A baby changes your life as much as or more than marriage itself. Baby will interrupt your sleep, your schedule, your private time, and your lovemaking. For most infertile couples the prospect of altering their lives to include a baby is a joyful goal. Planning will help smooth out the uncertainties during fertility treatment and after the new arrival. Statements 21 through 38 will help you decide if you are ready to bring a baby into your life�to settle down into a different life-style�and if you are financially able to support a new family member. By comparing your answers, you'll discover whether both of you share the same life-style needs. Bryan and Debbie got into quite a tangle when he said he wanted to continue their sailing, skiing, and traveling while she wanted to save so she could quit work and stay home with the baby: "We'd always had trouble managing our money. And if I quit, we would have to have a nest egg. After we talked about it, we decided to set aside a percentage of our income. Actually, Bryan gave up buying the sailboat he wanted and we joined a sailing club so we can rent a boat anytime we want." Kathy's answers indicated that she wasn't ready to give up her amateur running status. "When Steven and I talked about how important my physical, competitive, and social needs were to me, he stopped bugging me about quitting. Once I was relieved of my guilt, I could proceed with an aggressive treatment program�one that eventually resulted in my pregnancy." Compare your answers with your spouse's. Explore how your fertility treatment will affect your life-style. How will it affect your career? Your finances? Your travel? Are you willing to adjust these aspects of your life for a prolonged period of treatment? And if your fertility treatment is successful, how will the baby fit into your life? External Pressures (The Needs of Others) (Statements 39-62) I find that infertile couples (as well as those who decide to remain childless) often feel that full adulthood cannot be achieved without bearing children, and that remaining childless is a sign of immaturity, selfishness, failure, and instability. Steven's answers revealed some startling facts. Coming from a large traditional family, Steven felt that he would not truly be a man until he fathered children. Steven's dad was a very devoted family man and Steven had many fond memories of their weekends working and playing together. Steven couldn't imagine life without sons and daughters to help fill his non-working hours. Kathy was shocked with Steven's answers: "All along I thought that Steven's 'poor' sexual performance was because he didn't really want children. When I discovered that it had to do with his self-image and not his desire for children, it shed a whole new light on our problem. One we could deal with." Your family may exert a number of pressures on you to have a baby. Your parents may want to become grandparents. Or they may want you to continue the family lineage and name. If you seem to be overly concerned about what your family thinks and/or how to relate to them, you will be especially interested in reading chapter 20, Awaiting Your Miracle Baby. And you may wish to show your family "A Letter to Family and Friends". Not having a baby makes you different�much as being single, being unemployed, or being handicapped makes you different. "Different" people must cut their own paths, define their own roles, and even defend their individuality to family, friends, and co-workers. It' s little wonder that couples having fertility problems often seem driven to conquer their infertility�their "difference." Richard and Margaret found it more and more difficult to relate to their close friends, all of whom had children. "I don't have anything in common with them," Margaret told me. "I want to talk about my most recent business trip and my girlfriend wants to talk about Andrew's preschool." Their answers to the test showed a strong need to belong�to fit into the community. Compare how you and your spouse answer these statements. See how influenced you are by what others think. If you find you are more concerned with fulfilling the needs of your parents and society than with identifying your own needs, you may want to get your priorities in order. When my patients begin to discuss how these social pressures control their emotions and actions, their decisions often turn completely around. Michael and Shelley, for example, discussed why going home for Christmas was the last thing Shelley wanted to do. "Holding my sister's new baby would be too much for me," Shelley said. "After talking it over, we gave ourselves permission to vacation in Hawaii instead." Once my patients realize why outsiders have such an influence on their lives, they can handle comments from relatives, friends, and co-workers with a more positive view. And they remain true to their own convictions instead of bowing to external pressures. Parenting and Nurturing Needs (Statements 63-70) This section of the test will help you explore how you feel about children. Do you want to care for them, play with them, discipline them, and teach them�for the next twenty years? For some this sounds like an awesome task; for others it sounds like a dream come true. Not everyone enjoys diaper changing and 2:00 A.M. feedings. So if you are still ambivalent about having a baby or have doubts about your ability to care for a tiny tot, count yourself as part of the human race. If like Margaret and Richard your answers show that you like to play with children, that you like to feed, diaper, and bathe children, and that you believe you'll make a good parent, I wouldn't worry too much about your motives for having children. These statements should confirm what you already know�that you want to love and care for a child and, perhaps most of all, you want to have fun with a family of your own. Finding Your Happy Ending A fertility treatment plan should lead to a resolution that is right for you. By comparing and discussing your answers to the evaluation, you should both be well on your way toward deciding which happy endings will satisfy your emotional needs. Instead of seeing yourselves as threatened, powerless victims, you will operate as a well-coordinated team committed to common goals and a mutual plan. It's time now to learn what your diagnostic alternatives and medical resources are for pursuing your happy ending. In the next chapter I will give you a step-by-step procedure for designing your individual fertility treatment plan.

The RESOLVE group members looked at each other in disbelief. "Well, we thought it was my problem," Shelley T. said. "I've always had pain with my periods. It made sense." "The same thing happened to us," Steven S. commented from across the room. "We thought our doctor was a specialist. That's the way he's listed in the phone directory. But when he wanted to put Kathy through a six thousand-dollar workup and never even asked about me, we knew something was wrong." "What did you do?" Shelley asked. "We paid our two hundred-dollar consultation charge and found a different doctor." Steven glanced at his wife. "One who would work with us as a couple Infertility affects the couple, not just one individual." "But how do you know if your doctor is doing the right thing?" Shelley asked. The group leader spoke. "Learn as much about fertility problems and treatment as you can so you'll be able to ask the right questions and spot potential trouble. "Coming to RESOLVE is the first step," he added. "You learn a lot from our programs and from talking with our members. And if you read our newsletter, you'll see that we have resource people who can talk with you about different fertility subjects_like endometriosis, artificial insemination, and in vitro fertilization. We also have an extensive lending library of books and articles on just about any fertility topic you'll want to know about." "You mean I'm going to have to be responsible for my fertility treatment?" "You and your husband and your doctor," the RESOLVE leader said. "If you work as a team, you'll be able to design a fertility treatment plan that will work for you as a couple." The leader turned toward me. "Dr. Perloe, how can couples avoid hit-or miss fertility treatment?" "I agree with all that's been said. It's unfortunate that you cannot expect the same quality of treatment from every doctor or clinic. But I guess that's true of any kind of service." I glanced at Steven and Kathy. "I guess Steven and Kathy are one of the best prepared couples I've ever worked with. Prior to coming to me, they'd read everything they could get their hands on. Before they hired me as their doctor, they wanted to know what to expect." Shelley interrupted. "Like what?" "They wanted to know things like what tests I'd recommend, what the results would mean, how long the workup would take, and how much it would cost." "Didn't you feel like they didn't trust you?" "Not at all," I answered. "The more you know about your treatment, the better you can work with your doctor. In fact, I usually give every couple an overview of fertility treatment before we even start." "That's right, Shelley," the leader added. "If your doctor doesn't want to answer your questions or doesn't tell you what to expect, you're probably seeing the wrong doctor. Why don't you see me after the meeting and I'll give you some of our newsletters to read or where you an find information on the Internet." "That sounds great," Shelley said. "And I want to see your library, too." Beginning Your Fertility treatment Plan Even if you already have been through months or years of fertility treatment, it is not too late to begin a plan. Shelley and Michael T. were able to regain control once they knew what to expect and began to participate in the decisions about their treatment, and so can you. In this chapter I'd like to acquaint you briefly with the conditions necessary for conception. And as I do with my patients, I'd like to give you an overview of fertility treatment. With this understanding you will be able to help your physician provide the best opportunity to reach your fertility potential. I realize that many of the things I'll touch on will stir up more questions in your mind. However, hold your questions while I give you the big picture. In later chapters I'll discuss all of this information and more in greater detail. The Nine Key Ingredients of Fertility The goal of fertility treatment is to help you have a child. If you understand the factors necessary for making a baby, you will also understand what factors your physician will evaluate during your fertility workup. The nine key ingredients of fertility are: The woman's health must allow her to safely carry a pregnancy. The male must be able to produce and ejaculate functional sperm. A healthy egg must mature and escape from a woman's ovary at regular or predictable intervals. The egg must be able to travel through the fallopian tubes toward the uterus. A couple must have intercourse at the right time. The sperm must be able to travel through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes to join with the egg. The sperm must be able to penetrate the egg. The fertilized egg must be able to travel through the fallopian tube to the uterus for implantation. A woman's hormone system and uterus must be able to maintain the pregnancy. To pinpoint where things are breaking down, your physician must check out each of these fertility factors. Later in this book you will learn about the methods your doctor can use to investigate fertility problems and what treatment is available. When you understand your options, you will know how to get your miracle baby. Your Fertility Workup: An Overview Your Past Provides Important Clues First your doctor will ask you both to complete a general health and fertility history questionnaire. Your fertility problems may be rooted in your past-exposure to toxic chemicals, medications, illnesses, and infections, for example. I remember one couple whose problem crystallized when I learned that he'd been exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam. When I added this incident to his complaints of lethargy and low sexual desire, I began to suspect he could have a fertility problem. Your doctor should interview you not only together but also individually so you will feel free to reveal your closest-held secrets_having had an abortion, a sexually transmitted disease, or an illegitimate child, for example. If either of you withholds information, your doctor may perform unnecessary tests and it may take longer and cost more to identify your missing fertility factors. Honesty and completeness pay off. I remember one woman who told me in confidence about an abortion she had before she was married. Since I knew she had been fertile at that time, I began looking for events that occurred since then. When I learned she'd had a ruptured appendix at age twenty-one, I suspected the infection and surgery could have adversely affected her reproductive organs. So I began to formulate a series of tests that would give me definite answers. Sometimes your fertility history reveals obvious problems. If like Kathy S. you have only one or two periods a year, I quickly suspect ovulatory problems. If like Shelley T. you complain of extreme pain during menstruation, I'll look for endometriosis. Or if like Margaret B. you've had one or more episodes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), I'll check you for tubal blockage. You will learn more about how I diagnosed and treated each of these women and their husbands later. Some less obvious factors that can contribute to your fertility problem are: Previous abdominal surgeries, which may impair fertility in both men and women Diabetes or a case of childhood mumps, which can lead to a poor sperm count Drugs and high blood pressure medications, which can impair a man's sexual performance or the ability of the sperm to fertilize the egg As you are filling out your history form, you may not realize the significance of these events or conditions, but if you do your job well, your doctor will have the information he or she needs for piecing together the puzzle. Highlights of the Male's Workup To father a child you must be able to produce and ejaculate good quality semen. "Good" semen contains large numbers of normally formed sperm which can swim actively in a straight line. In addition, semen should be free of infection. To deliver your semen to your wife, you must also be able to ejaculate. This requires that you have open passages from your testicles to your penis and an intact nervous system for controlling your ejaculatory processes. Chapter 8 discusses all the hormonal and physiological systems necessary to support male fertility. If the semen analysis is normal, I can be almost certain that the fertility problem lies with the woman's reproductive system. So I will switch my attention to diagnosing her problem. If the semen analysis reveals a problem with the husband's fertility, he should have a physical examination to assess his general health and the condition of his reproductive organs. Shelley T.'s husband, Michael, had almost no sperm in his semen. I needed to find out if this was because he was not making sperm or because his sperm could not get out through his ducts. Based on my examination findings, I may order additional tests to detect if the man has tubal blockage, impaired ejaculation, impaired sperm production, or a hormonal problem, or refer him to a urologist for further evaluation and recommendations. Finding a fertility problem with the husband doesn't relieve my responsibility to make certain that the wife's reproductive system is working well. I find that in 20 to 30 percent of my cases, both partners contribute to their fertility problems. In Steven and Kathy so's case, for example, Steven had a poor sperm count and Kathy wasn't ovulating. Until I was fairly certain that Kathy's problem could be overcome, it would have been irresponsible for me to condone Steven's varicocoele surgery. Chapters 6 through 8 describe in detail the tests that are conducted for male fertility problems, what the test findings reveal, and what courses of treatment are available for male fertility problems. Highlights of the Woman's Workup Even if a woman's periods are regular, I cannot assume that her menstrual cycle is working normally. So once I've reviewed the wife's history and current complaints, I do a physical examination to evaluate her general health and the condition of her reproductive organs. I also order laboratory tests that will tell me if she's ovulating and if her hormone levels are adequate. I frequently include an endometrial biopsy in the initial workup because examining the uterine lining will tell me whether she's ovulating and whether her uterus can support a pregnancy. In addition, I may order an X ray to obtain valuable information on the structure of her fallopian tubes and uterus. Many of these tests must be performed at specific points in the monthly cycle. Therefore, I ask her to do some "homework" to help me time the tests. I ask her to keep a basal body temperature (BBT) chart. This cycle will not only help me synchronize the tests to her menstrual cycle but also tell me what time of the month she is most fertile. If your temperature chart line remains level throughout the month, for example, I may suspect that you are not ovulating (anovulation). If you are timing sex after your temperature rises, I'll know that you are practicing rhythm birth control, which is certainly no way to get a miracle baby! (You are most fertile twenty-four to forty-eight hours before your temperature rises.) I also perform a postcoital test to tell me if the "chemistry" between the partners is right. If the wife's cervical mucus is impairing or destroying the husband's sperm, there are a number of things I can do to improve their situation. You will learn more about the woman's workup in and 10. You may even discover what's causing your fertility problem and learn how to overcome it. Your initial workup usually takes six to eight weeks and may cost up to $2,500. (This cost may vary in different parts of the country.) Once your doctor has the results from your examinations and preliminary tests, you can begin to discuss your options: Beginning a treatment program to improve your fertility Undergoing surgery to correct anatomical problems Seeking other alternatives such as artificial insemination with donor sperm (AID), in vitro fertilization, adoption, or enlisting a surrogate mother Performing more tests to pinpoint your fertility problem Your doctor should outline a tentative treatment schedule as well as estimate the cost. Together you should develop a plan that will optimize your fertility while still taking into consideration your life-style needs and financial resources. Formulating Your Treatment Plan How Long Will It Take? I try to give couples a treatment time frame so they know how long it may take to achieve a pregnancy. With this information they can assume more control over their time and money. For example, I told Steven and Kathy S. that if he elected to have his varicocoele repaired, it would be at least three months after the surgery before we would know if Steven's sperm count would improve. During that time Kathy could begin taking medication to induce her to ovulate. Within three months Steven's sperm count should improve and Kathy's cycle should be regulated. Sometimes couples wonder why the workup often takes several months. Unfortunately, within one menstrual cycle we can try only a few things at a time. Since Kathy S. was not ovulating, my first priority was to induce ovulation. Once her body responded to that medication, I could then check other factors. As it turned out, I discovered a secondary problem which could prevent their fertilized egg from implanting in her uterus. So the next month I added a hormone to correct that problem. It is for these reasons that your doctor cannot always tell you exactly how long treatment will take or how effective it will be. you do have a right to know, however, what results to expect if the procedure is a "success" or a "failure." And this knowledge will give you the tools you need to participate in the decision about what to try next. Many people become discouraged with fertility treatment because they believe that in the first month they "become fertile" they will make a baby. We may work for four to six months regulating ovulation and improving semen quality to fertile levels. The seventh month passes_no pregnancy. The eighth month_no pregnancy. The ninth month_no pregnancy: "I don't understand, Dr. Perloe," Margaret B. said. "We've tried everything and I'm not pregnant yet." "Do you have friends or relatives with children?" I asked. "Yes, my brother and sister."V "Do you know how long they tried to get pregnant?" "Well, my brother and his wife did it in two months. But my sister took five." "Do either of them have a fertility problem?" "No. But why are you asking me about them?" she said. "Well, what makes you think that you'll get pregnant within two or three months of solving your fertility problem when it took your sister_who had no fertility problems_five?" She paused for a moment. "Well, I've always done everything better than my sister, and I should be able to get pregnant faster, too." She burst into a laugh. I laughed with her. "You see my point, Margaret? Fertile people have a 20 percent chance for pregnancy each month. And people who have been through fertility treatment have at the most a 20 percent chance, too. you could easily take six months to a year to get pregnant, even if everything is in perfect working condition. "Fertility treatment is a tremendous strain," I added. "Getting pregnant_or not getting pregnant_is on your mind every day. Just don't get upset about it_not yet, anyway. Remember our plan? We will try three or four cycles and then, if you aren't yet pregnant, we'll consider other options. Next time talk to me before you become upset. Okay?" How long will treatment take? Talk to your doctor, make a plan, and monitor your progress. And don't forget that "normally fertile" people may take up to a year to get pregnant. What Price Pregnancy? I find that many couples are reluctant to discuss money with me because they feel guilty about placing a "price" on pregnancy or having a baby. They tend to overlook insurance and money issues when developing their fertility treatment plan. However, fertility treatment can be quite expensive_both in actual cost and in the time you may lose from work. In fact, some treatment regimens may be so demanding that your job is placed in jeopardy. For example, certain medications must be given by injection in the doctor's office several days a week; postcoital tests require you to come in two to four hours after having sex; and diagnostic surgeries may require that you miss several days of work It's only fair that you be aware of these requirements before committing yourself to a treatment program. Knowing what you're getting into may not change your choice, but it will give you the opportunity to plan your life and prepare your employer. Before Michael and Shelley T. came to see me, they had had many squabbles about money. Since Michael did not understand why the tests and medications were necessary, he had no way of evaluating whether costs were getting out of hand. To make things worse, they'd bought a house, anticipating that Shelley's coming promotion would bring in more money. When Shelley's boss discovered that she'd filed insurance claims for fertility treatments however, he promoted someone else instead. The boss claimed that he passed her up because she was taking three to four afternoons off per month for tests. But Shelley heard through the grapevine that he didn't want to promote her because he thought she'd probably quit after she had the baby. He also mumbled something about her medical claims increasing the company policy premiums. Although not all employers will react this way, you may have to be careful how you present your planned absenteeism and your future employment plans to your boss. I'll tell you later how other couples have handled these dilemmas. Because this couple had not agreed upon a financially manageable treatment plan, Michael felt that he was not in control of the situation. I can understand why, when faced suddenly with a $6,000 surgical expense, they refused the doctor's recommendation for diagnostic surgery. However, if from the beginning Shelley's doctor had included Michael in the plans for her treatment, the story might have been different. Steven and Kathy S., for example, controlled their psychological and financial resources right from the start. As a runner, Kathy's athletic achievements were very important to her. After her initial workup, I pointed out to her that her physical exertion could very well be the reason that her menstrual periods had for the most part stopped. She decided, however, that she wanted to try to keep running and achieve pregnancy, too. So together we worked out a treatment plan based on that agreement. Since Kathy didn't work, they had a limited budget. Steven checked out what his group insurance covered before beginning treatment. The policy would pay for most expenses; however, it didn't cover everything. (Trying to keep up with what one insurance company covers and what another company doesn't is nearly impossible. The logic insurance companies use for determining eligibility is sometimes a mystery.) In the course of making their fertility treatment plan Steven and Kathy decided to begin saving for the possibility of microsurgery or in vitro fertilization, which could cost up to $8,000 or $10,000 per procedure. Even though their insurance would pay 80 percent of up to two in vitro procedures, they knew that their bill could add up to quite a bit more (many people require three or four in vitro cycles before conceiving). Since banks don't make loans for babies, they wanted to be prepared to make the right choices without facing extreme financial pressures. It was a good thing they started their savings account, because Steven's varicocoele surgery cost $5,400. We had to make a change in the fertility plan to include using his sperm for four cycles of artificial inseminations at $350 per cycle. (Remember that this expense was in addition to Kathy's ovulation induction of about $250 per month.) And if Kathy's oral medication hadn't worked, she might have had to take Pergonal injections and have blood tests costing nearly $400 per month. With the Pergonal, she would also need three to five $150 ultrasound readings to monitor her egg development, a total cost of about $2,500 per month. (Without ultrasound to determine the effects of the Pergonal she might risk having multiple births, and quadruplets were not in their plans.) I'll tell you how Kathy and Steven got their baby girl in a later chapter. The point I'm making is that fertility treatment can be very expensive, and expenses may increase as you modify your fertility plan to accommodate your medical needs. Your ability to control your expenses is a vital part of your fertility plan. I suggest that you work with your doctor to estimate a best-case and worst-case scenario. That way you minimize the risk of any big surprises. Insurance is No Guarantee You should talk with your doctor about the costs and with your insurance carrier about what is and is not covered. Sometimes insurance companies have riders and waiting periods before you qualify for coverage. Some policies even exclude pregnancy and fertility payments altogether. Coverage may also differ from state to state. If your company transfers you from New York Blue Cross/Blue Shield to Georgia Blue Cross/Blue Shield, for example, you may not have the same protection. If you change jobs, or change your insurance carrier from your coverage to your husbands, infertlity treatment may no longer be covered. A pre-existing condition using allows them to avoid paying for any condition you were treated for during the previous year. While some plans cover diagnosis and treatment, others may only cover diagnosis or they may provide no infertility benefits.In addition, some fertility treatment procedures may be considered experimental and therefore will not be paid for by the insurance carrier. In vitro fertilization fit in this category for many years. Even now few companies pay for in vitro. Those that pay, often place a limit on how many cycles they will cover. You could find that an HMO (health maintenance organization offering prepaid medical care) will provide more complete basic coverage than standard insurance policies. Only when you have these facts and figures can you develop a treatment plan within your means. The only way you'll know is by asking. Start by asking the insurance coordinator at your doctors office for advice. You can also gain information by talking to the benefits cooridnator at work. Be careful when you call your insurance provider as they may mark your insurance claims for special review making any women's healthcare coverage difficult. Later chapters will tell you more about the demands of specific tests and treatment regimens as well as how couples manage their jobs, their schedules, their money, and their personal lives. A Seven-Day-a-Week Commitment Fertility treatment is a seven-day-a-week proposition. If you ovulate on the weekend, you may find yourself in the doctor's office having ultrasound or artificial insemination. You can't spend hundreds of dollars a month to induce ovulation and blow it because it's the Sabbath. Discuss your feelings about the time involved. You will see how other couples handled these problems in chapter 20. In addition, I will discuss such specifics as how you can schedule a vacation while in treatment_and how you can start having fun in bed again. As a couple you need to decide how you will handle emotional issues, schedule changes, and inconveniences. One partner cannot bear all the burden. Examining Your Moral and Ethical Beliefs You also need to discuss what types of treatment plans will fit into your moral and ethical beliefs. The evaluation test in chapter 3 may have helped you analyze these issues. But once you begin formulating your treatment plan, you will have to come to grips with some heavy decisions. How do you feel about your spouse risking major surgery? Are you willing to consider artificial insemination with your husband's sperm (AIH) or with a donor's sperm (AID)? What about using a donor egg (embryo) from another woman? I'll discuss the legal and ethical implications of these and other options in chapter 21. And I'll also tell you about the decisions other couples have made. When Will You Stop Treatment? You should make a tentative decision about how long you will stick with one treatment approach. Although your decisions may change as you obtain more information from tests and treatments, you still should have short-term goals and concrete mileposts to measure your progress. For example, Steven and Kathy agreed to try AIH for six cycles before considering in vitro fertilization. Richard and Margaret limited themselves to three in vitro cycles. How long will you go through fertility treatment before considering adoption? Or when might you feel okay about deciding you want to remain childless? Your decisions may be criticized by relatives and friends who don't share your sentiments. Michael and Shelley T. decided not to try AID or in vitro because of their parents' religious beliefs. I'm not sure they were totally comfortable with this turn of events, but they chose to keep peace in the family rather than be alienated. Your Plan Isn't Carved in Stone I find that as my patients learn more about their fertility problem, as the significance of not having children sinks in, as the treatments tax their emotional and physical health, or as their bank account dwindles, they often change their minds about what treatment they want. In addition, new options arise every year from advances made in medical research: donor eggs, micmanipulation, laser surgery, embryo freezing and so forth. Many couples begin to consider options that seemed less attractive or simply were not available earlier in their treatment. For example, although Robert and Martha W. at first wouldn't even consider AID, they eventually decided that using donor sperm for artificial insemination would be better than going through in vitro fertilization procedures. They now have a beautiful, curly-haired baby girl whom they adore. Some couples decide that adoption is their best alternative. When Jamie L. dropped by my office to show me her newly adopted son, I remember her saying, "I wish now I hadn't thought of adoption as the last resort. I wouldn't trade my baby for anything." Your plan is only a guide, a road map. At any point in the journey toward your happy ending, you can choose a different route. The chapters to come will help you become an informed consumer, so you will be able to assess all your options and take advantage of the best.

"Dr. Perloe, how can couples find out which doctor to go to?" "There are a number of alternatives. Resolve's list of physicians is an excellent beginning." I paused. "However, one thing that concerns me greatly is the thinking that says that only a fertility specialist can treat fertility problems. That simply is not true." "But I wasted over a year going to my gynecologist before I realized he was just bouncing from one thing to another," Shelley said. "I know that can happen. But even a fertility specialist may use hit-or-miss procedures. You see, there is nothing to prevent any doctor from hanging up a shingle that says 'fertility specialist.' " "I didn't know that," Debbie said. "First consult with your family physician or obstetrician-gynecologist. She or he knows your medical history better than anyone. If your problem requires specialized knowledge, ask your doctor to refer you to a specialist. "Read everything you can about fertility problems and fertility treatment. Talk to RESOLVE members and other infertile couples about their experiences and compare what's happening to you with what you learn. Talk to your doctor. Discuss your treatment plan and ask lots of questions. If it seems to you that your doctor does not have a plan, is not using 'accepted' procedures, or resents answering your questions, you may want to seek a second opinion." "What if you don't have a doctor?" a woman across the room asked. "Get a list of names in your area from the American Society of Reproductive Medicine or your local county medical society. Call or write fertility clinics for additional information. Talk to family and friends, too. Perhaps they know someone who's seeing a doctor for fertility treatment. With one in six couples in the United States seeking treatment for fertility problems, help can't be too far away. The best insurance you can have is being prepared_by reading attending workshops, and joining support groups." In this chapter I will tell you how to find a physician, what types of physicians or clinics to look for, and how to spot the "poor treatment" danger signs. How to Find a Doctor Consult Your Current Physician First I encourage you to consult your family practice physician or obstetrician-gynecologist first. Since you've already developed a rapport, it will be easier for you to share personal and intimate facts about your sexual history and habits. Both of these physicians are trained to analyze the results from a semen analysis, blood tests, and X rays. And they know how to administer fertility treatment to both men and women. The following is a more detailed breakdown of different medical specialties. Doctors Who Treat Fertility Problems General Practitioner, Family Physician, Internal Medicine Specialist Family physicians can assess your general health and investigate the potential effects of your medical history, environment, and medications on your fertility. These physicians can determine if a woman is ovulating and if a man's semen is functional. Many common fertility problems may be resolved at this initial level--for example, using a basal body temperature chart to time coitus, changing blood pressure medication, and counseling on the discontinuance of sperm-killing douches and lubricants. If your fertility problem is such that it demands it, your physician should refer you to a specialist. Since your records and test results will be provided to the specialist, you won't have wasted your money by seeing your family doctor first. Obstetrician Gynecologist This physician specializes in the study and treatment of women's diseases especially of the genitourinary and rectal tracts. In addition, he or she is concerned with the care and treatment of women during pregnancy and childbirth. Most OB-GYNs, as they are commonly called, also perform surgery. However, depending on their skills, they may or may not be able to perform microsurgery on your fallopian tubes, which is required in about 10 percent of fertility patients. Most OB-GYNs can perform a diagnostic laparoscopy, but if they can't do microsurgery, the laparoscopy may have to be repeated by the microsurgeon so he or she can plan your corrective surgery. OB-GYNs have access to all of the fertility diagnostic tests available including the semen analysis. The OB-GYN should be able to treat anovulation with clomiphene and to perform artificial insemination. Reproductive Endocrinology and Fertility Specialist This is an American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology subspecialty for OB-GYNs who receive extra fellowship training in the endocrinology of women (the study of hormones) and infertility. Generally these physicians are affiliated with fertility research programs at universities, infertility clinics, or in vitro fertilization centers. They have the most up-to-date information on fertility and are skilled in microsurgery techniques. By providing a full range of infertility treatments, the reproductive endocrinologist can work with you to develop a cost effective treatment plan offering you the greatest chance for success. The reproductive endocrinology practice often provides financial counseling to enable you to better plan ahead and make insurance decisions. Urologist This physician specializes in the male genitourinary tract. The urologist can perform a semen analysis and can examine a man for a varicocoele, endocrine problems, genetic defects, or other physical abnormalities that may cause fertility problems. In addition, the urologist can perform a testicular biopsy, surgery for varicocoele repair, and vasectomy reversal. Andrologist This physician-scientist performs laboratory evaluations of male fertility. The andrologist need not be a medical doctor and may hold a Ph.D. degree in any number of technical areas, including microbiology, biochemistry, or andrology. Many andrologists are affiliated with fertility treatment centers and play a key role in performing in vitro fertilization. Psychologist/Counselor This healthcare professional can help you better communicate your feelings and needs to your spouse, family, friends and co-workers. An infertility counselor can help you plan to deal with stress you may encounter during treatment or explore ethical issues surrounding your chosen therapy. Accept Your Physician's Referral If you trust your doctor, you'll be inclined to trust the quality of the referral. Referral from another physician is one of the quickest and best ways to find a doctor. Starting Your Search from Scratch If you're faced with finding a new physician on your own, you may want to utilize some of these resources: RESOLVE, Inc. Contact your local RESOLVE, Inc., chapter or national RESOLVE, Inc., for a referral. The American Society of Reproductive Medicine and local county medical society. As noted, these organizations can provide you with a list of physicians who have expressed an interest in fertility treatment. Although membership in these organizations doesn't certify fertility treatment competency, this may be a good list to work from. Fertility clinics. A number of fertility clinics exist across the country. Some of them are for-profit clinics. Others are nonprofit research organizations usually associated with universities. Many of these clinics can perform your fertility workup. If not, they can provide you with a list of physicians whom they work with in your community. Later I will discuss the different types of fertility clinics. The Endometrioisis Association can provide referral to local physicians experienced in managing endometriosis related infertility. Should You Go to a Specialist? Through your reading and search for information, you may have noticed that many sources recommend you avoid your family physician and obstetrician-gynecologist and go directly to a fertility specialist. I have heard couples say, "If you go to the in vitro clinic for your workup, you're getting the best." While it is certainly true that you can receive very good care through these facilities, the erroneous conclusion drawn by some couples is: "If you don't go to the in vitro center, you're settling for second best." Or even worse: "If the in vitro center can't help you, that's the final word." You may also have heard that you can identify a fertility specialist by the fact that he or she "specializes" in fertility and doesn't deliver babies_the logic apparently being that if doctors are busy delivering babies, they're too busy to know enough about fertility to practice it. I don't believe this is an adequate description, however, of a physician who is qualified to treat your fertility problem. So for a number of reasons, which I'll share with you, I disagree with this generalized recommendation for fertility specialists. Any physician can be listed as a fertility specialist. There is no regulation, licensing, or certification required for advertising this specialty. Before you make your first appointment, however, you can inquire if the physician is fellowship-trained in the reproductive endocrinology and infertility subspecialty. Membership in the American Society of Reproductive Medicine is available to any physician showing an interest in the specialty. While membership in this organization does not guarantee a known standard of technical competence, it does demonstrate the physician's interest in fertility treatment (a definite plus)Specialists may charge more for the same services. An article in Money magazine stated that fertility specialists may charge up to five times more than nonspecialists. This may be overstated, but before you settle on the physician you want, ask about the charges for common tests and procedures. You may find that you'll pay twenty to twenty-five dollars more for a semen analysis from a specialist, even though the same medical laboratory provides these services to all of the doctors in your community. While a fertility specialist may charge more for a particular test or surgical procedure, that your treatment costs no more. A reproductive endocrinologist can best determine whether surgery or in vitro is a more cost effective option for you and help you develop a treatment plan that avoids wasting time and money on unecssary testing and outdated treatments. Do a little price comparison first and remember that the lowest- or highest-priced doctor is not necessarily the worst or best. The Private Physician vs. the Fertility Clinic Another question that arises is whether to consult with a private physician or go to a large fertility clinic. A private physician can treat most fertility problems. The additional skills and expertise provided by in vitro centers and large fertility clinics are needed only for about 10 percent of fertility problems. I have some additional ideas on this matter that I'd like to share with you: For-profit fertility clinics and in vitro centers are not certified. Fertility treatment has become a big money making business. It's little wonder that the clinic's interest in attracting customers influences the way in which they may report their pregnancy success rates. For example, a clinic may report that 50 percent of their patients get pregnant within two cycles. So you may assume that you have a one in two chance of pregnancy if you go to them. These could look like pretty good odds to some couples. However, the clinic's statistics do not show that they eliminate more than half of the applicants before completing the in vitro procedures. In fact, some clinics quote success rates based on a positive pregnancy test rather than babies delivered. the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology publishes an annual clinic specific report documenting success rates at each clinic. While this report ensures that each clinic defines success in a similar fashion, it may still not provide all the information you need to base your decision. At first glance, a program with a high success rate may seem the obvious choice. But, after a closer look, you learn that the clinic with a lower success rate treats older patients with more severe fertility problems while the clinic with the better pregnancy rates refuses women older than 35 and any couple with an abnormal semen analysis. Don't get me wrong: Reviewing statistics is important. Just try to be objective when you read or hear about success rates. Research-oriented clinics may perform unnecessary tests and procedures to meet research criteria and to pay their expenses. In order to conduct scientifically sound fertility research, medical professionals must have similar information about each couple. Thus this kind of clinic may perform expensive tests not only on patients who warrant them but also on those who do not need them. In this way the researchers can compare their results between "abnormal" and "normal" populations. Consequently the research clinic may not tailor your workup to your unique set of problems. Money charged for these "extra" tests also helps pay the bills for expensive laboratory and research capabilities which may not be needed for your basic diagnostic workup. Before signing up with a research clinic, find out what diagnostic procedures they recommend and how much they charge. If this information doesn't correlate with what you've learned about fertility treatment, you may wish to get a second opinion. Larger clinics may contribute to your feeling of isolation and anonymity. Often couples who have gone to large clinics complain that they didn't receive much of the physician's personal time; no one in the clinic knew them by sight; and a different resident physician saw them at each visit. Also, many people who travel considerable distances to these clinics don't feel comfort-able expressing their concerns: they feel isolated and dissatisfied. One patient said, "I feel like I'm being herded like cattle." If that's the way you feel, you probably are not getting the personal attention you need, and the clinic you're going to may be too large. I must say, however, that a number of large clinics provide services that many smaller organizations cannot: educational video-tapes, nurse practitioners to answer questions, on-site X-ray and testing laboratories, and counseling and support groups_all of which can be of great value. Many communities are not large enough to support fertility specialists and in vitro clinics. Traveling to distant medical facilities may add unnecessarily to your out-of-pocket expenses, absenteeism from work, and overall level of stress. If you have a good family practitioner and/or OB-GYN in your community who knows quite a bit about fertility treatment, I'd encourage you to begin there rather than travel hundreds of miles to a stranger. The "expert" isn't necessarily better just because he or she is located over one hundred mile s away. Often, you will find that your physician can work together with a fertility specialist to minimize your travel, expense and time. A Final Note About Selecting a Doctor Fertility treatment isn't magic. It is a structured, organized investigation. An obstetrician-gynecologist working together with a reproductive endocrinologist or urologist can diagnose and successfully treat the majority of people with fertility problems. Ultimately you should judge any doctor's ability based on the treatment plan he or she outlines especially for you and on the doctor's responsiveness to your problems and concerns. Making a List and Checking It Twice The first interview with your doctor provides an excellent opportunity for you to assess how well you will be able to work together. To prepare for your first visit, write down a list of questions you want to ask. To help formulate your questions, you may want to refer to the workup overview in chapter 4 as well as to the next section, which lists the questions people most frequently ask me. The reasons for asking some of these questions may not make complete sense until you've read the rest of this book. However, I feel I should put them here so you have them as background. If you are already receiving fertility treatment, it is not too late to ask your doctor these questions. If you spot any of the "Four Poor Treatment Danger Signs" discussed below, you may wish to reconsider your choice of doctors. Questions to Ask Your Doctor About the Doctor's Practice Do you have experience in fertility treatment? When do you consult with a reproductive endocrinology specialist? Will you refer me to an obstetrician when I get pregnant or will you deliver the baby? Will you send me to any other physicians or laboratories for treatments or tests? Will you treat my spouse? If not, who will? Do you arrange for adoptions? Do you document surgeries with photographs or videotapes so I can see your findings for myself or provide them to other doctors? Which hospital(s) do you use? Do you use Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon/Lupron to induce ovulation? If so, do you monitor egg development with ultrasound and blood estrogen to avoid multiple births? Do you perform sterilization reversals? What is your success rate? (Should be about 60 percent.) Do you perform microsurgery? What is your success rate for vasectomy reversal? (Should be about 90 percent.) For fallopian tube repair? (Should be 50 to 70 percent.) Do you belong to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine? Are you on the RESOLVE, Inc., recommended list of physicians? About Tests, Surgery, and treatments What kind of procedure is it? What will the procedure tell you? What results do you expect? How long will it take? What will it cost? Does insurance cover it? Will it hurt? How will it make me feel afterward? Can you do it in your office? As a hospital outpatient? Will I be incapacitated? For how long? Will I miss work? Will my spouse be involved? How? Will he/she miss work? Can I drive home afterward? How many times will it be repeated? Will it interfere with our sex life? How? Will we have to delay our vacation? About Medications What results do you expect? How long/often will I take it? What will it cost? Does insurance cover it? Will it hurt or have side effects? Do I take it at home or at your office? Will I have to miss time at work? How many times will it be repeated? Will we have to delay our vacation? Four Poor treatment Danger Signs Once you've selected your physician, you are responsible for monitoring your doctor's performance. That may sound strange to you, but if you hired a carpenter, auto mechanic, or roofer, you wouldn't think twice about making sure you were getting the work you contracted for. It's the same for a doctor. However, you must be an informed consumer in order to evaluate the doctor's performance. Below are four danger signs that will alert you that you may have chosen the wrong person: No clear cut fertility treatment plan. If your physician does not formulate and discuss a treatment plan, you may be on the "hit-or-miss" regimen. After your first conference, your doctor should be able to outline the initial phases of your workup. After the basic workup, which may take four to six weeks, your doctor should be able to outline a treatment plan. you should be confident that your doctor, as would any good investigator, is using specific step-by-step procedures for getting answers about your fertility problem. If your doctor hasn't shared the plan with you, ask for a detailed explanation. (I'll describe the nature of these plans later.) Take notes and make sure that your doctor follows that course. If your doctor deviates from the plan, find out why. was it because of an unexpected test result? Our did the doctor forget certain details that were planned initially? Remember, a ask questions when they arise. Waiting for the straw that breaks the camel's black or assuming that the doctor is an infallible being who will take care of everything will get you into trouble. If your doctor's response to your request for a plan is not adequate, find a different doctor. Poor communication. If you can't talk to your doctor, at least one of you has a problem. Doctors are usually very busy, so as a rule they won't sit down and strike up a conversation hoping that eventually you will feel at ease enough to ask a question. If, after you leave the doctor's office, you always remember a question you meant to ask, I encourage you to write down your questions before your appointments. You should feel free to call back and talk to the nurse practitioner or to the doctor personally. If you feel that your doctor is not taking your questions seriously, is giving you superficial answers, seems impatient about explaining terms and treatment, persistently talks over your head, will not return your calls, or is too frequently not available when you need help, find another. Unorthodox treatment or methods. After reading this book, you will be well acquainted with the methods your doctor should be using. If your doctor deviates from these regimens_for example, by failing to perform a semen analysis, prescribing fertility drugs before doing a complete fertility evaluation, or administering Pergonal without using an ultrasound to monitor the number of eggs you're developing_you have reason to be concerned. Talk to your physician. Don't just assume he or she is incompetent. You may have misunderstood something you heard or read, or your condition might be out of the ordinary. If after getting the doctor's answers you are still troubled, however, you may wish to request a second opinion, especially when surgery is recommended. No good doctor should balk at this perfectly reasonable request. If you don't think your doctor is using the "best" fertility treatment procedures or if you lack faith in your doctor's decisions, then find another doctor. Your treatment is taking too long. This is a tough one because the amount of time required to diagnose and treat each fertility problem is different for each patient. However, there are a few benchmarks you can watch for. Your initial workup should be complete within four to six weeks_ two months at the most. At that point your doctor should be able to give you the preliminary findings and should present your options for additional tests or treatment. As your treatment progresses, you may tend to become impatient. You may forget, for example, that even after you are "cured," you are no more fertile than the average population at your age. At the most, you have a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant each month. So if your doctor feels that your fertility problem is resolved after six months of treatment, it may take another six to nine months for you to get pregnant. If you don't conceive in that time, your doctor may recommend conducting further tests. Doctors may often use a more aggressive treatment approach with an older couple like Richard and Margaret B., who were in their mid-thirties. A woman in that age group doesn't have that many fertile years left and her odds for "normal" pregnancy are getting slimmer each year. If you feel your fertile years are slipping away, discuss your concerns with your doctor. If your doctor isn't responsive, find another doctor. I tailor the rate of treatment to each couple. Some people want to know all of the answers right now. Others want to proceed more slowly_they need time for things to sink in. For example, Shelley T. had a limited budget, so the pacing of her treatment plan was slower than for Margaret, who wanted to get pregnant as soon as possible. Each of these women required a custom-designed treatment plan that would accommodate her life-style. Is your treatment taking too long? That's very hard to judge. But if you're really worried about it, talk with your doctor and your RESOLVE support group counselors. If you don't feel that you're making progress, get a second opinion or find a new doctor. I encourage you to learn as much as you can about fertility treatment and, above all, never to accept your doctor's recommendations complacently. Ultimately, you are responsible for the quality of care you receive. You are responsible for selecting the doctor who is best qualified to help you get your miracle baby.

Hearing the news didn't do much for Shelley either: "A year of tests for nothing!" she said. "Don't be so hasty. They weren't exactly for nothing," I assured her. "You did find out you have endometriosis, which impairs your fertility. Only now we know that we must treat both of you. you may have that baby yet." Many couples overreact to the results of a single semen analysis, just as Michael and Shelley T. did. However, since many factors can "spoil" or influence a single test result--errors in collection, errors in handling the specimen, and errors at the laboratory I'll always advise performing a second semen analysis in a month or so. Convincing Michael and Shelley of this wasn't easy. "The semen analysis is only a screening test," I explained. "It does not provide a definitive diagnosis. It tells me the quality and quantity of your sperm, the motility or movement of your sperm, the volume of your semen, and the concentration of your sperm. In plain English it tells me if you are producing the right amount of good quality sperm and semen." "What did my test show?" "I found almost no sperm and very little semen or fluid. This can mean a number of things: You do not produce much semen and sperm. You produce semen and sperm but due to an obstruction they do not come out when you ejaculate. Or, perhaps even more simply, you didn't collect the sample correctly. That's what I need to find out first." Semen Analysis If the semen analysis suggests that the man is fertile and free from infection, no further fertility testing is usually needed of him. Other factors that might impair his sperm are incompatibility between his semen and his wife's cervical mucus or an inability to bind to the egg and fertilize it. Problems with sperm-mucus interaction can be checked by doing a postcoital test which I'll describe. Hamster-egg penetration tests, zona binding tests or in vitro fertilization can tell me if the sperm can function properly when it reaches the egg. However, if his semen analysis indicates a fertility problem, further evaluation is necessary. Collecting the Semen Sample Before I could evaluate the validity of Michael's semen analysis results, I needed to find out how he and Shelley had collected the sample. (To collect semen, a man must ejaculate into a sterile cup.) I asked them these questions: "When you collected the sample, how long had it been since the last time you ejaculated?" Each ejaculation affects your sperm supply, so specimen collection timing should be as close to your normal ejaculation frequency as practical. (When figuring this interval, you need to consider both sex and masturbation.) Having this information is vital for correctly interpreting semen analysis findings. For example, if you ejaculate infrequently, your sample will contain a higher than expected number of dead sperm and sloughed-off cells. If you ejaculate very frequently (for example, once a day), you may not have time to replenish your sperm supply between emissions. Altering your normal pattern just to perform the test either sooner or later--can distort the results. Michael reported that he produced the speci-men at his normal frequency of ejaculation. "How long did it take you to get the specimen to our laboratory for testing?" Normally I suggest collection at our laboratory site in our specially prepared soundproof room. However, a number of men have difficulty masturbating on demand in the doctor's office. It's at best embarrassing, and some even refuse for moral and religious reasons. I try to circumvent these obstacles as best as possible without seriously jeopardizing the integrity of the test. If the specimen is collected at home and delivered within one hour, we should be able to evaluate sperm quality. If the "home" results are abnormal, the test must be repeated to determine whether the sample was damaged in transit. If the couple wishes, the wife can help with the collection. Using on-site facilities ensures that you collect the sample in a sterile container, that you do not expose your sample to temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and that your sperm don't deteriorate from remaining in seminal plasma for more than an hour. By testing your sample immediately, we can also examine how it changes consistency. Normally your semen coagulates after ejaculation to prevent spillage. It should begin to liquefy within twenty minutes to one hour. If the semen remains coagulated, it traps your sperm and prevents them from swimming to the egg. Once identified, I can easily solve coagulation problems. Michael assured me that he had brought the specimen to the office within an hour: "Your nurse suggested that since we live so far away we get a motel room down the street. You should have seen the motel clerk," Michael said, "when they saw we had no luggage." "How did you collect the sample, and did you save the entire ejaculation?" The best way to collect your semen is by masturbating into a sterile wide-mouth jar. I don't recommend using jars washed in a dishwasher, since they contain harmful soap residue. It's extremely important that you collect the entire specimen because the concentration of sperm varies in different portions of your ejaculate. For 90 percent of the male population, the first squirt (ejaculate fraction) contains more sperm than later portions. Subsequent squirts contain primarily semen (seminal vesicle secretions). For these reasons, you cannot collect a good sample by withdrawing your penis during sex and taking a sample of remaining squirts. You cannot withdraw in time to save the first drop of sperm-rich semen. Since Michael T.'s religious beliefs forbade masturbation (that's actually why he refused testing with their previous doctor), I provided him with a Mylex condom to fit around his penis during sex. I cautioned him not to use an ordinary condom or lubricants, since they often contain sperm-killing chemicals. Although Shelley complained of some discomfort with the loose-fitting plastic pouch, they both found this procedure more acceptable and were able to collect a complete sample. Where religious beliefs forbid the use of contraceptive devices, inserting a small hole near the top of the collection pouch will satisfy the patient's objections and provide an adequate specimen. Substituting the Postcoital Examination If a man is unable or unwilling to collect a semen sample, I can examine the wife's cervical mucus several hours after unprotected intercourse. If I find living, mobile sperm, the chances of the man's being fertile are pretty good. Under ordinary circumstances, however, the postcoital test does not give me as much information as the semen analysis, because I cannot evaluate the percentage of deformed sperm or take a white blood cell count to test for infection. Repeating the Semen Analysis "Michael, I feel pretty confident that the results of your semen analysis are correct. However, I want you to repeat the test in four to six weeks. "I never jump to conclusions from a single negative test result. And you shouldn't either. Too many things can influence the results." I glanced at his medical history form. "I see you're diabetic. I want to do a physical and also evaluate your hormones. You aren't down for the count yet. you and Shelley have many options we haven't even discussed." I closed his file and leaned back in my chair. "I frequently find a condition called retrograde ejaculation in diabetics. It's possible that your bladder sphincter muscle, which normally directs your semen out through your penis, is not closing. Your sperm may be squirting back into your bladder instead." "Can you do something for it?" Shelley asked hopefully. "Yes. But first, we need to find out exactly what we're dealing with." "Okay, let's do it." Michael turned toward Shelley and said, "We'd better reserve that motel room again." What Is Semen Quality? To fertilize an egg (ovum), your sperm must be able to perform these critical tasks: Your sperm must be able to swim to the egg with a vigorous straight motion (motility, forward progression). Your sperm must be able to penetrate the egg to deliver your genes for fertilization (sperm penetration). The semen analysis tells me if your sperm meet the first criteria. The sperm penetration assay (hamster test) or acrosin test will tell me if your sperm can penetrate the egg for fertilization. I'll discuss egg penetration tests in later chapters. Sperm Count World Health Organization guidelines say a normal sperm count consists of 50 million sperm per ejaculate with 50 percent motility and 60 percent normal morphology (form). we know that concentrations must be under 20 million sperm per milliliter of ejaculate in order to actually impair fertility. Provided your sperm show adequate forward motility and good egg penetration, concentrations as low as 5 to 10 million can produce a pregnancy. It's interesting to note that only twenty-five years ago counts of 100 million sperm per ejaculate were the norm. With time, the effects of our toxic environment and/or life-style seem to be gradually degrading male sperm counts. Low Semen Volume Your total semen volume also influences your fertility. If the volume is too small, say under one milliliter, you may not have enough fluid to bring the sperm in contact with your wife's cervix (the entrance of her womb). In addition, an insufficient quality of protective semen will expose your sperm to the acid, sperm-killing environment of her vagina. I remember one couple who had been trying to have a baby for over three years. When I checked the husband's semen, I found a low semen volume and a depressed sugar (fructose) level. Since the seminal vesicles (glands that produce most of the seminal fluid) produce this sugar, I suspected an obstruction or infection. When I examined him further, I found evidence of infection. After several rounds of antibiotics, his semen volume doubled to normal levels. When semen volume cannot be increased, artificial insemination (AIH) provides excellent results by delivering concentrated sperm to the womb. High Semen Volume If your ejaculate averages more than 3.5 milliliters, your sperm concentration may be too low; that is, your sperm are diluted by excess seminal fluid. We know that for 90 percent of men, the first portion of their ejaculate is richest in sperm. So if you produce too much semen, I'll suggest that you collect an ejaculate by masturbation. I can then concentrate the sperm and place them inside the uterus, intrauterine insemination (IUI). Semen Viscosity Semen viscosity (liquid flow) also affects your fertility potential. If your coagulated semen does not liquefy within an hour of ejaculation, your sperm may be trapped in the cottage cheese-like jelly. I remember one man whose semen did not liquefy. Since the prostate gland secretes the chemical required for liquifaction, I did a rectal examination to check his gland. He just about jumped off the table when I pressed on the swollen tissue. Fortunately his infected prostate responded to antibiotic therapy. The most common way of dealing with persistent coagulation or high viscosity is collecting your sperm through masturbation, washing the semen from them, and using your sperm for artificial insemination (AIH). I'll discuss these procedures in more detail. Sperm Agglutination A microscopic examination will tell me if your sperm are clumping together (agglutinating). I've seen a number of semen samples where the sperm orient themselves tail-to-tail or head-to-head instead of swimming in a straight line. This clumping prevents them from swimming through the cervical mucus to the egg and attaching if they get there. This finding may indicate a problem with sperm antibodies or the presence of a bacterial infection. I'll discuss how we can solve these problems. Sperm Morphology A normal-looking sperm has an oval head and a tail seven to fifteen times longer than the head. You can identify defective sperm by their large heads or strange tails--kinked, doubled, or coiled. The World Health Organization says good quality semen should contain 60 percent normal sperm morphology. (See figure 6.1 Sperm Morphology) A closer evaluation called a strict morphology (Kruger morphology) is more time consuming and usually predicts normal sperm function when more than 15% are normal. The reason all men produce abnormal sperm (up to 40 percent) is not known. However, considering the rate at which your production line operates--ten million to fifty million new sperm per day--some attrition should be expected. We do know that toxins such as lead have been linked to reduced motility; cigarette smoke to abnormal morphology, organic solvents to coiled tails; and excessive scrotal heat to coiled tails in animal sperm. When you lower your exposure to these agents, abnormal morphology levels usually decrease. I remember one man who transferred to a different job at his company so he could avoid exposure to heat from a blast furnace and began taking 1000 mg of vitamin C each day. Within a few months his sperm motility and morphology showed definite improvement. Debris and Infection Too many underdeveloped or immature sperm (germinal cells) in your semen indicate testicular stress from illness or infection. I remember one young athlete who had recently recovered from a case of the flu where he'd run a 104-degree temperature for three days straight. His sperm count, revealing many dead and immotile sperm, nearly blew his mind. "Don't worry," I told him. "Your fever probably caused all the damage." I retested him three months later and found him fully recovered. If I find white blood cells (leukocytes) in your semen, I suspect an infection. I will want to check both you and your wife for infection, since these diseases are easily passed back and forth between sexual partners. Sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and ureaplasma respond to doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative. Prostate infections, which can be especially stubborn to treat, may take a month or more to clear up. Asthenospermia (Low Sperm Motility) with Adequate Concentration and Morphology Low motility may be a sign of infection or exposure to toxic substances. If your semen contains white blood cells and other cellular debris, you probably have an infection, which should respond well to antibiotic therapy. I will also ask if you are using medications or "street" drugs like marijuana, which can impair sperm motility. Changing medications or stopping drug usage will usually improve motility. Low motility is also quite common in the presence of a varicocoele. If other causes have been eliminated, I may recommend that the varicose vein be repaired. Nearly half the men who have this surgery impregnate their wives. If I find small testicles, scant pubic hair, or a thinning beard, I will run blood tests to confirm a hormonal deficiency. Chapter 8 discusses when varicocoele repair or hormone replacement therapy is a waste of time and money and when it will work wonders. Sperm-Mucus Interaction (the Postcoital Test) Your sperm must be: able to survive heir journey through your wife's reproductive system. The first barriers your sperm encounter are her highly acidic vaginal fluids and cervical mucus The vaginal environment does a good job of keeping bacteria under control, so in that way it's beneficial. However, the sperm must be specially equipped to make the journey intact. The postcoital test will tell me if your sperm are getting to your wife's uterus in good shape and in adequate members. I perform the postcoital test war the middle of your wife's monthly cycle (when she should be most fertile). At the time of ovulation her cervical mucus, which normally seals her womb from the outside, becomes thin and watery to allow your sperm to swim through the cervix toward her waiting egg. If the test is done 'at the "wrong" tine of her cycle, the results will be abnormal, since before rand after ovulation the mucus becomes impervious to sperm. This is why I use a urine LH kit to predict when she is about ready to ovulate. A few drops of urine are placed on the test stick. When a color change is noted, ovulation will usually occur within 24 hours. So, I recommend having intercourse that evening and checking the cervical mucus early the next morning. When I examine her cervical mucus, I look for three things: (1) if you delivered good quantities of sperm to her cervix, (2) if your sperm are vigorously swimming through the mucus in one direction, and (3) if white bloodcells are present, indicating infection in either partner. Assuming your semen analysis was normal, if I find immotile, clumped, or dead sperm in the mucus, I'll suspect that your sperm and your wife's mucus are incompatible. If I find no sperm at all, I may suspect a problem with the way you're havling sex. Even though the postcoital test provides very valuable information, I cannot substitute this test for a semen analysis, which gives me a better picture of morphology 'and the presence of infection (white blood cell count). Normal Semen Analysis with Poor Postcoital Test If I find no sperm in the cervical mucus, as I did with Michael and Shelley T., I suspect a deliverer problem. Perhaps, the husband is ejaculating prematurely and not depositing the sperm near her cervix. Maybe he is not actually ejaculating at all. Or maybe she is douching immediately after sex. I can often identify the problem by talking with the couple. I remember one man who had a great sperm count but no sperm at all showed up in their postcoital test. After counseling with him, I discovered that when he had sex he faked his climax and did not ejaculate. After several months of counseling (costing far less than fertility treatment), he and his wife returned for another postcoital evaluation and all looked well. "It's only a matter of time now," I told them. "Just let nature take its course." If I find agglutinated (coagulated) semen that contains shaking sperm instead of actively swimming sperm, I suspect that something in the mucus is attacking the sperm. Vaginal lubricants or allergic responses to the sperm can also cause this toxic reaction; for example, the woman's immune system may be producing antibodies that are attacking the sperm. In some situations the man himself may be making antibodies in his own sperm. I find this among men with frequent genital infections and with men who have undergone a vasectomy reversal. Overcoming Sperm Antibodies Using a condom during sex can sometimes reduce a wife's sensitivity to her husband's sperm. If she avoids all contact with her husband's sperm--hands, her mouth, her genitals, and so forth--for three months or so, her antibodies may decrease in numbers. A repeat postcoital test at three-month intervals will tell me if this procedure is working. Once her antibodies stop attacking his sperm, they can swim to her egg and make a baby. Some people do not want to wait as long as a year for the possibility that her antibodies will decrease. So usually I use artificial insemination with the husband's sperm to bypass sperm-mucus interaction problems. This is the route Steven and Kathy S. eventually took. AIH often works quite well. I will discuss these procedures in greater detail in Chapter 21. Concentrating Your Sperm Sometimes I can improve the quality of your semen without having to diagnose and treat an underlying fertility problem. Concentrating your sperm by natural means or in the laboratory may improve your semen quality enough so that your wife can get pregnant without expensive medications and surgeries. Centrifuging Semen for AIH Centrifuging your semen and using the more concentrated Portion for AIH may also improve your semen quality. Sometimes this technique is used with in vitro procedures. Freezing Multiple Semen Samples for AIH Unfortunately, collecting and freezing several sperm samples will not increase sperm quantity and concentration. The freezing and thawing processes damage the sperm so severely that semen quality actually diminishes. It's interesting, however, that sperm from a fertile donor does not deteriorate from freezing as much as that from an infertile donor. Other Methods of Sperm Preparation Many methods are available to separate the sperm from the semen and concentrate them before performing an insemination. Techniques such as percoll, swim-up, swim-down and sedimentation procedures are helpful for in vitro fertilization, they are usually not necessary for insemination. Most of these procedures select only a small percentage of the moving sperm so I usually have many fewer sperm than after a simple centrifuging sperm procedure. If sperm concentration techniques do not work, I have to look for underlying causes. Chapters 7 and Chapter 8 explain how I can identify the causes of your problem and outline a fertility treatment plan. Hit or-Miss Male Fertility Treatment In the past the understanding and treatment of male fertility lagged far behind that of female fertility. Infertile men were treated empirically. Without ever undergoing a thorough diagnosis, most men received a random series of treatments. Many times I've heard my patients say, "I had a low sperm count, so the doctor gave me Serophene. He said if that didn't work, we'd try Metrodin." When I asked them if their doctor ran tests to find out why the sperm count was low, more often than not they said no. This type of treatment consumes a lot of precious time as well as your energy and money. Therefor, you should insist on getting an accurate diagnosis and treatment for a known problem. Evaluating male fertility can be time-consuming and frustrating because sperm take approximately ninety days to form and mature. So if your doctor does something today to enhance your sperm production, it may be ninety days before the improved sperm show up in your semen sample. With the advent of inn vitro fertilization techniques, we're seeing rapid advances in male fertility, diagnosis and treatment. Doctors now know how to direct therapy to the source of your problem. Today we can correctly diagnose 80 percent of our male fertility patients. And we can successfully treat over half of those. These results are pretty impressive when you consider the aim�the creation of a new human life.

I thought people like that wouldn't be able to 'get it up.' " I smiled. "That's not a dumb question at all. But 'getting it up' and getting them out are two different things." I sat on the stool beside the table. Steven still looked anxious. "You mean you can have one problem without the other?" "Yes, you can have a completely normal sex drive and still not make enough sperm to get your wife pregnant." "What a relief." He relaxed and the tension left his face. "I almost didn't have the courage to ask you." "Please don't ever feel that way, Steven." I picked up his completed medical history form. "Let's see what we can do to raise your sperm count." Steven's concern about virility is common among men. Although we see a connection between virility and fertility with a few hormonal disorders, sexual impairment is fairly rare. In this chapter you will discover how your life-style, general health, and sexual experiences may be affecting your fertility. And you'll learn more about how your doctor can identify the source of your fertility problem. The Four Factors of Male Fertility To get your wife pregnant, you must be able to make and ejaculate viable sperm. To accomplish this, a number of mechanisms must be in good working order. I divide my fertility formula into the following categories: pretesticular, testicular, posttesticular, and ejaculatory processes. The interruption of any one of these four processes accounts for about 80 percent of male fertility problems. The other 15 to 20 percent are very rare conditions or disorders that cannot be diagnosed at this time. Before covering each of the fertility formula factors in depth, I'd like to give you an overview of the four processes. In the next two chapters I'll discuss these areas in greater detail. Pretestlcular Function (Hormones) Disturbances in the hormonal system cause about 10 percent of male fertility problems. Your brain plays a key role in regulating the hormones that affect the development of sperm (spermatogenesis). The process begins when your hypothalamus (a part of your brain) emits a substance (gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH) that stimulates your pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain. Your pituitary gland then emits LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). These stimulate testicular development and sperm production. LH also initiates the testicular production of testosterone�a hormone responsible for virility, male secondary sex characteristics, and the support of sperm production. (If you got through that, the rest will be a cinch!) A number of conditions can interfere with the development and timely delivery of these hormones. When the system breaks down, low sperm production (oligospermia) or no sperm production (azospermia) may result. If you have a pretesticular problem, you have a good chance of responding to hormone replacement therapy. Testicular Function Testicular failure represents about 55 percent of male fertility problems. To respond to hormone stimulation properly, your testicles, or testes, must be capable of producing sperm (spermatogenesis). To assess your testicular potential, I need to know if your testes descended into your scrotum on time; if they have been damaged by a varicocoele (a varicose vein in the scrotum) or by excessive heat, toxins, disease, or trauma; or if for some genetic reason they failed to develop normally. If the damage or failure is severe, nothing much can be done to improve testicular performance. However, testes damaged by varicocoeles (which are found in 40 percent of men with fertility problems) frequently respond to surgical repair. And testes impaired by toxic substances often recover when the toxins are removed. Posttesticular Function Tubal obstruction�including vasectomy�accounts for about 6 percent of male infertility. Your posttesticular system of ducts must be capable of storing and delivering your sperm. Sperm delivery system problems include obstruction or interruption of the tubes as a result of congenital malformation, disease, surgery, or trauma. Laser surgery and microsurgical techniques offer excellent chances for duct repair and restored fertility. Newer techiques allow the urologist to remove sperm directly from the testicle. These sperm can then be injected directly into your wife's eggs. Ejaculatory Disturbance, Impotence, and Sexual Problems Ejaculatory disturbances, impotence, and sexual problems may prevent you from delivering sperm to your wife's vagina. These disorders represent about 10 percent of male fertility problems. Premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, and impotence may stem from surgery, medication, or physiological disturbances which respond well to hormone replacement therapy. Altering sex techniques and counseling often overcome psychologically based sexual performance difficulties. Making the Diagnosis Is Not Always Easy Fitting you neatly into one of these categories is not always easy. Sometimes a man will have mild or moderate symptoms or he will have several different problems, so complaints and test results will appear confusing or in conflict. For these reasons, I caution my patients not to jump to conclusions from preliminary test results and not to attempt self-diagnosis. If you have a fertility problem, the only way you can get an accurate diagnosis is to have a complete fertility workup, combined with careful analysis by a professional. Clues From Your Past: Analyzing Your Life-style Many people suspect that doctors never read those long complicated history forms you fill out. This isn't true, especially with fertility evaluations. Your general medical history, life-style, and current symptoms provide vital clues that help your doctor pinpoint potential difficulties. Travel, Work, Hobbies, and Activities We know that certain chemicals can adversely affect sperm development (spermatogenesis) and lower sperm counts. Since Steven S. had a low count (oligospermia), I wanted to find out if he had ever come in contact with toxic chemicals like lead, pesticides, polystyrene, xylene, benzene, mercury, Agent Orange, anesthetic gases, and solvents. Long-term exposure to these chemicals can cause irreversible damage; however, removing the toxin can often restore fertility. One unusual case surfaced a couple of years ago when a thirty-two-year-old chemical technician with oligospermia was referred to me by his company doctor. When I questioned Paul W., I discovered that several times each day he used various chemical solutions to clean metal parts. He told me that he often didn't use his safety mask because he couldn't see well with it on. After I talked to the company safety director about the composition of the cleaner, I advised Paul that some of the chemicals he used had been linked to depressed sperm production. "Either use the mask or find another job," I told him. I guess he took me seriously, because without any further treatment I found a marked regeneration of sperm three months later. Before the year was out, his wife was pregnant. Accidental and medically prescribed exposure to large amounts of radiation to the gonads (to combat a malignant tumor, for example) can also impair sperm production. If your tissue damage is not extensive, however, some degree of fertility may regenerate. (Note: Normal, diagnostic X-ray studies do not impair fertility.) We also know that excessive exposure to heat can interfere with sperm production. One reason that your sperm-producing testicles are located in your scrotum is to lower their temperature one or two degrees below your body's. I remember one man I treated who worked out at the gym four times a week and afterward soaked in the 106 degree whirlpool. His biceps were bigger than my thighs. When I found his low sperm count, I asked him to give up the whirlpool. Several months later I received a phone call from him saying his wife was pregnant. Some jobs may overheat your scrotum (from the temperature, not from your boss breathing down your neck) for example, the foundry worker or the sedentary long-distance truck driver. Oligospermia in the wheelchair-bound paraplegic also may be due to excessive scrotal heat. In some situations changing from jockey shorts to boxer shorts may offer a solution. Removal of the heat exposure will usually resolve this type of fertility problem. It's thought that a varicocoele may also damage testicular tissue because of the excessive heat caused by the pooled blood. Some doctors even diagnose varicocoele by measuring the temperature difference between the right and left sides of the scrotum (measuring scrotal temperature, however, is not standardized and is frequently unreliable). If you travel frequently, you may not be able to have sex during your wife's fertile time of the month. For example, due to business commitments, Richard and Margaret B. often found themselves in different cities on her fertile days. With only twelve or thirteen opportunities per year for pregnancy, and with only a 20 percent chance of achieving pregnancy each time, infrequent sex can seriously hamper your odds for success. If you have some control over your travel schedule, you can improve your odds for pregnancy by staying at home and having sex during your wife's most fertile days. The rest of the month you can travel all you like. Or, you may choose to have your sperm frozen so that an insemination can be performed in your absence. Infrequent sex can also lead to decreased sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology (shape). I'll tell you later how to calculate which days are best. Drugs, Alcohol, and Cigarettes Since the 1950s more and more people have experimented with "street" drugs and many have continued using them, especially marijuana. If you've smoked marijuana over a long period of time, your semen analysis may show lower sperm motility and higher incidences of abnormal sperm morphology. Both of these factors are critical for fertility. I'd noticed that Richard B. checked marijuana use on his history form, so I wanted to talk with him about it. I explained, "We don't understand exactly how it works but we do know that there seems to be a correlation between sperm motility and marijuana use. If you want to maximize your chances, I recommend that you stop smoking." His expression became serious. "Margaret and I have waited a long time for this baby. I'll do anything that will improve our chances." I don't think Richard was totally convinced, but he did stop smoking. When his semen analysis improved in just two months, I think he was pleasantly surprised. We also know that central nervous system depressants such as barbiturates, heroin, and other narcotics cause impotence and ejaculatory disorders. If you stop using these drugs, usually these symptoms resolve themselves. Chronic alcohol use can lead to impotence, poor sperm quality, and further complications from liver damage. If alcohol damages your liver, you may have elevated estrogen (female hormone) levels. When a man's female hormones become excessive, they suppress his sex drive and interfere with his sexual performance. If you stop drinking alcohol, these conditions may reverse�provided your liver can recover. Though not conclusive, there is indication that some of the hundreds of chemicals in cigarettes may interfere with fertility by elevating the number of abnormal sperm forms. It's difficult to know, however, how smoking may affect any one individual. If you have concerns about the effects of smoking on you, the best strategy might be to cut down or quit smoking entirely. Stress and Excessive Exercise We know that stress and excessive exercise can interrupt the normal flow of hormones from the woman's hypothalamus and pituitary. These abnormal hormone levels can interfere with her menstrual cycles and with her fertility. Some believe that endorphins (natural narcotics) released by the brain to minimize pain and stress may block the normal release of GnRH, which is essential for maintaining male and female reproductive hormone balance. An example of this would be the abnormal (infrequent or absent) menstrual cycles often seen in women who run fifteen to twenty miles a week. Because of the many similarities in the hypothalamus-pituitary hormone system of men and women, there also may be similarities in their responses to stress and excessive exercise. If you believe that your life-style is too emotionally or physically stressful, try cutting back. Run fewer miles, try to avoid emotional situations, and incorporate more relaxing activities into your schedule. Your General Health Medical Disorders A number of childhood and adult diseases can adversely affect fertility. Some of the changes are only temporary; for example, a high fever (over 102 degrees) may cause your scrotum to overheat and your sperm to die. Usually this type of problem resolves itself in a few months. Some diseases, however, exert a more lasting effect. For example, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, and adult mumps can destroy vital testicular tissues and leave you permanently sterile. Consult with your doctor before you write yourself off, however, because these diseases do not affect everyone the same way. If you have ever contracted sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and ureaplasma, scar tissue left by the inflammation can partially or totally block your sperm ducts. Bacteria, viruses, and your own white blood cells (Iymphocytes) can attack your sperm and reduce your fertility. Finding white blood cells and dead tissue cells in your semen alerts me to the presence of an active infection. These infections are usually limited to the lower parts of the male genital tract�urethra, prostate, and seminal vesicles. Seldom does the infection travel further in toward your testicles. If infection does reach your testicles, it can cause serious damage. With the exception of prostatitis, which can be difficult to clear up, sexually transmitted infections will usually respond to antibiotics. If your genitourinary tract becomes scarred from repeated infections, the damaged ducts can often be repaired with microsurgery. It's vital that your sexual partner also be treated for infection because you can pass the disease back and forth between you. As you'll learn later, sexually transmitted diseases produce far more devastating damage in their female victims. Systemic diseases such as high blood pressure, colitis, diabetes, and hepatitis can deteriorate sperm quality and cause impotence and ejaculatory disorders. When I found that Michael T. had diabetes, for example, I wanted to investigate its effects on his fertility. Sickle-cell anemia, most frequently found in people with black heritage, may also reduce sperm concentration. Insufficient thyroid hormone has also been linked with low sperm motility and other hormone imbalances. I will discuss the specific treatment options available for these disorders in Chapter 8 . Kidney problems may also affect your fertility. I remember an executive with a major oil company who developed chronic kidney disease in his mid-forties. He'd had two daughters by his first wife; but his disease-induced fertility problem prevented his new wife from having a child of their own. "My wife really cares desperately about carrying our child," he pleaded. I worked very closely with his nephrologist and together we managed to get him a kidney transplant. With his disease under better control, his sperm count improved, and miraculously the couple produced a baby. Reports of breast disorders such as tenderness, soreness, and milky discharge or neurological problems characterized by visual disturbances, dizziness, chronic headaches, and/or seizures may lead me to suspect multiple sclerosis, nerve damage, or a problem with the pituitary. Since your brain and your master pituitary gland are vital for maintaining your sex hormone balance, any interruption in their function can impair your fertility. I'll discuss the roles your brain and pituitary gland serve in much greater detail in Chapter 8. Surgeries If you have no sperm in your semen (azospermia), but have normally sized testicles and normal hormone levels, you probably have blockage in the ducts between your testicles and your penis. If a hernia repair or lower abdominal surgery is part of your medical history, I'd be suspicious that you had an accidental vasectomy (severing of the vas deferens or duct coming from the testis during surgery). I remember one man who was quite surprised when I told him that a hernia repair he had when he was six years old caused his fertility problem. After microsurgery to reverse the accidental vasectomy, his sperm count came up to 40 million. Skilled surgeons can reverse both accidental and elective vasectomies 90 percent of the time if the reversal is performed within ten years of the vasectomy. Chapter 8 will tell you how this surgery can be done with such precision. I also need to know if you've incurred nerve damage from a colon resection. This injury can cause both erection and ejaculation problems. If you've had bladder or prostate surgery, you may suffer from retrograde ejaculation. This condition causes you to ejaculate into your bladder instead of out your penis. You can read more about how we manage this problem in Chapter 8. If you've had surgery for the removal of an adrenal, scrotal, or pituitary tumor, I may suspect an endocrine (hormone) imbalance. Once they're correctly diagnosed, hormonal deficiencies often respond well to hormone replacement therapy. The diagnostic procedures and treatment regimens I use for hormonal problems are detailed in the next chapter. Medications We know that certain medications lower fertility by depressing sperm production or impairing sexual performance. For example, if you take high blood pressure medication (antihypertensives) such as reserpine, methyldopa, and guanethidine; or if you consume alcohol or narcotics, you may have difficulty maintaining an erection and suffer from ejaculation failure. In addition, these drugs can lower your sex drive. Hypertension is often treated with medications called calcium-channel blockers (Captopril, Vasotec, nifedipine). These medications appear to effect the ability of the sperm to bind to and fertilize the egg. Cytotoxic drugs, anabolic steroids, cimetidine (Tagamet for ulcers), sulfasalazine, spironolactone, opiates, and colchicine all may cause depressed sperm production. We also know that antimalarials, tetracycline, amebicides, nitrofurantoin (for bladder infections), propranolol (Inderal), and barbiturates may cause fertility problems. If you take methotrexate for psoriasis or cancer, you may even suffer irreversible germ cell damage in your testes. Many of the drugs I've mentioned are generic; that is, they are the names for the basic chemical compounds. You can check to see if the medication you're taking contains any of these compounds by looking in the Physician's Desk Reference at your library or by asking your doctor. Often by simply altering your medication your doctor can restore your fertility. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer may have irreversible effects on fertility. However, if some of your testicular germ cells remain intact, your sperm production may resume when treatment stops. Since every case is individual, you should check with your doctor about your particular situation. Your Sexual History Sexual Development I also need to know about your sexual development. For example, if you had undescended testes, I need to know if and when you underwent surgery to correct the problem. If you had the surgery before you were six, your testes may be fine. Otherwise, cellular damage that impairs sperm production may have occurred. It's also helpful for me to know if you went through puberty exceptionally early or late (the normal range is nine to sixteen). Sometimes this clues me in to hormone problems. Sexual Performance If you have difficulty getting and maintaining an erection, I want to check your general health, your nervous system, your hormone levels, and your exposure to toxic chemicals or medications. Any one of these factors can cause physical impotence. if necessary, your doctor may want a second opinion from a psychologist, neurologist, or psychiatrist. I'll discuss more about treating impotence and erection problems in Chapter 8. If you become too excited and almost always ejaculate before inserting your penis into your wife's vagina, you'll never get your sperm into her cervix. And you both will be pretty frustrated with your sexual life. Premature ejaculation can often be solved by using the sexual techniques and positions I describe in Chapter 8. I also need to know how often you have sex and what techniques you use. One of my patients told me, for example, that his father had advised him to have sex three times a day. While this "prescription" for pregnancy may sound reasonable, it actually lowered my patient's fertility potential. He could not possibly make enough sperm that frequently. It's also helpful for me to know if you've previously fathered a child, or if your wife has had an abortion or miscarriage during her partnership with you. With this information I can establish that you were fertile at one time and begin looking for problems that developed since then. Repeated miscarriages also alert me to the possibility of a genetic problem with either the man or woman. Your Family History Since fertility problems often run in families, I need to know if your mother, father, brothers, or sisters have encountered any difficulties. For example, if your mother had a history of repeated miscarriages when she was pregnant with you, she may have taken a drug called DES. Knowing whether or not you were exposed to DES could help me determine if you're suffering from DES-caused testicular abnormalities. I also need to know if your family has a history of hormonal problems such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, or adrenal gland malfunctions. Adding your family history to other clues may help me decide on which areas to investigate more closely. Steps for Evaluating Male Fertility Your doctor will recommend doing a semen analysis and postcoital test. If these are normal, the doctor's focus will shift toward detecting problems with your wife. If your semen analysis reveals abnormalities, however, your doctor will perform a physical examination and various laboratory tests on you. Your doctor will use the results of your abnormal semen analysis and postcoital test (both discussed in chapter 6), to guide the rest of the investigation into your fertility problem. The following discussion will help you understand what procedures and tests are available and when they should be used. Oligospermia (fewer than 20 million sperm per milliliter) If your sperm count shows a concentration lower than 20 million sperm per milliliter, I'll first try to eliminate toxic substances or recent illnesses as possible causes. If your history or life-style does not provide any clues, I will examine your scrotum to determine if your testicular size is normal. Under-developed testicles may be caused by a number of problems which I discuss in detail later. I will also look for the presence of a varicocoele (varicose vein in the scrotum), which may be impairing your sperm production. See chapter 8 for a complete discussion of varicocoeles. If I find a stress pattern in your semen analysis (low count, poor morphology, and low motility), I'll order blood tests to determine your hormone levels. And if I suspect a genetic problem such as Klinefelter's syndrome, I may recommend checking your chromosomes (karyotyping). chapter 8 describes in detail what these tests will reveal and the treatment regimens available for improving sperm production. If you do not respond to treatment for oligospermia, you are a prime candidate for artificial insemination with your own sperm (AIH) or in vitro fertilization, in which a surgeon retrieves your wife's eggs (ova) and uses your sperm to fertilize them in a petri dish. The fertilized egg (embryo) is then transferred to your wife's uterus in the hope that it will implant and develop into a baby. The first in vitro "miracle baby" was born less than ten years ago. Now in the United States alone over one hundred clinics offer these services. I'll discuss in vitro fertilization and many other technologically advanced options in later chapters. Severe Oligospermia (fewer than 10 million sperm per Milliliter) If your semen analysis shows fewer than 10 million sperm per milliliter, I will check your hormone levels and the size of your testicles. I'll measure your FSH hormone level to determine if your pituitary gland is stimulating your testes to make sperm. If FSH is elevated (indicating testicular failure) and you are not making sperm, the odds of improving your underlying condition are bleak, although in vitro fertilization may work. If I find that your hormones are deficient and your testicles are small, hormone replacement therapy may help you develop normal testicular function. When your sperm concentration is this low, I may also recommend that a urologist perform a testicular biopsy, which will tell me the condition of your testes at the cellular level. I need to know if your germ cells are dividing and producing immature sperm cells. I also want to know if you have Sertoli, or nurse, cells to shepherd and nurture the immature sperm cells through their five or so stages of maturation. The biopsy will also tell me if your Leydig cells are capable of producing testosterone (male hormone), which is vital for sexual performance and sperm development. I can also see if your testicular (seminiferous) tubules are intact. If the biopsy reveals that your testicular structures are irreversibly damaged, I probably cannot do anything to improve your sperm production. If the biopsy shows me that your testes are understimulated by hormones, I can prescribe replacement hormones, which may initiate testicular development and establish spermatogenesis. If the biopsy shows me that your testes are normal, then I know that your vas deferens (tube leading from your testicles toward your penis) is partially blocked. Microsurgery may be able to restore the path. Chapter 8 will tell you what can cause these problems and the treatments available to improve oligospermia. Azospermia I evaluate azospermia, the condition in which the semen contains no sperm, the same way I evaluate severe oligospermia. However, in addition to performing the tests I do for a severely oligospermic man, I will also test your semen to see if it coagulates and if it contains fructose (sugar). (Azospermic men usually do have semen, because sperm and semen are made in different organs.) Your seminal vesicles make fructose and the chemicals that cause your semen to coagulate. If you were born without seminal vesicles or if your ejaculatory duct is blocked, your semen will not coagulate. I may also examine your urine after ejaculation to see if you have retrograde ejaculation. An ultrasound examination may show a blockage of the ejaculatory ducts where they enter the prostate. Chapter 8 tells you more about the procedures used to manage these problems. When Do You Need a Vasogram or Testicular Biopsy? Vasograms (X rays of your ducts) and biopsies of your testicles may damage delicate genital structures. Therefore, your doctor should exhaust all other measures before using these more invasive diagnostic procedures. With less invasive tests, such as an ultrasound of the prostate, I can predict pretty well whether or not you have an obstruction. However, I may need to order an X ray to determine where an obstruction or absent tubal structure exists. This procedure is usually performed under anesthesia at the same time that you are prepared for corrective surgery. When a Testicular Biopsy Can Be Helpful If you have severe oligospermia or azospermia; low or normal FSH levels; and do not respond to hormone replacement therapy. If you are azospermic; have normal hormone levels and normal testicular size. Interpreting Testicular Biopsy Findings If you are azospermic and have a normal testes biopsy, you definitely have a tubal blockage. (See Chapter 8 for a complete discussion of tubal blockage and corrective techniques.) If you are oligospermic because your testes are performing at an abnormally slow rate, you have hypospermatogenesis. If you are azospermic because your testes cannot complete the sperm maturation process, you have maturation arrest. Hypospermatogenesis If the biopsy finds hypospermatogenesis (perhaps a phase of maturation arrest), you will show diminished germ (germination) cell activity and marked germ cell loss. Since the germ cells are the precursors of sperm, you will produce low numbers of sperm or no sperm at all. Chemical toxins, drugs, and varicocoeles may cause hypospermatogenesis. Maturation Arrest With maturation arrest, one of the most frequent biopsy findings in male fertility, your germ cells divide and produce early sperm forms, and other testicular structures will appear normal. At one stage in their maturation, however, sperm development halts throughout all your testicular tubules. The condition may be complete (azospermic) or partial (oligospermic). Chemical toxins, drugs, and varicocoeles may cause maturation arrest. If your FSH level is high, indicating severe testicular damage, it may be too late for treatment. However, things are brighter if your FSH level is low or normal. Removing the toxins and/or repairing your varicocoele will often restore spermatogenesis.

Could you clarify the current thinking for us?" the RESOLVE leader asked. "The first part of the male formula is what I call pretesticular function. This means that your hormone system must be functioning properly in order to stimulate your testicles to make sperm. "The second ingredient I call the testicular component. This means that when stimulated by your sex hormones, your testicles must be capable of producing sperm. Testicles can be congenitally deformed or they can be damaged by chemical toxins, illness, systemic disease, or trauma." I saw Steven S.'s hand go up. "Yes, Steven?" "But I thought your testicles made your sex hormones. If your testicles aren't working, how can your hormones be stimulating them?" "Your testicles do produce the male hormone testosterone. However, your brain and your pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain, produce chemicals that tell your testicles when to make testosterone and when to make sperm. Without these signals from your brain and pituitary, your testicles may fail to mature and fail to make sperm. "The third ingredient of the male fertility formula is posttesticular function. The ducts leading from your sperm-producing testicles must provide a clear and continuous path for your sperm to travel out of your penis. Congenital tubal defects, surgeries, and blockage from infections may clog up these pathways." "What can be done for blocked tubes?" Michael T. asked. "Today with the aid of microsurgery, most tubal problems can be corrected, including vasectomy reversals." I turned to the chalkboard and wrote down the fourth factor, ejaculatory disturbances, impotence, and sexualproblems . "These are the final ingredients of the male fertility formula," I said. "You must be able to deliver your sperm to your wife's cervix in order to make a baby." I set the chalk in the tray and turned back toward the group. "There are some exceptions to this. Some delivery problems can be overcome with artificial insemination. For example, some men ejaculate backward into the bladder. When this happens, we can retrieve the ejaculated sperm and use artificial insemination techniques to get the sperm to their destination." "What if the man can't perform?" a woman across the room asked. "There are two types of sexual performance problems�physiological impotence and psychological impotence. Often it's difficult to separate the two, since men with impaired sexual performance frequently have psychological problems regardless of the source of their difficulty. Physiological impotence may be caused by toxic chemicals, hormone deficiencies, "street" drugs, medications, and nerve damage, for example. A complete fertility evaluation should reveal the source of the problem. And even with physiological impotence, counseling may be needed to ease the difficulties associated with inadequate sexual performance. "These are the four ingredients necessary for male fertility." I started toward my chair. "If any one of them is out of order, you may have a fertility problem. Working together, you and your physician must identify the deficient factor and direct treatment toward improving that function." Male Fertility: How It Works The Male Hormone System The Hypothalamus and Pituitary Start the Action Approximately every ninety minutes a specialized area in your brain (hypothalamus) secretes GnRH (gonadotropic-releasing hormone). GnRH signals your pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain, to produce LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). LH tells your testes to secrete the male hormone testosterone. Testosterone stimulates your sexual desires and develops and maintains your male secondary sex characteristics such as hair growth and deep voice. Together, testosterone and FSH stimulate your testes to produce sperm (spermatogenesis). Your body's ability to make and regulate these hormones is vital for maintaining your virility and sperm production. Feedback Hormones from Your Testicles You have feedback hormones�testosterone and inhibin�that keep a check and balance on your GnRH, LH, and FSH levels. Once the Leydig cells in your testicles produce enough testosterone, your hormone control 00 systems cut back on GnRH and LH production. When the Sertoli cells, which respond to FSH stimulation, produce enough inhibin, the pituitary cuts back FSH production. Examining figure 8-1 will help you visualize your fertility hormone control system. These relationships will become more clear in the discussions that follow. The Stages of Sperm Production Cell Division Each day your testicles make millions of sperm. Your testicles are composed of a number of different types of cells which support and surround masses of microscopic seminiferous tubules. Your sperm grow and mature within these tubules. The germ cells (germinal cells or basic sperm cell factories) line these tubule walls. When they are stimulated by the Sertoli cells, the germ cells divide (mitosis) to produce one primary spermatocyte that contains a full complement of your forty-six chromosomes (genetic material). The germ cells remain intact to divide repeatedly throughout your reproductive life. The primary spermatocytes, containing forty-six chromosomes, however, proceed to divide by a special process called meiosis. Meiosis produces four spermatids (immature sperm) containing twentythree chromosomes each. These spermatids are destined to fertilize your wife's egg, containing twenty-three of her chromosomes. At this point cell division ends and the sperm maturation process begins. Sperm Maturation The spermatids remain attached to your tubule wall, where they are nurtured by the Sertoli, or nurse, cells. It takes about ninety days for the sperm to grow, mature, and travel through the tubules to a central storage area called the epididymis. Here the sperm become powerful swimmers. After each ejaculation, it takes about forty hours for your epididymis to refill with mature sperm (this is why too-frequent intercourse can impair fertility). Each microscopic sperm carries all the genetic information necessary to fertilize the egg. Half of your sperm carry an X chromosome (inherited from your mother) and half carry a Y chromosome (inherited from your father). If an X-carrying sperm fertilizes your wife's egg (ovum), you'll have a baby girl. If a Y-carrying sperm fertilizes the ovum, you'll have a baby boy. In this way the husband's genetic contribution determines the baby's sex. The Sperm Delivery System When you ejaculate, your sperm rush through a number of channels between your epididymis and the opening of your penis. (You can view the course that your sperm travel during ejaculation in figure 8-2 below.) At the moment of ejaculation, your epididymis expels the sperm into the pulsating muscular walls of your vas deferens. While coursing through your vas deferens, the sperm pass the seminal vesicles. These secrete fructose (a sugar to feed your sperm), seminal fluids (to protect your sperm), and a chemical that coagulates your semen soon after it enters your wife's vagina. Then your sperm speed through your ejaculatory ducts past your prostate gland, which secretes additional seminal fluids, including a chemical that liquefies your coagulated semen within an hour after ejaculation. As your semen (sperm plus your seminal fluids) rushes past the bladder, a muscle (sphincter) squeezes the bladder opening shut. This guides the semen on course through your urethra and out of your penis. Erection, Orgasm, and Ejaculatlon Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation are three distinct processes controlled both by your conscious mind and by involuntary neural responses. To get sperm to your wife's cervix, all three of these processes must be working properly. Erection Erection may occur when you have an erotic thought or when your penis is touched. During an erection, nerves signal the blood vessels in your erectile tissue to dilate and become engorged, and your penis swells and becomes rigid. Friction from manual and vaginal stimulation sends more signals to the brain and stimulates orgasm and ejaculation. Psychological factors can stimulate or interfere with your erection; however, once you reach orgasm your automatic reflex actions run their course. Orgasm and Ejaculation Orgasm is the name given to the physiological and sensory thrill that accompanies ejaculation. The first stage of orgasm, called ejaculatory inevitability, occurs two to four seconds before ejaculation. During this interval you sense your imminent ejaculation and cannot continue to control the process. Your prostate gland and your seminal vesicles start to pulse. The second stage of orgasm begins when you involuntarily expel semen in several convulsive waves. Typically you ejaculate about one teaspoon of semen, which contains 40 to 150 million sperm. The first squirt (semen fraction) generally contains the largest number of sperm. After orgasm, most men and many women experience a recovery (refractory) period during which they cannot have another orgasm. This period may last many minutes and sometimes several hours. You may also experience an erection refractory period. As I discuss the various causes of male fertility problems, the statistics in table 8-1 will help you place each condition into proper perspective.

In the rest of this chapter I will describe how each of the four fertility factors may malfunction, how specific disorders can be diagnosed, and how they can be corrected. Fertility Factor #1: The Hormone Balancing Act Several things can go wrong with your hypethalamus-pituitary endocrine system: Your brain can fail to pulse GnRH properly. Your pituitary can fail to produce enough LH and FSH to stimulate your testes. Your testes' Leydig cells may not produce testosterone in response to LH (pituitary) stimulation. Your body may produce other hormones and chemical compounds which interfere with your sex-hormone balance. Any one of these conditions can impair your sperm production. To help you understand the treatment for these hormonal disorders, I'd like to explain what medications are available and how they are prescribed to improve male fertility. An Overview of Hormonal Treatment If your pituitary hormones (LH and FSH) are low, but you do have a working hypothalamus and pituitary gland, clomiphene citrate (Serophene, Clomid) should stimulate your hypothalamus to pulse GnRH at regular intervals. When your hypothalamus properly releases GnRH, your pituitary gland will respond by producing LH and FSH. If Serophene does not improve LH and FSH levels, then I will suspect that your pituitary gland may be malfunctioning. (Since Serophene is an oral medication, it is more convenient and less expensive than your other options.) If your pituitary cannot manufacture the missing sex hormones, you can take hormone supplements. Injections of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) will increase your LH supply and often stimulate your testes to produce testosterone and sperm. If your response to hCG is inadequate, I might add Pergonal (FSH and LH) to stimulate sperm production. Pergonal and hCG treatments can be quite expensive, since they require regularly repeated injections. If these treatment regimens are successful, sperm production and quality will begin to improve within three to four months. Diagnosing and Beating Specific Horrnonal Problems Hyperprolactinemia Hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin) can be difficult to diagnose because your FSH, LH, and testosterone levels will be normal. We find elevated prolactin, a hormone associated with nursing mothers, in 10 to 40 percent of infertile males. Mild prolactin elevation produces no symptoms; however, greater elevations can reduce sperm production, impair your sex drive, and cause impotence. Hyperprolactinemia responds well to a drug called Parlodel (bromocriptine). A prolactin-secreting tumor will also respond to Parlodel; however, surgery and/or radiation therapy may be necessary. Hypothyroidism Found in 1 percent of infertile men, hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone) can cause poor semen quality, poor testicular function, and/or disturbances in sex drive. You will be lethargic, intolerant of cold, and overweight. Because the pituitary gland is trying its best to stimulate your unresponsive thyroid gland, your pituitary-produced TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level will be elevated. Elevated prolactin levels, frequently found with this disorder, may cause impotence. You can sometimes bring on hypothyroidism by eating a diet high in iodine�for example, kelp or seaweed�or taking multimineral tablets. Chronic ingestion of iodides in cough syrups (formerly used in treating asthmatic bronchitis) may also produce these symptoms. In addition, hypothyroidism may be caused by radioactive thyroid medications and autoimmune diseases. Correcting your diet or beginning thyroid hormone replacement therapy should elevate your sperm count to previous levels. I must emphasize that unless you have low thyroid, thyroid hormone replacement therapy will not improve your sperm quality. Stress and Excessive Exercise When a woman is under a great deal of stress, we can use Serophene to regulate the GnRH pulses from her hypothalamus and restore ovulation. It seems logical to assume that Serophene may help a man in the same situation. Although we don't know the therapeutic effects for certain, I have observed some semen improvement when Serophene has been used with these men. I especially remember Ted M., who was the typical "Type A" personality. Ted had a borderline sperm count, smoked five packs of cigarettes and drank ten cups of coffee a day, and was a workaholic. I prescribed Serophene and also counseled with him about restructuring his habits. With some help from his friends in RESOLVE, Ted began a moderate exercise program and got his nicotine and caffeine habits under control. Within five months his count began improving and a year later he fathered a child. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Pound in 1 percent of infertile males, congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be suspected when a semen analysis shows a low sperm count, an increased number of immature sperm cells, sperm with long tapered heads, and low motility. These abnormalities occur when the pituitary is suppressed by increased levels of adrenal androgens. Men with this disease may also have hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (water retention). Early onset of the disease may result in ambiguous genitalia at birth or reaching puberty at an early age. Adult onset may be characterized by infertility, high blood pressure, and/or water retention. Cortisone replacement therapy will lower your androgens and allow your pituitary to function normally. Therefore, indirectly, cortisone replacement therapy will elevate your sperm count. Some of these situations are not so easily managed. One time I had the unfortunate job of counseling one of my bearded male patients who was genetically a she. Because the adrenal androgens (male hormones) had dominated this person's hormonal system since before birth, male secondary sex characteristics developed. Fortunately this finding is quite rare. Hypogonadotropic Hypopituitarism Hypogonadotropic hypopituitarism is a spectrum of diseases with a complicated name that means low (hypo-) pituitary gland output of LH and FSH. Other stages of this disease are called isolated gonadotropin defect and panhypopituitarism, in which the entire (pan-) pituitary gland is affected. These diseases arrest sperm development and cause the progressive loss of germ cells from the testes. In addition, the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells (which produce testosterone) also deteriorate. If the condition persists for a long time, you will have no sperm production at all. (See chapter 7 for a discussion of maturation arrest.) When the disease is associated with a pituitary tumor, elevated prolactin levels may also cause impotence. Clifford J. showed signs typical of this progressive degeneration. Over a period of three to four years he gradually lost his heavy beard, became less interested in sex, and eventually could not sustain an erection. His blood tests revealed low LH, FSH, and testosterone levels, and his sperm count was 10 million per milliliter. I prescribed Serophene in hopes of improving his sperm count and sexual performance. Fortunately he responded to the drug, and six months later his sperm count increased to 18 million. After performing AIH four times, his wife became pregnant. Following fertility treatment, I discontinued the Serophene (it's too expensive to take all of the time) and continued giving him a testosterone supplement to maintain his virility and sexual performance. Panhypopituitafism Complete pituitary gland failure (panhypopituitarism) lowers your growth hormone, ACTH level, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and LH and FSH levels. If you have this rare disease, you will have multiple symptoms that include impotence, decreased sex drive, loss of secondary sex characteristics, and normal or undersized testicles. Your hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone) will cause you to gain weight, be intolerant of cold, and feel lethargic. If the disorder began early enough in your life, you may even be a dwarf. The hormonal deficiency is often caused by a tumor, surgery, or trauma to the pituitary gland. No amount of stimulation can improve the performance of the damaged pituitary gland, so I will work with an endocrinologist to supplement the missing pituitary hormones. The thyroid hormone supplement as well as other hormone replacements will restore general health and vigor. At that point I administer hCG to stimulate the testicles to produce testosterone and to begin making sperm. Kallman's Syndrome Kallman's syndrome is a congenital hypothalamic dysfunction. If you are born with this unusual condition, you will have underdeveloped testicles and possibly a harelip, cleft palate, color blindness, and/or the inability to smell. Affected men have varying degrees of sexual infantilism (prepuberty) and no sperm production. Since the hypothalamus fails to stimulate the pituitary adequately, FSH, LH, and testosterone levels are low. I treat Kallman's syndrome similarly to hypogonadotropic hypopituitarism. Although at first it seems hopeless, men afflicted with Kallman's syndrome can achieve normal puberty and eventually become fertile. Delayed Puberty Individuals with isolated pituitary growth hormone deficiency do not sexually mature until their mid to late twenties. Hormone supplements can make them look virile, but until they go through puberty, they won't be fertile. Pergonal and/or hCG injections can bring on puberty, although if left alone, sexual maturity and fertility will be achieved in time. Fertile Eunuch If you have this rare disorder, your virilization (acquisition of adult sex characteristics) will be moderately advanced, but you will not have completed sexual maturation and testicular growth. If I biopsied your rather small testicles (a procedure not usually needed to diagnose this condition), I'd find evidence of sperm production and thus the potential for fertility. Since the arrest of sperm production and low testosterone levels are caused by an LH deficiency, administering hCG will raise both hormone levels and stimulate sperm production. Fertility Factor #2 Treating Unresponsive Testlcles What Causes Testicular Failure? Let's suppose that your hypothalamus and pituitary are working well. The fact is that some conditions prevent your testicles from responding to pituitary hormone stimulation. Testicular failure, as it's called, can be caused by genetic abnormalities or by damage from drugs, injury, radiation, excess heat, adult mumps, a varicocoele, or toxins from your environment. Sensing abnormal testicular function, your brain responds by telling your pituitary to pump out more FSH to stimulate sperm production. In fact, elevated FSH is the primary diagnostic indicator for testicular failure. Unfortunately there isn't much that can be done for primary testicular failure, which is caused by a genetic mistake. The malformed testes are unable to produce sperm and no amount of stimulation will improve their function. However, if you have this problem, you and your wife need not go childless. You are a prime candidate for artificial insemination with donor sperm (AID). With AID your baby will inherit your wife's genes and traits and will be your own through your marital bonds and love. I'll talk more about AID techniques in a later chapter. We have a better chance of treating secondary testicular failure (acquired damage). If, before too much testicular damage occurs, you discontinue potentially harmful medications and illicit drugs; avoid contact with toxic substances such as pesticides; reduce excess heat exposure; or have a varicocoele surgically repaired, you may once again produce sperm. Below is a discussion of what causes testicular failure and the methods available for improving fertility. Varicocoele When I examined Steven S., I could see his varicocoele as I crossed the room: "Steven, see these veins crisscrossing over the left side of your scrotum?" He leaned over for a better view. "Oh, those. I've had those for years. They never give me any trouble." "They're called a varicocoele�a varicose vein that allows blood to pool in your scrotum. It's thought that poor circulation may lead to a buildup of blood toxins or increase your scrotal temperature. Either of these conditions may result in what's called a testicular stress pattern. "The typical stress pattern shows depressed sperm production, poor sperm motility, and poor sperm morphology�which is exactly what your semen analysis showed. I also noticed that your left testicle is a bit small. That's another frequent finding with varicocoeles." "Is that why I'm infertile?" "It could be," I answered. "Forty percent of infertile men have varicocoeles." "What can you do about it?" "With some men I'd try artificial insemination with their sperm. If that didn't work, I d get a second opinion from a urologic surgeon. There is some evidence that repairing the vein may improve your chances of having a baby to at least fifty-fifty. However, with your 15 million count and 20 percent motility and few normal sperm, it's my guess your chances for AIH working aren't very good. "I'd like you to see a urologic surgeon. You should know, however, that 10 percent of normally fertile men have varicocoeles. So there are no guarantees that the varicocoele is causing your marginal count or that repairing it will improve your fertility." A varicocoele is a dilation of the veins that carry blood out of your scrotum. The bulging veins cannot support the column of blood returning to your circulatory system, so your blood pools in the swollen vessels surrounding your testicles. Because of the venous structure, varicocoeles usually occur on your left side. How they cause infertility is unknown, but it is speculated that poor circulation (toxic buildup) and/or higher scrotal heat from pooling blood may be factors. Two-thirds of the infertile men who have a varicocoele also have reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology. The semen will contain large numbers of sperm with tapered heads and many immature spermatids. If these findings are coupled with smaller than normal testicular size, you probably have a varicocoele. A pronounced varicocoele feels like a "bag of worms" in the scrotum. Your doctor may find a less obvious varicocoele by having you bend over and exert a downward pressure as though you are forcing a bowel movement. The pressure will force the veins to bulge out. Other tests used to diagnose varicocoele include the Doppler stethoscope (ultrasound) and thermography (thermal detection methods). If the temperature difference between one side of your scrotum and the other is significant, you probably have a varicocoele. Unfortunately the instruments and techniques used to measure this small temperature difference have not been perfected. These diagnostic procedures are not painful and are relatively inexpensive. Varicocoele treatment Corrective surgery is not always necessary because laboratory techniques for improving semen quality may provide an adequate sample for intrauterine insemination. For example, your semen can be collected, concentrated, and washed for artificial insemination (AIH). Varicocoele repair is one of the primary methods used to improve sperm motility and concentration. Surgical correction of the varicocoele will improve semen quality in 70 percent of infertile men, and 50 percent of their wives become pregnant. When the surgery works, as it did for Steven, improved sperm motility seems to be the most significant result. If you rate varicocoele surgery by improvement in semen quality, Steven's results were nominal. His count improved to 20 million and his motility to 40 percent. However, if you ask Steven and Kathy to rate his improvement by the final results�a delightful baby girl�they would say the surgery was 100 percent successful. Undescended Testicles (Cryptorchidism) Undescended testicles occur in 8 out of 1,000 boys. Since some testicles descend during the first year, making a diagnosis before one year of age is difficult. If only one testicle is affected, fertility will not be compromised. However, there's a 20 percent increased incidence of cancer in the normal testicle. (Normal risk for testicular cancer is 8 in 100,000 men.) If the undescended testicles are surgically lowered before age six, normal fertility will be preserved. If the repair is done after age six, however, irreversible damage to the seminiferous tubules will cause infertility. These men will appear virile, but they have a forty to fifty times greater risk of developing testicular cancer. Infection Mumps, tuberculosis, brucellosis, gonorrhea, typhoid, influenza, smallpox, and syphilis can cause your testes to atrophy. With some of these infections your LH and testosterone (virility) levels may remain normal. However, if your FSH is high, as in Pete B.'s case, the prognosis for testicular recovery is poor. When he was seventeen, Pete B., the son of one of my patients, caught the mumps from his little brother. Both testes were affected, one side more than the other. When I saw him in his early twenties, Pete had scanty pubic hair and complained about having no sex drive. His semen analysis showed a sperm count of 10 million, with 30 percent motility, and his FSH was elevated. Together this evidence told me that Pete had suffered extensive testicular damage. To relieve his immediate concerns about his manliness I prescribed testosterone replacement to restore his virility. Bolstered by his newfound sexual abilities, he married and soon returned for fertility counseling. Since Pete's count was so low I suggested they first try AIH. "If AIH doesn't work within four or five cycles, in vitro fertilization will give you a good chance for a baby." I have to give them credit. They stuck with the AIH regimen for five tries. It was worth it: Pete has a cute red-haired, green-eyed baby girl who's got him wrapped around her little finger. And Grandmother shows me her pictures every time she comes in for an appointment. Torsion Torsion of the testis and/or blood vessels supplying the testis (spermatic cord) is a common problem that threatens fertility. Torsion is caused by a supportive tissue abnormality which allows the testis to twist inside your scrotum, causing extreme pain and swelling. When your gonad rotates, the attached blood vessels entwine like the ropes on a swing and pinch shut the blood supply. Within a few hours cellular degeneration from impaired blood flow begins to take its toll. The amount of cellular damage varies with the degree of torsion; however, emergency surgery must be performed to prevent further damage. Due to rapid growth of the body during puberty, torsion seems to occur most frequently at that age. If you have torsion on one side, you have a 40 percent chance of having torsion on the other side, too. Consequently the surgeon should secure the unaffected testis to prevent subsequent trauma. When the deteriorated testis is left in place, damage is often induced in the unaffected testis. Studies suggest that removing the damaged testis may help preserve full function and fertility of the remaining one. Trauma Severe injury to your testicles requires prompt intervention to avoid tissue loss. If you have marked swelling and pain, a surgeon should explore your scrotum and make needed repairs. When required, a surgeon can drain a clot o f blood from the scrotum (scrotal hemotoma) or repair a testicular rupture. Klinefelter's Syndrome Each cell in a normal man's body has only one Y. (male) and ones (female) Chromosome People with Klinefelter's syndrome, however, haveene Y and two X chromosomes in each cell. On examination I will find pxnut-sized testes and enlarged breasts. A chromosome analysis (karyotypinx will confiirm this diagnosis. In the beginning stages of this rare disorder your FSH is oly slightly e levated, indicating minimal testicular failure. Administration of hCG at this Stage may improve sperm production. However, eventually all othe active testicular structures will atrophy, including germ cells, tubules, Lydig cells, abnd Sertoli cells; the testes themselves actually shrink. After testialar failure Occurs (causing FSH levels to rise dramatically), improving fertilit is impossiible. However, these people can still have children by usig artificial insemination with donor sperm. Cushing's Syndrome Cushing's syndrome occurs when the adrenal gland secretezexcessive amounts of cortisol. People with this rare disorder will have a moon-shaped face and will suffer from water retention, obesity, impotence, feminized characteristics, loss of sex drive, and infertility. The condition me be due to an adrenal tumor or to excessive stimulation of the adrenal gland by ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) from the pituitary. If ACTH is high either the pituitary is overactive or an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumo ris present (called Cushing's disease). Elevated adrenal androgens suppress LH and FSH production ad spermattogenesis. Cortisone replacement therapy will reduce cortisol levels and restore natural LH, FSH, and sperm production. If a tumor s present, surgery and/or radiation therapy is required. Germ Cell Aplasia (Sertoli Cell Only) Germ cell aplasia (Sertoli cell only) is an inherited condition. The testicular biopsy will show that the slightly small testes have normal Leydg cells, no germ cells, and narrow tubules. Because their Leydig cells ontinue to lproduce testosterone, these men remain virile, but they can't produce sperm. Germ cell aplasia can also be caused by exposure to large doses of radiation and prolonged exposure to toxic substances. Once the damage is complete, no therapy is available. To couples facing this diagnosis, I usully suggest artificial insemination with donor sperm or adoption. Testicular Enzyme Defects Testicular enzyme defects prevent the testes from responding normally to hormonal stimulation. These rare genetic defects can cause muliple genital aabnormalities, incomplete virilization, small testes, and low o no sperm production. LH and FSH will both be high, since the brain is doing its best to stimulate the unresponsive testicles. Providing some sperm production still exists, AIH or in vitro fertilization may lead to pregnancy. Fertility Factor #3: Repairing Sperm Ducts Seven percent of infertile men cannot transport sperm from their testicles out of their penis. The path from each of your testicles to your penis may be interrupted by a number of conditions: A genetic or developmental mistake may cause blockage and/or the absence of one or both tubes (vasa). Scarring from tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia may block your epididymis or tubes. An elective or accidental vasectomy (severing of the vasa) may interrupt tube continuity. I usually suspect an obstruction when you have normal-sized testes and normal hormone levels but fewer than I million sperm per milliliter of ejaculate. If you have a partial obstruction, your sperm count and motility will be low and you will have an increased percentage of abnormal sperm morphology. Complete obstruction results in the total absence of sperm and, depending on the location of the obstruction, possibly the absence of semen. Twenty-five percent of azospermic men have duct obstructions. Unfortunately, if you're missing large sections of the vas, surgical repair is impossible. If I suspect an obstruction, I will order an ultrasound or X ray of your tubes to locate the exact position of the obstruction or missing section. If the ultrasound is normal, testicular biopsy, X ray and repair may be necessary. Surgical repair is usually performed at the same time as the X ray, since both require general anesthesia. I'd like to describe each type of transport problem and tell you how they are diagnosed and corrected. Advanced reproductive techniques such as epidymal sperm aspiration (removing sperm from the epididymis) and ICSI (direct injection into eggs retrieved by IVF) results in pregnancy rates between 25 and 30%. Voluntary or Accidental Vasectomy Voluntary vasectomy (surgical dissection of both vasa deferentia for birth control) is the most common posttesticular cause of fertility loss. A vasectomy may also occur accidentally as a complication of traumatic injury, scrotal surgery, and lower abdominal surgery such as a hernia repair. Infection and Disease Chronic active prostatitis and gonococcal or tuberculosis infections can cause scarring and tubal blockage. I suspect these diseases if you have difficulty voiding, show a urethral discharge, or have a painful and enlarged prostate gland on rectal examination. The tail of the epididymis at its junction with the vas deferens is the usual site of this type of obstruction. The seminal vesicles, prostate, and ejaculatory ducts may also be involved. Azospermic men with acquired obstruction usually have fructose in their seminal fluid and normal FSH levels, indicating that the seminal vesicles and testes are intact and functional. If I have any doubts about my diagnosis, I'll order a testicular biopsy to confirm normal sperm production. Performing microsurgery to repair the epididymis is tedious, but the 50 to 70 percent success rate approaches that of vasectomy reversals. Cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease occurring in I out of 2,500 live births, may also cause low sperm counts, diminished semen volume, or the congenital absence of the vas deferens. Congenital Obstruction Congenital abnormalities account for approximately 2 percent of male fertility problems. Frequently the blockage will be located at the anatomical junction between your vas and your epididymis. If fructose is absent from your seminal fluid, I suspect congenital absence of both the vasa and seminal vesicles or a rare obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts. Congenital malformations are frequently difficult to overcome, since many times long sections of both vasa may be absent. These require microsurgical retrieval of sperm from the epididymis or testicle and direct injection into the egg. I remember one unusual situation involving a couple in their mid-twenties. Jess H.'s semen analysis showed no sperm at all. On his history form he indicated that his mother had taken DES to prevent miscarriage. Because I suspected blockage from the usage of this drug while he was in utero, I referred him to a urologic microsurgeon for X rays and a biopsy. In the meantime I completed a fertility workup on his wife and confirmed that she was fertile. (It wouldn't make much sense for them to pay for expensive microsurgery on him if she had a serious fertility problem.) Jess's X ray showed blockage at the epididymis on both sides, so the surgeon repaired the tubes. After several months Jess's semen analysis showed marked improvement. Vasectomy Reversal and Surgical Repair for Obstruction Today more and more men want vasectomy reversals. Often they find themselves divorcing and remarrying in midlife and then wanting to begin a Wg new family. Fortunately, if your reversal is performed within ten years of the original vasectomy, you have a 70 to 90 percent chance of restoring your fertility. After ten years the prolonged pressure buildup from sperm in your epididymis may "blow out" holes in the epididymis wall. These ruptures can be difficult to correct. In addition, you may begin to form antibodies against your own sperm. Later I'll discuss the adverse affects of sperm antibodies in greater detail. |Vasectomy reversal and tubal repairs are complicated by the fact that the vas has a thick, tough muscular wall with a pencil-lead-sized opening (lumen) | inside the tube. Pressure from sperm production tends to swell or enlarge the | portion of the tube attached to the epididymis. Thus the lumen will be larger in diameter than the detached tube leading to the penis. Fitting the two ends together can be tedious, but gentle dilation of the smaller tube and microsurgical techniques seem to work well. Fertility Factor #4: How We Correct Ejaculatory Disturbances Impotence You are impotent if you are unable to maintain an erection and ejaculate during sex. Organic impotence differs from psychological impotence in that with organic impotence your body cannot respond because of insufficient hormone stimulation, incomplete nerve paths, and/or insufficient reproductive organ development. Some people have always been impotent (primary impotence) and others may develop impotence later in life as a result of surgery, injury, or an illness. Determining the cause of impotence is not as straightforward as one would like because many men who suffer from organic impotence may also have a number of psychological problems stemming from their inability to perform sexually. Impotence can be caused by diseases such as prostatitis, diabetes, and kidney failure and by neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and spinal injuries. Impotence may also be caused by pelvic surgery, including kidney transplant, prostate, and bladder surgery. Hormone imbalances such as elevated prolactin and low testosterone levels can also decrease sex drive and cause impotence. Many drugs and medications such as antihypertensives, anti-depressants, alcohol, and narcotics have been linked with impotence. Men with organic impotence have few if any erections during their sleep. You can confirm if you have organic impotence by monitoring your nocturnal erections for several nights. You can do this with an expensive overnight at home more simply with my "trading stamp procedure." Just before going to bed moisten a short strip of trading stamps and stick them in a circle around the center of your penis. Make sure the ends of the strip overlap and the stamps glue together securely. If the strip breaks during the night, you probably had a nocturnal erection. Repeat the procedure several nights in a row to make sure. If your impotence is due to a hormone imbalance and/or systemic disease, appropriate treatment may alleviate your problem. Or supplementing your testosterone to normal levels may improve your sexual desires and performance. You can overcome irreversible organic impotence with a surgical penile implant or by the use of an injection to stimulate and maintain an erection. Thousands of men use penile implants, and many of their wives report that during intercourse they cannot sense any difference from a normal erection. Nearly half of the penile implants have been used with men having diabetes, spinal cord injury, pelvic fracture, chronic renal disease, ethanolism, multiple sclerosis, or genital trauma. The implant can be bent down easily and worn in a normal position under your clothing. It is a safe and successful cure for organic impotence. However, as the injectible medications are so effective and easy to use, most men now choose this option instead of surgical implants. While a penile implant or injectible medication can improve your sex life, it will not necessarily make you fertile. If you want to father a child, you should request a complete fertility workup. Premature Ejaculation If you cannot control your ejaculatory responses for at least thirty seconds aher penetrating your wife's vagina, you may suffer from premature ejaculation. Some prefer to broaden this clinical definition: if you cannot control your ejaculatory responses for a sufficient length of time to satisfy your partner at least half of the time, you have premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation becomes a fertility problem when you ejaculate prior to inserting your penis fully into your wife's vagina. Of course you can always consider artificial insemination with your sperm. However, given a choice, most couples prefer using "natural" techniques. You can open control this condition by changing coital position and by using a behavior modification procedure called the "squeeze technique." The squeeze technique helps desensitize your penis so you can participate in sex without experiencing premature ejaculation. When using this procedure, your wife places her thumb on the frenulum on the underside of your penis. (See figure 8-2.) She places her first and second fingers on either side of the coronal ridge on the top of your penis. Squeezing her fingers together for three to four seconds in this manner will make you lose your urge to ejaculate. You may also lose some of your erection. Aher fifteen to thirty seconds your wife can stimulate your penis again and just before you ejaculate repeat the squeeze technique. If your wife is concerned about how much pressure to use, you can place your fingers over hers and press with her. This demonstration of ejaculatory control improves your self-confidence and will be a major step toward reestablishing communication and improving your marital relations. Once you've practiced this technique, you can try it with her in the female-superior coital position (wife on top). After using the squeeze technique several times, she can insert your penis into her vagina without thrusting her pelvis to stimulate you. With counseling many couples are able to establish "normal" coital patterns and pregnancy. Ejaculatory Incompetence Men with this disorder rarely have difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection; however, they cannot ejaculate during sex. Often the wife is unaware of her husband's condition because he simulates orgasm. I can detect this problem by comparing the semen analysis with the postcoital test. If your semen test is normal but there are no sperm in the cervical mucus after sex, ejaculation did not occur. This rare psychological condition sometimes responds well to behavior therapy. Ejaculation may be stimulated by combining masturbation and manual stimulation with eventual insertion into the wife's vagina. If the condition persists, you can overcome the fertility problem by using AIH with a masturbated ejaculate. Retrograde Ejaculation Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in which semen is ejaculated into the bladder rather than out through the urethra, because the bladder sphincter does not close at the moment of ejaculation. It is found in 1.5 percent of infertile men and is the most common cause of absent ejaculate. If you have this disorder, you may notice that your ejaculate volume is small (below one milliliter) and that sometimes after intercourse your urine looks turbid or cloudy. The diagnosis can be confirmed by examining a urine specimen taken soon after intercourse. If large quantities of sperm are found in your urine, retrograde ejaculation is the fertility problem. Retrograde ejaculation often occurs in diabetics, paraplegics, and men taking blood pressure medication (antihypertensives). The disorder may also occur in men with urethral stricture or men who have undergone surgical repair of their bladder, prostate, or other abdominal structures. Many times medications such as decongestants, which contract the bladder sphincter, will control retrograde ejaculation. In certain circumstances, surgical reconstruction of the bladder neck can restore normal ejaculation. Consult with your doctor to see if you are a candidate for surgical intervention. The most common fertility treatment method involves retrieving the sperm from the man's bladder and artificially inseminating his wife. This is the technique I tried with Michael and Shelley T. Since sperm cannot survive in an acid urine, I asked Michael to take one teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in a glass of water four times a day for two days prior to Shelley's most fertile time of the month. About twenty minutes prior to collecting his semen, I asked Michael to empty his bladder. After he ejaculated into a jar, I catheterized Michael to collect his semen together with a small amount of urine. I then washed the sperm and using a syringe placed the sperm into Shelley's cervix. The success rates are quite good, provided the couple can stick to the regimen. However, Shelley still did not conceive. We had some more work to do with Shelley's endometriosis. I'll discuss the procedures I used in a later chapter. Although Michael wished to avoid catheterization, this frequently provides the best specimen for AIH. I can obtain a semen sample by first asking you to void. Then I will insert a catheter through the penis into the bladder and drain any excess urine before placing a small amount of sperm nutrient media into the bladder. The man is asked to ejaculate and then voids the nutrient media into a specimen cup. The sperm are separated from this liquid, concentrated and placed into the uterus. Obtaining Semen Artificially "Normal" ejaculation may not be possible for many men who are physically impaired; for example, if they are quadriplegic. However, semen can often be obtained by artificially stimulating the man to ejaculate. Using a vibrator to stimulate his penis is a simple and often effective technique. (Some of you may not even consider this to be "artificial.") When this fails, electrical stimulation will make half of these men ejaculate, and an additional 15 percent will have retrograde ejaculation. Thirty-five to 40 percent will not ejaculate because of the pain experienced from the procedure. It's possible, however, that many of these men could ejaculate under general anesthesia. Decisions about using these options should involve the couple and their physician. Because male fertility has been shrouded in mystery, I've covered male fertility problems in much greater detail than most fertility books do. I hope that with the understanding you've gained in these chapters, you will be able to ensure that your physician is giving you the best opportunity to reach your fertility potential. When you and your wife both maximize your fertility, you have the best chance for getting your miracle baby.

Kathy's voice belied her controlled exterior. "We want a baby so badly. You're our last hope." "Kathy," I said, glancing at her history form, "tell me when your periods stopped." She sat straight and squared her shoulders. "Two years ago." I scanned the page. "You're a runner. Do you enter the Peachtree Roadrace?" Her face brightened. "I wouldn't miss it. Last year I came in twelfth." "That's very good. How long have you been running?" "I really started training two years ago. Up to then I wasn't so serious about competing." Two years ago, I thought. And two years ago her periods stopped. Now I had the first important clue to Kathy's fertility problem. I knew she wouldn't like what I was about to suggest. "Kathy, we know that women athletes often complain that their periods stop. Of course, I need to know a lot more about you, but I wouldn't be surprised if your training regimen is contributing to your fertility problem." Her smile faded. "You mean I'll have to stop running?" "Not at all," I assured her. "Many women athletes keep in shape even while they are pregnant. But first, let's figure out how to help you get you pregnant." She smiled. "Sounds good to me." Physical exertion is only one of many factors that may affect your fertility. Critical points about your development, medical history, and life-style all give me vital clues to solving your fertility problem. In this chapter you'll learn what your doctors investigations into your past can reveal, and gain insight into what may be causing your fertility problem. Analyzing Your Life-style Excessive or Rigorous Exercise This cause of infertility may be grounded in our ancestral heritage. If food supplies were low, we followed herds of migrating animals or ranged far and wide to gather fruits and grain. A pregnancy would impair the woman's ability to keep up with the group. To improve her odds for survival during famine, nature decreased her fertility so that she stopped ovulating and her periods ceased (amenorrhea). This is probably the same protective mechanism that caused Kathy S.'s problem. Fortunately, resolving Kathy's hormonal imbalance was easy once I identified the cause. I'll tell you how we treat amenorrhea in a later chapter. Emotional Stress Most women with fertility problems appear to be under a great deal ofstress. But we don't know for any one person whether the stress contributedto the fertility problem, or whether the fertility problem brought on the stress.Many women in high stress situations become pregnant, so we can't sayconclusively that stress will disrupt your hormonal balance. We do know, however, that stress can affect your hypothalamus, the partof your brain that controls sex hormones. And we know that some womenwho have no apparent reason for being infertile except stress will oftenrespond to a medication that improves hypothalamic function. I'm not saying that the old wives' tale "Just relax and you'll get pregnant"will work. However, there's a great deal about the link between fertility andstress that we don't understand. Dieting and Nutrition Low calorie diets, special athletic diets, eating disorders, and other restric-tive eating practices may impair your fertility. A number of factors may causethis problem: Losing the weight itself Reaching a low percentage ofbody fat Reaching an absolute minimum weight Stressing the body Suffering from a nutritional imbalance. The mechanism for reducingyour fertility isn't clear and it may vary from one individual to another. LikeKathy S., however, the most common complaint is amenorrhea, lack ofmenstrual periods. (I frequently find that teenagers who have been on crashdiets stop having periods.) Fortunately this is one of the easiest fertility problems to correct. Whenyou change your diet and gain weight, you usually start ovulating and menstruationresumes. Strangely enough, I've also seen ovulation stop in women who follow strict vegetarian diets. I remember one woman who ate so many carrots that her genitals turned bright orange. The stress of her diet and high blood levels of carotene (from eating carrots) may have caused her anovulation. Rather than taking medication to induce ovulation, she chose to cut down on her vegetables and add fish and eggs (protein) to her diet. Having thus increased her caloric and protein intake, she began ovulating and soon became pregnant. Women weighing two hundred pounds or more may also have fertility problems. This may also be one of nature's protective mechanisms, since obesity does not provide the best environment for fetal development and birth. In fact, before the age of modern medicine, many obese women and their babies died in childbirth. Nature apparently prefers to reduce your fertility and wait for you to lose weight. I remember one woman who, at five foot four and 188 pounds, complained of irregular periods with heavy flow. The reasons for her fertility problem are interesting. It seems that fat cells themselves can convert androgens (male hormones produced by the ovaries and adrenal gland) into estrogen (female hormone). Assessing all her symptoms, I suspected that her fat cells were producing enough estrogen to confuse her brain. Her brain, thinking that the ovaries were producing the estrogen, lowered her pituitary gland hormone production, which in turn led to anovulation. (You'll learn more about how these complex hormonal systems control your monthly cycles and fertility in the next chapter.)Once I explained how this woman's obesity affected her fertility and general health, she was more than willing to start a diet. A well-planned weight-reduction diet and exercise program eventually restored her fertility. And since her "reduced" fat cells no longer produced excess estrogen, she got a bonus: her risk of developing endometrial cancer diminished, too. Gathering Medical Clues Pelvic and Reproductive Tract Surgery Adhesions (scar tissue) inside the abdominal cavity caused by pelvic infections or abdominal surgery can impair fertility. I commonly find scar tissue in women who have had surgery for ruptured appendix, bowel repair, cesarean section, ectopic pregnancy, or the removal of an ovarian cyst. Twisting around the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and even the uterus, these inflexible webs of scar tissue restrict the natural mobility of these delicate organs. Margaret B., for example, had a ruptured appendix when she was twenty-three. When I looked at her reproductive organs through the laparoscope (telescope), I found that her pelvic adhesions were so extensive they prevented her eggs from entering her fallopian tubes. I clipped and removed the tissue from around the organs so that Margaret's tubes could once again gently flex and coax the ova down the narrow passage toward the waiting sperm. Scarring may also occur inside the uterus. Debbie W., for example, came to me about a year after having a D & C, saying, "Ever since my gynecologist scraped out my uterus, instead of having a period I just spot each month." When I looked into her uterus with a hysteroscope (small telescope), I found her uterine walls stuck to one another. I used a rather simple yet effective procedure to separate her uterine walls so they could heal and begin functioning normally. I'll discuss more about this procedure in a later chapter. Frequent Vaginitis If you suffer from frequent yeast or trichomonas infections, you may also have chlamydia, which can cause tubal damage. Because of increased exposure, women with a number of different sexual partners have a much greater chance of contracting these infections. A history of frequent vaginitis will alert me to the possibility that you have pelvic adhesions and tubal blockage. Once diagnosed, these abnormalities may respond to corrective surgery. Illnesses May Impair Fertility A number of illnesses can lead to impaired fertility. The most obvious ones are the venereal or sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, ureaplasma infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). These diseases can scar your uterus, block your tubes, and cause the formation of pelvic adhesions.I remember one woman who said that four years ago her doctor thought she had a gallbladder problem. "I had a pain right here," she said, holding her hand over the lower right half of her rib cage. "I guess it just went away, because I haven't had any more trouble." After asking her several questions about her symptoms I suspected that instead of having a gallbladder problem, she had probably contracted PID. After further tests, I discovered that PID had caused her liver to adhere to the inside of her abdominal wall, a condition called Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome. Once I surgically removed the adhesions and repaired her scarred fallopian tubes, she soon became pregnant. Other diseases such as hepatitis fever disease) and kidney disease can cause fertility problems. Both your liver and kidneys filter and remove waste products, toxic substances, and impurities from your blood. A buildup of wastes and unmetabolized (not chemically broken down) hormones may interfere with your menstrual cycle. When these diseases are brought under control, fertility usually returns. Thyroid gland disorders may also interfere with fertility. Increased metabolism from an overproduction of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) will burn up your estrogen supply faster than your body can make it. Without estrogen you cannot ovulate. In contrast, if your thyroid gland produces insufficient thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), you will stockpile too much estrogen and you may have an elevated prolactin level. If you have an excess of these two hormones, your ovaries cannot function normally. Regulating your thyroid production through surgery or thyroid supplements usually restores fertility. Adult onset diabetes or insulin resistance may interfere with normal menstrual cycles. High levels of insulin abnormaly stimulate the ovary to make high levels of male hormones which block normal ovulation. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may be associated with an adrenal gland disorder that causes excessive production of male hormones (androgens). Increased androgens can disrupt normal ovarian function as well as disturb your female secondary sex characteristics. I remember one woman referred to me for a fertility workup said, "Doctor, I'm growing a mustache!" The hair growth on her upper lip (a condition called hirsutism), very oily skin, and acne told me she was probably producing excessive androgens. As I expected, her blood tests revealed that she had an overactive adrenal gland. When she received medication to slow her androgen production down, her periods resumed, and much to her relief her mustache stopped growing. Treatment for Abnormal Pap Smears Cone biopsy, laser surgery, Leep, or cryosurgery may be used to treat a condition detected by an abnormal Pap smear. Any of these procedures can degrade the quality of your cervical mucus to the point that sperm cannot travel into your uterus. I performed a cone biopsy on a twenty-seven-year-old patient of mine who had a precancerous Pap smear result. I hoped I could halt the growth of abnormal tissues and prevent Nancy V. from developing cervical cancer. A year later she married and wanted to have a baby. When I performed a postcoital test, I found that her mucus was too scant and thick for the sperm to pass. So I recommended we wash her husband's sperm and inject them directly into her uterus (intrauterine artificial insemination homologous). After three tries Nancy became pregnant. A cone biopsy can also weaken the cervix and allow premature pregnancy loss. So during Nancy V.'s pregnancy I watched her cervix to make sure that it stayed shut until delivery. Fortunately all went well and she delivered an eight-pound fourteen-ounce baby boy. I'll discuss more about the procedures I used with Nancy in chapter 19. Anticancer Agents and Radiation Anticancer agents such as methotrexate or radiation treatment may also compromise your fertility. Radiation can cause not only pelvic adhesions but also chromosomal damage to your eggs. If you're concerned about the effects of these treatments, talk with your doctor. Endometriosis Endometriosis may scar your fallopian tubes, interfere with your ability to ovulate, and prevent embryo implantation. Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the womb. Unfortunately we do not know the exact mechanism by which endometriosis forms. Being sensitive to monthly hormonal changes, this tissue grows and then, as does the endometrium in the uterus, sheds during menstruation. This "bleeding" inside the abdominal cavity is very painful, as Shelley T. testified: "When my period starts, my cramps get so bad I have to go to bed." When I looked inside Shelley T.'s abdomen with a laparoscope, I found extensive pelvic inflammation and scarring. Since endometriosis can also cause tubal blockage, I injected dye into her uterus and tubes to see if they were open. I was really relieved to see the blue inklike fluid seeping out each fimbria (the opening of the fallopian tube near the ovary). Fortunately endometriosis frequently responds to hormonal therapy and, when necessary, to surgery. In Shelley's case I decided to use the laparoscope and a small instrument passed through a second small incision to cut her adhesions. Then I used a laser to selectively cauterize and excise the endometrial implants. She received GnRHa (Synarel, Lupron, Zoladex) for three months after her surgery and then attempted pregnancy. A later chapter will explain more about these procedures. German Measles (Rubella) German measles (rubella) does not impair fertility. However, if you con-tract rubella during the first half of your pregnancy, your baby will likely suffer from severe defects, including deafness and mental retardation. It would be tragic to undergo extensive fertility treatment only to achieve a pregnancy blighted by German measles. Therefore, I always do a blood test to determine if my fertility patient is immune to German measles. If the test is negative, I give her a rubella vaccine. I then recommend that the couple use barrier contraception, such as condoms, for three months to avoid the remote possibility that the live virus vaccine could affect their baby. Tender Breasts and Milky Discharge If your breasts are tender or if you have a milky discharge, you may have breast tumors. If I cannot detect any abnormal growths, I look for other factors that can cause a hormone imbalance_for example, an excess production of prolactin. Prolactin, one of the primary hormones responsible for milk production (lactation), suppresses ovulation. I remember one patient who came to me because she hadn't responded to the drugs her doctor prescribed to induce her to ovulate. Heather P. complained of milk leaking from her breasts, so I suspected that her pituitary gland was producing excessive amounts of prolactin. When this was confirmed by a blood test, I prescribed Parlodel (bromocriptine, an oral medication. That did the trick and she got pregnant in her very next cycle. I'll discuss this treatment more in chapter 12. Neurological Disorders Any disturbance in your central nervous system may interrupt the delicate hormonal coordination between your hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries. If you suffer from seizures, epilepsy, visual disturbances, poor sense of smell, dizziness, loss of balance, or chronic headaches, you may have a neurological disorder. If you take medication to control epilepsy, nervous tension, depression, and so forth, the drugs themselves may interfere with your fertility. I remember one RESOLVE member who reported that when her doctor changed her antidepressant to a different prescription she began ovulating three months later. I may consult with a neurologist if I feel the disorder requires further diagnosis and treatment. Once we correct the neurological abnormality, fertility may return naturally. Medications That Compromise FertilityA number of medications may compromise your fertility. If you take hormones, antibiotics, or antihypertensives, they can prevent an embryo from implanting in your uterus. If taken in the middle of your menstrual cycle, Motrin, Anaprox, Indocin, or aspirin_usually taken to ease menstrual cramps_may prevent your ovary from releasing a ripened egg. Antidepres-sants, hallucinogens, painkillers, and alcohol may increase your prolactin levels and cause ovulation failure. When you stop these medications (and don't stop taking any medications without consulting your doctor first), fertility usually resumes. Be sure to tell your doctor about every prescription or over-the-counter drug you take. These drugs may not only play a part in your fertility problem but, should you become pregnant, they may also jeopardize the development of your infant. My general rule of thumb is "When in doubt, do not take it." We honestly do not know the effects of all drugs on a pregnancy, particularly when taken in combination with other medications. Illicit Drugs Central nervous system depressants such as heroin or large, frequent doses of marijuana can interfere with your sex drive and with the hormonal balance necessary for ovulation and menstruation. Don't bother to pay for expensive fertility treatment if you plan to continue taking these drugs. Besides, during your pregnancy, a number of these drugs may also threaten your unborn child. Both marijuana and tobacco cigarettes increase the carbon monoxide level in your blood and impair your unborn baby's oxygen supply. Without adequate oxygen, tissues and vital organs may be damaged or killed. Taking hard drugs like cocaine will also reduce the life-sustaining blood supply to your unborn baby. When you stop using these toxic chemicals, your fertility usually returns. Massive Hemorrhage During Childbirth At a RESOLVE meeting I met a woman who had nearly died with the birth of her first child. During her delivery she had suffered a massive hemorrhage. "They gave me twelve blood transfusions," she reported. "My baby and I just barely survived." She picked up her infant and held her close. "I tried to nurse Rachael, but she was starving, so I gave it up. After a few weeks it was all I could do to get out of bed, feed her, and change her diapers." Her husband interrupted. "I knew something had to be wrong, so I put Sarah and Rachael in the car and drove them to the doctor." "The doctor told us that massive bleeding associated with pregnancy sometimes shocks the pituitary gland to the point that it dies," Sarah said. "He called it Sheehan's syndrome. He didn't know exactly why this hap-pened to me, but my pituitary may have suffered a temporary loss of its blood supply." Since Sarah's damaged pituitary gland no longer controlled her thyroid hormone production, adrenal hormone production, and blood sugar levels, she experienced a wide range of symptoms including extreme fatigue. In addition, she could not ovulate, she could not have a period, and she could not have another baby. When her doctor put Sarah on pituitary hormone replacement therapy, she eventually regained her fertility and gave birth to a second child. Assessing Your Gynecological History When Are You Most Fertile? Day 1 of your menstrual period is the day your period begins. This seems relatively simple, but you wouldn't believe how many people fail to get pregnant because they count the days from the wrong starting point. (Just recently I spoke to a couple who counted from the day her period stopped. They knew she was most fertile around the middle of her cycle, or approximately days 14 to 16, so they timed intercourse two weeks after her period stopped. However, since her period stopped on what they should have counted as day 6, they were having sex a week too late_on days 20 to 22.) Because on the average a woman's cycle varies in length from twenty-six to thirty-five days, you cannot count forward from day I to find your most fertile days. Since you ovulate approximately fourteen days before your next period begins, you count backward fourteen days from the date you expect your next period will start. That means the woman with a thirty-five-day cycle would ovulate on day 20 or 21 and the woman with a twenty-six-day cycle on day 11 or 12. Since you're fertile for only twenty-four hours each month, these calculations become quite critical. I use a number of methods to determine the time of peak fertility, but many women, however, can do so by increasing their awareness about their bodies. Around the time of ovulation many women sense a discomfort on one side of their lower abdomen. The feeling associated with ovulation, called mittleschmerz, does not occur in women who do not ovulate_for example, in women taking birth control pills. Also at the fertile time of the month women often notice a clear stringy mucus discharge from their vagina. When your mucus thins out, it allows sperm to swim through the cervical canal. This definitely signals the right time to have sex. I'll discuss other methods you can use to pinpoint your peak fertility in a later chapter. Cramps and Pelvic Heaviness If you have cramps or take medication for cramps, your doctor needs to know how severe they are. Severe pain at the onset of your period may indicate the presence of endometriosis. If you do not become bloated, do not cramp, and develop only a scanty flow, you may not be ovulating. That's why women who take birth control pills often have less discomfort during their periods. Fortunately ovulation induction treatment is successful for most women. If you experience pelvic heaviness, you may have large fibroids (non-cancerous growths) in your pelvis. Fibroids may also interfere with your ability to conceive and with the ability of your uterus to support an early pregnancy. When necessary, the offending fibroids can be surgically removed and fertility restored. Menstrual Flow A heavy monthly flow may indicate that too-persistent estrogen production is overstimulating the growth of your uterine lining. A scanty flow may indicate that your body produces too little estrogen to prepare the uterine lining for implantation, or that you have intrauterine adhesions. When estrogen levels are controlled, normal menstrual flow resumes and the quality of the uterine lining improves. When indicated, intrauterine adhesions can be surgically removed. Spotting during the middle of your cycle may indicate a hormonal imbalance or abnormalities inside your uterus_for example, the presence of scar tissue or an IUD you forgot about. Don't laugh. I once removed an IUD from a patient who had tried to get pregnant for two years. When I extracted the coil she'd received some four years earlier, she was shocked, saying, "But my doctor said I'd passed it!" When the string disappeared, her doctor assumed her uterus had expelled the IUD. In fact, her uterus had "swallowed" the string and concealed its presence for two years. Never assume. Amenorrhea"Doctor, I'm not having monthly periods. My husband and I want a baby. What should I do?" When I hear this complaint, I first establish whether the woman has ever had a period. If she has, then her reproductive tract is patent (intact and open to the outside). If she has never menstruated (primary amenorrhea), I examine her to determine if she has a uterus, if her uterus opens into a vagina, and if the vagina opens to the outside. If the vaginal tract is closed, I can open it surgically and restore fertility. However, if her reproductive organs are missing or severely deformed, not much can be done to correct the abnormalities. If her ovaries are intact, new technologies provide hope that her eggs can be fertilized and nurtured in another woman's uterus. (See Hysterectomy below.) If I've established that she is not pregnant and has no physical abnormalities, I begin to look for signs of hormonal deficiencies. Secondary amenorrhea, or the cessation of periods after they've been initiated, is a much more common finding. Secondary amenorrhea may be caused by pregnancy, damaged uterine lining, ovulatory failure, ovarian failure, hypothalamic failure, or pituitary failure. First I determine if your hormonal systems are functioning properly. For example, if your breasts are underdeveloped, if your pubic hair is absent or scanty, or if you have signs of virilization such as a mustache (hirsutism) or masculinized genitalia, I'll suspect a hormone imbalance. If I find elevated FSH(pituitary hormone) levels, I'll suspect ovarian failure. (Remember, this is also the sign for testicular failure in men.) Only by performing a complete fertility workup can I identify the reason for your failure to menstruate. Hormone stimulation and replacement therapies are successful in most of these cases. Because amenorrhea is the most common complaint of women with fertility problems, I've devoted chapters 12, 13, and 14 to discussing ovulatory failure and treatment. D&C If you've had a D&C (dilation and curettage) to scrape out the contents of your uterus, the doctor treating your fertility problem needs to know why. Sometimes a doctor performs a D&C to remove unwanted scar tissue or the remains of an incomplete abortion. Instead of the D&C improving the uterine environment as expected, however, sometimes the procedure will cause the inflamed uterine walls to stick (adhere) together. People with Asherman's syndrome, as this condition is known, usually have regularly occurring, scanty periods. I can correct this condition with a rather simple procedure described in chapter 19. Traumatic Abortion If a trained physician using sterile procedures performs your abortion, you do not need to worry about compromising your fertility. Illegal, back-alley, and self-induced abortions may lead to life-threatening infection and tubal blockage. Damage to your cervix from a traumatic abortion may also increase your risk for early pregnancy loss. Fortunately these complications occur must less frequently since the Supreme Court legalized abortion. Spontaneous Abortion and Miscarriage I need to know if you've ever been pregnant, if you've had an elective abortion, or if you've carried a baby to term. A previous pregnancy demon-strates to me that at some point in your life you were fertile. If your present husband fathered a child with you, I know even more_that together you were fertile. That's a very important piece of information, since there is clear evidence that your fertility potential depends on a unique compatibility between you and your partner. I also need to know if you lost a baby early in a pregnancy. The positive side of a spontaneous abortion or an ectopic pregnancy is that you can get pregnant. The reactions to early pregnancy loss, however, are anything but positive. The couple suffers shock, disbelief, anger, sadness, and grief.Many women may discard a developing embryo within the first month or so of pregnancy without realizing it. Researchers therefore believe that the spontaneous-abortion rate may be as high as 25 percent. However, if a woman reports repeated abortions, I will want to assess if her uterine lining can support a pregnancy and if her cervix will remain closed throughout the pregnancy. I'll discuss more about correcting these problems in chapter 19. Ectopic Pregnancy If scar tissue blocks the pencil-lead-sized fallopian tube passage (lumen), the tiny sperm may be able to get through but the larger, dividing fertilized egg may get stuck. Entrapped by adhesions, the embryo implants in the tube and continues to grow. Damage to the inside surface of the tube may also interrupt the fertilized egg's journey to your uterus. Waving like blowing grass, the tiny hairlike cells (cilia) lining the inside of a normal fallopian tube stroke the fertilized egg toward your uterus. When infection or surgery strips the cilia from the walls of your tube, the immobilized embryo may attach itself to the smooth tubal wall. Unfortunately the condition that damaged one of your tubes very likely damaged your other tube. For this reason, if you have one ectopic pregnancy, you have an increased chance for another one on the opposite side. Years ago women suffering from an ectopic pregnancy often lost the affected fallopiantube. The job of creating another pregnancy fell almost exclusively to the remaining ovary and tube. Now, however, with early pregnancy detection and microsurgery, we can often save the affected tube and restore it to a functional state. In the next few chapters I will reveal many more of nature's fascinating secrets and tell you how you can overcome and cope with pregnancy losses. Did Your Mother Have a Fertility Problem? Quite frequently fertility problems run in families. Therefore, clues from your mother's past may help me unravel a complex mystery. I remember a thirty-year-old woman who came to me after she'd had two miscarriages. She told me her mother had also miscarried twice before giving birth to her. I asked my patient to find out if, in order to avoid another miscarriage, her mother had taken a drug called DES when my patient was in utero. We were both greatly relieved to find out that her mother had not taken this insidious drug. Had she been exposed to DES, my patient could have suffered from unexplained infertility and repeated unexplained pregnancy losses, as well as have a deformed cervix and womb. Congenital Uterine Abnormalities Congenital abnormalities of the female genital tract range from a simple septum dividing the uterus in half to a complete duplication of all structures_ uterus, cervix, vagina, and external genitalia. Some of these abnormalities may interfere with implantation of the embryo or lead to early pregnancy loss. Surgical correction often improves the chances for maintaining a preg-nancy to term. Sometimes endometriosis can cause a tipped uterus. The tipped uterus, however, is not causing the fertility problem; the endometriosis is. Hysterectomy Today women who had previously given up hope of pregnancy because of a hysterectomy may be able to have their own babies. Using in vitro fertilization techniques, we can surgically retrieve her eggs and fertilize them with her husband's sperm. Since she cannot carry the pregnancy, we deposit the fertilized embryo into a surrogate (substitute) mother's womb. Though born to another woman, the baby will carry its true parents' genes. These exciting prospects are medically possible, and the legal system is grappling with the issues they raise. I'll tell you more about these techniques in chapter 21. Contraceptives and Infertility Sexual Freedom Modern contraception, usually regarded as a great success story, may actually be responsible for dramatically increasing fertility problems. The upside of contraception is that women can enjoy sex and still avoid unwanted pregnancies. With the ability to control their fertility and plan their lives, women are making remarkable progress in the educational, artistic, and business worlds. And with the fear of unwanted pregnancy removed, many women enjoy sex with different men. They're glad to see the demise of the double standard. The unfortunate downside to freely available contraception is that liberated sex has given rise to a rampant increase in sexually transmitted diseases. Every year over 250,000 college-aged women become infertile from chlamydial infection alone. And many of them won't know it until some years later. Whereas women in the past feared unwanted pregnancy, they should now fear pelvic inflammatory disease. I offer no easy answers for the man or woman who wants a free sex life. We do know that barrier contraceptives such as condoms and diaphragms lower your risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections. My hope is that medical breakthroughs will provide a vaccine or some other means for curbing this epidemic. The IUD The IUD, or intrauterine device, particularly exposes the promiscuous woman to an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal damage. Although the exact mechanism of contraception is not well understood, the IUD apparently creates a low level inflammation which prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and an embryo from implanting in the uterus. The IUD string may allow bacteria from your vagina to enter your womb, where they can flourish and invade your delicate reproductive structures. This risk is greatest in the first month following insertion. There's some evidence, though, that copper IUD's and the levonorgestrel containing IUD (Lng-20) may offer some protection against infection. Since the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease and impairing fertility increases with exposure to different partners, the IUD was temporarily removed from the American market. We now know that the IUD is safe and effective contraception for monogamous women and that the new Lng-20 has many medical benefits. The Pill Using the Pill won't impair your fertility; however, its use may disguise an underlying fertility problem. I remember when Shelley T. approached me in a panic: "God's punishing me! I know it!" "Birth control pills did not cause your fertility problem, Shelley." Once she calmed down a bit I asked, "What were your periods like before you took the Pill?" "I had terrible cramps," she told me. "But the Pill changed that." "The Pill may have reduced your cramping, but it did not cure your endometriosis. It's been with you all along," I told her. The Pill may also artificially regulate women who normally have irregular periods. When their irregular cycle returns after they go off the Pill, these women are often surprised. All the time they took the Pill, they falsely assumed that it had cured their underlying hormone imbalance. It is true that up to 3 percent of women using the Pill will develop menstrual irregularities as a direct result. However, they usually respond very well to ovulation inducttion therapy. I'll discuss more about the Pill in chapter 12. Norplant Norplant contraceptive implants a six small capsules placed into the upper arm. They release a small amount of levonorgestrel, a synthetic progesterone each day. This thickens cervical mucus preventing sperm penetration. Ovulation may also be blocked. And, if all else fails, the normal preparation of the uterine lining so that a pregnancy may attach is prevented. Ovulation generally resumes about 2 weeks after a simple procedure to remove the implants. Lost Years Lower Your Odds Couples who use any contraceptive method over a prolonged period of time have only a few remaining fertile years in which to resolve their fertility problem. To compound the difficulty, their fertility naturally declines as they grow older. However, since women can manage a healthy pregnancy through their late thirties, these couples succeed quite frequently. They just need to pursue their fertility treatment more aggressively. Sexual Practices Lubricants and Contraceptive Creams A lubricant used during sex may contain spermicidal chemicals that attack and kill millions of sperm before they have a chance to enter the protective cervical mucus. Even petroleum jelly may interfere with sperm activity. The easiest and cheapest lubricant is your own saliva, although bacteria in your mouth may degrade the semen. I suggest that if necessary my patients use a water-based lubricant such as Replens, K-Y Jelly or Lubrifax. If you're in doubt about what product to use, ask your doctor. Douches If you douche before having sex, you may alter the environment in your vagina and deteriorate the quality of your mucus. Later, when the sperm arrive, your vaginal passage may be hostile and your cervix blocked by mucus that sperm cannot penetrate. If you want to make a baby, I do not recommend douching before sex.Even though most sperm penetrate your mucus within a couple of minutes of ejaculation, I recommend waiting at least thirty minutes after sex before douching. Actually, unless you have some personal preference for douching, you never need to douche regularly. I'm amazed by the ability of commercial advertisers to make money from our fears about smelling bad or being dirty. Timing If you don't have sex, you can't get pregnant. You can quote me on that. You'd be surprised at the number of people who do not have sex the national average of two and one-half times a week. you are fertile for about twenty-four hours each menstrual cycle and sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. So you can see that if you do not have sex every forty-eight hours around the middle of your cycle (during your fertile days), you probably will not get pregnant. Some couples prefer using a urine LH kit to predict when ovulation is about to occur. When the stick turns blue, ovulation will likely occur the next day. This means only one day of work-sex and the rest of the month can be for lovemaking. Many factors can interfere with sex_the couple may be too busy, the husband and wife may travel, they may be under too much stress. During fertility treatment you may need to reduce your activities, alter your business schedules, and even cancel vacations. It doesn't make much sense to spend $300 to $500 in a month to become fertile and then blow your chances because of a trip. Too Much Sex You know what they say about too much of a good thing.... Seriously, though, extremely frequent sex reduces the amount of sperm available for each ejaculate. We know that it takes about forty-eight hours after sex for a man to build up an adequate supply of sperm. So having sex more frequently than that reduces the man's sperm count so much that pregnancy becomes even less likely. So you'll just have to control yourself_at least until you get pregnant. Uncomfortable or Painful Sex Uncomfortable or painful sex may indicate infection or other abnormalities. Sometimes, however, discomfort may only be due to insufficient lubrica-tion. If your vagina is consistently dry during sex, perhaps you and your husband should engage in foreplay longer. Stimulating your nipples, clitoris, and other erogenous areas will make your glands secrete natural juices. If your vagina remains dry after sexual arousal, your lubricant-supplying glands may be infected or your hormones may be deficient. You may require low-dose estrogens to improve your vaginal secretions or you may choose to use a water-soluble lubricant. You need to discuss this problem with your doctor. Aversion to Sex Sometimes sex turns a person off. one particularly sad case comes to mind wheres as a child, my patient had been sexually abused by her uncle. To Donna N. sex was shameful and to be avoided as much as possible, even though she loved her husband. After she told me about her uncle and her abortion at age thirteen, I referred her for counseling. Although it took some time, her relationship improved to the point where she looked forward to pursuing fertility treat-ment. If sex turns you off, seek professional advice. Your Fertility Treatment History Many couples who come to me already have completed all or part of a fertility workup. They may have been referred to me by their doctor or perhaps they became discouraged and wanted a second opinion. Often they are surprised when I tell them I may need to repeat many of their tests. However, there are a number of factors I must consider: Often the reports I receive for previous tests do not contain all the information I need for proper interpretation. For example, only when I know both the test date and the ovulation date can I evaluate your postcoital test and biopsy results. I know and trust my assistants, technicians, and the outside laboratories I use. Due to the lack of standard methodology, many medical laboratories will report different results on the same blood specimen or do not do a good job of reporting sperm morphology on a semen analysis. I remember one instance where a couple came to me after the wife had undergone fertility treatment for over a year. When I repeated the husband's semen analysis, I found severely abnormal sperm. Four months after I treated them with antibiotics and vitamin C, she became pregnant. Since I'm responsible for my patient's care, I want the best information I know how to get. While conducting a pelvic exam or ultrasound evaluation, I make many observations that may not be noted on your previous physician's report. I notice, for example, how easily I can manipulate your pelvic organs. If they are stiff and rigid or which area seems to reproduce your pain. I may suspect adhesions. Subtle clues like flinching when I touch your ovary or kicking when I do your rectal exam help me solve the mystery. I'll also find out if your condition has improved or grown worse since your previous doctor examined you. I may need to perform X rays and/or laparoscopies so I myself can view the dye moving through your tubes. The written results of a previous laparoscopy do not tell the whole story. Watching a videotape and seeing the flow and the response of your reproductive organs to manipulation tells me much more, for example, than knowing that you have a tubal blockage. If necessary, I can even lay out a specific plan for performing corrective surgery. I'll discuss the use of diagnostic laparoscopies and X rays in much more detail in later chapters. People change with time_for better and for worse. Your fertility potential one year ago is history. I must assess your current condition before I can design a customized treatment plan. When you change doctors, bring your old records on your first visit and, if possible also bring your hospital records, surgical videotapes, laboratory test results and X ray films. By providing these records you may not totally avoid the need for duplicating tests, but you'll minimize your expense and you'll give your doctor an edge on solving your fertility problem Your doctor should use every available clue from your past because considering every factor will give you the best chance for having your miracle baby.

As the plot unwinds, however, our hero gradually pieces together one shred of evidence after another, until, in the final climactic scene, the master investigator pinpoints the culprit. There's little difference between conducting this kind of investigation and doing a fertility evaluation. When a woman first comes to my office, I suspect a broad range of causes: tubal blockage, endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, uterine abnormalities, anovulation, and so forth. As I review her history, I search for clues that will help me narrow my list of suspects. Repeated pelvic infections, for example, lead me to suspect tubal blockage or pelvic adhesions. If she tells me she's not menstruating, I'll focus my investigation on hormonal problems or uterine abnormalities. If she complains of extreme discomfort when her period starts, endometriosis will be uppermost in my thoughts. Just as the master detective can be thrown off by misleading evidence, I must also be cautious not to jump to conclusions. It's all too easy to say, "Pain at menstrual onset? You have endometriosis." Although this may be correct, endometriosis may not be the only offender. Intrauterine adhesions or hormonal imbalances may also play a part. The challenge presented by contradictory clues can seem overwhelming Just as I think I'm about to close in on one suspect, I uncover evidence that doesn't seem to fit the pattern. With my theory blown out of the water, I must formulate a new strategy for tracking down the culprit. By analyzing the clues and continually searching for additional ones, I draw closer and closer to the solution until I reach the climactic day when I tell you that you are pregnant. Lucy H., for example, had infrequent periods and pain with intercourse. Ovulation induction therapy had regulated her periods but she'd failed to get pregnant. When her doctor referred her to me, I performed a laparoscopy (telescopic examination of the inside of her pelvis) and discovered that she had endometriosis and that adhesions (scar tissue) encased her ovaries. Even if she had ovulated, her eggs could not have reached her fallopian tubes. The Five Female Fertility Factors The five key elements of female fertility are: Ovulation Sperm-mucus interaction Fertilization Tubal transport Embryo implantation During the physical examination and fertility workup, I attempt to confirm or eliminate each of these candidates as hindrances to your fertility. Your history may point strongly to some of them. The clues I gather during the physical examination will offer additional evidence. Once I've pinpointed the areas of greatest concern, I can recommend specific tests and procedures to confirm my diagnosis. For now, though, I'd like to discuss what clues I can gather from the physical examination. The Physical Examination During the physical examination I look for evidence that you are ovulating, that your mucus allows sperm to reach the egg in good shape, and that the fertilized egg can successfully implant and grow in your uterus. A number of things may go wrong during this process. The sperm may not be able to journey through inhospitable cervical mucus or, having reached the egg, they may be unable to penetrate its surface. The egg may get lost in the body cavity and never find its way into the fallopian tube. Fallopian tubes, damaged by infection or trapped in adhesions, may not be capable of moving the egg toward the uterus. The growing, fertilized egg may become entangled in webs of intratubal adhesions caused by infection and develop into an ectopic pregnancy. Or the uterine lining may fail to nourish the early embryo. Once I determine where these processes are breaking down, I have a good chance of restoring your fertility. Fertility Factor #1: Ovulation Any woman who comes to me complaining of very heavy menstrual flow, very light menstrual flow, no menstrual flow, irregular cycles, breast discharge, or scanty or overabundant body hair growth is telling me that she may not be ovulating. This may be due to an intrinsic malfunction of her reproduc-tive organs or hormones, or to a systemic disease causing other body chemistry problems. During the physical examination I look for evidence of systemic disease: jaundiced (yellow) skin and eyes are indicative of liver disease; tenderness in the middle of the back and water retention (edema) may indicate kidney malfunction. Nancy F., for example, had been trying to get pregnant for six months. When I examined her, I found that her ankles and fingers were swollen. Further tests indicated that her kidneys were not functioning well. I referred her to a kidney specialist, since once her kidney function improved, her periods would probably return to normal. Since your liver and kidneys filter impurities from your blood (including "old" hormones), their function is vital for maintaining hormonal balance. If I find high blood pressure together with excessive body hair, I may suspect - adrenal gland abnormalities, which can affect ovarian function. (I discuss more about how we diagnose and correct these problems in the chapters on - ovulation.) I also look for other clues pointing to ovulation problems. For example, if you weigh over two hundred pounds, if you're severely underweight, or if; you have a highly developed athletic build, I may suspect a hormonal imbalance. Kathy S., who ran fifteen to twenty miles a week, had leg muscles; a man would be proud of. It didn't take much imagination to know that she was exercising to the point that she would cause ovulatory failure. (Chapter 9 explains the mechanisms for these disorders.) When I examined Dorothy L., I found that her thyroid gland was swollen, and she appeared lethargic. Suspecting a thyroid deficiency, I ordered a thyroid hormone blood test. After she began taking a thyroid supplement, she became more energetic, had much more interest in having sex with her husband, and her periods returned to normal. Five months later she called to tell me she was pregnant. Both hyperthyroidism (overproduction of thyroid hormone) and hypothy-roidism (underproduction) may interfere with your menstrual cycle by dis-turbing estrogen supplies. I'll discuss more about how your hormonal system works in chapters 11, 12, and 13. When I examined Gale P., I found that she had a translucent, white discharge from her breasts. She said that she'd had a milky discharge ever since she'd stopped nursing her toddler. I suspected she was producing excess prolactin, a hormone usually associated with nursing mothers. This hormone prevents ovulation and pregnancy so that you can give your baby the best nutrition possible. When you're trying to get pregnant, however, you don't need prolactin's birth control protection. With treatment, Gale's fertility quickly returned. Your body build and secondary sex characteristics may provide additional clues to hormonal imbalance. Undersized breasts, scanty pubic hair, and underdeveloped hips all suggest a female hormone deficiency. An enlarged clitoris and abnormal hair growth such as a mustache may suggest excess male hormones. Rarer conditions such as ambiguous genitalia (not clearly male or female) and duplicate reproductive organs may point to genetic or enzyme defects that can interfere with ovulation. Although breast size, body conformation, and hair distribution are not conclusive evidence, they may corroborate suspicions created by other clues. If your menstrual history and evidence from your physical examination point to ovulatory problems, I will recommend a number of tests to confirm this diagnosis. Like the detective, I need corroborative evidence to prove my case. Chapters 11 through 14 describe in detail what can cause ovulatory problems and how, with treatment, most women with ovulatory disorders can get their miracle babies. Fertility Factor #2: Sperm-Mucus Interaction Normally your cervical mucus forms an impervious plug that keeps foreign materials, including sperm, from entering the uterus. Once each month, responding to estrogen, the cervical mucus becomes clear, thin, and stringy so sperm can swim through the cervix into the uterus. I'll examine your cervix to make sure that the mucus has not been degraded by infection, by a cone biopsy to remove abnormal precancerous tissue, by cryosurgery, or by cervical deformities from congenital defects or DES exposure (as in Debbie W.'s cervix). In part IV, "When Sperm Meets Egg," I'll explain how I diagnose and treat sperm-mucus problems. Since bacteria, viruses, white blood cells, and antibodies may attack and impair the sperm, a number of different vaginal and cervical infections can cause fertility problems. Some wave red flags in the form of pus (purulent discharge), inflammation, itching, burning, and foul odors, but many of the more insidious varieties can be detected only by special laboratory tests. Minor infections include candidiasis or yeast, which may be uncomfortable and itchy; trichomonas, which may produce a bad-smelling greenish discharge; gardnerella infection, which causes a burning sensation and a gray, pasty discharge; and ureaplasma infection, which is symptomless. A microscopic examination of the discharge will disclose the identity of the invading organism. Once antibiotics eradicate these infections, fertility may improve. Infections such as chlamydia, ureaplasma, and gonorrhea occasionally cause severe illness leading to tubal blockage and the formation of adhesions, often without the victim knowing it. Diagnosis is difficult, since the only evidence may be a reddened vagina or a burning sensation and urgency to urinate. In the presence of an abnormal cervical discharge, I will test for all of these organisms. Janice D.'s laparoscopy, for example, revealed that she had extensive pelvic adhesions. When I questioned her, the only incident she could recall was a flulike illness she'd had during her junior year at college. She and her physician had never realized she was suffering from a chlamydia infection. It was six years later, when she couldn't get pregnant, that she received the diagnosis. By causing an inflammation of the uterine lining, ureaplasma (often called mycoplasma) may lead to early miscarriage. When this sexually transmitted infection is found in the woman, it will probably be in her partner, too. When ureaplasma occurs in the man, he may form antibodies which attack his own sperm. Since the symptoms for this disease are as elusive as those for chlamydia, only a culture can help me diagnose it. Gonorrhea is usually symptomless in the woman, although in some cases it causes a bad-smelling yellowish discharge and red and swollen vaginal walls, and if it invades your tubes, you'll suffer severe pain and develop a high fever. In the presence of infertility I always culture for this organism because, once detected, I can often restore fertility with the antibiotic doxycycline. During the vaginal examination I will also note if you appear to be having an abnormally high level of discomfort. This sometimes indicates psychological problems which could interfere with having intercourse. Since you are fertile for only forty-eight hours each month and sperm survive for only forty-eight hours in your reproductive tract, infrequent intercourse may play a role in your fertility problem. Fertility Factor #3: Fertilization Fertilization depends on the sperm's ability to penetrate the outer layers of the egg and transfer its genetic information. Since I cannot determine if fertilization is working properly from the physical examination, I must use the sperm penetration assay or the acrosin test, which are explained in chapter 18. Fertility Factor #4: Tubal Factor Other clues uncovered during the physical examination may point to transport problems. Abdominal scars, for example, could indicate that sur-gery might have caused adhesions to form. Margaret B. had an appendec-tomy scar from a ruptured appendix. Since the massive infection and surgery could have caused tubal blockage, I did a tubal X ray right away. Abdominal adhesions can prevent the egg from entering the fallopian tube as well as impede its passage through the tube. I have seen many women whose tubes were frozen in place by this nonstretchable tissue preventing the tubal movement necessary to coax the egg toward the uterus. During the pelvic examination I manipulate your reproductive organs to detect if they move freely or if they feel like rigid, plaster models. I can often restore fertility to women with adhesions by surgically removing this scar tissue. I'll discuss these procedures in chapters 16 and 17. Wincing, tenderness, and pain during the pelvic examination may indicate an active infection, Endometriosis can cause adhesions and impair ovulation. Sometimes I can detect endometriosis during the vaginal and rectal examination; however, just as Sherlock Holmes pulled out his magnifying glass to get a closer view of the evidence, I often must confirm the diagnosis with a laparoscopy. When I examined Shelley T., I could feel the tell-tale beading or bumps on the surface of her reproductive organs and supporting uterine ligaments, but I followed up with a laparoscopy to confirm my diagnosis. Endometriosis may respond to medication or, failing that, surgery. I'll discuss more about endometriosis in chapter 17. Depending on their size and location, fibroids and ovarian cysts can also interfere with egg transport. These conditions will usually respond to surgery. Remember that having open tubes isn't the whole answer. If infection has stripped the hairlike cilia from the tubal lining, the egg may not be able to complete its journey toward the uterus. Detecting tubal problems during the physical examination is very unlikely; only an X ray can confirm that diagnosis. By combining the clues from your history and from the physical examination, I can decide if sperm/egg transportation might be contributing to your problem. A complete discussion of testing and procedures for tubal transport problems appears in chapters 16 and 17. Fertility Factor #5: Embryo Implantation Sometimes during the physical examination I detect obvious causes for miscarriage such as congenitally malformed reproductive organs, an abnormally shaped cervix evident of DES exposure, or a cervix distorted by previous surgical procedures. Most of the time, however, the physical examination will not reveal the exact causes for recurrent miscarriage. The tests specific to this and other disorders causing pregnancy loss are covered in complete detail in chapters 18 and 19. Standard Laboratory Tests As part of the physical examination, I order a number of laboratory tests. The Postevaluation Conference The postevaluation conference I have with my patients reminds me of the meeting between the chief of detectives and his team to plan the final strategy for solving the mystery. Step by step the chief outlines the plan, so each person knows exactly how to play out his or her role. He also outlines contingency plans to deal with obstacles and unexpected events. And even with all this forethought and effort, sometimes the suspect isn't where they expect him to be; sometimes the suspect escapes; and sometimes the suspect turns out to be innocent. As "chief of detectives," once I have collected all the clues from my investigation�your history, your physical examination, and your laboratory tests�I begin to outline a strategy for treating your fertility problem. I may not know the exact cause of your infertility, but I can customize the investigation to uncover the most likely problem. If I suspect ovulatory problems, as I did with Kathy S., I will want to evaluate the menstrual cycle. If I suspect tubal blockage, as I did with Margaret B., I will order an X ray. If I suspect an infection, I'll recommend antibiotic therapy. Or if I find poor semen quality, I'll want to evaluate your husband more thoroughly. As I get closer and closer to the answer, I begin to put together my strategy for eliminating your fertility problem. Table 10-1 The lnitial Workup Laboratory Tests I Often Perform Cultures/DNA Probe: Cultures for sexually transmitted infections reveal the presence of active infections which must be treated prior to initiating other fertility treatment. It's mandatory that the woman's partner be treated for the same infection, since bacteria are easily passed back and forth between sexual partners. Recently tests called DNA probes can detect chlamydia and gonorrhea from a simple smear taken from the cerivx. Day 3 FSH: In those women over 35 I recommend this blood test to determine ovarian status. VDRL: This test rules out the presence of syphilis, which may affect the fetus as well as pose a serious health hazard to you. HIV & Hepatitis Screening: Testing for the AIDS virus and hepatitis may be done as part of your initial evaluation. Pap Smear: Although not specific to fertility problems, a Pap smear should be performed during every workup to eliminate the possibility that you have or may soon develop cancer of the reproductive organs. CBC: A complete blood count will give a reading on your general health. It will also indicate if you have an infection, systemic disease, or iron deficiency. Urinalysis: This test will help rule out renal disease or genitourinary tract infections as potential fertility problems. Prolactin: This test is likely to be abnormal if you have irregular periods or note a clear or milky breast discharge. Thyroid Hormone: I run this test if the physical exam suggests hyper- or hypothyroidism . Testosterone, DHEAS, 17 Hydroxyprogesterone, & Fasting Insulin: These tests may be helpful if you have irregular periods and excessive hair growth. Sed Rate: The sedimentation rate in your blood will often reveal an infection when cultures show up negative. Rubella Titre: I always test for immunity to German measles, since con-tracting this disease during a pregnancy often leads to severe deformities in the fetus. Sickle Cell Screen: If you are Black, this test will indicate if you are at risk of having a child with sickle cell anemia. Semen Analysis: Your workup is not complete until your husband's semen has been evaluated. Performing extensive testing and treatment on you will be to no avail if he is not contributing adequate sperm. You, as a couple, are part of my assault team. Without your input, understanding and participation, my efforts will fail. you will decide how much of your resources you are willing or able to spend, and how long you want to pursue your goal. Together we'll decide how aggressively to attack the problem. Margaret and Richard B. knew that due to Margaret's age they had only a few fertile years left. They had good insurance coverage, so they wanted to check everything out as soon as possible, with money as no object. Shelley and Michael T., in contrast, had already been through a year or more of tests, had many bills to pay, and Michael was feeling so pressured that he was ready to quit entirely. They chose to proceed more slowly�one step at a time. The fertility treatment plan we worked out for these two couples differed considerably. To help you understand the types of decisions you may be facing, the next chapters will cover specific tests and treatments for the five main suspects in female infertility.

Female Fertility Are You Ovulating? Clues from Your Menstrual History The complexities of regulating ovulation remind me of the difficulty a musical conductor faces when combining a hundred individual performances into a symphony. Although each individual plays an important part in the production, the overall performance ultimately depends on the precise coordination of all the players. If even one instrument is unsynchronized or off-key, the delicately balanced harmony can turn into disorganized noise. In the "ovulation symphony" harmony can be disrupted by disturbances in the menstrual cycle. Instead of an unwavering pattern repeated from month to month, infertile women frequently complain that their periods are irregular or have stopped altogether, and some women have never experienced men-strual flow.So, like the semen analysis, your menstrual history serves as a simple screening test to guide my investigations. It won't tell me precisely what the fertility problem is, but it will tell me where to look for further clues. The Three Types of Menstrual Patterns The Regular Menstrual Period The critical point about this category is that your period is regular from month to month, beginning like clockwork every twenty-five days or every thirty-five days, for example. If your periods are regular, you are probably ovulating. The consistently irregular menstrual cycle, however, where one month you begin menstruating after twenty-five days, the next month after thirty-four, and the next in thirty, may indicate that you have a fertility Problem. If a woman reports a regular menstrual history, I'll usually look at other areas of the reproductive system for a breakdown in the fertility formula. Irregular Menstrual Periods or Amenorrhea for Six or More Months This is the most common complaint found with fertility problems, The woman's menstrual periods occur infrequently and at unpredictable intervals. Some women, like Kathy S., even report that at some point their periods stopped altogether. Because these women are capable of menstruating (as demonstrated by their history), there is a good chance that with the proper treatment ovulation and a regular menstrual cycle will resume. Nonexistence of the Menstrual Period Women who have never menstruated may have genetic abnormalities, congenitally deformed reproductive organs, delayed puberty, or a pituitary malfunction. If by the age of sixteen a woman has not started menstruating, she should be concerned. It is important to diagnose the problem early and to determine if such women will respond to hormonal therapy or surgical correction. The emerging new technologies offer the most promise to these people. More about that in chapter 21. What Is Ovulation? Ovulation is a fascinating harmony performed by several different "players" � your hypothalamus, your pituitary gland, and your ovary. Your hypo-thalamus maintains the hormonal "tempo" by regularly pulsing GnRH (go-nadotropic-releasing hormone). These pulses stimulate your pituitary gland to produce LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). Your pituitary gland plays the chorus�a pattern repeated from month to month in a beautifully precise rhythm. Each month the pituitary secretes FSH to stimulate the development and growth of over one thousand eggs. This phase in the ovulation cycle is known as the follicular phase. At puberty a woman has about half a million primitive germ cells. Only four or five hundred, however, will ever reach maturity. Due to some mysterious mecha-nism which we don't yet understand, usually each month only one of the thousand developing eggs becomes dominant and grows to maturity. This egg, or ovum, is cradled within the ovary in a tiny, fluid-filled capsule called the follicle. During the follicular phase of your cycle, LH acts on the ovary's theca cells to initiate estrogen production by the granulosa cells. The estrogen makes the follicle even more responsive to FSH, which further stimulates follicular growth and development of the egg. As the follicle expands toward the surface of the ovary, the egg increases in size nearly forty times. The ovary tells the pituitary when it needs more or less FSH to finish the job of egg maturation by making a feedback hormone called inhibin (folliculostatin) . Shortly before ovulation, the genetic material (nucleus) in the egg divides (meiosis) to half the number of chromosomes in the cell. If the egg is fertilized a second meiotic division leaves the ovum with twenty-three chromosomes�a perfect complement to the sperm's twenty-three. To form an egg, the female germinal cell divides twice, as does the male germinal cell. During female germ cell divisions, however, the "surviving" ovum jealously hoards the bulk of cellular material (nutrients) and casts off the excess genetic material (polar bodies). The egg or (if the egg is fertilized) the embryo survives on these nutrients until the embryo successfully implants in the woman's uterus. Estrogen also stimulates the uterine lining (endometrium) to become thick, lush, and filled with nutrients for the embryo. The cervical mucus responds to elevated estrogen by becoming clear, watery, and stringy. Normally impervi-ous to sperm, at midcycle the mucus welcomes the sperm and promises easy passage toward the egg. When dried on a slide, the "friendly" mucus shows a characteristic ferning pattern. (See figure 15-2) When your estrogen level peaks at midcycle, the pituitary "knows" that the egg is ready to embark on its journey. The pituitary responds to the estrogen peak by producing a surge of LH, which releases the egg within eighteen to thirty-six hours. The outer wall of the ovary dissolves away from the bulging follicle, and within two to three minutes the ovum escapes into the woman's abdominal cavity. Surrounded by a sticky protective layer of cells (cumulus oophorus), the egg gently floats toward the fallopian tube. The expelled follicular fluid stimulates the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube to reach toward the ovum, grasp the ovary, and vacuum up the egg. The muscles and tiny hairs (cilia) lining the fallopian tube gently coax the egg on its three-to-four-day journey through the narrow passage. For conception to occur during this cycle, the sperm must fertilize the egg in the fallopian tube within twelve hours of ovulation. (See figures 10-1 and 15-1.) During the egg's journey, the ruptured follicle begins an amazing transformation into the corpus luteum. Stimulated by LH from the pituitary gland, this yellow-pigmented, glandular, ovarian structure enlarges to make up nearly a third of the ovary. During the Luteal phase (latter half of the cycle), the corpus luteum produces progesterone, a hormone that prepares the uterine lining for implantation of the embryo. Progesterone also acts on your body's temperature-regulating mechanism by raising basal body temperature (BBT) approximately one-half degree. Thus shortly after ovulation, you will see a rise on your BBT chart.If fertilization does not take place, the corpus luteum deteriorates. Estrogen and progesterone levels decline rapidly in the week or so prior to menstruation. Deprived of these hormones, the endometrium atrophies and menstrual flow begins. At the site of the original follicle the corpus luteumdegenerates and leaves a minute piece of scar tissue as a reminder of its brief existence.If fertilization takes place, a corpus Irwteum of pregnancy forms to maintain the uterine lining (endometrial bed) and support the implanted fertilized ovum (conceptus). I'll discuss more about fertilization and implantation in chapter 19. The hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary must all work in perfect harmony. When they do not, the most obvious symptom is abnormal menses. And the nature of the abnormality clues me into the source of the problem. Table 12-5, "Conditions That Can Interfere with Ovulation and Menstruation," gives an overview of which fertility problems are caused by malfunctions of the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, pituitary feedback system, and other related systems. The diagnosis and treatment for these disorders are discussed in the remainder of this chapter and in chapters 12 and 13 . In the remainder of this chapter I will explain how I approach evaluating ovulation in the woman with a regular cycle. The next two chapters will explain how I approach evaluating women who have never had a period and women who have irregular periods or periods that have stopped. Evaluating the Womanwith Normal Menstrual Periods "My period is so regular," Margaret B. explained, "that whether or not I've started, on the thirtieth day I insert a tampon before I go to work. By noon I'm always glad I did, because otherwise I would have had an accident."When I hear this type of menstrual history, I'm almost certain that the woman is ovulating each month. My attention turns immediately to diagnosing other fertility problems. However, on the outside chance that nature is tricking us into complacency, I ask the woman to keep a basal body temperature (BBT) chart for a couple of months or monitor her urine for an LH-surge. When accurately kept, the BBT will confirm the timing of ovulation and will help me properly schedule other tests. Interpreting the Basal Bobby Temperature Chart The normal ovulatory pattern: Measure your basal (resting) body temperature first thing in the morning�even before getting out of bed. During the f follicular phase (the first half of your cycle) the "normal" BBT pattern should show only slight variations in your temperature (under 98 degrees). In response to progesterone produced at midcycle by the corpus luteum, your BBT will rise about a half degree (to about 98.4) and should remain elevated until your next period begins. The two or three days preceding the temperature elevation are your most fertile. After your temperature rises, the odds of initiating a pregnancy become minimal. By reviewing this data over two to three months, you can usually predict your most fertile days.Failure to ovulate: If your temperature remains relatively constant throughout your cycle, you did not ovulate. Short luteal phase: If you are undergoing ovulation induction treatment, you will want to pay particular attention to the fourteen days following ovulation. Should your period start within ten days of the temperature rise, you may have a progesterone deficiency (luteal phase defect). Without an adequate progesterone supply the uterine lining will not develop properly and the embryo will fail to thrive. Sustained temperature rise: A sustained rise in your temperature�beyond the date for your next period�should make you jump for joy because you are probably pregnant! Additional data: Variations in temperature levels aren't the only data recorded on BBT charts. You can also indicate the days you menstruate (with an X), the days you have sex, the day you feel mittleschmerz (the twinge of pain associated with ovulation), and days when you are ill or out of sorts. When kept with care, this record can provide valuable information for planning your fertility treatment. Table 11-1 explains how to keep your chart. Don't get too uptight about keeping the BBT chart. If doing so causes you problems, discuss it with your doctor and consider urinary LH testing. Although the BBT can provide important supportive data, it isn't absolutely necessary. Your peace of mind is far more important than creating a graphic history of your sex and reproductive life. Table 11-1 How to KeepYour Basal Body Temperature Chart Begin taking your temperature on the morning your menstrual period ends. Shake down the thermometer the night before and place it on a bedside table. At your first waking moment take your temperature by inserting the thermometer in your mouth, vagina, or rectum for five minutes. Do not vary your procedure from day to day or month to month. Use a clock to time yourself. DO NOT smoke a cigarette, eat or drink, or get up to go to the bathroom or to go find your thermometer before taking your temperature. Record the thermometer reading on your chart under the correct day of your cycle (day 1 is the first day of your period). Record the days you have sex by placing an arrow at the bottom of the column. Record the days of your menstrual flow with an X. Record mittleschmerz if you feel it. Note any exceptions on your chart�for example, if you are ill, did not get a good night's sleep, or are running a fever. Also mark when your doctor performs any tests and what they are. Wash the thermometer with cool soapy water, rinse it, shake it down, and place it in its protective case beside your bed. Some people prefer to use alcohol or disposable plastic thermometer protectors. Repeat this procedure every day until your next period begins. Each month start taking your temperature on the morning your menstrual period ends. Take your charts to every doctor's appointment. Living with BBT Keeping the BBT chart is an inexpensive method for observing your menstrual cycle and hormonal system at work and an indirect method for ballparking when ovulation will occur. BBT charts will help indicate your most fertile days, so you can plan sex at the "right" time of the month. I've had some women tell me in total frustration that they're ready to flush their thermometer down the toilet. "If I have to plot another flat line, I think I'll scream. Every morning the mercury reminds me that I'm a failure."I have a few suggestions that may help you put BBT charting into proper perspective: Think of taking your temperature like brushing your teeth: you do it without even thinking. The BBT is more convenient because you don't even have to get out of bed to do it. Make BBT charting into a game. see which one of you can guess the day that your temperature will rise. The one who wins gets taken out to eat (at the other's expense, of course!). If you are the analytical type, use your calculator or personal computer to calculate median temperature during the follicular phase, percent differ-ence to the luteal phase, and standard deviations. Where else could you find so much data to analyze? Compare BBT charts at your fertility support group meetings. Award ribbons for those with the flattest line, for those with the highest midcycle temperature rise, and for those couples who had sex even during their infertile days. Urinary LH testing Although serum progesterone tests BBT's and endometrial biopsy can indicate whether you have ovulated, these do not help pinpoint the actual day of ovulation. The BBT is not helpfu to tell you when you need to have sex or have an insemination in any particular month. The urinary LH test is a test picks up the rise in LH that occurs about 24 hours before ovulation. While older kits required up to one hour to perform, newer tests are more accurate and can be performed in a few minutes. The test kit can be purchased without a prescription and can easily be carried in the woman's purse. Testing begins a few days before expected ovulation. If you cycles last 28 days I recommend testing start on cycle day 12. When the woman is taking clomiphene testing can start four days after the last pill is taken. The testing is best carried out mid to late morning (for most kits). I ask my patients to save all the sticks so they can be compared from day to day, or they can be brought to the office if there is a question about when the surge really started. If the LH surge stick does not change color after about six days, I recommend checking an ultrasound or blood progesterone levels to make sure the surge was not missed. Taking an Endometrial Biopsy By examining a tiny piece of uterine tissue, I can evaluate how well prepared your uterus is to accept an embryo. I use the LH surge test and your menstrual history to time the biopsy one to three days before your next period begins. I will have mny patients call the office when they detect an LH surge. We will schedule the surge 12-13 days later. I recommend avoiding intercourse durig the month the biopsy is scheduled or recommending that a blood pregnancy test be checked to insure that an early pregnancy won't be interrupted. With few rare exceptions (where the egg remains trapped in the follicle, a condition called luteinized unruptured follicle or immunologic abnormalities), a normal endometrial biopsy confirms that you are ovulating, that you have an adequate luteal phase, and that your uterine environment will support an embryo. I'll discuss more about the endometrial biopsy in chapter 19. If a woman's menstrual cycle appears normal, I proceed down different diagnostic paths. However, if any of these test results look suspicious, I treat her as I would a woman with abnormal menstrual periods. Read on to learn how I diagnose menstrual abnormalities.

Can you ovulate? Once I've answered these questions, I have a good idea of what'scausing your fertility problem. I'd like to share this information with you, as well as some ofthe questions and concerns my patients have brought up from timeto time. What Makes You Have a Period? Normally each month estrogen and progesterone stimulate the growthof the uterine lining. When the progesterone-producing corpusluteum deteriorates toward the end of the cycle, "progesteronewithdrawal bleeding" occurs: you have a period. Waves ofvasoconstriction (blood vessel spasms) restrict the blood supplyto the endometrium and thus provoke the onset of menses. At theconclusion of menses, clotting factors seal off exposed bleedingsites, and resumed estrogen production begins restoring the endometrium. Initial Tests Several basic tests will help determine why your periods are abnormal.Table 12-1, "Diagnostic Approaches for Irregular MenstrualPeriods or Amenorrhea," which appears later in this chapter,will give you an overview of the diagnostic approaches used todetermine if you are ovulating and the conditions that can interferewith ovulation and menses. Pregnancy Test This may seem surprising, but pregnancy is the single most commonreason for women reporting to me that their periods have stopped.Before I initiate any type of fertility treatment, I conduct apregnancy test to rule out the possibility of pregnancy. Cervical Mucus Smear Normally the cervical mucus is thick and relatively imperviousto the outer environment. Throughout the first half of the cycle,increasing amounts of estrogen produced by the ovary cause themucus to "fern." When placed on a slide and dried, theestrogen-primed mucus crystals form a beautiful fern-like pattern.Around the time of ovulation, high estrogen levels transform themucus into a clear, watery, viscous fluid that sperm can easilytransverse. After ovulation progesterone from the corpus luteum"opposes" the action of the estrogen, and the mucusonce again thickens. I use this simple test to tell me if you'veovulated during this cycle. If you have not yet ovulated, I willobserve the telltale ferning. I will then perform the progesteronewithdrawal test to find out if you are capable of menstruating. Vaginal Ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound is a sample painless procedure that can be performed in less than 15 minutes. It provides helpful information that unlocks the clues to your ovulation problem. This picture demonstrates a 12mm "triple-line" pattern indicating normal estrogen stimulation. As your follicles develop and release estrogen, the uterine lining thickens and takes on a very specific appearance. Immediately prior to ovulation in a natural cycle, the endometrium measures 8-12mm andfollicles reach 20-24mm, while if you are receiving ovulation medication follicles may be ready at 16-18mm. After ovulation, the endometrial echo (shadow) becomes more opaque (white) indicating that the corpus luteum is now making progesterone. If your ovaries are not making estrogen the endometrium will be thinner, 6mm or less and the ovaries will usually contain either many small follicles surrounding the margin of the ovary (polycystic ovaries) or no follicles at all. This may be due to ovarian failure or abnormal hormonal stimulation. You will soon learn how I can decide which is causing your menstrual cycle problems. Progesterone Withdrawal Test The progesterone withdrawal test will confirm if your uterus iscapable of menstruating. If it is, then the cause of your menstrualirregularity lies with your hormonal systems. If your uterus cannot"bleed," then the problem lies with the uterus itself. I can bring on your period either by giving you oral progesteroneover a five- or ten-day period or by giving you a progesteroneinjection. After taking the progesterone, your period should beginwithin fourteen to twenty days. Positive Response to Progesterone Withdrawal If progesterone withdrawal causes your period to start up, asit did with Kathy S., I learn a number of things. First, I know that your ovaries are producing enough estrogento build up your uterine lining. I also know that your uterusis capable of responding to estrogen and progesterone stimulation.Since your uterus is functioning normally, your fertility problemlies somewhere in your hormonal system. Second, you are failing to menstruate because you are failingto ovulate. For some reason your pituitary is not producing theLH spike necessary to release the ovum from your follicle. Two conditions must exist before your pituitary will release anLH surge: The follicles growing in your ovaries must release enoughestrogen to signal your pituitary that it's time to release theLH surge-in other words, that at least one egg has reached maturity.And your pituitary gland must be capable of generating the LHspike. I may suspect that your hypothalamus just isn't prodding yourpituitary well enough. If your follicles do not grow to maturity,you'll never produce enough estrogen to trigger the LH spike torelease the egg and thus ovulate. A pituitary malfunction cancause the same problem; however, in Kathy's case, I suspecteda hypothalamic insufficiency from excess running. "How can you be sure?" Kathy asked. "Well, that's exactly what my next series of tests will show.I want to make sure that other systems in your body are not adverselyaffecting your hormonal system." Negative Response to Progesterone Withdrawal: Repeating the ProgesteroneWithdrawal After Estrogen Stimulation Like Kathy, most women will "bleed" in response to progesteronewithdrawal. However, if you don't, it's possible that your estrogensupply is not adequate to stimulate uterine lining growth. Ifyour uterus is normal, taking estrogen to prime the growth ofthe uterine lining should guarantee that you'll have a periodafter progesterone withdrawal. So we'll try it again-this timegiving you estrogen before the progesterone, just to be sure. If the estrogen/progesterone-stimulated cycle fails to producea "bleed," it means that your uterus cannot respondto estrogen and progesterone stimulation: we've pinpointed youruterus as the problem. My next step will be to examine the insideof your uterus. (I'll discuss uterine abnormalities, hysteroscopy, saline sonohysterography, D&C, and uterine X-ray procedures in chapters 16 and 19.) Positive Withdrawal to Estrogen/Progesterone Stimulation When you have a period after taking estrogen and progesterone,I know that your uterus is capable of menstruating. The reasonyou have not been menstruating is that your ovaries are not producingadequate amounts of estrogen. At this stage in the diagnosticprocedures we don't know for certain why your ovaries are notproducing estrogen, but several possibilities exist: Your ovaries are not capable of producing estrogen, Your hypothalamus is not stimulating your pituitary to release FSH and LH, whichcontrol follicular development and estrogen production, Your pituitary is unable to produce adequate amounts of LH and FSH, Other hormonal imbalances are tricking your pituitary into"thinking" that it's doing a good job when, in fact,it is not. Since estrogen stimulation is vital for the growth of the uterinelining, I will measure your estrogen hormone levels to confirmthis diagnosis before venturing into new diagnostic territories.I'll may also do a cytology smear to look at estrogen stimulationof your vaginal cells. In addition, I'll measure your FSH levelto rule out ovarian failure. (A high FSH level indicates thatthe ovaries have been severely damaged or have run out of eggs.) Detecting Ovarian Failure Ovarian failure occurs when your ovaries are severely damagedor when they run out of eggs. When this happens, your pituitarygland tries to force your ovary to manufacture estrogen and toovulate by working overtime to produce FSH. The pituitary gland'ssignals fall on deaf ears, though, because the damaged ovariescannot respond to the extra FSH stimulation. Ovarian failure may be caused by a number of conditions includinginfection, chemical toxins, medications, radiation exposure, tumor, surgery, immunologic dysfunctionand genetic abnormalities. Unfortunately ovarian failure is rarelyreversible. However, ovarian failure due to infection or endometriosiswill sometimes respond to treatment. Since a diagnosis of ovarianfailure can be distressing, I always repeat the FSH test beforerecommending donor eggs or other alternatives. Diagnosing Anovulation Once we've ruled out uterine abnormalities and ovarian failure,we've confirmed that your periods are irregular because you arenot ovulating (anovulation). For some reason your pituitaryis not sending adequate amounts of LH and FSH to your ovaries.However, I have good news: the failure to ovulate, which affects25 percent of infertile women, responds very well to treatment. Symptoms of Anovulation Although a few anovulatory women will have normal periods, mostwill have few or no periods at all (amenorrhea). Prolonged orheavy periods (menorrhagia), spotting during the middle of thecycle (metrorrhagia), and prolonged spotting may also occur. Womenwith anovulatory menstrual periods do not experience the typicalmenstrual discomforts often found in ovulatory women: breast soreness,mood changes, or cramping. The anovulatory woman's BBT chart willbe flat (monophasic) and her cervical mucus will fern, indicatingthat progesterone (produced by the corpus luteum that forms afterovulation) never opposes the estrogen stimulation. Tests Used to Determine the Cause of Anovulation In the next phase of testing I try to determine why your pituitarygland is not stimulating your ovaries to ovulate. I need to answera number of questions: Is your hypothalamus not "beating the drum" by producing regular pulses of GnRH? Is your pituitary gland damaged? Is your pituitary gland getting misleading feedback messages aboutovarian function? Several tests will give me the additional answers I need. Tables12-1, "Diagnostic Approaches for Irregular Menstrual Periodsor Amenorrhea," and 12-2, "Hormonal Tests for Diagnosingthe Cause of Anovulation," profile which tests I may order. Table 12-1 Diagnostic Approaches Used to Determine If You Are Ovulating If You Have Irregular Menstrual Periods or Amenorrhea Pregnancy test Basal body temperature (BBT) Cervical mucus smear Transvaginal ultrasound Progesterone withdrawal If progesterone withdrawal does not result in a period:      Administer estrogen and repeat progesterone withdrawal  If estrogen/progesterone withdrawal does result in a period:      Cytology smear (to look at estrogen stimulation of vaginal cells)      Estrogen blood test      FSH test (if not elevated, may indicate pituitary          or hypothalamic failure)If estrogen/progesterone withdrawal does not result in a period:      Hysteroscopy (telescopic exam of uterine interior)       Hysterosalpingogram (uterine X ray)      FSH test (if elevated, may indicate ovarian failure due to          genetic abnormality: may perform chromosome analysis) Table 12-2 Hormonal Tests for Diagnosing the Cause of Anovulation Prolactin Pituitary Hormone Excessive prolactin can suppress pituitary output (LH and FSH)and can act directly on the ovary to suppress follicular growth. Thyroid Hormone Hyper- and hypothyroidism can interfere with hormonal metabolism(the rate at which hormones are used up by the body) and withthe delicate hormonal balance between the pituitary and ovary.In addition, through an intriguing mechanism (explained later)hypothyroidism may contribute to excess prolactin production. FSH and LH Pituitary Hormones Elevated FSH almost always indicates ovarian failure. If FSH andLH are depressed, I suspect one of three things: that a faultyhormonal feedback mechanism is inappropriately telling the pituitaryto cut back production; that the hypothalamus is not "beatingthe drum" to stimulate the pituitary to function; or thata pituitary inadequacy prevents the gland from functioning normally. Adrenal Androgens (DHEAS and Testosterone) In the presence of excessive hair (hirsutism) or male secondarysex characteristics (enlarged clitoris or ambiguous genitalia),elevated male hormone (testosterone), elevated DHEAS, or elevatedadrenal androgens may indicate a congenital enzymatic defect,polycystic ovaries, or a tumor in the pituitary gland, adrenalgland, or ovary. Testosterone or adrenal androgens can suppressovulation as well as cause a number of other problems discussedlater. Solving the Mystery of Anovulation Twenty percent of ovulation failures result from stress, obesity,diet excessive androgen production, thyroid gland dysfunction,or excess prolactin. In the sections that follow, I will explainhow these conditions can be identified and treated to resolvefertility problems. Chapter 14 describes ovulation induction treatment,which I may use if you have idiopathic anovulation (unknown cause)and which I may also use with some of the conditions discussedbelow. Coming Off the Pill Let me lay one fear to rest. It's very unlikely that oral contraceptivescause amenorrhea or anovulation. Oh, but you say, when you stoppedthe Pill, your periods never returned. Or perhaps they returnedbut were irregular and spotty. To that I must ask, "What were your periods like before youtook the Pill?" Usually the answer is "My periods wereirregular. But I've had regular periods ever since I began takingthe Pill." So what's happening? Oral contraceptives do suppress ovulation;however, your uterine lining continues to cycle between developmentand shedding. Can you guess why you have a period? You may alreadyknow that the Pill contains estrogen and progesterone. When youstop taking the Pill for one week each month, you experience estrogenand progesterone withdrawal, and so you begin to menstruate. Somethingelse happens that's also logical. You don't cramp, you don't bloat,and you don't become depressed-and that's because you don't ovulate.(Women who do cramp and bloat on the Pill may have other problems,which should be discussed with their physician.) Each year thousands of women go off the Pill, and within two tofour months they begin ovulating. If it is their goal, they soonbecome pregnant. However, a few women stop the Pill and resumean abnormal menstrual pattern, which may indicate that they arenot ovulating. For some it's possible that a fertility problem arose while theywere taking the Pill. The cyclical action of the Pill may havemasked the symptoms (menstrual irregularities) until they stoppedtaking it. This is why some doctors recommend that you stop takingthe Pill for a few months every couple of years: to see if everythingis still working normally. I do not recommend this practice, however,since one frequent side effect of this procedure is pregnancy.To me it does not make any more sense to go off the Pill everycouple of years than to stop using condoms to see if you can stillget pregnant. The few women who do become anovulatory as a direct result ofusing the Pill usually respond very well to ovulation inductiontreatment with clomiphene (Serophene/Clomid). (Chapter 14 describes how Serophene can be used to restore ovulation.) Hypothalamic Malfunction We suspect that a number of conditions may adversely affect hypothalamicperformance: emotional stress, endorphins (nature's painkillers,which are synthesized by the brain in response to stress and pain),extreme exercise (amenorrhea athletica), dieting, poor nutrition,weight loss, low body fat, anorexia, and drugs, toxins, or medications.I discussed many of these conditions in chapter 9. We cannot directly measure hypothalamic performance: we don'tknow for sure if the drum is beating. Sometimes, though, we canmeasure the results of insufficient hypothalamic stimulation.For example, we can test for low LH, FSH, and estrogen levelsas described in table 12-2. However, often the changes are toosubtle to detect. Except for estrogen, the test results for Kathy S., for example,were all normal. When I discovered this finding, I had to assumethat, as a result of her excessive running (stress), Kathy's hypothalamuswas not pulsing GnRH in a manner sufficient to stimulate her pituitary.As a result, her pituitary was not properly stimulating folliculargrowth, her ovaries did not produce enough estrogen, and she didnot ovulate. When I prescribed Serophene to enhance her hypothalamicactivity, she began to ovulate. You'll learn more about Kathy'sexperience with ovulation induction in chapter 14. Pituitary Gland Malfunction Hormones from the pituitary gland control a number of "chemicalfactories" throughout your body: your adrenal gland, yourthyroid gland, and your ovaries, to mention a few. When your pituitarymalfunctions, many different systems can break down. The singlemost common end result, however, is an excess production of prolactin(hyperprolactinemia). Hyperprolactinemia Nearly 10 percent of women with irregularperiods and 20 percent of women with no obvious cause for amenorrheahave elevated prolactin levels. One-third of these women may havea milky discharge from their breasts (galactorrhea) and one-thirdof them will have a pituitary tumor (adenoma). Almost always benign,these tumors respond well to drug therapy (bromocriptine) andto surgery. You may wish to refer to table 12-3, "FactorsCausing Elevated Prolactin Levels," for an overview. Excessive Exercise, Stress, or Suckling Excessive stress and/or exercise may cause hyperprolactinemia.In addition, nursing a baby will release prolactin, nature's birthcontrol hormone. When you stop nursing, relieve the source ofyour stress, or take Parlodel (bromocriptine), your prolactinlevels will drop and ovulation will return. Hypothyoroidism When your thyroid hormone production drops below normal, an intriguingchemical process leads to excess prolactin. Your hypothalamusalso controls thyroid hormone levels by producing TRH (thyroid-releasinghormone) which tells your pituitary to make TSH (thyroid-stimulatinghormone). When your thyroid gland cannot respond to these chemicalsignals, your hypothalamus senses that there isn't enough thyroidhormone around, so it produces more TRH, saying, "Get towork. We need more thyroid hormone." Due to a unique chemical association, TRH also tells your pituitaryto release more prolactin. The excess prolactin not only interfereswith pituitary function but also exerts a direct inhibitory effecton the ovary itself. Taking a thyroid supplement to quiet yourhypothalamus will usually correct this chemical imbalance andrestore ovulation. Elevated Adrenal Androgens (DHEAS) We also find elevated adrenal androgens (male hormones) in one-thirdof women with excess prolactin. I'll discuss how these hormonescan interfere with ovulation in the section on hormonal feedbackbelow. Severe Kidney Disease Severe kidney disease, which impairs the body's ability to purifyand filter the blood, may also result in the buildup of prolactinhormone. Dialysis, kidney transplants, or better management ofthe kidney disease may restore fertility to these women. The discussionon hepatorenal disease below will tell more about managing thisdisorder. Medications Certain medications may increase prolactin levels: phenothiazinesand other tranquilizers; tricyclic antidepressants; methyldopa(Aldomet, an antihypertensive); Reserpine (antihypertensive);and narcotics. When these drugs are withdrawn, prolactin levelswill return to normal. If you are concerned about a particularmedication that you are taking, discuss it with your doctor. Table 12-3 Factors Causing Elevated Prolactin Levels Neurologic Suckling Stress Hypothyroidism Metabolic Exercise Kidney failure Medications Phenothiazines and other tranquilizers Tricyclic antidepressants Methyldopa (Aldomet, antihypertensive) Reserpine (antihypertensive) Narcotics Birthcontrol Pills Excess Androgens Polycystic ovary Adrenal disease Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Pituitary Prolactin-secreting tumor Empty sella syndrome Growth hormone secreting tumor Treatment for Hyperprolactinemia The nature of your treatment depends on the cause of the elevatedprolactin. Table 12-4, "Treatment for Hyperprolactinemia,"explains a number of treatment options. Except for obvious systemicproblems such as thyroid inadequacy and kidney failure, I usuallyprescribe Parlodel to lower prolactin levels. Parlodel will alsoreduce pituitary tumor size, should one be present. An oral medicationtaken with meals, Parlodel as few side effects, is relativelyinexpensive, and-should you get pregnant-will not adversely affectyour baby. Women with hyperprolactinemia respond well to thismedication and their fertility usually returns quite quickly. Table 12-4 Treatment for Hyperprolactinemia Pituitary tumor Parlodel (bromocriptine) Surgery/X-ray therapy Thyroid insufficiency Thyroid hormone supplement Adrenal androgen excess Parlodel Cortisol Surgery/X-ray therapy Kidney failure Kidney transplant Dialysis Empty sella syndrome Parlodel Medication Terminate or change medication Idiopathic (unknown) Parlodel Pituitary Gland Failure Damaged Pituitary Gland If your pituitary gland has been damaged by surgery, tumor, radiationtherapy, and/or excessive bleeding during childbirth (Sheehan'ssyndrome), it may not be able to produce LH and FSH hormones inadequate amounts. To restore function to your ovaries, and yourfertility, I must replace these hormones. Pergonal/Humegon/Puregon (LH and FSH) and Metrodin (FSH)are common medications used for this purpose. (See chapter14.) Cushing's Disease Though rare, Cushing's disease is characterized by elevated adrenal stimulating hormone (ACTH) secreted from a pituitary tumor. If you have thisdisease, you will have excess androgens (male hormones) and possiblyexcess prolactin (found in 20 percent of women with Cushing'sdisease). To diagnose this condition, I ask my patients to take a low dose steroid pill at bedtime and I check a cortisol level early the next morning. If detected, this condition can often be corrected by surgicallyremoving the pituitary tumor. Empty Sella Syndrome Empty sella syndrome occurs when spinal fluid leaks into the bonychamber (fossa) housing your pituitary gland. Empty sella syndromemay happen because of a congenital weakness, surgery, trauma,or a pituitary tumor. When pressure from the spinal fluid compressesthe pituitary gland against the bony walls of the fossa, you maylose LH- and FSH-producing cells, and you may lose your fertility.Lowering your prolactin levels with Parlodel (bromocriptine) andsupplementing your LH and FSH levels with gonadotropins (FSH+/-LH)should correct your fertility problem. Hormonal Feedback Problems Affecting Your Pituitary Gland Many systems in your body can trick your pituitary gland intoproducing fewer ovarian stimulants. Like production supervisors,your hypothalamus and pituitary gland monitor ovarian performanceby sensing levels of estrogen and other chemicals circulatingin your blood. In this way the pituitary knows when to speed upor slow down ovarian production. However, when other hormonesget out of balance, the feedback messages from your ovaries becomedistorted and your hypothalamus and pituitary gland respond inappropriately.When this happens, your periods become irregular and you stopovulating. Hepatorenal Disease Hepatorenal diseases affect your body's ability to filter impuritiesfrom your blood. Both your liver (hepato-) and your kidneys(-renal) remove toxins and "old" hormones fromyour system. If estrogen or adrenal androgens (see discussionof adrenal disease below) are allowed to build up in your blood,they tell the pituitary, "Stop stimulating the ovaries. Don'tsend out any more LH and FSH." The hypothalamus mistakenlythinks that your elevated estrogen supply is coming from ripeningfollicles. When the pituitary responds to this message by slowingdown FSH production, your immature follicles fail to develop andyou stop ovulating. If you have this problem, artificial blood filtration methodssuch as dialysis may not be adequate to restore your fertility.Pregnancy may not be advisable, however, since it may place anundue strain on your already compromised physical condition. Onceyour physician arrests the disease and the filtration systemswork, your fertility will return. Adrenal Disease (DHEAS) Adrenal diseases usually cause two feedback problems: both excessadrenal androgens and, in 30 percent of these cases, excess prolactin(see above) will lower LH and FSH production and cause anovulation.Several different conditions may contribute to DHEAS elevation: Psychological or physical stress Pituitary, ovarian, or adrenal tumors Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (an inherited disorder) Fortunately 30 to 40 percent of the women having mild DHEAS elevationwill respond to ovulation induction therapy, without my havingto treat the basic cause of the DHEAS elevation. If your prolactinhormone is also elevated, Parlodel will reduce both your prolactinand androgen levels Women with high androgen levels will show signs of virilization,such as growing a mustache (hirsutism). In these cases I mustfind out what's causing the elevated androgens and treat thiscondition. Elevated adrenal androgens are associated with Cushing'ssyndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or polycystic ovaries. Cushing's Syndrome Cushing's syndrome, another rare disorder, can be identified bythe presence of "buffalo hump" (characteristic lumpof excess fat located between the shoulder blades), water retention(edema), high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, weakness,bruising, moon face, acne, hirsutism, and menstrual dysfunction.If you have these classic symptoms, I'll run a test to determineif you have an androgen-secreting tumor. If you do not have atumor, low-dose cortisol medication will get your adrenal androgenproduction under control and your fertility will return. If thetest shows you do have a tumor, surgical removal of the tumorwill restore your ability to ovulate. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia The classic symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia includesignificant androgen excess, excessive hair growth, and an enlargedclitoris (clitoromegaly). If you have this inherited disorder,you may be shorter than your peers and you may have a family historyof this disease Because of an enzyme deficiency, you cannot make cortisol. Sothe chemicals that your body normally uses to synthesize cortisolbuild up, and your body uses them to make androgens. The excesslevels of androgens suppress ovulation. I can screen for this disorder with a simple blood test for 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The results may lead me to give you an injection of ACTH into your vein and repeating the blood test. I can treat this disorder by supplementing your cortisol supply. When I replace your missinghormone, you will stop pumping out the chemicals to make cortisoland your androgen levels will return to normal When this happens,you will begin to ovulate. I will continue to supplement yourcortisol supply throughout your pregnancy, with no risk to yourbaby. Polycystic Ovaries Polycystic ovaries occur in 4 percent of women. Women having polycysticovaries are frequently but not necessarily obese, have few if any menstrual periods,and have abnormal hair growth, which increases with the passageof time. Polycystic ovaries are frequently associated with: Ovarian or adrenal dysfunction Ovarian or adrenal tumors Insulin Resistance (Pre-diabetes) Adrenal hyperplasia Cushing's disease Hyperprolactinemia Thyroid disorders Although many different conditions may cause polycystic ovaries,the basic mechanism for excess androgen production appears tobe the same. The theca cells in the ovary make androgen. (Youmay want to refer to the illustrations of the female reproductivetract and hormone system.) Normally the follicular(granulosa) cells convert this androgen to estrogen. When thischemical process fails, androgens build up, the follicle failsto mature fully, and the immature ovum remains trapped in theovary. As the next menstrual cycle begins, last month's deteriorated,malfunctioning follicle continues to manufacture androgens. Thislocal supply of male hormone now interferes with new folliculargrowth. Month after month follicles form, fail to rupture, and continueproducing androgens until the ovary becomes cystic and can nolonger function. If I could see these ovaries, they would appearenlarged, smooth, and pearly white: a result of long-term LH stimulationwithout subsequent ovulation. When I find your LH level higher than your FSH level, I can bealmost certain you have polycystic ovaries. If you are thin, laboratorytests will probably indicate that you also have elevated DHEASand normal estrogen levels. If you are obese, I will probablyfind that you have elevated estrogens, because your fat cellsare converting your excess DHEAS to estrogen. Thirty to 40 percentof the women with polycystic ovaries will also have elevated prolactin,and many will have abnormally high DHEAS and other androgen levels.If androgen levels are extremely high, I will look for an adrenalor ovarian tumor. I may find a darkening of your skin under your arms, beneath your breasts and on the nape of your neck. This discoloration, called acanthosis nigricans, may indicate a condition called HAIR-AN syndrome. (hyperandrogenism insulin resistance acanthosis nigricans). While the exact reason that elevated insulin levels interfere with ovulation is not yet known many theories exist. And, we do know that women with elevated insulin levels usually are obese and have elevated androgen levels. While exercise, diet and weight loss are the mainstays for treating this disorder, a new drug, Metformin, offers promise. We no longer recommend the wedge resection (removal of part ofthe ovary) once performed for polycystic ovaries. Although thisprocedure often temporarily restores fertility by reducing theamount of androgen production, the surgery permanently reducesyour fertility potential by removing egg-filled tissues. In addition,there's a significant risk for adhesion formation, which can alsoimpair fertility. If you are undergoing laparoscopy I can use lasers or electrosurgical needles to"shoot" cystic follicles and destroy their androgen-producingcapabilities. This surgical procedure may correct an ovulation for a short period of time allowing you to conceive without ovulation induction medication. Unfortunately, after three or four months your ovulation abnormality will return if you do not conceive. Although many women with polycystic ovaries will respond to Seropheneother more potent and expensive ovulation induction techniques are often required. You may also requireParlodel and/or cortisol to lower prolactin and androgen levels. If you have polycystic ovaries, you have a good chance for pregnancy, but finding the ovulation induction scheme that works best for you requires careful planning and monitoring. As I monitor your cycles, I may be forced to change medications or dosages or even cancel a cycle. After you have completed a treatment cycle, my nurse practitioner and I will review your treatment and, if you do not conceive a plan will be established for another cycle. I'll discuss more about ovulation induction in chapter 14. Hypo/hyperthyroidism Hypo/hyperthyroidism also distorts the hormonal feedback mechanism.Too little thyroid production (hypo-) may cause two fertilityproblems: increased prolactin levels and persistent estrogen stimulation.(See "Hyperprolactinemia" above.) Hypothyroidism slowsdown your metabolism and causes "old" estrogens to buildup in your blood. This persistent estrogen stimulation tricksyour hypothalamus into believing that your ovary is producingenough estrogen, so it tells your pituitary to reduce LH and FSHstimulation. When this happens, your follicles fail to matureand your ovaries do not produce enough estrogen to trigger theLH spike necessary for ovulation. A thyroid hormone supplementwill lower your prolactin levels and improve your estrogen metabolism. If your thyroid is underactive, I will check for antibodies that attack your thyroid gland. When your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism),your increases and prematurely burns up your estrogen supply soyou become hypoestrogenic: you don't have enough estrogen. Sincethe pituitary never senses that your follicle has reached maturity(signaled by elevated estrogen), it does not release the LH spiketo trigger ovulation. Oddly enough, taking a thyroid supplementmay turn off the o veractive thyroid gland and return thyroidhormone levels to normal, so that normal ovulatory cycles resume.Surgery to remove the overactive thyroid gland is sometimes necessary. Obesity Obesity can also lead to insulin resistance and persistent estrogen stimulation. Thelarge number of fat cells in women weighing over two hundred poundsmanufacture enough estrogen to interfere with the ovary-pituitaryfeedback system. The elevated estrogen tells the hypothalamusand pituitary to stop stimulating follicular development. Whenyou reduce your weight through dieting and a moderate exerciseprogram, fertility will resume. The successful treatment of hormonal feedback problems affectingthe hypothalamus and pituitary gland generally results in pregnancy.Sometimes these women may also require ovulation induction techniques,discussed in chapter 14. Ovarian Abnormalities Cysts, tumors, infections, and endometriosis can interfere withthe delicate hormonal balance of the ovary and depress follicledevelopment. Surgical removal of abnormal tissues (cysts, tumors, and endometriosis)will often restore ovarian function. Although antibiotic therapywill clear up the infections and restore ovulation I frequentlybecome concerned about the condition of the fallopian tubes followingan infection. I'll discuss more about resolving tubal problemsin chapter 16. Premature Ovarian Failure Premature ovarian failuresimply means that the ovaries run out of follicles. For unknownreasons some women go through menopause at an early age. There'sevidence that a few of these women may have developed an autoimmunereaction to their own ovarian tissue. When this occurs, antibodiesform, attack the ovaries, and destroy vital structures. Other reasons include: surgery, trauma, radiation, and chromosomal. Unfortunately, most of the time we do not know why the ovaries fail prematurely. We canconfirm this diagnosis by finding elevated FSH levels. Unfortunately, when you run out of eggs, you cannot make a baby.However, there are new technologies (oocyte donation) that allow you to experience a normal pregnancy and give birth to a baby. I'll talk more about these wondrous possibilitiesin chapter 21. For a quick overview of the sources of ovulatory and menstrualproblems, you may wish to examine table 12-5. Table 12-5 Conditions That Can Interfere with Ovulation and Menstruation Pregnancy Hypothalamic Malfunction Emotional stress (endorphins?) Amenorrhea athletica (extreme exercise) Dieting, poor nutrition, weight loss,low body fat Anorexia Idiopathic (drugs, toxins, medications?) Pituitary Gland Malfunction Hyperprolactinemia Tumor Surgery Trauma Empty sella syndrome Sheehan's syndrome Cushing's disease Hormonal Feedback Problems Affecting Pituitary Gland Hepatorenal disease Adrenal disease Cushing's syndrome Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Polycystic ovary Hypo/hyperthyroidism Obesity (excess estrogen) Ovarian Abnormalities Ovarian cysts Endometriosis Infection Premature ovarian failure Incidental Fertility Findings Asherman's syndrome (adhesions in the uterus) Cervical stenosis (cervix closed from surgery) Idiopathic (no identifiable cause) A Note of Concern If you have amenorrhea or early menopause, I'd like to cautionyou that you may be at risk for bone decalcification (osteoporosis).Estrogen is vital for the maintenance of good bone structure.The estrogen-deficient athlete (10 to 50 percent of athletic women),for example, will suffer significant bone deterioration withinone to three years. Even if pregnancy is not your goal, you mayneed to supplement your estrogen supply to prevent fractures andirreversible bone damage. Check with your doctor.

I'm toldthat the girls' locker room can be just as intimidating as theboys'. However, delayed puberty is only one aspect of this menstrualdisorder. Many other factors ranging from anatomical abnormalitiesto genetic defects can prevent the onset of menses. Categorizing Primary Amenorrhea It's quite likely that if you have never menstruated, you've alreadyconsulted with your physician about which of the four categoriesof primary amenorrhea you fall into. You may, however, be unawareof some of the new options you may have for bearing your "own"child. The road to your "happy ending" will depend onwhich of the four categories you fall into: Women who have a normal uterus and ovaries: If yourreproductive organs are normal, you have a hormonal problem whichdeveloped prior to your going through puberty: empty sella syndrome,pituitary tumor, adrenal tumor, polycystic ovarian disease, andso forth. In some rare cases your problem may stem from an anatomicalabnormality: you may have been born with an imperforate hymen(closed vagina); with cervical stenosis (closed cervix) or without a vagina. Theseproblems affect about 40 percent of women with primary amenorrhea. Women who have a normal uterus with nonfunctional ovaries:You may have a normal uterus, but have ovaries that do not containany eggs (germinal cells). These problems affect about 30 percentof women with primary amenorrhea. Women who have a nonfunctional uterus with functional ovaries:You may have normal ovaries and a nonfunctional uterus. Theseproblems affect about 20 percent of women with primary amenorrhea. Women who have no uterus and no ovaries: You may have no ovariesand no uterus. These problems affect about 10 percent of womenwith primary amenorrhea. Treatment Options for Women with Primary Amenorrhea Normal Uterus and Ovaries If your reproductive organs are normal, but hormonal problemsare keeping you from menstruating, the treatments for hormonalimbalances outlined in chapter 12 will probably restore your fertility.Should your hymen or cervix be closed to the outside, a minorsurgical procedure will open them to allow menstrual flow. If you were born without a vagina but have a normal uterus, hysterectomy will usually be necessary to prevent a painful buildup of menstrual blood that can destroy the uterus. Your ovaries will not be removed and will enable you to use invitro techniques to harvest your eggs and fertilize themwith your husband's sperm. Pre-embryos will then be transferred to a gestational surrogatewho can carry the pregnancy. Normal Uterus with Nonfunctional Ovaries (No Eggs) If you have a normal uterus and nonfunctional ovaries, your FSHwill be elevated, indicating that your pituitary is working overtimeto stimulate follicular development. This may be because you wereborn without any eggs (Turner's syndrome) or because, due to anenzyme defect, your ovary cannot respond to FSH stimulation (resistantovary syndrome). I can confirm that you have a normal uterus withan X ray (Hysterosalpingogram). Even though your chance for having a baby seems hopeless, studiesindicate that with the proper hormonal supplement, you should beable to nurture a donor embryo in your womb. Joe and Toni H. decided to use donor eggs to achieve a pregnancy.They used Joe's sperm to fertilize the eggs retrieved from a donor who remained anonymous. I transferred three embryosto Toni's uterus after providing the necessary hormones. After a few weeks of pregnancy, her placenta provided all the necessary hormones. You may wish to read more about donor embryo transfers in chapter21. Nonfunctional Uterus with Functional Ovaries If you have normally functioning ovaries, you can have your ownbaby. One particular couple comes to mind: Gary and BridgetteD. Although her ovaries were perfectly normal, Bridgette's uterushad not developed properly. Gary and Bridgette decided travelled to Pennsylvania to undergo in vitro fertilization. Her sister agreed to carry the pregnancy and had three of the pre-embryos transferred to her uterus. Three weeks after the second try, they receiveda call telling them that they had made a miracle baby. With in vitro fertilization techniques a doctor can surgicallyretrieve (harvest) your eggs, mix them in a petri dish (in vitro)with your husband's sperm, and transfer your living embryo toa surrogate mother's womb for gestation. Nine months later youcan take home your own baby for a lifetime of joy. Although these medical techniques are feasible today, many unansweredlegal and ethical questions have been preventing widespread use.I suggest you read chapter 21 for the legal and moral issues associatedwith embryo transfers and surrogate mothers. Uterus and Ovaries Absent If you have no uterus and no ovaries, you have several optionsfor having a child. You cannot have a child genetically relatedto you, because you have no eggs to pass on your genes. A surrogatemother, however, can offer you the opportunity for having a babywho is genetically related to your husband. Using artificial inseminationtechniques, your husband can father the child and you can adoptit from the surrogate mother. If you are interested in pursuingthis type of arrangement, I suggest you read the information onsurrogate mothers in chapter 21. Another option you may wish to consider is adoption. Once theyreceive their "chosen" baby, many couples who sufferthrough years of unsuccessful infertility treatment often wonderwhy they waited so long before choosing adoption. Adoption canbe a very satisfying happy ending. Most women with primary amenorrhea can be helped. Women with hormonalimbalances can have them corrected; women with eggs and no uteruscan "hire" a gestational surrogate; women with a womb and noeggs can give birth using donor oocytes; and women with no reproductiveorgans can consider a surrogate mother relationship. With theaid of "miracle medicine," nearly all of the women withprimary amenorrhea can look forward to a happy ending.

With the use of ultrasound monitoringand "instant'' hormone assays, ovulation induction has becomea science instead of a shot in the dark as it once was. The medicationsand monitoring techniques work so well that when you fail to getpregnant, I must suspect some other interfering and perhaps undiagnosedcondition. Individualized treatment is far more effective than a preset regimen.Because of this, it is difficult for me to say, for example, thatyou will be given a certain dosage for so many months and thendouble that dosage for a certain number of months and so forth.Your doctor will determine the best course of treatment basedon your unique response to the medication. I canonly share with you what I do, and help you to understand my reasoning.With this knowledge you will be better equipped to understandwhat your doctor does and to ask questions about your particularsituation. Ovulation Induction: Screening Candidates Minimum Prerequisites The minimum prerequisites for ovulation induction therapy arethe same as those for fertility. The woman needs one open (patent)fallopian tube and an ovary that is able to produce mature eggs.To ensure the best possible response to the medication, all otherfertility problems such as abnormal day 3 FSH or clomiphene challengetest, excess prolactin levels, endometriosis, uterine abnormalities,and inadequate sperm should be ruled out. Progesterone Withdrawal The progesterone withdrawal test will determine which ovulationinduction regimen will work best for you: Clomid, Serophene (clomiphenecitrate), Pergonal (human menopausal gonadotropin), or a relativelynew treatment option, GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Thinkfor a moment about what the progesterone withdrawal test reveals. If you menstruate in response to the test, your pituitary is stimulatingyour ovaries to make some estrogen. In order to do this, bothyour hypothalamus and pituitary gland must be intact and working-atleast to some extent. So by prescribing Serophene I can trickyour hypothalamus and pituitary into making more LH and FSH, whichwill "kick" your ovaries into high gear. About 20 percentof women treated with Serophene will not ovulate. They may respond,however, to a combination of Serophene and Metrodin treatment,which I'll describe later in this chapter. If progesterone withdrawal does not cause you to have aperiod, I suspect a uterine abnormality or that your hypothalamusand/or pituitary cannot stimulate your ovaries to make estrogen.Once I've eliminated uterine abnormalities as your problem, youbecome a candidate for gonadotropin hormone replacement therapywith GnRH or Humegon/Pergonal (LH and FSH) or Metrodin (FSH).Women with low estrogen production (hypoestrogenic) respond bestto gonadotropin treatment: about two thirds of them will conceive. Women with a functional pituitary may respond to GnRH. Studiessuggest that using GnRH to stimulate a "natural'' pituitaryhormone release may improve results as well as reduce the numberof adverse side effects associated with Serophene and gonadotropininjections-hostile mucus and multiple births' for example. I'lldiscuss more about this technique later in this chapter. Clomiphene Citrate Therapy (Serophene/Clomid) Clomiphene citrate is available in two popular brand-name medicationsSerophene and Clomid. For the sake of simplicity, throughout thisdiscussion I'll refer to either of these medications as clomiphene. Clomiphene is indicated for the woman who withdraws to progesteroneand thus demonstrates an intact hypothalamus and pituitary gland.clomiphene works by stopping up the estrogen receptors on thehypothalamus and the tricking the hypothalamus into thinking thatyou don't have enough estrogen In response, the hypothalamus "beatsthe drum'' harder and your pituitary gland produces more FSH (follicle-stimulatinghormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) which initiate folliculargrowth. Clomiphene Treatment Regimen The exact procedure for clomiphene treatment will differ fromone couple another. Kathy and Stephen S. had a bumpy but fairlytypical experience. "Dr. Perloe, before we get started could you tell me exactlyhow all of this is going to work?" Kathy asked. "Sure.'' I handed her the clomiphene prescription. "Beforeyou leave I'll give you Provera pills to start your period. Inless than a week or two your period should start. If it doesn't,please call me. On the third day of your cycle I want you to begintaking 50 milligrams of clomiphene-that's one pill each day forfive consecutive days. Kathy tucked the prescription into her purse. "How does clomiphenemake me ovulate?" "As your follicles develop, they release estrogen into yourbloodstream. Normally this estrogen would tell your hypothalamusto slow down. clomiphene, though, is masking the presence of theestrogen. Thinking, that your ovary isn't working at peak efficiency,you will continue to stimulate the growth of the follicles inyour ovaries. Giving your follicles this extra boost for a fewdays will help them grow to maturity. When your estrogen levelpeaks a week or so after you stop taking the clomiphene, yourpituitary gland should release a large dose of LH to free youregg from the follicle." "Do I need any blood tests", Kathy asked. "After you take clomiphene for the first time, I like tocheck the LH and FSH blood levels a few days after clomiphene.In some women, clomiphene brings about an increase in LH but verylittle FSH increase. Or the FSH level may be very high. Bothof these situations mean pregnancy may be less likely and we'llneed to discuss your options before proceeding." "When should we have sex?" she asked. "You should ovulate around cycle days 13 to 16. Four daysafter finishing the clomiphene, you can begin testing for theLH surge by using a simple urine test kit. You don't want to startchecking too soon, because clomiphene causes a rise in LH whichmay show up on the urine test. So if you test too early you maythink you are ovulating, but, in fact you may not be ready fora few more days." Call me around cycle day 16 if you havenot seen a urinary LH surge. We can check an ultrasound to seeif you have developed follicles and the uterine lining is ready.If so, an hCG injection can trigger ovulation. If the folliclesare still small, we will increase your dose next month. If youovulate, I will recommend that you try at least three months.If it doesn't work by then, we may choose to add hCG injectionsand inseminations to try and improve the pregnancy rate. I showed her to my office door. "Now, don't get discouragedif you don't ovulate the first month. It may take several cyclesto find the right dosage for you. "Thank you, Dr. Perloe,I'll see you in a few weeks. Wish us luck.'' "You,ve got it.," About a month later Kathy called to say that the progesteronehad brought on her period and she had taken the clomiphene, hercycle day 9 LH and FSH were fine, but her urinary LH surge kitnever changed colors. It appeared that she had not ovulated. Iasked her to come in for an ultrasound. "Did I ovulate?" "Well' I'm not sure we've made that much progress. But anythingis possible. I also want to do an ultrasound examination to letme look at your ovaries to see the size and number of your follicles.That will tell us if the clomiphene is doing its job.'' I picked up the smooth vaginal ultrasound wand (transducer) andgently placed it into Kathy's vagina. "Ultrasound works bybouncing sound waves off your internal organs. We use sound wavesbecause they don,t expose you to radiation. "You won't feel a thing except me pushing against your bladderand the top of the vagina.'' I centered the probe over her rightovary. "This will produce a TV picture that shows me howmany follicles you're developing and what size they are. "There it is-a follicle 10 millimeters in diameter. Let'stry the other side.'' When I saw just two small follicles on vaginal ultrasound, I recommendeda progesterone shot so we could try again at 100 mg. "When your next period starts, I want you to increase yourdose to two tablets a day.,, "Do you think the clomiphene is going to work?,, Kathy asked. "Remember, I told you that it may take several cycles tofine-tune your dosage. If the 100-milligram dosage fails, we'llmay decide to add a few days of Metrodin injections.'' A few weeks later, after trying two clomiphene tablets (100 mg)for five days, Kathy called and told me that her BBT chart wasstill "flatter than a pancake'' and her LH stick still hadn'tchanged. She seemed a bit discouraged, but I assured her thiswasn't unusual. I recommended that she come in for another ultrasound and askedher to stop by my office for a few minutes to talk. "You think this will be the month I'll get pregnant?', I positioned the wand over her left ovary, and to my delight Ifound an 19 mm and 20 mm follicle and a thickened midcycle uterinelining measuring 12 mm. "Kathy, you should be having an LH spike any moment. I wantyou to continue testing your urine each morning. When you've hada surge, we can schedule a postcoital examination for the nextmorning. We need to know whether or not clomiphene is adverselyaffecting the quality of your cervical mucus. But, if you do nothave an LH surge by Monday, I want you to have intercourse Mondaynight and come to the office Tuesday for a postcoital test andto give you an hCG injection. This medication should free youregg within forty-two to forty-eight hours.'' Monday morning she called to say that she had not surged and wouldcome in for the postcoital test and the hCG injection. When Idid the postcoital examination, I found that Kathy's mucus wasscant and very thick. I can't say I was too surprised, since nearlyhalf of the women on clomiphene therapy suffer from mucus problems. I explained that if she did not conceive this month, I suggestedthat they try intrauterine artificial insemination (IUI) withSteven's sperm. She said that she and Steven had discussed IUIand that it was all right with both of them. Kathy returned four days later for an ultrasound and a progesteroneblood test to confirm that she'd ovulated. I was happy to reportthat I saw a large corpus luteum. Unfortunately, she did not conceive. "Don't be discouraged"' I told them. "Nearly one-thirdof all women taking this treatment have a poor postcoital testand many get pregnant with insemination. We'll check Kathy's ovariesand then give you another clomiphene prescription for next month.Go ahead and use the urinary LH test again. I believe we'll stillhave to give Kathy an hCG injection before she'll ovulate, butthere's no sense in giving the hCG injection if she has an LHspike on her own. We may need to repeat the ultrasound just beforemidcycle because the hCG must be given at exactly the right timeor it won't work. "I believe we have most of your problems under control."I leaned against the counter. "You know, it's discouragingfor me, too, when a new problem shows up in each cycle. But ifyou look at it as tackling one problem at a time, it makes solvingyour fertility problem manageable. The only thing I'm still concernedabout is Kathy's cervical mucus, you may want to try artificialinsemination.'' The next month she repeated the procedure: 100 mg of clomiphenefor five days, urinary LH test strips to detect the LH surge, ultrasound examinations until a mature follicle developed, anhCG injection to stimulate ovulation, and an intrauterine insemination.We began monitoring the development of a 16 mm follicle. Whenit reached 20 mm, I gave her hCG and told her to bring Stevenwith her the next day for IUI. "Before this is over, you are going to know as much aboutthis process as I do." I laughed. The inseminations went well, and her BBT rise confirmed that shehad ovulated and that the corpus luteum had formed. Now all wehad to do was wait. If her BBT stayed up and her period did notstart, we'd know she was pregnant. I guess it wasn't meant to happen-not that month, anyway. Kathycalled a couple of weeks later to tell me that her period hadstarted. "Don't worry,'' I said. "We've got you on the rightroutine now and it's only a matter of time. It may take threeor four normal cycles before we make that baby. If you are notpregnant after finishing three cycles we need to review all youroptions." Each month I could tell that it was becoming harder for them tokeep up their optimism. I assured them that Kathy's cycles wereworking fine on this regimen and that it was only a matter oftime. Three weeks after their third IAIH she called me. "Dr.Perloe, I think we did it. My period is four days late." Sure enough, that month, Steven and Kathy started Jamie! Diagnosising and Treating Trapped Egg Syndrome Trapped egg syndrome (luteinized unruptured follicle, LUF) seems tooccur more frequently in women taking fertility drugs and in womenwho have had pelvic inflammatory disease. When this occurs thefollicular surface fails to dissolve and release the egg, eventhough it's stimulated by an LH spike. However, the follicle continuesto evolve into the corpus luteum as expected. LUF is very difficult to detect. All of the routinelyperformed tests will indicate that you've ovulated. Your BBT willrise, your midluteal phase progesterone will be elevated, andan endometrial biopsy will be normal. So if you do not becomepregnant within four or five Serophene induced ovulatory cycles, I may perform an ultrasound scan priorto ovulation and just after your temperature rise. This noninvasiveprocedure will allow me to see your ovary, the developing follicle,and the formation of the corpus luteum. The signs of ovulationinclude: Complete disappearance of the follicle Loss of the circular shape of the follicle Thickening of the follicle wall Replacement of the clear, lucent follicle by an irregular spongy area (corpus luteum) Fluid behind the uterus To prevent trapped egg syndrome, some doctors try to further stimulatefollicular growth by giving Pergonal/Humegon (LH plus FSH). Some add Parlodel(bromocriptine) during midcycle to ensure that an elevated prolactin levelis not interfering with ovulation. Others prescribe a midcyclehCG (LH) injection to stimulate ovulation. Ultrasound examination(or if necessary a laparoscopy) will confirm the effectivenessof these approaches. Treating Clomiphene Resistance: the Metrodin Short Course If you are developing follicles with clomiphene but they are notreaching maturity, supplementing your LH and FSH with Metrodininjections may provide the results you want. With the Metrodin Short Course you usually take clomiphene from cycle day three through cycle day seven. On cycle day eight, I will have you begin Metrodin injections for three days before checking an ultrasound to see if your uterine lining has developed and a follicle is maturing. The exact procedures used during this treatment must beindividualized according to your response to the clomiphene. If,for example, ultrasound indicates that with clomiphene alone youdevelop several follicles, your doctor will have to add Metrodinvery gingerly to avoid stimulating multiple follicles. If youare quite resistant to clomiphene, however, more Metrodin may berequired. Some physicians prefer trying the short course becauseit has fewer side effects and is more convenient than Metrodin or Pergonal treatment alone (see below). Many studies show that as a rulewomen who fail to respond to clomiphene because of severe polycystic ovaries, may be poor candidates forPergonal induction therapy. Clomiphene Side Effects The most commonly observed side effect of clomiphene (Serophene,Clomid) therapy is poor cervical mucus. The anti-estrogenic effectsof the drug can prevent the mucus from thinning out and ferningin up to 50 percent of women. If the postcoital test reveals live motile spermin the mucus, pregnancy may be possible. However, in these casesI may recommend insemination with the husband's sperm (IUI),since it works very well. Ovarian cysts and enlargement occur in about 15 percent of womentaking clomiphene, but complications from them are rare. Smallpercentages of women report hot flashes, abdominal bloating, nausea,breast soreness, and visual blurring. In addition, I may heara few complaints about headaches, weight gain, fatigue, and nervoustension. Sometimes it's difficult to say whether these symptomsare due to the drug itself or to the stress of ovulation inductiontherapy. Clomiphene does not increase the odds that you'll have an earlypregnancy loss or that your baby will have birth defects. Therates of abortion, multiple pregnancies, and congenital abnormalitiesare all within normal limits. Recent studies have suggested that women who have used clomiphene for more than twelve cycles may have a greater risk of developing ovarian cancer. If they conceive, or if they have used oral contraceptives for more than one year the protective benefit reduces the risk to normal. Success Rates with Clomiphene Of the women who have a withdrawal bleed following to provera, 70 to 90 percent will ovulate in response to clomiphene citrate; and 40 to 60 percent will conceivewithin six to twelve cycles. Taking clomiphene will not make yousuper-fertile. The conception rate approaches that of normal couples:approximately 20 percent per month for women in their twenties. When clomiphenetherapy fails, other fertility factors should be examined more closely. Human Gonadotropin Therapy (Humegon, Pergonal, Metrodin) Normally the hypothalamus secretes GnRH to stimulate LH and FSHproduction by the pituitary gland. Figure11-1 The gonadotropins (LH and FSH)act on the ovaries to initiate follicular development, estrogenproduction, and ovulation. Sometimes, however, due to an intrinsicproblem with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, the pituitarycannot produce adequate amounts of these hormones. As a result,the understimulated ovaries fail to produce estrogen and failto ovulate. Typically these women will not withdraw to progesteroneunless an estrogen supplement is used to prime the growth of theuterine lining. If elevated FSH levels indicate ovarian failure,gonadotropin therapy will not be successful. The Treatment Regimen with Humegon, Pergonal or Metrodin There are many different ways to use these injectable medications, but a few standardsmust be strictly followed. Estrogen assays and ultrasound examinationsmust be performed regularly in order to avoid multiple birthsand life-threatening complications. If your doctor prescribesany of these medications without taking these precautions, I suggest you consultwith a different physician. Gonadotropin injection treatment can be very demanding and expensive, averagingabout $2,000 per treatment cycle. In addition to daily injections, the woman must come to the doctor'soffice for periodic blood tests, and for ultrasound evaluations. You and your spouse must be prepared for the rigors of this schedule or you won't make it. I'd like to share with you the experience Tammy and Ken J. hadwith Pergonal treatments for her problem with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). They had really been through the wringer. After five disappointing years I was the third doctor they had consulted. Tammy had received Pergonal before, but her doctor had used started with three ampoules of Pergonal each day and each cycle had to be canceled when she developed too many eggs. Since we have learned to begin injections at a very low dose for PCOS women, pregnancy rates have improved markedly. An added benefit of this "slow and steady" approach seems to be a lower risk of multiple births and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. So I recommended that they give it another try. Studies show that for PCOS women, a month or two of pretreatment with birth control pills willlower abnormally elevated levels of LH as well as abnormal production of male hormones by the ovary. A month before starting Pergonal I gave Tammy estrogen one month of birth control pills. Because Tammy's ovaries contained were enlarged with many cysts and her male hormone levels were elevated, I decided to begin treatment with Lupron after two weeks of birth control pills. Lupron is administered with a very tiny needle as a daily injection just under the skin. After Tammy's period began, I gave her one ampoule of Metrodin(75 units FSH) for seven consecutive days. At that time I performed a vaginal ultrasound and measured her estrogen (estradiol) level. If the medication was adequatelystimulating follicular growth, her estradiol should approach 100 pg/ml. SinceI saw no significant increase in her estradiol, I increased thedosage by 1/2 ampoule (to 1 1/2 ampoules per day) and repeated theultrasound after five more days of drug treatment. I would repeat this procedure untilshe achieved an estrogen response indicative of follicular development.Once Tammy's blood estradiol level reached 100 pg/ml, I knew that she would respond to that dose. After the twelfth day of treatment, I began more frequent monitoring offollicular growth with an ultrasound examination every two tothree days. We all nearly cheered out loud when I found threegood-sized follicles. When the dominant follicle reached 12 mmin diameter, I began scanning her daily. At 16 mm I stopped givingher Metrodin and ordered an hCG injection later that evening to stimulate ovulation. I knew Tammy would ovulate within forty-two to forty-eight hours later, so I advised her to have intercourse that evening and return with her husband the next morning. I performed a postcoital examination to make sure her cervical mucus could support the sperm migration and survival. If I found a problem, I would need to recommend an intrauterine insemination to insure the best possibility of conceiving. But, since gonadotropins usually do not degrade the mucus as clomiphene does, I expected to find all was well-and it was. About five days after Tammy's hCG injection, I repeated the ultrasound examination and drew a blood sample for progesterone to make sure she'd ovulated and to confirm the formation of thecorpus luteum. Her ovaries were not overly enlarged and three corpora lutea were seen, just as we'd hoped. Because she had received Lupron, additional hormonal support with either additional hCG injections or progesterone vaginal suppositories was needed during the luteal phase (second half) of her cycle. She had previously used progesterone vaginal suppositories after Pergonal therapy and developed a vaginal irritation. So, five days after the first hCG injection, I gave her a second hCG injection to prevent corpus luteum failure (inadequate luteal phase). (The second injection may be given four to eight days after the first.) I cautioned her to monitor her weight each day and call me if it rose more than five pounds. I explained that women with PCOS who receive extra hCG shots may have a greater risk of hyperstimulation (ovarian enlargement). But since her ovaries were not too large, I felt hCG could be safely used instead of suppositories. Tammy did not conceive in the first cycle' so we tried again when her period started. I began the second round at the same dosage level that produced follicular growth during the first cycle.This cut a week or so off the initial regimen. We all got excited when two follicles reached maturity at the same time. Even though we knew she might have twins (music to her ears), I gave her thehCG injection. Nine months later Tammy and Ken delivered an eight-pound twelve-ounce baby girl. Side Effects If estrogen levels become extremely high (usually over 2,000 picogramsper milliliter: 2,000 pg/ml) or if ultrasound reveals numerouslarge follicles, withholding the hCG injection and canceling the treatment cycle will prevent life-threateningcomplications. But, some couples choose other options. In the first option, about 38 hours after hCG, I give pain medication and a local anesthetic. Using vaginal ultrasound to guide the way, I place a needle through the vagina into each of the ovaries. All but a three or four follicles are drained and the fluid is discarded. An insemination is performed at the same time. Although there are no guarantees, I believe this may lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple births. A second option is to convert the cycle to in vitro fertilization (IVF). As above, the ovarian follicles are drained using ultrasound guidance. But in this scenario, I drain all the follicles. The eggs are identified and mixed with sperm in the laboratory. Two days later, a few of the fertilized pre-embryos are transferred back to the uterus. More about this in Chapter 21. Another precaution I may use in patients with very high estradiol value who do not elect to cancel there treatment is intravenous albumin infusion. This treatment appears to be very effective in preventing ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF patients. Mild ovarian hyperstimulation, which occursin 10 to 20 percent of all gonadotropin treatment cycles, may result in a doubling ofovarian size and cause lower abdominal discomfort. After the nextmenstrual period the swollen ovaries usually return to normal proportionson their own. Moderate hyperstimulation after an hCG injection occurs in 1 to6 percent of the treatment cycles. With this more serious formof hyperstimulation, the ovaries become cystic and in this fragilecondition may hemorrhage, rupture, or twist to cut off their bloodsupply (torsion). Bed-rest, and increased fluid intake usuallyprevent complications. Rarely, the patient is hospitalized to provide painmedication and intravenous fluids. Moderate hyperstimulation usually resolves in threeto ten days, with complete recovery occurring in four weeks. Unlesshemorrhage or torsion is highly suspected, surgery should notbe attempted. The ovaries are so fragile during this period that pelvic examinations should be avoided and surgical intervention should be avoided as it usually ends with the surgeon havingto remove the ovary. Severe hyperstimulation, a very rare occurrence, causes massiveovarian enlargement, accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity which can lead to life-threatening fluid/electrolyte shifts, and vascular collapse. Immediate hospitalization and emergency measures must be taken to prevent death. Intravenous fluids, careful blood chemistry monitoring, as well as drainage of excess abdominal fluid usually result in resolution of this syndrome. An interesting note is that a majority of these patients are subsequently found to be pregnant and luckily, the treatment has no ill effects on the pregnancy. The possibility of severe ovarian hyperstimulation is very real for patients who are not closely monitored during Pergonal, Humegon or Metrodin therapy. Close monitoring of estrogen levels and regular ultrasound examinationswill also help guard against multiple gestations. Each maturefollicle contributes 200 to 250 pg/ml of estrogen. During eachcycle there may be as many as a dozen follicles growing, witheach one contributing some amount to the estrogen pool. Studiesshow that as long as the total estrogen level is below 2,000 pg/mlthe odds of having a "litter" are small. When estrogen risesabove 2,000 pg/ml, or multiple follicles are seen on ultrasound,withholding the hCG injection or draining the follicles may prevent multiple births andhyperstimulation. How Well Do Humegon, Pergonal and Metrodin Work? Ninety-nine percent of women taking gonadotropins will ovulate andtwo-thirds will conceive. Since the chances for conceiving duringany one treatment cycle are 15-20 percent, most women get pregnantwithin three treatment cycles. For estrogen-deficient women thepregnancy rate after six cycles approaches 90 percent if there are no other fertility problems. For PCOS women who have failed to ovulate with clomiphene, conception rates are lower, about50 percent after six courses of therapy. Frequently, superovulation (Humegon, Metrodin, Pergonal) is combined with intrauterine insemination for male factor infertility or unexplained infertility. Pregnancy rates for these couples depend on a number of factors. Your physician will need to review all fertility factors before attempting to predict the likelihood of success. Studies show that up to two-thirds of gonadotropin patients will get their miracle baby. As encouraging as these reports are, you must also take into consideration that one-third of the Pergonal-induced pregnancies will terminate spontaneously (compared to a 15 to 25 percent abortion rate for women taking clomiphene and for women in the normal population). About one-fourth of these conceptions will be multiple births-twins, approximately 2-3% will be triplets and 1 out of 200 pregnancies may result in four or more fetuses. Multiple gestation can be a devastating problem for couples seeking to start a normal family. Medical bills for triplet pregnancies can be over $100,000. Babies frequently require prolonged hospitalization in a neonatal intensive care unit and may end up with lifelong medical problems. The stress of raising three infants may tax even the strongest marriage. While careful monitoring, canceling stimulation cycles or draining follicles may limit the risk of multiple births, this cannot be guaranteed. I now of one patient with a single follicle on ultrasound with an estradiol of 300 pg/ml who had triplets. After careful consideration, some couples choose a new procedure called selective reduction. This procedure involves terminating all but two of the pregnancies to limit the health risk to the remaining fetuses and the mother. Obviously, partial pregnancy termination is an emotionally charged issue that many women find ethically unacceptable. It is my hope that as our knowledge improves, fewer couples will be faced with this unpleasant option. Women have often thought that Humegon, Pergonal or Metrodin therapy is a last resort.Now that superovulation and intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization offers additional options, however, gonadotropin therapy is far from being the final opportunity for getting your miracle baby. We'll discuss more about that in a later chapter. Gonadotropic-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) For years Europeans have been using GnRH to stimulate the pituitaryto function normally. Research shows that GnRH therapy seems toavoid the risks associated with hyperstimulation and multiplebirths. GnRH may also eliminate the need for daily injectionsand monitoring, and ultimately may reduce treatment costs. Treatment Regimen GnRH therapy may restore fertility to women who have hypothalamicdisorders and an intact pituitary gland. A normal hypothalamuspulses GnRH every ninety minutes to permit pituitary function.So when you supplement GnRH, it must be pulsed in a similar manner. Recently, relatively inexpensive automatic pumps been developed for intravenous injections: for example,Lutrepulse from Ferring Laboratories. These battery-powereddevices are so portable that you can carry your mechanical hypothalamusanywhere you go. Although some women cannot tolerate the semipermanent intravenousdelivery system, many appreciate the relative freedom this treatmentoption promises: no more daily injections and blood tests,no more frequent visits for ultrasound examinations, and no moreconcern about multiple births and hyperstimulation. After ovulationyou discontinue intravenous therapy and receive an hCG injectionevery three to four days to support the corpus luteum. Results Pulsatile intravenous GnRH injection almost always results in ovulation. The pregnancy rate appears to be around 25 to 30 percent per month. It does not appear effective for most women with PCOS. At present the cost for pulsatile GnRH therapy is about half that of Pergonal treatment. With similar results, added convenience, lower cost, and reduced this option may be an attractive option for many women. A few years ago women with hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiencies had no hope. Now the wonder drugs clomiphene, GnRH, Humegon, Metrodin and Pergonal give thousands of women an opportunity to have their miracle babies.

"When my doctor did our postcoital test, she said Larry'ssperm were dead," Kelly M. told the RESOLVE group. "Shealso found some white blood cells. She thought one or both ofus might have an infection, so she ordered cultures on my cervicalmucus and Larry's semen. She also ran some tests to see if wehad sperm antibodies," "What did she find out?," the support group leader asked. "Well Larry's sperm survived in donor mucus. And donor spermsurvived in my mucus.'' "Then what was killing Larry's sperm in your mucus?'' a womanasked. "The cultures didn't show infection, so she said it was antibodies,"Kelly M. said. ."My doctor told me that I was rejecting Larry'ssperm just like I might reject a kidney transplant." "What can you do about it?" her friend asked. "Several things", Kelly answered. "First, we wantto try washing Larry's sperm and using intrauterine insemination.If we can get around my mucus, we may be able to get around theantibody problem." Kelly and Larry M. belong to a special group of infertile coupleswhose problem we are just beginning to understand and resolve.I'm very excited about the fertility research taking place inthe field of immunology. Antibodies, however, are only one reasonwhy cervical mucus may be hostile to sperm. Other mucus problemsmay also impair their journey to the egg. Cervical Mucus: Protector and Pathway Acting as the gateway between the vagina and the uterus, the cervixsecretes a thick, impermeable mucus to plug the canal. Normallythis "hostile" mucus protects the woman's reproductivetract from invading organisms and foreign particles. At the timeof ovulation, however, the mucus transforms into a "friendly"path through which sperm can travel in safety. Under the influenceof estrogen the thick and sticky mucus becomes clear and stringy.Like lanes in an Olympic swimming pool, tiny tubular paths formto guide the sperm toward the uterus. When the mucus fails to become "friendly" as it doeswith 5 to 10 percent of all infertile women, the sperm cannotsafely begin their journey toward the egg. The hostile mucus,as it is called, will either block the sperm's passage or willdamage the sperm so severely that they can no longer function.The aim of fertility treatment is to restore the quality of themucus so it can: Facilitate or interfere with sperm transport at appropriatetimes of the month Protect the sperm from the acidic vaginal environment Preserve the sperm in the cervical canal and release themin a steady stream over a period of time Filter out abnormal sperm Protect the sperm from white blood cells which may destroythem as they would invading microorganisms Provide nutrients to the sperm Prevent bacterial contamination of the uterus Performing the Postcoital Test The postcoital test is the primary tool for diagnosing cervicalmucus problems. Performed at the time of ovulation, it assessesmucus quality. When I examine the cervical mucus approximately8 to 12 hours after intercourse, I look for three things: If the husband delivered good quantities of sperm to the cervix If the sperm are swimming vigorously through the mucus If white blood cells are present, indicating an infectionin either partner If the results of the test are good, I don't worry about the mucusbeing a fertility problem. If the results are poor, I know thata mucus interaction problem exists or that the test was performedat the wrong time in the cycle (the most common reason for a poorpostcoital test). The best way to insure that the test is performedat the correct time is to plan intercourse with a urine LH test kit. Since we can predict ovulation more accurately than we could when only the BBT chartwas available, we are less likely to get poor results from poortiming. A number of factors can cause an abnormal postcoital test: Infection in either partner (indicated by white bloodcells in the mucus) Sperm antibodies produced by either partner will causethe sperm to die, to agglutinate (clump together), and/or to shake. Abnormal mucus quality: High-viscosity and/or low-volumemucus can block sperm. Abnormal semen: Sperm antibodies produced by the manas well as infections in the man can adversely affect test results,as can a low sperm count and poor motility. Poor coital technique or ejaculation disorderscan also prevent the sperm from reaching the cervix. Infections: Diagnosis and Treatment Diagnosis Infectious organisms in either partner may kill or maim sperm.I suspect an infection if I find dead sperm, white blood cells,and/or cellular debris in the postcoital specimen. Specific microorganismscan often be identified by performing a culture of the cervicalmucus but, often I more it more cost effective to initially treateach couple with a short course of antibiotics. In the presenceof white blood cells, however, I may prescribe an antibiotic evenif the culture comes back negative. Treatment Both partners must be treated to ensure that they are not passingthe disease back and forth. The semen and mucus cultures for Danand Marie C., for example, revealed the presence of chlamydia.I prescribed an antibiotic (doxycycline) for both of them. Toavoid exposing an early pregnancy to antibiotics, Marie took themedication during the ten days following the start of her menses. If I continued to find white blood cells in Marie's mucus, I wouldtry to isolate the problem. To make sure Dan was not depositingwhite blood cells with his sperm, I would ask them to abstainfrom sex until just before their next postcoital. A normal semenanalysis and the presence of the white blood cells only immediatelyfollowing intercourse would tell me Marie was producing them inresponse to Dan's semen, which could indicate a sperm antibodyproblem. I was relieved when I found Marie's mucus free of whiteblood cells after antibiotic therapy. If treating an infection with antibiotics restores a normal postcoital test, up to 42 percent of the couples treated will conceivewithin three months, and 84 percent within one year. Testing for Sperm Antibodies The Sperm-Mucus Cross Tests Normally antibodies attack foreign substances invading your body.For some unknown reason, however, 4 percent of all men produceantibodies against their own sperm. (The incidence of this autoimmunityincreases from 4 percent to 50 to 60 percent in men with vasectomies.The sperm antibodies are probably a protective mechanism to helpget rid of millions of unused, trapped sperm.) The effects ofantisperm antibodies will usually show up in the semen analysis:the sperm may clump together (agglutinate) or shake in randommotions. Sperm antibodies are also found in the cervical mucus of 30 percentof women with unexplained infertility problems. If a fairly recentsemen analysis shows that unexposed sperm have normal forwardmotility, but the postcoital test shows them shaking or clumping,I'll suspect that the woman is the source of the sperm antibodies. A sperm-mucus cross test will help me understand the exact natureof a couple's sperm antibody problem. John and Leslie P. were referred to me after four years of unexplainedinfertility. John's semen analysis was normal and their cultureswere negative. When their family doctor did a postcoital, however,he found dead sperm. Since they used a urinary LH test kit topredict ovulation, I knew they had timed the test perfectly. Thecouple obviously had a sperm-mucus interaction problem. If I suspect an antibody problem, I can order special tests tolook for antibodies in the woman's blood, cervical mucus, andattached to sperm using an immunobead sperm test. Treatment for Antisperm Antibodies Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) When the sperm from the man are antibody-bound, they can achieveonly a 15.3 percent pregnancy rate. Sometimes, though, we canreduce the adverse effects of the antibodies by having the manejaculate into a nutrient liquid, washing the semen from the spermand using them for intrauterineinsemination. When washing restores function to morethan half of the sperm, we can achieve a 66.7 percent pregnancyrate. IUI may also be helpful for women producing sperm antibodies.This is what John and Leslie P. decided to try. By washing John'ssperm and injecting them directly into Leslie's uterus, we gavehis sperm a head start against her hostile mucus. I cautionedthem, however, that since Leslie's antibodies could be anywherein her genital tract, IUI might not work. Moreover, women withsperm antibodies are twice as likely to have a spontaneous abortion.If IUI didn't work, they might want to consider in vitro fertilization. Although a sensitive pregnancy test showed a pregnancy after thesecond insemination, Leslie's period started a week later. I wassorry to tell them that she had probably aborted. They were notdiscouraged; in fact, they were elated. Now they knew that John'ssperm could swim to her egg and fertilize it. Undaunted, theycontinued with IUI two months later Leslie's period was late again.We didn't know whether or not to celebrate because she wasn'tout of the woods yet-and wouldn't be for a few months. We allsighed a breath of relief when she entered her second trimesterwith Mom and baby doing well-Dad too. Now they have a red-haired,green-eyed baby girl who's made them forget they ever had a fertilityproblem. Condom Therapy Use of condoms during intercourse for a prolonged period of timemay reduce the level of the woman's antibodies to the extent thatthe sperm will not be affected. The woman must avoid all contactwith the man's sperm for three to six months; this includes oralsex as well as skin contact. (If the man is producing antibodiesto his own sperm, however, condom therapy will not work.) Manypeople do not want to go this time-consuming route and will electto use IUI instead. This method was more popular prior to availabilityof IUI and has fallen out of favor because it is less successful. High-Dose Steroid Therapy Experimental therapy with high-dose steroids for men with antispermantibodies appears to produce a 30 to 40 percent pregnancy rate.Although few studies have been done with women producing spermantibodies, steroid therapy may prove to be more effective thancondom therapy. In addition, suppressing the antibodies may diminishthe spontaneous-abortion risk. However, this therapy is not withoutrisk. High dose steroids result in loss of calcium from the bones. There have been cases reported where steroids used to treat infertilityhave resulted in hip fractures requiring hip replacement surgery. At this time, I fell that the risk of this therapy is too greatto warrant its routine use. In Vitro Fertilization By washing antibodies from the sperm and fertilizing the woman'segg outside her body through in vitro, we can avoid exposure toantibodies in the semen and in the mucus. Before attempting invitro fertilization, a hamster penetration test should be performedon the man's sperm to ensure that once they are treated they willbe able to fertilize an egg. Since sperm antibodies produced by the man or woman are associatedwith a high spontaneous-abortion rate (50 percent), many couplesmay wish to try IAIH first. IAIH is much less demanding on thecouple and quite a bit less expensive More research is neededbefore in vitro can be considered a viable option for resolvingsperm antibody problems. Poor Mucus Quality Mucus viscosity and volume abnormalities may be caused by surgicalprocedures performed on the cervix, by in utero DES exposure,and by clomiphene citrate ovulation induction treatment. About40 percent of the time a low-dose estrogen supplement will improvemucus volume and viscosity. However, I generally recommend IUIto bypass the mucus problem as the result is more predictable. Women suffering from cervical stenosis (scars sealing the cervix)may respond to gradual dilation and estrogen therapy.Ejaculation Disturbances or Poor Coital Technique When the semen is poor or when the coital technique does not providean adequate supply of sperm to the cervix, the postcoital testmay appear abnormal, even though neither of these abnormalitiesrepresents a sperm mucus interaction problem. Artificial inseminationwith the husband's sperm and/or counseling on coital techniquesmay be helpful in overcoming these problems. Immediately before ejaculation, a muscle at the opening to thebladder constricts so that sperm rushing from the ejaculatoryducts are forced out through the penis and not back into the bladder. Occasionally diabetics or men with neurologic disorders and menwho have undergone prostate surgery may have difficulty constrictingthat muscle. At the time of ejaculation, the semen spurts intothe bladder rather than out the penis. I will suspect this ifthe amount of semen is very low. I can check for this by testinga urine sample immediately after ejaculation. If I find spermin the urine, I know retrograde ejaculation is the problem. Although urine is normally toxic, we can often collect a goodsperm sample for intrauterine insemination by draining the bladderand instilling a small amount of nutrient media into the bladder.I will ask the man to empty his bladder immediately after ejaculationand will often retrieve healthy sperm for insemination. Whencoupled with ovulationinduction medication, intrauterine insemination canoften be successful. If this fails, a specimen can be retrievedas mentioned above and used for in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmicsperm injection. But more about that in Chapter21. The sperm's journey from your vagina to the egg through your fallopiantube is fraught with peril. Only a hundred or so will surviveto encounter this precious genetic package, provided your eggcan pass into and through your fallopian tube. Unfortunately tubalproblems are the most common cause of infertility. In the next chapter you'lllearn what can cause tubal problems and what you can do to correctthem.

"Tostop bleeding all of the time, I had to go on the Pill when Iwas fifteen. The doctor told my mother that I wasn't ovulatingand might never conceive. "I lost my virginity on the operating table. I can't evenremember how many D&Cs I had before I was twenty-five." "Did you cramp a lot?" one member asked. "Yes, but I thought everyone cramped and that having painwith your periods was normal. The pain eventually got so bad thatwhen I was in my early twenties, I had to stay home during thefirst two days of my period. I learned later that discomfort fromnormal periods shouldn't interfere with your daily routines. Butsince I never knew any differently, all of those years I didn'tquestion it." She paused. "Not until that awful day.My husband and I had decided to try to have a baby. I'd been takingclomiphene for several months, to get me to ovulate, and my period was a week late. Thatwasn't anything unusual, since my periods were frequently fortyto fifty days apart. But I'd been regular since I'd been on clomiphene.When my basal body temperature stayed up that week, we both becamepretty excited. After two years of trying, I was sure I was pregnant. "But that morning at work I had terrible cramps, like I neededto have a bowel movement. The pain in my side was so bad thatI had to go home. Later that afternoon I did go to the bathroomand the pain stopped. But not for long. It became so severe thatI thought I was going to pass out. I called the doctor. I criedall the way to the hospital. "After running some tests, he told me that I had either appendicitisor a tubal pregnancy. I'd begun to spot, so I was afraid I waslosing a baby. He had me stay at the hospital overnight. "The next morning I was weak but I felt better. Since they'dfound some blood in my urine, the doctor thought I was passinga kidney stone. And he sent me home. "The pain continued and the bleeding got worse, so I wentback to the hospital and had a D&C. The doctor didn't thinkI was pregnant because he couldn't find any tissue in the materialhe removed. "When I returned home, the pain in my right side was gone,but I was bleeding like a leaky faucet. I knew it wasn't right.I was a D&C expert by then. Another thing that puzzled mewas that my breasts were still swollen and tender. But when Icalled the doctor, he didn't seem very concerned. He just said,'You can expect some bleeding after a D&C.' "Even though the bleeding continued, I returned to work.In the middle of the morning, searing pain doubled me over. Mysecretary rushed me to the hospital. I had an ectopic pregnancyand had lost a quart of blood. That wasn't all I could have lost.I nearly lost my right tube and ovary." The group was quiet. "What caused it?" a voice asked from the back row. "When they did my laparoscopy, they found out that I haveendometriosis. That's probably why my periods were screwed up.The doctor said that my adhesions were so thick he could hardlyfind my tubes." "What did you do?" a woman asked. "First of all, I changed doctors. After all I'd been through,I'd lost faith in him. My new doctor is performing a laparoscopy next week. He believes he can clean out the adhesions and endometriosisand possibly restore my tubes to normal. We'll know more after the surgery." Tubal problems are the leading cause of female fertility problems.With the tremendous increase in PID and sexually transmitted infections,and with the increased incidence of endometriosis, tubal problemsaccount for half of female infertility. What Causes Tubal Problems? A number of different problems can impair fallopian tube function: Abdominal adhesions and scar tissue that immobilize fallopiantubes Adhesions and scar tissue that prevent the egg from enteringthe tube and traveling toward the uterus Damage from an ectopic pregnancy or sterilization surgery These problems can be caused by a variety of events: Ruptured appendix Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Gynecologic surgery Postpartum infection In utero DES exposure Salpingitis isthmica nodosa Endometriosis Cesarean section Bowel surgery Ectopic pregnancy Tuberculosis (genital) When infection and disease attack delicate tubal structures, thetubes may become deformed and cease to function. Trapped in adhesionsand scar tissue, they can no longer retrieve the egg and coaxit toward the uterus. Infection and damage from ectopic pregnancymay strip the vital ciliated lining from the inner walls. Whenthis happens, sperm cannot meet egg, and fertilizationcannot occur. If the tubes are obstructed only partially, spermmay be able to meet egg, but the developing embryo can becometrapped inside the tube and cause a painful and even life-threateningectopic pregnancy. The PID epidemic alone is claiming the fertility of hundreds ofthousands of women each year. Up to 60% of women who have antibodies to chlamydia are unaware that they ever had an infection will this stealthy invader that can destroy your fallopian tubes and rob your fertility without the slightest hint. Fortunately microsurgery, lasersurgery, and in vitro fertilization techniques can restore fertilityto many of those victims. Diagnosing and Evaluating Tubal Problems Normal Tubal Function The fallopian tube is an active, muscular organ that retrievesthe egg from the ovary and coaxes it toward the oncoming sperm.If adhesions restrict the tube's mobility or if infection hasstripped the tiny cilia from the tubal lining the tube cannotperform its vital job. The various tests I use will help me determineif: The tubes are open (patent) The fimbria are open and free to grasp the ovary The tubes are free from adhesions so they can move The inner lining of tiny hairs (cilia) is intact I can evaluate tubal performance by tubal X ray (hysterosalpingogram), sonohysterosgraphy (an ultrasound test), laparoscopy (telescopic look into the abdomen), and tuboscopy(telescopic look inside the tubes). The Tubal X Ray: Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) When to Perform an HSG When the woman's complaints or history indicates the possibilityof tubal problems, the HSG will give me an excellent first lookat the problem. I will order an HSG if she: Has a history of repeated vaginal infections Suffered from one or more episodes of PID or postpartum infection Has unexplained infertility Has a history of abdominal surgery or ruptured appendix Has had one or more ectopic pregnancies If she has not conceived after sterilization reversal surgery Purpose of the HSG By squirting an opaque dye into your reproductive tract and takingX rays, we can see an outline of the inside of your uterus andtubes. The picture will reveal uterine abnormalities as well astubal problems such as blockage and dilation (hydrosalpinx). IfI'm planning a sterilization reversal, I can also see where thetubes are blocked and how much normal tube remains attached to the uterus. The X-ray study will not only help me planthe laparoscopy and possible surgery but also help corroboratemy other findings. Performing the HSG To ensure that an early pregnancy is not exposed to potentiallyharmful X-ray dosage, your doctor will perform the HSG a few daysafter your period stops. Before you have the X ray, you may bepremedicated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as: Aleve, Ultram or Motrin,for example, or given a local anesthetic. Your doctor will inserta small tube through the cervical opening. By forcing a syruplikeX-ray dye into your uterus, the X ray can take a picture of theoutline of your uterine cavity. As the dye travels into your fallopiantubes, it outlines the tiny passages and spills into your abdominal cavity. This lets us know that your tubes are open. Interpreting HSG Findings If the tubes are not blocked by adhesions or scar tissue, thedye will pour into the abdominal cavity. Demonstrating tubal patencyis one good sign; however, it does not guarantee that the tubeswill function normally. The X-ray pictures also give us a rough estimate of the qualityof the tubal structure and the status of the tubal lining. Ifthe tube bulges, for example, we suspect a hydrosalpinx. And ifwe do not see the folds inside the tube, we know there may be seriousabnormalities of the internal tubal architecture. We can also see endometrial polyps, submucus fibroids, intrauterineadhesions (Asherman's Syndrome, synechia), congenital uterine cavity abnormalities (ie.,uterine septum & bicornuate uterus), or the after-effectsof genital tuberculosis. Proximal tubal obstruction is a condition where the tubes appear blocked where they join the uterus. In some patients this may be due to tubal spasm and will not be seen on a repeat HSG. For other women, proximal tubal obstruction indicates severe damage to the portion of the fallopian tube where it crosses the uterine wall or merely debris clogging the tubal opening. I can often correct this problem by performing a recanalization procedure This involves passing a tiny wire through the uterine cavity, and into the fallopian tube thereby dislodging the offending debris. This procedure successfully restores tubal patency in at least one fallopian tube for up to 85% of patients. While up to one third of patients undergoing this procedure will conceive, it is of little or no benefit if the ends of the tube are also damaged. Approximately 4 percent of infertilepatients will have an abnormal HSG indicating salpingitis isthmicanodosa, a little-understood condition that responds very poorlyto surgery. These couples could benefit most from in vitro procedures.The X-ray study may or may not detect pelvic adhesions, mild hydrosalpinx,endometriosis, tubal phimosis (clubbing of the fimbria at theend of the tube), or immobility of the tube. Therapeutic Effects from the HSG Although the primary purpose for ordering the HSG is not therapeutic,sometimes forcing the dye through the tubes will dislodge materialblocking the tube. Without further treatment a number of womenhave become pregnant following the HSG. Potential Complications from the HSG Procedure Although complications from an HSG are infrequent, there is alwaysthe possibility for bleeding, infection, cramping, and the terminationof an exposed pregnancy. Sonohysterography Advances in ultrasound have provided significant improvements in our ability to evaluate the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. Sonohysterography placing a small amount of liquid into the uterus to better visualize the uterine cavity. The use of specialized protein solutions and color-flow doppler ultrasound allows us to visualize the liquid as it travels through the fallopian tubes and disperses in the abdomen. While this technique avoids X-Ray exposure, the cost of the dye and color-flow doppler ultrasound equipment limits use of this technique. Laparoscopy When to Perform a Laparoscopy Since the laparoscopy is a surgical procedure done under generalanesthesia, I attempt to rule out all other male and female fertilityfactors before performing it. Depending on the woman's age and history and the findings fromthe workup, however, I may choose a more aggressive diagnosticapproach for a particular couple. I'm more likely to use the laparoscopysooner if the woman is in her thirties and/or if I find pelvicpain. Normally I will perform a laparoscopy for the following reasons: Suspected endometriosis Blocked fallopian tubes Ovarian cysts Unexplained pelvic pain Uterine fibroids that are in the outer layer of the uterus. Abnormal hysterosalpingogram findings History of pelvic infection or surgery Pre- and postoperative evaluation of tubal surgery Failure to conceive after ovulation induction therapy Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Purpose of the Laparoscopy The laparoscopy lets me visually inspect your reproductive organs.I can see if the tubes are deformed, swollen, or trapped in adhesions;I can see if the ends of the tubes are open and the fimbria functional;and if adhesions are preventing the egg from migrating from theovary to the tubes. I can also detect the presence of endometriosisand perform a number of surgical procedures to correct variousabnormalities. I will usually combine the the laparoscopic procedure with a diagnostic hysteroscopy to evaluate the inside of the uterine cavity. Micro-Laparoscopy Recent advances in the development of surgical equipment allows us to visualize the abdominal cavity with instruments less than 3mm in diameter. Because the laparoscopic telescope is so small, it can be passed through a needle without making an incision in your abdomen. This requires a minimal amount of local anesthesia and sedation through an intravenous line. Most women who undergo this procedure are back to normal in a few hours.Unfortunately, structures inside your abdomen such as the fallopian tubes, small bowel and ovaries can be very sensitive to manipulation, this technique is best for insuring that things are normal. In most cases if a significant abnormality is found, you will be put to sleep and a standard laparoscopy can be performed to correct the problem. Performing the Laparoscopy Since the period of greatest fertility immediately follows thefirst surgery, I may recommend delaying surgery until a time whenI have optimized all other fertility factors and the couple isready to conceive. If I suspect you have endometriosis, I will perform the laparoscopyshortly after your period stops. Excising the endometrial implantsat this time results in less bleeding and may reduce the likelihood of adhesion formation. (See also chapter17, which discusses endometriosis in detail.) A laparoscopy can be performed on an outpatient basis. First,you are given a general anesthesia. Then your doctor will slipthe laparoscope through a small incision in your belly button.Through a second puncture just above your pubic bone, your doctorwill slip in a small probe to manipulate your organs. Pressurizedcarbon dioxide gas forces your abdominal wall up and away fromthe organs so your doctor can get a clear view. After you awakefrom the anesthesia, you can return home. You may, however, wishto take a day or two off from work following the surgery. As with the HSG, your doctor will force a dye through your uterusand tubes to demonstrate tubal patency (chromoputerbation). Manytimes, however, the dye will flow through only one tube (preferentialflow) because that tube provides the least resistance. This doesnot mean that the other tube is blocked; on the other hand, itdoes not rule out that possibility either. Many corrective procedures can be performed during a laparoscopy,thus saving the need for major surgery. Bipolar electrosurgery and lasersurgery offer the surgeon safe and effective tools for performingthese repairs. Many different types of laser equipment can be used for laparoscopic surgery (carbon dioxide, KTP, argon, and YAG). The laser uses light energy to cut, vaporize or cauterize tissue. Each laser system has advantages and disadvantages. Often the cost when a laser is used can be as much as $2000 more. Newer energy sources such as bipolar electrosurgery and the harmonic scalpel may be cheaper. Healing, adhesion formation, and pregnancy rates do not seem to depend on which method is used. Therefore, although most physicians prefer one or another surgical instrument, s/he will likely decide which instrument based on cost-effectiveness and the type of surgery planned. Procedures Used During Laparoscopy The two most common surgical procedures performed with the laparoscopeare the cutting and removal (lysis) of thin pelvic adhesions surroundingthe ovaries, tubes, and uterus, and the surgical removal of endometriosis implants. Sometimes I will sever nervesto the uterus to relieve the pain associated with endometriosis, open a blocked fallopian tube or remove a large ovarian cyst. At present most, but not all tubal repairs can be performed with the laparoscope. Lysis of Adhesions In this procedure the surgeon removes adhesions (scar tissue)with a laparscopic scissors, bipolar electrocautery instruments, harmonic scalpel, or laser. Best results are obtained if the band of scar tissue is removed and not just cut. Results appear to be better after laparoscopy than laparotomy. The adhesiolysis (cutting adhesions) is more effective preventing new adhesions from forming than they are after an operation to treat existent adhesions. Salpingostomy/Fimbrioplasty (opening the fimbria and repairingthe tube) Sometimes infection, endometriosis or surgical trauma cause the "petals"of the fimbria to close in on themselves much as a tulip mightclose at night. Pressure from fluid building up inside the tubecauses the tube to dilate (hydrosalpinx). When this happens, itis unlikely that the ciliated inner lining will be intact andfunctional. I can use a laser or microscopic cautery needle tocarve an X-shaped incision at the end of the tube to allow the"petals" to separate and fold back into their normalposition. If the fimbria are not restored by this procedure, Ican open the tube, but without fimbria the tube has little chanceof retrieving the egg. Women with severely damaged or atrophied fimbriahave less than a 10 percent chance of achieving pregnancy. In vitro fertilization mayoffer the best chance for success. (See chapter 21 for a descriptionof in vitro fertilization.) Salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube) Occasionally a tube is in such poor condition that it must beremoved or sealed to give preference to the better tube. In vitro fertilization may be more successful if a large, dilated fallopian tube is removed prior to treatment. Bleedingfrom a ruptured ectopic pregnancy may require that I tie off the bloodsupply to the tube or remove the tube. Provided the woman hasone good tube, I may remove a diseased tube if it is damaged beyond repair and causing pain.If both tubes are not functional or must be removed, I turn myattention to freeing up the ovaries for in vitro egg retrievalprocedures. Removing an Ectopic Pregnancy While most ectopic pregnancies occur in women with no risk factors, often I will suspect ectopic pregnancy in women who have had surgical treatment of tubal abnormalities, previous ectopic pregnancies or an hCG titre that demonstrates a suboptimal rise. The hCG level should rise a minimum of 60% in 48hrs. After the level is above ~1800 miu/ml, I can usually see the pregnancy inside the uterus with transvaginal ultrasound. If the rise is repeated less than 60% or the pregnancy is not seen by a certain point, I will suspect either a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy. Oftentimes I will locate a gestational sac in the fallopian tube on ultrasound. If the diagnosis is made early enough when the pregnancy is small, the drug methtrexate can be used to dissolve the pregnancy and avoid surgery in up to 85% of those treated. If I have any doubt that an ectopic pregnancy exists, I may still choose to treat with methotrexate to avoid later complications and more expensive surgical treatments. For those patients unwilling to receive methotrexate therapy, I will perform a laparoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes the pregnancy is small enough that I can simply slitopen the tube lengthwise and carefully suction out the material.It is not necessary to repair the tubal incision. The tube will healnormally without being stitched. When a more advanced pregnancy ruptures the tube, I will snipout the distorted portion of the tube to remove the pregnancy.Because the tube has a greater tendency to bleed during pregnancy,I will not reconnect the two ends at that time. If within a yearthe woman does not conceive with the other tube, I may considerfurther surgery to reconnect the tube. Removing the Ovary If at all possible, I try to conserve an ovary. If an ectopicpregnancy implants on the ovary, however, destruction of the ovariantissue and excessive bleeding may require its removal. The ovarymay also have to be removed when it has been entirely replaced with endometriosis(see "Chocolate Cyst" in chapter 17), when it becomestumorous or when it is painful. Sometimes ovarian enlargementcaused by a tumor or cyst may cause the ovary to twist and cutoff its blood supply. When this happens, I must remove the ovary.As long as one ovary is intact, however, fertility should notbe compromised. Therapeutic Results from the Laparoscopy About half of the time no evidence of a fertility problem is found.(Oddly enough, of those with no abnormal findings, one-third willget pregnant following the procedure.) Where a problem is identified,about three-fourths of the time it is endometriosis and one-fourthof the time adhesions. If repairs must be made to the fallopiantubes and/or if microsurgery is needed, I will usually performabdominal surgery. (See the discussion of laparotomy below.) Once a problem has been corrected (during the laparoscopy or duringsubsequent abdominal surgery), you will have a 50-65 percent chanceof getting pregnant. Repeat attempts to correct fallopian tube abnormalities are less successful. When pregnancy is achieved an ultrasound examination is recommended soon after the pregnancy is confirmed to determination its location. After tubal surgery, the pregnancy can implant in the fallopian tube in 10-15% of patients. Potential Complications from the Laparoscopy Although complications are rare, the risks of the procedure includeinjury to abdominal structures, infection in the bladder or incisions,bleeding, allergies to medications, complications from generalanesthesia, and pelvic infections. Should damage occur to otherorgans during the procedure, abdominal surgery may be requiredto correct it. Falloposcopy Falloposcopy is an experimental technique that allows us to placea scope directly inside the fallopian tube to examine the qualityof the mucosal lining. If I find bare patches, I know that thewoman is at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy and that reconstructivetubal surgery will be less likely to restore her fertility. Unfortunately, at present the procedure requires laparoscopy to gain access to the fimbriated end of the tube. New equipment will soon allow this procedure to be performed by passing tiny catheters through the cervix and uterus into the fallopian tube. While falloposcopy promises to be a valuable tool for predicting the success oftubal repairs, it has not yet been proven cost effective in the management of tubal infertility. Tubal Surgery: the Laparotomy When to Perform a Laparotomy I will recommend abdominal surgery (laparotomy) to restore fertilityif with the HSG and laparoscopy I discover: Removal of large uterine leimyoma (fibroids) deep within the uterine muscle Fallopian tube reanastomosis after tubal sterilization Extensive and/or large endometrial implants of the bowel that cannot betreated laparoscopically Purpose of the Laparotomy Abdominal surgery affords me the access I need to perform delicate microscopic surgical procedures such as tubal reanastomosis with greatersuccess. While many cases of endometriosis of the bowel may be handled by endoscopic resection, laparotomy may be necessary to handle the difficult case. Laparoscopic suturing techniques have been developed that allow us to sew without opening the abdomen. Yet, I believe that for the those patients with multiple fibroid tumors or those with fibroid deep within the wall of the uterus, a laparotomy will provide a better repair. Procedures Used During Laparotomy After you're anesthetized (either by going to sleep or with an epidural block), the surgeon will usually make a small bikinicut (side to side above your pubic bone) through your abdominalwall to expose your pelvic organs for inspection and repair. Dependingon your fertility problem, a number of corrective procedures maybe performed: Tubocornual Anastomosis (removing tubal blockage and reconnectingthe tube to the uterus) When the tubal blockage occurs near the uterus, I can cut outthe bad portion of the tube and reconnect the good end to theuterus, with the aid of an operating microscope. I shave awaythe layers of the uterus over the tubal opening, align the openingwith the tube, and suture the end of the tube to the uterus. At present, in vitro fertilization would appear to provide better pregnancy rates at lower cost in most cases. Tubotubal Anastomosis (removing a diseased portion of thetube and reconnecting the ends; sterilization reversal) Sometimes repeated infection will block the fluid-filled tube.Removing the blocked portion may restore function to the tube.If it hasn't been stretched too far out of shape, I can removea section of the tube and reconnect the ends to form a functionalpassage. The best results occur when the two ends of the tubeare similar in size and when the remaining portion exceeds threeinches in length. This procedure will restore fertility to halfof the women treated. Sterilization reversals are far more successful than correctivesurgery for damage from infection: 60 percent or more will becomepregnant after the surgery. This indicates to me that infectionoften impairs the tubal lining to the point that restoring patencydoes not restore tubal function. The best success with this procedurehas been achieved by skilled microsurgeons using operating microscopes. While laparoscopic techniques are being tested to replace this procedure, as yet they have not duplicated the results of laparotomy tubal reanastomosis. Recovery From the Laparotomy When an epidural anesthetic and IV sedation are used along with local anesthesia at the incision sites, post operative discomfort can be minimized. While most women choose to remain in the hospital overnight or two to three days, many patients have returned home on the day of surgery. Recovery should require three to five days of rest at home or in the hospital and three tofour weeks of restricted activity: No driving for two weeks No intercourse for two to four weeks No heavy activity or lifting for four to six weeks Absence from work for two to four weeks Potential Complications from the Laparotomy As with any surgical procedure there is always a slight chancefor adverse reactions to the anesthesia and medications; and forpostoperative infection. The Key to Successful Fertility Surgery: Preventing Adhesionsfrom Re-forming The key to successful fertility surgery is minimizing the damagefrom infection, from the organs drying out, and from bleeding.Microsurgical techniques cause the least amount of damage, sincethe specially coated instruments are small and delicate. By usingmicrosurgery we can control bleeding and blood clotting, whichmay start the formation of new adhesions. We can also use fine bipolarcauteryneedles to selectively excise small areas of tissue-endometrialimplants, for example-and to stop the bleeding fromvery tiny blood vessels. Special solutions are used during surgeryto keep the organs from drying out. Before completing the surgical procedure, the raw surfaces are often covered with a adhesion barrier membrane to prevent the re-formation of adhesions (Interceed, Goretex). Alternatively, some physicians will place fluid inside the abdomen to float the internal organs and prevent raw surfaces from sticking together. Second-Look Laparoscopy Some physicians will perform a second-look procedure one to six weeks after thesurgery. If filmy adhesionsare re-formed, the physician can clean them out at that time. As microlaparoscopy under local anesthesia is far less costly than standart laparoscopy, second-look procedures may be more frequently performed as equipment becomes available. I often perform an HSG six weeks to six months after the surgery to demonstratetubal patency. Depending on the nature of the surgery and thewoman's age, I may recommend in vitro fertilization if pregnancy hasnot occurred within six months to one year.

In addition, it may be up totwo years before you know if tubal surgery is a success or failure.Experience shows that success rates for repeat tubal surgery arefairly poor. A repeat salpingostomy, for example, has a poorersuccess rate (less than 10 percent) than in vitro fertilization.The primary difficulty you may have with choosing between tubalsurgery and in vitro is that your insurance will pay for tubalsurgery, whereas it often won't payfor in vitro procedures, which cost up to $8-10,000 per cycle. Although in vitro procedures may require traveling to distantclinics and more doctor visits, they expose you to fewer risksthan repeat surgery and have a greater chance of success. In addition,within a short time you will know if in vitro will work, whereaswith surgery it may take up to two years to find out. While the risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher after tubal surgery, multiple pregnancies are higher after in vitro fertilization. Margaret B.'s Story Margaret B. suffered a ruptured appendix when she was eighteenyears old. She was in the hospital for three weeks and nearlydied. At twenty-four she had a PID infection which did not requirehospitalization. She'd always been concerned that these infections(peritonitis) could have affected her fertility, but her doctorswould never confirm her suspicion. "At thirty I went off the Pill, and my periods resumed inthree months. After six months of trying to get pregnant we becameconcerned and consulted Dr. Perloe" Margaret said. "When he did my laparoscopy, he found I had adhesions sothick that he could barely see anything else. During my surgery he found that my right tube was blockedand the fimbria had deteriorated. Although he attempted to repairthe tube, he was doubtful that it would work. My left tube, however,was in good shape once he removed the pelvic adhesions from aroundit. After the surgery he told me I had a fifty-fifty chance ofgetting pregnant. "I returned home within hours of my surgery. Dr. Perloetold me to stay home; and not to vacuum, pick up grocery sacks,or do any heavy work. After a week or two, he said, I could returnto work." "Three months after my surgery Dr. Perloe repeated my tubalX ray. That's when we got the bad news: both of my tubes had blockedup with adhesions. My husband and I didn't want to go throughanother laparotomy, so we decided to try in vitro." "I'm happy to report that our second in vitro try was successful!Jon was born last month."

"Ithought something was wrong with me . . .that I was frigid orsomething. "When I went to the doctor, I told him I'd always had somepain with my periods but that my cramps were getting worse. "He did a pelvic exam and I screamed when he touched my leftovary. After doing an ultrasound examination, he told me thatmy left ovary was swollen to twice its normal size. He also feltsmall bumps behind my uterus. He recommended doing a laparoscopyto find out what was going on. "That's when I got the news: endometriosis at the ripe oldage of twenty-three, and that I had probably had endometriosis as a teenager! What a way to start married life." What is it? Endometriosis is described as the presence of endometrial tissue in locations outside the endometrial (uterine) cavity. Endometriosis is commonly found in the cul-de-sac (behind the uterus), the rectovaginal septum (the tissue between the rectum and vagina), on the surface of the rectum, the fallopian tubes and ovaries, the uterosacral ligaments, the bladder, and the pelvic side wall. Generally endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum is more likely to deeply invade the underlying structures. Is endometriosis a genetic disease? Studies have shown that sisters have a six times increased risk compared to their husband's sisters. Other studies show up to an eight times increased risk when compared to other women. Affected sisters are more likely to have severe disease than other. Although these studies suggest a genetic basis, presently, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The OXEGENE Study is enrolling family members with endometriosis to try and identify the genetic basis of this disease. How common is it? At the time of tubal ligation 2-5% of women will have endometriosis, while between 25-50% of infertile women have been reported to have endometriosis. Endometriosis affects 5 million U.S. women, approximately 6-7% of all females, 30-40% of whom are infertile. What are the causes? No one theory seems to explain all cases. Several theories, however, havebeen postulated: The endometrial tissue migrates from the uterus through thetubes into the pelvis. (This doesn't explain how women with theirtubes tied develop the disease or why it remains after hysterectomy.) An abnormality in the immune system allows normally shed endometrial cells to attach and grow. The disease is caused by a genetic birth defect as evidencedby the tendency for it to run in families. Patients with an affectedmother or siblings are more likely (61 percent) to have severeendometriosis than those without affected relatives (23 percent). Tissue in the abdominal cavity changes into endometrial tissueas a result of repeated inflammation (sheer speculation at thispoint). The endometrial tissue spreads from the uterus to the abdominalcavity through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Commonly during the menstrual period, cells can be found in the fluid behind the uterus. The most widely held theory, retrograde menstruation, states that endometriosis occurs when endometrial fragments attach to nearby pelvic structures and grow. Other theories include tissue transplantation, induction of changes in peritoneal lining cells, spread through uterine veins, and direct extension through the lymphatic system. As endometrial cells are frequently seen in peritoneal fluid in all women at the time of menses, one would expect endometriosis to develop in everyone. Obviously this is not appear the case. Unfortunately, we don't really know why. Is the immune system the cause? Immunological changes have been demonstrated in women with endometriosis, however, it is uncertain whether these immunologic findings are responsible for the endometriosis or are a result of the inflammation caused by endometriosis. How Does Endometriosis Cause Fertility Problems? In cases where there is obvious disruption of the normal anatomy, endometriosis is a known cause of fertility problems. In fact 30-40% of patients with endometriosis are infertile. This is two to three times the rate of infertility in the general population. In patients with endometriosis, the monthly fecundity (chance of getting pregnant) decreases by 12-36%. However, the long term cumulative pregnancy rates are normal in patients with minimal endometriosis and normal anatomy. Studies provide contradicting information, but the bulk of research at this time indicates that pregnancy rates are not improved by treating minimal endometriosis. Under the influence of cycling female hormones, each month thedisplaced endometrial tissue grows and sheds blood at the timeof menses. Instead of flowing harmlessly outside the body, however,the excrement wreaks havoc in the abdominal cavity. The resulting chronic tissue inflammation leads to the formationof adhesions and scars, which surround and entrap delicate reproductiveorgans. The adhesions can be so extensive that they literallyfreeze the tubes, ovaries, and uterus into place (stages III andIV). The eggs themselves are trapped in the heavy shrouds of scartissue surrounding the ovaries, and infertility results. As thedisease spreads, the older endometrial cells burn out, leavingdead scar tissue in their wake. Even mild forms of the disease (stages I and II) may interferewith fertility. It is hypothesized that the prostaglandins (hormones)secreted by the active, young endometrial implants or other chemicals secreted by white blood cells may interferewith the reproductive organs by causing muscular contractionsor spasms. The tube may be unable to pick upthe egg, and the stimulated uterus may reject implantation. In addition, sperm motility may be adversely affected along with the ability of the sperm to penetrate into the egg. Althoughthe mechanisms are not fully understood, endometriosis may alsoresult in anovulation (17 percent), cause a luteal phase defectinterfering with implantation, or cause a luteinized unrupturedfollicle. Some researchers suggest that the woman's body may form antibodiesagainst the misplaced endometrial tissue. The same antibodiesmay attack the uterine lining and cause the high spontaneous-abortionrate: up to three times the normal rate. (Fortunately, removingthe endometriosis with medication or with surgery will reducethis risk to normal.) The normal tissue surrounding the endometriosis implant becomespuckered and ischemic (suffering from lack of oxygen), causingpain similar to that from a heart attack. Attacked over a prolongedperiod, the fallopian tubes may become inflamed and swell shut. Blocked by adhesions, the tubescan no longer provide safe passage for egg, sperm, and embryo.Ectopic pregnancies become a real danger: up to sixteen timesmore likely than the normal population (16 percent vs. 1 percent).Let's evaluate the specific factors that may contribute to infertility in patients with endometriosis. Hormonal parameters: Compared to a normal cycle, the follicular phase may be shorter in patients with endometriosis, the estradiol may be lower, and a blunted LH surge may be seen. Progesterone levels and luteal phase endometrial biopsies, however, are normal. There is a tendency towards greater number of follicles which are smaller at the time of the LH surge in patients with endometriosis. However, this data does not prove that endometriosis is the cause of infertility. Women with subtle ovulatory dysfunction are more likely to have infertility and it may be that infertility or an abnormal hormone profile increases the likelihood of endometriosis. Luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome: In women with severe pelvic adhesions where the ovary is encased, luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) may be noted. This is believed to occur when, despite normal hormonal parameters (LH surge), the egg is not released from the ovary. Endometriosis is found in 63% of those patients reported to have LUF. LUF is seen in 35% of patients with endometriosis versus 11% of patients without endometriosis. However, the detection of follicular rupture by ultrasound and laparoscopy is very subjective and the diagnosis of this condition is complicated. Therefore, studies that look at endometriosis and LUF must be held suspect. IVF and experimental models: Studies in rabbits have shown that surgical induction of endometriosis leads to a decrease in fertility from 75% to 25%. This may be due to anovulation associated with endometrial implants. Studies have evaluated immune modification in the rabbit model to attempt to restore fertility. We know that during in vitro fertilization endometriosis patients have normal hormonal profiles. There is a tendency towards fewer oocytes and it appears that oocytes derived from ovaries with endometriomas may have a lower fertilization rate and implantation rate. In order to understand whether this effect is due to the embryo or the uterine environment we can look at donor embryo studies. Dr. Simon found decreased donor oocyte implantation rates when the oocytes were from women with endometriosis. In his study, endometriosis in the recipient had no effect on implantation while other studies have found conflicting results. On the other hand, Dr. Bruce Lessey performed endometrial biopsy surface at the time of implantation and found lower levels of vitronectin (an adhesion molecule on the endometrial surface) in women with unexplained and endometriosis related infertility. Treatment with Lupron and ovulation induction appeared to restore this implantation marker and fertility. Peritoneal Effects: The effect of endometriosis on the peritoneal environment may adversely affect fertility. There is an increased volume of peritoneal fluid, and peritoneal macrophages (scavenger white blood cells), are increased both in number and activity. Cytokines (white blood cell chemical messengers) such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Interferon, C3, C4 are all increased. These may adversely affect sperm oocyte interaction, sperm mobility and survival, and oocye pick up. In addition, serum samples obtained from women with endometriosis were found to be embryotoxic in mouse embryo cultures 78% of the time versus 20% in women without endometriosis. Immune System: The immune system is affected by endometriosis and may adversely affect fertility. Patients with endometriosis may show decreased nature killer cell function, and decreased reactivity to transplanted endometrial tissue. In addition, complement, an immune component that breaks apart abnormal cells, is elevated in patients with endometriosis. What Are the Symptoms of Endometriosis? Nearly one-third of the women having endometriosis have no symptomsother than infertility. The others have varying degrees of symptoms,depending on the stage of the disease. Oddly enough, the earlystages or milder forms are frequently more painful than the laterstages. We believe this is because the young endometrial tissueliberates spasm-causing prostaglandins, whereas the older endometrialtissue simply burns out and turns into inactive scar tissue.The most common symptoms associated with endometriosis are pain and infertility, however, premenstrual spotting, urinary urgency, rectal bleeding, painful urination, bloody cough, and skin nodules may also be noted. Endometriosis may frequently mimic other disorders such as pelvic adhesions, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, and ulcer disease. Careful evaluation is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis. Diarrhea or rectal bleeding and tenesmus (sense of rectal fullness) at the time of menses are particularly telling symptoms. Table 17-l gives a profile of the endometriosis patient and tellswhere the implants, which can be found anywhere in the body, aremost frequently located.

Endometriosisassociated with the classic symptoms of painful menstrual periodsand/or painful sexual intercourse is relatively easy to diagnose.However, when the symptoms are less suggestive-unexplained infertility,irregular periods, or spotting, for example-identifying the disease may be more difficult.Occasionally while doing the pelvic examination I can feel thetelltale beading on the outside of the reproductive organs. Theonly definitive diagnostic procedure for endometriosis, however,is a direct look inside the abdominal cavity and a biopsy of thetissue. Diagnostic Laparoscopy Since laparoscopy requires general anesthesia, I try to rule outall other male and female fertility factors before performingit. Depending on the woman's age, history, and findings from theworkup, however, I may choose a more aggressive diagnostic approachfor a particular couple. If the woman is in her thirties and ifshe complains of pelvic pain or has unexplained infertility, I'mlikely to perform a laparoscopy sooner. Viewed through the laparoscope, the endometrial lesions look likeraised shaggy brown or blue-black areas ranging from 2 to 10 cm(1 to 4 inches) in diameter. If the disease has been present fora prolonged period of time, the tissue adjacent to the implantswill pucker and burned-out areas will show fibrotic scars. Advancedendometriosis (stage III or IV) may invade, pucker, and erodethe walls of affected organs, and adhesions may be so dense thatthey "freeze" the pelvic organs into distorted positions. Dr. Redwine has described the progressive nature of endometriosis lesions. They are first seen as clear vesicles, then become red, and then progress to black lesions over a period of 7-10 years. Dr. Karnaky described water blister lesions becoming blue dome cysts over a period of 4-10 years. The clear lesions are seen are at an average age of 21.5 while black scarred lesions are seen at a mean age of 31.9. This progression from clear to red to black lesions with age confirms the progressive nature of this disease if left untreated. Disease will progress in 47-64% of women without therapy and approximately 20% of women with therapy. While performing the laparoscopy, I'll force a colored dye throughthe cervix, uterus, and tubes to demonstrate tubal patency. Manytimes, the dye will flow through only one tube (preferential flow)because that tube provides the least resistance to the coloredliquid. Although this does not mean that the other tube is blocked,it does not rule out that possibility, either. There is poor correlation between the degree of pain or infertility and the severity of disease. Early lesions which are clear or red are metabolically more active than older, dark, fibrotic lesions. This metabolic activity may be responsible for the associated infertility, immune abnormalities, urinary urgency, pelvic pain or diarrhea. Surgical Treatment for Endometriosis When Is Surgery Indicated? The severity of the disease, the woman's history of infertility,the intensity of her desire for pregnancy, and her age all playa role in determining whether or not to do conservative surgeryto restore reproductive structures or to perform a hysterectomy. Unfortunately, even hysterectomy is not a guaranteed cure for the disease as up to 30% of women have persistent pain. In women with distorted tubal-ovarian anatomy due to endometriosis, the first surgery is the most effective. Repeat surgical interventions are less effective at restoring fertility, than the initial attempt, which is best performed by a skilled endoscopist. The most common surgical procedures performed with the laparoscopeare the cutting and removal (lysis) of pelvic adhesions surroundingthe ovaries, tubes, and uterus, exision or surgicalremoval of endometriotic implants and removal of ovarian endometriomas. Surgical treatment of endometriosis consists of cautery, coagulation, excision or vaporization. As most cul-de-sac endometriosis is generally deeper than it may at first appear, excision should be the treatment of choice. Vaporization of adhesions on the ovarian surface, bladder flap, and uterine peritoneum may be beneficial. Uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) Since sensory nerves from the uterus run inside the uterosacral ligament, sometimes I will sever the ligament to relieve the pain associated with endometriosis. This proecedure relieves discomfort related in menstrual cramps in up to 85% of patients. Unfortunately LUNA does not relieve pain associated with adhesions, endometriomas and pelvic sidewall endometriosis. For more severe pain, a pre-sacral neurectomy (PSN) can be performed. In this operation, the the bundle of sensory nerves are cut as they enter the pelvis. As the nerves are surrounded by large veins, bleeding can occassionally complicate this operation. Treatment of ovarian endometriomas has included removal of the ovary, simple drainage, destruction of the cyst-lining with laser, bipolar electrosurgery, monopolar electrosurgery, and excision of the ovarian cyst. Although in many cases the cyst-lining can be stripped from inside the ovary during laparoscopy, in approximately 30% of the cases, this cannot be performed. In these cases, unless destruction of the lining is carried out, the endometrioma will likely recur. Use of an Argon beam coagulator, C02 laser or bipolar electrocautery are the methods of choice in this situation. Monopolar cautery must be used with caution as deeper penetration with this method may destroy normal ovarian tissue and cause premature ovarian failure. Success Rate with Surgery Pregnancy rates following surgery generally range between 35-40% for severe endometriosis to 55-65% with milder disease. Of those who become pregnant, 30 percent conceivewithin three months, 50 percent within six months, and 86 percentwithin fifteen months. There appears to be no difference in pregnancy rates with laparoscopy or laparotomy with laser or electrosurgical techniques. While long term pregnancy rates may approach 65%, surgical studies that look at fecundity show monthly pregnancy rates as low as 3-6% per month following surgical treatment of this disease (versus 20% per month in fertile women). Usually, normal monthly pregnancy rates can be achieved with ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination. Post-operative pregnancy rates appear best for those with infertility of short duration of one to two years of 68%. Those who have been trying between three and seven years have a 43% pregnancy rate, while those with eight or more years of infertility demonstrate a pregnancy rate of less than 10%. Table 17-4 indicates the pregnancy ratesfollowing surgery for endometriosis.

Withthis procedure the recurrence rate is only 1 to 3 percent. However, the use of estrogen-only hormone replacement or leaving an ovary behind significantly increase your risk that pain will recur. Up to 30% or more will experience recurrent endometriosis symptoms if both ovaries are not removed. For this resason I often recommend a hormone-free period before initiating hormone replacement therapy with a combination of estrogen and progesterone. Somewomen with a history of severe pain will request a hysterectomy.After fighting her endometriosis and Michael's retrograde ejaculationfor years, Shelley T. decided to have a hysterectomy. "It felt so good for our fertility nightmare to end,"Shelley said. "We could finally have sex for fun. And wedidn't have to worry anymore about whether or not my period wouldstart each month. I didn't realize how much pain I had each monthuntil it was over. I wish I'd done it sooner." Medical Treatment for Endometriosis Historical Medical Approaches Multiple studies have reported a 4-5 times improvement in fecundity (monthly chance of conception) with empirical treatment, super-ovulation with either clomiphene or injectable gonadotropins (Humegon, Metrodin, Pergonal) combined with intrauterine insemination. A number of different types of medical regimens have been triedbut discarded because of adverse side effects and questionableresults: androgen, estrogen, progestin, and high-dose estrogen-progestin.The aim of all these therapies was to suppress ovulation and mensesfor a prolonged period of time in hopes that in an unstimulatedenvironment (decidualization) the disease would regress. Birth Control Pills, Danazol, Lupron, Synarel, Zoladex, depot-Provera and Norplant have not been proven effective as either primary or adjunctive therapy (combined with surgery) for endometriosis related infertility. While the use of medical treatment may decrease inflammatory reactions making surgical correction easier and reduce endometriosis-related pain, use of these medications in patients with minimal disease is of no proven benefit in treating infertility. "Taking the Pill Decreases Pain but Won't Help You Get Pregnant" Because many women reported that their symptoms from endometriosissubsided when they were on birth control pills, doctors beganusing the Pill to control the disease. By suppressing their periodsfor nine months or more with very high-dose birth control pills,80 to 90 percent of these women suffered less pain, and nearlyhalf became pregnant when they discontinued the medication. However,endometriosis recurred in a third of these patients. Because ofthe adverse side effects from high-dose hormones and the marginal results, high-dose birth control pills are not used today to treat endometriosis. Today's low-dose birth control pill not only may reduce the riskof developing endometriosis, but for many it also seems to providetemporary relief from the symptoms. Some physicians suggest that their patients skip the placebo pills (pills 22-28) and start a new pack each 21 days. While this may be an effective method of treating pain related to endometriosis, the Pill is also very effective contraceptive. The Pill may also preserve the woman's fertility by temporarily containing the milder formsof the disease. For these reasons young women with endometriosismay wish to take the Pill until they decide to start their families. I should caution you, however, that if you suspect you have endometriosis,you should not delay treatment by taking birth control pills untilyou are thirty years old. By then the disease may already silentlyhave invaded your reproductive organs and made restoring yourfertility difficult. Danazol Therapy Initially popular after being introduced in 1975, because of unpleasant and often irreversible side-effects, Danazol is rarely the chosen for initial therapy. Danazol inhibits the release of FSH and LH by the pituitary gland.The endometrial implants will improve in 85 to 95 percent of thewomen taking the drug. Danazol seems to be most effective in womenwith mild or moderate endometriosis (stages I and II). Mensesreturn four to six weeks after stopping the drug, and the bestchances for pregnancy occur about two months after that. Pregnancyrates may be as high as 50 percent with Danazol therapy. Due tothe side effects, however, about 5 to 10 percent of the womenstop taking Danazol. Table 17-2 illustrates the astounding improvementthis drug offers. Potential side effects are profiled in table17-3.

By blocking the production and release of LH and FSH, GnRH agonist (Lupron, Synarel and Zoladex)lower estrogen to menopausal levels. The drug creates the pseudomenopausal state desirable for reducing the size and number of endometriotic lesions. Synarel, a daily nasal spray; Lupron, a monthly injection; and Zoladex, a monthly implant; appear to be equally effective. Side effects are most often due to the lowered estrogen levels. They include: hot flashes, vaginal dryness, headaches and sleep disturbances. Rarely, complications such as short term memory loss, muscle, bone and joint pains and decreased bone calcium. Soreness at the injection site may be seen with Lupron and Zoladex, while nasal stuffiness and burning have been reported with the use of Synarel. These medications are approved for six months of use, and many endometriosis sufferers report six months of blissful relief. Unfortuantely, not all women respond and GnRH agonists are definitely not a cure for endometriosis. They merely suppress endometriosis during the course of therapy. Unfortunately, without aggressive surgical excision, endometriosis often returns within months of discontinuing any of these medications. So why use them if the endometriosis is going to return? GnRH agonists reduce endometriosis-related pain. If the diagnosis of endometriosis was made at a previous surgery, often a GnRH-agonist can effectively reduce your pain. After a three to six month course of therapy, you can either switch to the Pill, Depo-provera or Norplant as these often prolong the pain relief induced by a GnRH agonist. Others choose to continue agonist therapy with add-back. Add-back therapy involves the daily administration of a small dose of estrogen and progesterone. Given together in combination, these two medications will lessen the side effects due to low estrogen and minimize further bone loss. Further steps to prevent bone loss include monitoring bone turnover with NTX and insuring an adequate dietary calcium intake. GnRH agonists may faciliate surgical treatment. By reducing endometriosis related inflammation, surgery is easier. These is less raw surface area when endometriosis is resected and adhesions are separated. This may minimize subsequent adhesion reformation. GnRH agonists can be used as a diagnostic tool. You may wish to postone costly diagnostic surgery. If you benefit from a short course of GnRH agonist, it is more likely that surgical excision will be of benefit than if you did not respond with a significant reducation of pain. GnRH agonists do not restore normal fertility in patients with endometriosis. While GnRH agonists can benefit patients undergoing ovulation induction or in vitro fertilization, their use after surgery in patients with minimal or moderate disease that has been excised does not improve pregnancy rates. Medical Therapy Combined with Surgery In women with more severe endometriosis (stage III or IV), medical therapy may be combined with surgery to provide even better results. Frequentlyphysicians prescribe the medication prior to surgery to reducethe number and size of the lesions. Surgery following medical treatment is much less likely to destroy healthy tissue and causeadhesions. To reduce inflammation and in an attempt to clear up any remaining endometriosis, medical treatment is also prescribedfollowing surgery. Reportedly this approach increases the chances for women with severe endometriosis to become pregnant.Some physicians, however, feel that since the highest levelsof fertility immediately follow surgery, postponing ovulationwith postsurgical medical treatment may rob you of your best chancesfor pregnancy. Therapy for Mild Endometriosis (Stages I and II) Treatments for mild forms of the disease are controversial. Some physicians feel that since adhesions may not form at this stage,it's better to take a wait-and-see approach (expectant therapy)rather than prescribing heavy doses of medication. Although most studies have found no proven benefit of surgical treatment for minimal endometriosis, more recent studies suggest increased pregnancy rates after completely excising all endometriosis. Therefore, as endometriosis progresses in up to 60% of women if untreated, aggressive surgical management at the time of discovery leads to the long term best results. After exising all endometrial implants with the laparoscope,up to 75 percent of these women will become pregnant within twelveto eighteen months without additional medication. If no pregnancyoccurs within six, the patient is older than 35 years of age or, has been attempting pregnancy for over two years, super-ovulation and intrauterine insemination is often successful. For those with extensive inflammatory endometriosis, I recommend a short course of GnRH agonist followed immediately by more agressive therapy. However, for most patients with minimal or mild disease who have undergone complete surgical excision, the use of GnRH agonists or danocrine are not likely to improve pregnancy rates or prevent recurrences. Therapy for Moderate and Severe Endoemtriosis (Stages III and IV) Stages III and IV endometriosis, however, often cause thicker and broader-based adhesions thanearly endometriosis and often cause the ovary to stick to thepelvic sidewall. Frequently the wall of the large bowel or rectum are involved and a portion of the bowel will also need to be removed. Since the removal of these types of adhesions and endometriosis of the bowel and rectum require more care than removing the filmy ones associated with earlier stages of the disease, this type of surgery is best performed by a well skilled endometriosis team. Prior to planning your surgery, I will have you consult with a bowel surgeon who may recommend a barium enema (x-ray) or an office procedure where the rectum and sigmoid colon are visualized with a flexible telescope. I will often recommend a GnRH agonist (Lupron, Synarel, Zoladex) prior to surgery to decrease inflammation. To safely perform bowel surgery it is necessary to perform a bowel prep a day or two before surgery (enemas, antibiotics and magnesium citrate or Golytely). But as I can never be sure when endometriosis of the bowel or rectum will be encountered and bowel surgery will become necessary, I order the bowel prep on all laparoscopy patients. Resolving Multiple Problems Is a Complex Task Because endometriosis may cause so many fertility problems-anovulation,luteal phase defect, adhesions, tubal blockage, ectopic pregnancies, and idiopathic (unknown) infertility-treating endometriosis can be very complex. I may have to decide if ovulationinduction will work in the presence of the disease; or if theendometriosis must be treated before trying ovulation inductiontherapy. And before even attempting ovulation induction therapy,I must be relatively certain that adhesions will notinterfere with fertilization or cause an ectopic pregnancy. Ifyou are at risk for an ectopic pregnancy, medical and endoscopic surgical treatmentmay significantly reduce your risks for this complication. After I perform surgery to remove endometrial implants, clearadhesions, and perform tubal repairs, I must reassess your fertilitypotential. Together we can explore the post surgical treatment options below and develop a plan that best meets your needs. Expectant management (wait & see) Ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination In vitro fertilization Where to find help I strongly advise you to consult with a fellowship trained reproductive endocrinologist(RE)who can offer the full range of treatment infertility options as well as provide you with state of the art surgical treatment. By consulting with an RE, you may learn that in vitro fertilization or superovulation and intrauterine insemination will provide a better opportunity for success and than surgery. However, if surgery is necessary, your procedure will be performed by a skilled endoscopist best trained to protect your future fertility Fortunately there are many ways to solve these problems and getall of your systems working in perfect harmony so you will haveyour chance at making a baby-the greatest miracle of all.

"We did that, too. We put off buying a house, getting a car, changing jobs, taking a vacation . . ." "So have we," Bryan W. interrupted. "We spend all our extra money on medical bills. We can't do anything else." "The menstrual cycle takes over your whole life," Steven S. added. Kathy agreed. "Every time we want to leave for the weekend, I have to go in for ultrasound or Steven has to collect a specimen for AIH. There's no time for making other plans." Of "We don't even go to my parents' house anymore," Shelley T. said. "I can't stand all the questions: 'When are you going to give us a grandchild?' Or, 'Why don't you just relax? Let nature take its course.' " Kathy interrupted. "I don't go to baby showers anymore either. I used to cry for days afterward and I don't need that kind of grief." "You have the right to avoid painful situations," the RESOLVE leader agreed. "There's no rule that says you have to force yourselves to face these situations all of the time. you have to plan your own life and be true to your own needs. "You need to give yourselves permission to move on with your lives. Putting off buying new clothes because you may need a maternity wardrobe instead; delaying your vacation because you might miss a call from the adoption agency; keeping your old job because if you get pregnant you don't want to lose your maternity benefits�it can go on and on. Giving up your other dreams and all the fun in your life only adds to your frustration and anger." Then Margaret B. spoke: "I'm beginning to understand what you're saying. We aren't just upset about our fertility problem; we're also upset about how our fertility problem is ruining the rest of our lives." "So if we would try to live like normal people, we would be happier." Richard B. reached for Margaret's hand. "It would do a lot for our marriage, too." Even when only one partner must be medically treated, I find that the fertility problem affects them both because the couple loses control of their destiny, the couple undergoes fertility treatment, and the couple shares the emotional strain of dealing with friends and family. Infertility does not just affect one person; it affects the couple. In this chapter I want to help you rethink the attitudes that may be interfering with your self-esteem, your sexuality, and your progress toward pregnancy. You are entitled to have the freedom to be yourself and to consider new options apart from what others expect or demand. I want to put you back in control of your life so that you can deal with your marriage, your family, your friends, and your career. And I'm certain that as a couple you will grow closer and stronger from your efforts. Infertility�a Recycling Life Crisis Coping with a fertility problem is as significant a life crisis as adjusting to the death of a loved one. Because of the ambiguity of the loss, however, couples with fertility problems have difficulty getting over their crisis: there is no body to bury and no clear-cut stopping point. Perhaps it's more like having a loved one missing in action. There's always hope: just one more month of treatment, just one more surgery, maybe next month will be The One. With each attempt the couple develops renewed hope, and with each failure the couple mourns their loss. Then, once again, they muster up enough strength to get back on the emotional crisis roller coaster: they try again, and again, and again. Riding the Emotional Crisis Roller Coaster Shock and denial. When you learn that you are "infertile" or that your fertility treatment has failed, at first you become numb. you may have difficulty thinking, experience emotional swings and outbursts, and show impaired judgment. You may only be able to function from day to day and not really believe the facts: "This can't be happening to me. I'm not infertile, I just can't get pregnant." "Until now I had a perfectly ordered life; then everything just hit the wall." This period of adjustment may last several weeks or even a couple of months Searching and learning is a period during which you want to learn everything you can about infertility, so you can make some sense of it. you read everything you can get your hands on and talk to infertile couples every chance you get. you may frequently find yourself becoming angry, restless, impatient, and indecisive. You begin to feel guilty about what you perceive as past transgressions: an abortion you had as a teenager, an affair that caused PID, or using birth control for so many years. During this time, studies show that you are at greatest risk for developing an illness. Bargaining and guilt is a stage where you attempt to regain control of your life and do a lot of crying. You may look to God for answers or promise to "be good" if you get pregnant. You may find yourself saying, "What did I do to deserve this?" "Maybe I'm too selfish," "It's your fault," or "Maybe we don't deserve children; our marriage isn't the greatest in the world." Anger grows from the senselessness and futility of the situation. You become resentful, enraged, and feel helpless. You feel that you've lost control of one of your basic rights. You say, "Why me? All sorts of other people can have babies. I'm a good, wholesome person, so why do I have to suffer?" Optimism and hope grow as you begin to believe that treatment will help. You work hard at your treatment, but your anger and frustration increase with each failure. You may even start to con yourself: "I'm sure everything will work out," "It doesn't really matter anyway," "I should feel happy� I've got everything else I could want," "Maybe if we adopt, I'll get preg-nant," "Maybe we shouldn't have any children." Depression descends from your pain, despair, emptiness, and sadness. For many, life loses its meaning and pregnancy becomes an obsession. You try more bargaining: "We'll do anything." Any failure�at workup at school, in bed�is seen as "another example of my inadequacy." You begin to think that you may be going crazy: "I'm trapped in hope; I don't want to hope anymore." Reorganization follows depression and is characterized by better judg-ment, better eating and sleeping. The obsessive drive is gone; you are healthier; you begin to get your priorities into perspective. You stop fighting what's happening and realize that like it or not, fertility problems are part of your life and need to be dealt with, not denied. Acceptance and resolution take place when the doctor says, "We've done all we can." Once the pain subsides, you begin to say, "Maybe it would be okay to decide not to have children"; "If I never have a baby, I at least have a husband who loves me. We're going through this together and he's right with me"; "I was courageous to get this far." you begin to laugh and make plans to get on with life unless you have renewed hope�a new treatment, a new doctor, a breakthrough in technology�and then you hop aboard the emo-tional roller coaster for another round. The time people spend in each stage of emotional crisis varies from one person to another. Their ability to help themselves, to communicate, to handle their thoughts, to manage anger, to adjust to stress, and to resolve conflicts help them move through the stages. People who fail to deal with any one stage of grief get caught�caught in bargaining and guilt, caught in anger, caught in depression. People who learn to deal with each stage, one step at a time, accept their situation, take control of their lives, and start living again. Many of my patients have done this and you can learn to do it, too. Recognize the Danger Signs of Excessive Stress Sometimes stress levels build to unreasonable levels. Your coping skills fail and you begin to use inappropriate and ineffective techniques to resolve your problems. If you find yourself resorting frequently to the mechanisms described below, you may want to seek outside counseling or do some quiet thinking and talking with your spouse or close friend about what is happening. Displacement�redirecting your feelings from the original person or prob-lem to another person or object. For example, when Michelle P. became upset with her mother, she would take it out on her husband. After her husband gently called this to her attention, they worked out a strategy for her to deal more effectively with her mother. Dependency�letting someone take care of you and make all of your decisions for you so you are free to "opt out" of life. For example, Vicky M. let her husband take care of all the funeral arrangements for their stillborn child. Vicky always regretted that she hadn't picked out the dress their daughter was buried in. she hated her weakness. Aggression�moving against another person. Dan M. spent all of his time figuring out how to get back at someone instead of figuring out how to level with the person about how he felt. When he learned to say "Ouch!" he found that people really didn't intend to hurt him, they just didn't understand. Passivity and evasion�seizing power by becoming passive, by avoiding responsibility, or by pouting. John T. used to say, "I don't care�do what you want," when he really didn't feel that way. Then he learned that people would consider his feelings if he shared them. That was the first step John took toward taking control of his life. Sexual withdrawal�expressing disapproval or anger by withholding sexual favors. Not wanting to make love after an argument is understandable, but using sex to get your way is inappropriate. You may wish to rate yourself on the checklist below. If you have too many pluses for your own comfort, you may want to seek outside counseling. Often a counselor can quickly relieve your anxiety by helping you get your priorities in order and pinpointing the key elements of a problem so you can deal with each stressful situation one step at a time. Stress Assessment Check List Make a copy of this questionnaire or write the statements on a sheet of paper or in a notebook. Then place a plus (+) beside each statement that describes you, a minus ( - ) beside each statement that does not describe you. I've lost interest in almost everything but my fertility treatment. I don't know what to do with my free time. I spend all day keeping the house spotless/spend long hours on work so I won't think about not having children. People make too many demands on my time. I don't seem to be able to say no to my doctor or my spouse. I don't care what I look like anymore. Sometimes I don't keep my BBT chart or take the medicine my doctor ordered. I never have any time for me; my schedule revolves around my fertility treatment. Other people' s opinions are more important than mine. I can't concentrate; all I can think about is getting pregnant. I don't sleep well; wake up too early; don't feel rested. I feel like my body is my enemy. I nap in the afternoon or fall asleep early in the evening. I've lost my sense of humor. Without children in my life there's no room for happiness and fun. I often cry for what seems like no reason. Sometimes I just feel numb and emotionless, especially about having sex. Sometimes I laugh nervously and loud. I want to be alone most of the time. I can't bear having to explain my infertility to anyone anymore. Life seems superficial. I feel cheated. I need a lot of reassurance from my friends. When I'm down, I crave foods, especially carbohydrates. Sometimes I'm too tense to eat. I often feel resentful and angry, and don't know why. Sometimes I wish I could start life over so I could avoid the mistakes that led to my fertility problem. I often ignore things that in the past would have upset me. Frequently I'm impatient and irritable. I may even accuse my spouse or doctor of not doing his/her best to help me with my fertility problem. I think about and talk about the past a lot. Without children I don't have much of a future. Getting Control of Your Life Be Your Own Best Friend Can you look in the mirror, smile, and say, "You are really something special !" ? If you cannot, it's probably because you reevaluate yourself every time someone else disapproves of you or something you've done. Don't let other people knock you off balance by suggesting a different doctor or a new treatment. Their opinion or point of view is not any more valid than your own. you need to learn to look at yourself, and life, through your own eyes. With your experience and knowledge you know far more about fertility treatment than most people. You know where you're going and how you're going to get there. Accept yourself as a "package deal"�overall, you are okay. Look Ahead You need to break the habit of living life laced with guilt, always saying things like, "I should have changed doctors two years ago," "If only I had tried to get pregnant ten years ago," or, "What if I had not used an IUD?" Separate your past from your future and move ahead. Allow yourself to change your mind. Give yourself permission to act instead of looking to others for permission and approval. Don't feel as though you have to justify your decisions. Manage your own life. Enjoy yourself and laugh a lot! Be Assertive, Not Aggressive Assertiveness is the key to effective communication. By becoming assert-ive, you can avoid internalizing your anger and frustration. When you communicate your feelings honestly�your disappointment, your pain, your frustration�you help others understand you so they can meet your needs. If they are not concerned about your needs, perhaps you should reconsider the relationship. You can find out how assertive you are with the following checklist. Try to be as honest with yourself as you can. Your first impression is probably the truest answer. Assertiveness Checklist Make a copy of this questionnaire or write the statements on a sheet of paper or in a notebook. Then place a plus (+) beside each statement that describes you; a minus ( - ) beside each statement that does not describe you. I usually speak up for what I believe (my doctor, my choice of fertility treatment). I usually state my views on issues important to me (my right to avoid baby showers, my choice of treatment). I don't mind complaining openly. I can say no to my doctor, spouse, and relatives without feeling guilty. I don't mind disagreeing with the majority. I don't try to avoid an argument. I ask questions of my doctor. I frequently offer suggestions to my doctor. I can accept a compliment without putting myself down. I can accept rejection without getting upset. I can express my anger honestly�especially when a treatment fails to produce a pregnancy. I can tell someone he/she is bothering me. I can initiate sex with my partner, even during the infertile days of the month. I can ask to be caressed. I can tell my lover what feels good to me. I can choose not to answer questions about my fertility and plans for a family. I can ask for favors. I have confidence in my own judgment about my fertility treatment. I can let others control the conversation at family gatherings. I often compliment other people. I can speak to a group of people. I can tell my family and friends when I disagree with their suggestions for fertility treatment. I can introduce myself to strangers. I can tell jokes. I do not have difficulty making decisions about my fertility. If your checklist is full of pluses, you don't have a problem with assertiveness. If you have more minuses than you think you should, here are a few suggestions for improving your score: Plan Some New Responses to Old Problems Keep track of your assertiveness by reviewing your responses in specific situations. For example, remember the last time someone's insensitivity made you angry? Perhaps someone said something like, "I don't know why having a baby is so important to you. There are other things in the world besides having babies." If you became angry but didn't express it, withdrew from the situation, or found yourself wanting to leave, consider this: Were you upset because of what the other person said or because you were not able to respond? Not willing to stand up for your ideas or your opinions? Many times we are more angry with ourselves for letting others control our emotions than we are because the other person didn't understand us. If you withdraw from the situation instead of asserting yourself, you will probably kick yourself all the way home�and the next day, too. Imagine handling the situation assertively. What should you have said? Should you have called him a name? Should you have tried to explain your needs? Should you never invite that person to your house again? What are the consequences of these actions? Can you live with them? If you need some help in deciding what to do, ask someone. Perhaps watching a role model will give you some ideas. Support groups like RESOLVE are especially good at showing you how other couples have dealt with stressful situations. Set a realistic goal for the next encounter. Try it out. See what happens. If necessary, modify your approach and try it again. How do you feel? Stick with it. Keep Communication Open and Honest Have you ever felt that other people don't understand you, that when you try to talk to them they don't listen? It's hard enough to talk about your fertility problems and the effects they have on your life, let alone trying to get through someone else's thick head at the same time. There are a few principles of good communication which might give you an edge: Communicate to be heard, not to win. Inform; don't try to teach. Make requests, not demands. Ask for what you need; don't expect others to read your mind. Go for compromise, not perfection. These principles make a lot of sense, but putting them into practice is another matter altogether. Think about different ways you could say the same thing. Winning: "I won't go to your sister's baby shower." Communicating: "When I go to baby showers, I feel awful." Teaching: "People need funerals to mourn their loss." Informing: "I really need my family with me right now, to help me say good-bye to our baby." Demanding: "I need next Wednesday off. I have a doctor's appointment to take some tests." Requesting: "I need to take some tests at my doctor's next Wednesday. Do you see any problem with my taking a couple of hours off? I can make up the time by coming in early Monday and Tuesday." Waiting for telepathy: "You know why I'm mad!" Asking for what you need: "Mom, please don't ask me after every appointment what the doctor said. If anything happens, I'll let you know." Insisting on perfection: "You ought to understand what I mean! After all, you're a college graduate!" Going for the compromise: "Would you try to understand? I think it would help us get along better." I know some of these statements sound familiar to you. As I was writing them, I recalled a few situations I could have handled better, too. Try to remember that you and your mate are a team; you're both on the same side. Maybe you go about reaching your goals differently, and maybe your priorities are not exactly the same, but you aren't enemies, and you aren't plotting to do the other one in. When disagreements flare, try to put yourself in the other person's place, and remember; principles are rarely more important than people. If you seem to have reached an impasse, you may wish to consult with a trusted friend, counselor, or member of the clergy. Perhaps they will be able to help you get a different perspective. If you level with family members, friends, and your boss about your feelings, instead of lecturing them or hoping they'll read your mind, they will be more likely to understand you and respect your decisions. Remember that a series of small earth tremors relieves tension and pres-sure within the fault and often prevents a major earthquake. Likewise, if you handle each situation as it arises, you can relieve stress and tension in your relationships and perhaps prevent a major upheaval. Techniques for Handling Your Thoughts Many people who survive serious accidents, undergo major surgery, or narrowly escape death relive the events as though they had a videotape in their brain. Reviewing the details of tragic events is a normal mechanism for dealing with stress and grief. We use this process to desensitize ourselves and to come to terms with what happened. However, when our thoughts take over our lives, as they did Debbie W's., when they prevent us from moving ahead, we must yell "Stop!" out loud and shift to pleasant thoughts. "When the RESOLVE group told me to stop ruminating over my lost baby by yelling 'Stop,' I thought people would think I was crazy," Debbie W. said. "But it worked. I finally convinced myself to live for the future instead of burying myself in the tragedy of my past. Now, instead of planning my baby's funeral, I'm decorating the nursery." Prepare for Stressful Situations You need to prepare yourself for stressful situations, even rehearse and practice for them. First, say to yourself: I am important. My opinions count. I have the right to say what I feel. When the conflict begins, convince yourself to take the action you know is needed. Believe that what you want is important. "I used to dread going to Sunday dinner at Mom's. My brother and his children always came and there was never a Sunday that someone didn't say, 'When are you going to give us a grandchild?' It had gotten to the point that my wife and I didn't want to see them again. But the RESOLVE group convinced me that my folks just didn't know they were hurting me and that I needed to level with them." "I practiced what I wanted to say to them every day for a week, over and over, until I could say those words in my sleep: Mom, Dad, no one wants to give you a grandchild any more than Jan and I do. But right now we can't. We're doing everything we can to solve our problem. I know you don't mean to hurt us, but asking us when we're going to give you a grandchild only makes us feel like failures. We'd both appreciate your not saying any more about it." "You can't imagine how hard it was to tell my mom and dad that. But you know, they were really sorry. They had no idea they were hurting us. My dad apologized and Mom gave Jan a big hug. Now we look forward to spending Sunday with the folks." How to Control Your Anger Anger is a natural, healthy, non-evil emotion. Go ahead and get angry! Get it off your chest! But next time, why don't you lay some plans that will avoid an angry confrontation. If you become angry, it's probably because you've given someone else the power to control you and your emotions. Remember, you are responsible for your feelings; others don't make you angry. How many times have you become angry when someone said: "One of these days you'll pop up pregnant." As someone puts her newborn in your arms: "You're going to have one of these someday." "Isn't it about time for you to have children?" "You'll just have to accept things." "I don't understand why you do that to your body, just to have a baby. It isn't worth it." Get to know yourself. Know what triggers your anger, what pushes your anger button. And don't set yourself up to get angry. Instead, plan some alternatives for these situations. If you know, for example, that holding a newborn baby drives you up the wall, be ready to say, "Oh, I'd better not hold her. I think I'm coming down with a cold." Or if you become uncomfort-able at a dinner party, when someone you barely know asks you how many children you have, brush it off by saying, "We aren't quite ready to start our family yet." You must remember that most people don't intend to cause you discom-fort. And often they really aren't extremely interested in your answer; they're just making small talk. It's usually only because you are listening defensively that what they say gets to you. Getting angry is your problem, not theirs. If someone repeatedly bothers you, a relative, for example, then you need to assert yourself and say, "Mother, you know it's unlikely that we're going to 'pop up pregnant' someday. You aren't cheering me up, you're making me feel worse. I'd appreciate your not saying things like that." Or, "We aren't ready to 'accept things.' As long as our doctor has hope, we aren't giving up. When you say things like that, I feel angry. I'd appreciate changing the subject." Remember: Stick to specifics and to the present situation. Avoid generalizing and reviewing the entire history of your relationship. Deal with issues as they arise, when you feel your anger building. Work toward a resolution, not a victory. Be honest with people, share your feelings with them, and don't put them on the defensive by making accusations. If they really care about you, they will do their best to help. Learn to Fight Fair It's okay to fight if you fight fair. Fair fights release tension and often lead to the resolution of problems. Unfair fights, though, create more tension and do not solve anything. To fight fair, you need to follow these rules: Do not tell your mate what he or she is thinking: "You don't really want this baby!" Instead, say how you are feeling: "Sometimes I'm not sure that you want this baby." Do not reach into the past for insults and injustices: "If you'd taken a semen analysis in the beginning, we'd be a year ahead of where we are now!" Instead, stick to the present: "Let's make an appointment to see the urologist." Do not resort to name-calling: "Your mother is a bitch !" Instead, look for solutions: "I believe it would be best for me to avoid long visits with you mother." Avoid a win/lose position: "I'm not changing my mind." Instead, seek understanding: "I feel very strongly about my position. I don't believe I can change my mind." When Is It Time to Quit I wish I could give you a magic answer to this question: call a halt after two years, after in vitro, after adoption. But it's not that simple. There is no concrete answer that works for everyone. Some people decide to take a breather from the rigors of fertility treatment: to stop taking their temperature, to stop taking medication, to stop worrying about whether they'll get pregnant this month. In fact, many even use birth control to prevent a pregnancy. After they've had some time to relax and to enjoy life, or after hearing of a new breakthrough in fertility treatment, they may once again renew their treatment efforts. Other people want to make a final decision: they have a hysterectomy; they stop treatment and apply for adoption; they have their tubes tied. They want to get off the roller coaster forever and get on with their lives. The best time to quit is when you decide to�not when you run out of money, not when others say it's all right, not when you've tried every possible treatment, not when you've hit bottom, but when you decide you want to quit. As a couple, you must decide what "happy ending" will meet your needs. Will you be satisfied to remain childless? Will an adopted child meet your parenting needs? Will AID meet your needs? Will a surrogate mother meet your needs? Is an embryo transfer the answer? How much money are you comfortable spending? How much time will you devote to solving your fertility problem? Only when you've answered these questions to your satisfaction will you be able to move on with your life. Two Special People "What do you do when your spirits get low?" Shelley T. asked. "Well, a good cry helps a lot!" Kathy S. smiled. "I've even been known to slam every door in the house!" The group laughed. "I appreciate the little things Bryan does to cheer me up," Debbie W. added. "After my second miscarriage he brought me breakfast in bed for a week. And every once in a while, for no special reason, he'll bring me a red rose." "When we really get down, we splurge on something," Michael T. said. "It seems like we give up everything to pay for our fertility treatment. So even though we're careful to watch our budget, once in a while we do something specialgo out to eat, go skiing, buy a new camera." "Taking my temperature every morning used to get me down," Kathy said. "I hated to tell Steven, 'Today's the day.' It really helped when Steven started recording my temperature for me. Sharing the responsibility and making him aware of my fertile days took a lot of pressure off both of us." "Let's face it, the stress we're under really strains our sexual desires and Performance," Shelley said. "We really have trouble before a postcoital test." "Ever since I realized I had a fertility problem, I haven't been able to enjoy sex�even during my so-called infertile days," Margaret B. said. "I've always been haunted by a lingering hope: maybe this time will be the time that works." "Me, too," Kathy said. "But Steven always refuses to let our infertility get us down. I don't know what I would do without his positive attitude. Just when I'm at my lowest, he'll say, 'We're not going to let this thing stop our life.' " Shelley said: "A couple I know sometimes uses birth control so they can enjoy sex. Because they know they can't get pregnant, neither of them feels that they must perform, and when her period starts, they don't feel they failed that month." "It seems to me that infertility disturbs women more than it does men," Kathy said. "At least we seem to show it more," Margaret said. "I don't know about that," Shelley countered. "One time I thought Michael was going off the deep end. I didn't know what to do, so I called a RESOLVE member for help. she suggested that Michael talk to a RESOLVE husband having a similar fertility problem." "Talking to Jerry was the best thing I ever did," Michael said. "You know, that's really the key," Kathy said. "Having someone who will listen to you. "Keeping our marriage together and learning again how to enjoy our sexuality hasn't been easy," Kathy added. "We've had to work hard at it, over many months." She reached for Steven's hand. "But it's been worth it." She smiled. "I don't mean to sound conceited, but I believe we have a stronger marriage than most of our friends, who have not gone through what we've had to." You Have the Power to Change Like these couples, you have the power to change your life. Change is hard work; it usually comes in small steps; not all at once. Always keep in mind that you can change only yourself and those things under your control, not others. When you approach life assertively, fight fair, express your needs, accept responsibility for your feelings, and act openly and honestly�with yourself and with others�you will see the world through a new light. Armed with this knowledge and understanding about fertility treatment, you will be in control of your life and your future. Keep your spirits up and know that you can do it. you are working with an infinitely valuable resource�yourself. Table of Content. Ch21: High Tech Babies: Now and in the Future. ARHC Homepage.

Sometimes it seems like no matter what you do, it's the wrong thing. I'd like to give you a few suggestions that may help you be the friend I know you want to be: Be ready to listen. Infertile couples have a lot on their minds and need someone to talk to. Sometimes a good ear helps people get things off their chests. A good listener can help people express their anxiety, anger, and guilt; or help people work out solutions to problems. Without offering any suggestions your attentiveness and interest may provide the comfort and reassure ance these couples need most. Don't offer advice unless you are really well informed. Infertile couples read everything they can get their hands on. Sometimes it seems as though they know more about fertility treatment than their own doctors. So talking off the cuff about something you don't really know about will only make them angry and defensive. Be sensitive and don't joke about infertility; attempts at levity will only anger them. Joking about infertility is as inappropriate as joking about death at a funeral. Remember, infertile couples are hypersensitive about many things. Try to put yourself in their shoes whenever you insist they come to a baby shower, when you brag about your children's achievements, or when you tell them about your friend's daughter who got pregnant at fourteen. Be patient. This couple may experience mood swings with every treatment or monthly cycle. One week they may be high because a new treatment promises hope; the next week they may be in mourning for the child they lost (didn't make) this month. They may be riding an exhausting emotional roller coaster which makes their actions and moods unpredictable. Try to understand and flow with their changes. And remember that when they want to be alone, they are not rejecting you. Don't get your feelings hurt by the preoccupation they have with their problems; keep in touch. Show that you understand their difficulty. Say things like, "I know this is difficult for you," "I don't envy what you're going through," or, "If there is anything I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask." If you aren't sure about what they are experiencing, read some articles and books that discuss the emotional aspects of fertility problems. Be realistic and supportive of their decisions for or against fertility treatment. Once they've reached a difficult decision, don't say, "Shouldn't you see another doctor?"; "Are you sure that you really want to adopt?"; or, "I'd never consider doing that!" These couples usually weigh each issue as though it were a life-or-death decision. Don't take their decisions lightly unless you have good reason to. Don't put down their doctor or choices for treatment. Refrain from making comments like, "I never heard of a doctor doing that. Does he know what he's doing?" or, "You don't need surgery. What you need is a vacation." Unless, from your reading or experience, you are certain that their physician is not using accepted methods, keep quiet about these topics. Be truthful. Don't, for example, try to hide a pregnancy in the family. The truth does not hurt, provided you are not brutally frank. Let them know when you don't know what to say. The couple will appreciate your honesty and will probably suggest how you can help them in that particular situation, even if it means remaining quiet. Admitting your problem will help establish honest communication. Be an advocate for infertile couples. Educate others and speak up for the couple's decisions. Promote your local RESOLVE chapter. If you do not have a support group in your community, help form one. Understand that individuals and couples respond to fertility problems differently. Learn to recognize the normal emotional stages they are experiencing�denial, anger, depression, mourning, acceptance, and so forth. And realize that they may cycle through these stages with each new round of treatment and with each lost opportunity. Accept them when they are angry accept them when they are depressed, and accept them when they feel guilty. Unless they remain in a single stage for a prolonged period of time, don't become overly concerned. Above all, be there when they need you and show them that you care. This is a stressful time for everyone. Don't underestimate how important you and your relationship are to this couple. Your understanding and support can make a significant difference during this difficult period. Mark Perloe M D Atlanta, GA For information on Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Email me directly.

Abortion, Incomplete: An abortion after which some tissue remains inside the uterus. A D&C must be performed to remove the tissue and prevent complications. Abortion, Missed: An abortion where the fetus dies in the uterus but there is no bleeding or cramping. A D&C will be needed to remove the fetal remains and prevent complications. Abortion, Spontaneous: A pregnancy loss during the first twenty weeks of gestation. Abortion, Therapeutic: A procedure used to terminate a pregnancy before the fetus can survive on its own. Abortion, Threatened: Spotting or bleeding that occurs early in the pregnancy. May progress to spontaneous abortion. ACTH: A hormone produced by the pituitary gland to stimulate the adrenal glands. Excessive levels may lead to fertility problems. Adhesion: Scar tissue occurring in the abdominal cavity, fallopian tubes, or inside the uterus. Adhesions can interfere with transport of the egg and implantation of the embryo in the uterus. Adrenal Androgens: Male hormones produced by the adrenal gland which, when found in excess, may lead to fertility problems in both men and women. Excess androgens in the woman may lead to the formation of male secondary sex characteristics and the suppression of LH and FSH production by the pituitary gland. Elevated levels of androgens may be found in women with polycystic ovaries, or with a tumor in the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, or ovary. May also be associated with excess prolactin levels. Alpha-fetoprotein Test (AFP): A blood test performed to evaluate the development of the fetus and to look for fetal abnormalities. AID (Artificial Insemination Donor): See Artificial Insemination Donor. AIH (Artificial Insemination Homologous): See Artificial Insemination Homologous. Amenorrhea: The cessation of the menstrual periods for six months or more at a time. Amenorrhea, Primary: A term used to refer to a woman who has never menstruated. Amenorrhea, Secondary: A term describing a woman who has menstruated at one time, but who has not had a period for six months or more. Androgens Male sex hormones. Andrologist: A physician-scientist who performs laboratory evaluations of male fertility. May hold a Ph.D. degree instead of an M.D. Usually affiliated with a fertility treatment center working on in vitro fertilization. Anorexia Nervosa: A life-threatening eating disorder; self-imposed starvation. Severe weight loss and malnutrition from this disorder cause anovulation. Anovulation: The failure to ovulate; ovulatory failure. Antibodies: Chemicals made by the body to fight or attack foreign substances entering the body. Normally they prevent infection; however, when they attack the sperm or fetus, they cause infertility. Sperm antibodies may be made by either the man or the woman. Antisperm Antibodies: Antibodies are produced by the immune system to fight off foreign substances,like bacteria. Antisperm antibodies attach themselves to sperm and inhibit movement and their ability to fertilize. Artificial Insemination (AI): The depositing of sperm in the vagina near the cervix or directly into the uterus, with the use of a syringe instead of by coitus. This technique is used to overcome sexual performance problems, to circumvent sperm-mucus interaction problems, to maximize the potential for poor semen, and for using donor sperm. See also Artificial Insemination Donor; Artificial Insemination Homologous. Artificial Insemination Donor (AID): Artificial insemination with donor sperm. A fresh donor semen specimen or a thawed frozen specimen is injected next to the woman's cervix. Artificial Insemination Homologous (AIH): Artificial insemination with the husband's sperm. The sperm may be washed and injected directly into the wife's uterus (IAIH). Often used with poor semen or to overcome sperm-mucus problems. Artificial Spermatocoele: An artificial, surgically created pouch used to collect sperm from men with irreversible tubal blockage. Asherman's Syndrome: A condition where the uterine walls adhere to one another. Usually caused by uterine inflammation. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Several procedures employed to bring about conception without sexualintercourse, including IUI, GIFT and ZIFT. Asthenozoospermia: Low sperm motility. Azozoospermia: Semen containing no sperm, either because the testicles cannot make sperm or because of blockage in the reproductive tract. Bacterial Vaginosis Infection: A vaginal infection that causes a burning sensation and a gray, malodorous discharge. May interfere with fertility. Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Your body temperature when taken at its lowest point, usually in the morning before getting out of bed. Charting BBT is used to predict ovulation. Basal Body Temperature, Biphasic: A basal body temperature pattern consistent with ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. This hormone will elevate the basal body temperature about one-half degree during the latter half of the menstrual cycle. Basal Body Temperature, Monophasic: An anovulatory basal body temperature pattern where the temperature remains relatively constant throughout the cycle. Beta hCG Test: A blood test used to detect very early pregnancies and to evaluate embryonic development. Bicornuate Uterus: A congenital malformation of the uterus where the upper portion (horn) is duplicated. Bromocriptine (Parlodel): An oral medication used to reduce prolactin levels and reduce the size of a pituitary tumor when present. This medication often causes dizziness and upset stomach and must be started with a small dose which is gradually increased as needed. This medication is equally effective when the tablet is placed into the vagina. Bulimia: An eating disorder characterized by voracious eating followed by forced vomiting. The resulting weight loss and malnutrition may cause anovulation. Buserelin: A long-acting GnRH available in Europe as a nasal spray and used to create the pseudomenopause desirable for reducing the size and number of endometriotic lesions. It can also be used to treat fibroid tumors, PMS, hirsutism, ovulation induction and for in vitro fertilization. Candidiasis (Yeast): An infection that may be uncomfortable and itchy and may impair fertility. Capacitation: A process that sperm undergo as they travel through the woman's reproductive tract. Capacitation enables the sperm to penetrate the egg. Cauterize: To burn tissue with electrical current (electrocautery) or with a laser. Used in surgical procedures to remove unwanted tissue such as adhesions and endometrial implants. Also used to control bleeding. Cervical Mucus: A viscous fluid plugging the opening of the cervix. Most of the time this thick mucus plug prevents sperm and bacteria from entering the womb. However, at midcycle, under the influence of estrogen, the mucus becomes thin, watery, and stringy to allow sperm to pass into the womb. See also Cervix. Cervical Smear: A sample of the cervical mucus examined microscopically to assess the presence of estrogen (ferning) and white blood cells, indicating possible infection. Cervical Stenosis: A blockage of the cervical canal from a congenital defect or from complications of surgical procedures. See also Cervix. Cervix: The opening between the uterus and the vagina. The cervical mucusplugs the cervical canal and normally prevents foreign materials from entering the reproductive tract. The cervix remains closed during pregnancy and dilates during labor and delivery to allow the baby to be born. Cervix, Incompetent: A weakened cervix, which opens up prematurely during pregnancy and can cause the loss of the fetus. A CERVICAL CERCLAG E is a procedure in which a stitch or two is put around the cervix to prevent its opening until removed when the pregnancy is to term. Chocolate Cyst: A cyst in the ovary that is filled with old blood; endometrioma. Occurring when endometriosis invades an ovary, it causes the ovary to swell. Frequently, patients with large endometriomas do not have any symptoms. If the cyst ruptures or the ovary containing the cyst twists, emergency surgery may be necessary. Usually treatment can be carried out through the laparoscope. Chromosome: The structures in the cell that carry the genetic material (genes); the genetic messengers of inheritance. The human has forty-six chromosomes, twenty-three coming from the egg and twenty-three coming from the sperm. Cilia: Tiny hairlike projections lining the inside surface of the fallopian tubes. The waving action of these "hairs" sweeps the egg toward the uterus. Clitoris: The small erectile sex organ of the female which contains large numbers of sensory nerves; the female counterpart of the penis. CLOMIPHENE CITRATE (Clomid, Serophene) A fertility drug that stimulates ovulation through the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland." Coitus: Intercourse; the sexual union between a man and a woman. Conception: See Fertilization. Conceptus: The early products of conception; the embryo and placenta. Condom Therapy: Therapy prescribed to reduce the number of sperm antibodies in the woman by using a condom during intercourse for six months or more and by the woman refraining from all skin contact with the husband's sperm. The woman's antibody level may fall to levels that will not adversely affect the sperm. Cone Biopsy: A surgical procedure used to remove precancerous cells from the cervix. The procedure may damage the cervix and thus disrupt normal mucus production or cause an incompetent cervix, which may open prematurely during pregnancy. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: A congenital condition characterized by elevated androgens which suppress the pituitary gland and interfere with spermatogenesis or ovulation. Women may have ambiguous genitalia from the excess production of male hormone. Contraception: The use of a method, medication, or device that will prevent preg-nancy, such as condom, oral contraceptives, diaphragms, natural family planning, IUDs, spermicides, and sponges. Contraceptive, Oral: A medication that prevents ovulation and pregnancy. Up to 3 percent of women taking the Pill will become anovulatory when they stop taking it. The regulatory effects of the Pill can also disguise symptoms of fertility problems-- for example, an irregular cycle or endometriosis. May be used to control the symptoms and development of endometriosis. Corpus Luteum: The yellow-pigmented glandular structure that forms from the ovarian follicle following ovulation. The gland produces progesterone, which is responsible for preparing and supporting the uterine lining for implantation. Progesterone also causes the half-degree basal temperature elevation noted at midcycle during an ovulatory cycle. If the corpus luteum functions poorly, the uterine lining may not support a pregnancy. If the egg is fertilized, a corpus luteum of pregnancy forms to maintain the endometrial bed and support the implanted embryo. Picture of a corpus luteum.A deficiency in the amount of progesterone produced (or the length of time it is produced) by the corpus luteum can mean the endometrium is unable to sustain a pregnancy. This is called Luteal Phase Defect (LPD) Cumulus Oophorus: The protective layer of cells surrounding the egg. Cushing's Syndrome: A condition characterized by an overproduction of adrenal gland secretions. The person will suffer from high blood pressure and water retention as well as a number of other symptoms. A concurrent elevation of adrenal androgens will suppress pituitary output of LH and FSH and result in low sperm production or ovulatory failure. A woman may also develop male secondary sex characteristics, including abnormal hair growth. Cushing's Disease is another condition in which these same symptoms occur, but as the result of a pituitary tumor. D&C (Dilation and Curettage): A procedure used to dilate the cervical canal and scrape out the lining and contents of the uterus. The procedure can be used to diagnose or treat the cause of abnormal bleeding and to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Danazol (danocrine): A medication used to treat endometriosis. Suppresses LH and FSH production by the pituitary and causes a state of amenorrhea during which the endometrial implants waste away. Many women experience oily skin, acne, weight gain, abnormal hair growth, deepening of the voice and muscle cramps with this medication. Delayed Ejaculation: A condition in which the man fakes orgasm and does not actually ejaculate when having sex. Delayed Puberty: A condition in which the youngster fails to complete puberty anddevelop secondary sex characteristics by sixteen years of age. Puberty may be stimulated with hormonal replacement therapy. Some will outgrow the condition without treatment. DES (Diethylstilbestrol): A medication prescribed in the 1950s and 1960s to women to prevent miscarriage. Male and female fetuses exposed in utero to this drug devel-oped numerous deformities including blockage of the vas deferens, uterine abnor-malities, cervical deformities, miscarriages, and unexplained infertility. DES is no longer prescribed for this indication. DHEAS: See Adrenal Androgens. Doxycycline: A tetracycline derivative; an antibiotic that inhibits many of the microorganisms infecting the reproductive tract. Often used for treating ureaplasma infections. Many physicians find routine treatment with this antibiotic more cost-effective than performing multiple cultures on both the husband and wife looking for infection. Dysmenorrhea: Painful menstruation. This may be a sign of endometriosis. Dyspareunia: Painful coitus for either the man or the woman. Ectopic Pregnancy A pregnancy outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. Such a pregnancy can rarely be sustained, and often leads to decreased or complete loss of function in the affected tube. Methotrexate is now used to dissolve the pregnancy without causing major damage to the tube. Egg Retrieval: A procedure used to obtain eggs from ovarian follicles for use in in vitro fertilization. The procedure may be performed during laparoscopy or by using a long needle and ultrasound to locate the follicle in the ovary. Ejaculate: The semen and sperm expelled during ejaculation. Ejaculation: The physiological process by which the semen is propelled from the testicles, through the reproductive tract, and out the opening of the penis. Embryo: The early products of conception; the undifferentiated beginnings of a baby; the conceptus. Embryo Transfer Placing an egg fertilized outside the womb into a woman's uterus or fallopian tube. Empty Sella Syndrome: A condition that occurs when spinal fluid leaks into the bony chamber (fossa) housing the pituitary gland. The fluid pressure compresses the pituitary gland and may adversely affect its ability to secrete LH and FSH and may elevate prolactin levels. Endometrial Biopsy A test to check for Luteal Phase Defect. A procedure during which a sample of the uterine lining is collected for microscopic analysis. The biopsy results will confirm ovulation and the proper preparation of the endometrium by estrogen and progesterone stimulation Endometriosis A condition where endometrial tissue is located outside the womb. The tissue may attach itself to the reproductive organs or to other organs in the abdominal cavity. Each month the endometrial tissue inbreeds with the onset of menses. The resultant irritation causes adhesions in the abdominal cavity and in the fallopian tubes. Endometriosis may also interfere with ovulation and with the implantation of the embryo. Endometrium: The lining of the uterus which grows and sheds in response to estrogen and progesterone stimulation; the bed of tissue designed to nourish the implanted embryo. Endorphins: Natural narcotics manufactured in the brain to reduce sensitivity to pain and stress. May contribute to stress-related fertility problems. Epididymis: A coiled, tubular organ attached to and lying on the testicle. Within this organ the developing sperm complete their maturation and develop their powerful swimming capabilities. The matured sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens. Erection: The process during which the erectile tissue of the penis becomes engorged with blood, causing the penis to swell and become rigid. Estradiol The female hormone produced in the ovary. Responsible for formation of the female secondary sex characteristics such as large breasts; supports the growth of the follicle and the development of the uterine lining. At midcycle the peak estrogen level triggers the release of 4he LH spike from the pituitary gland. The LH spike is necessary for the release of the ovum from the follicle. Fat cells in both obese men and women can also manufacture estrogen from androgens and interfere with fertility. Estrogen Female sex hormone. Expectant Therapy (Endometriosis): A wait-and-see approach used after laparoscopic surgery for mild endometriosis. Fallopian Tubes Ducts through which eggs travel to the uterus once released from the follicle. Sperm normally meet the egg in the fallopian tube, the site at which fertilization usually occurs. Female Kallman's Syndrome: A condition characterized by infantile sexual develop-ment and an inability to smell. Since the pituitary cannot produce LH and FSH, the woman must take hormone supplements to achieve puberty, to maintain secondary sex characteristics, and to achieve fertility. Ferning: A pattern characteristic of dried cervical mucus viewed on a slide. When the fern pattern appears, the mucus has been thinned and prepared by estrogen for the passage of sperm. If it does not fern, the mucus will be hostile to the passage of the sperm. Fertile Eunuch: A rare disorder characterized by an LH deficiency leading to low testosterone levels and poor sperm production. Male secondary sex characteristics will be incomplete and sex drive will be low. Fertility Specialist: A physician specializing in the practice of fertility. The American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology certifies a subspecialty for OB-GYNs who receive extra training in endocrinology (the study of hormones) and infertility. Fertility Treatment: Any method or procedure used to enhance fertility or increase the likelihood of pregnancy, such as ovulation induction treatment, varicocoele repair, and microsurgery to repair damaged fallopian tubes. The goal of fertility treatment is to help couples have a child. Fertility Workup: The initial medical examinations and tests performed to diagnose or narrow down the cause of fertility problems. Fertilization: The combining of the genetic material carried by sperm and egg to create an embryo. Normally occurs inside the fallopian tube (in vivo) but may also occur in a petri dish (in vitro). See also In Vitro Fertilization. Fetus: A term used to refer to a baby during the period of gestation between eight weeks and term. Fibroid (Myoma or Leiomyoma) A benign tumor of the uterine muscle and connective tissue. Fimbria The opening of the fallopian tube near the ovary. When stimulated by the follicular fluid released during ovulation, the fingerlike ends grasp the ovary and coax the egg into the tube. A normal tube and ovary as seen at laparoscopy. Follicles Fluid-filled sacs in the ovary which contain the eggs released at ovulation. Each month an egg develops inside the ovary in a fluid filled pocket called a follicle. This follicle is one inch in size and is about ready to ovulate. Follicular Fluid: The fluid inside the follicle that cushions and nourishes the ovum. When released during ovulation, the fluid stimulates the fimbria to grasp the ovary and coax the egg into the fallopian tube. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) A pituitary hormone that stimulates spermatogenesis and follicular development. In the man FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells in the testicles and supports sperm production. In the woman FSH stimulates the growth of the ovarian follicle. Elevated FSH levels are indicative of gonadal failure in both men and woman. Follicular Phase The pre-ovulatory portion of a woman's cycle during which a follicle grows and high levels of estrogen cause the lining of the uterus to proliferate. Normally takes between 12 and 14 days. Galactorrhea: A clear or milky discharge from the breasts associated with elevated prolactin. Gamete A reproductive cell:Sperm in men, the egg in women. Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) A technique that may be used in lieu of in vitro fertilization for women with patent tubes. After egg retrieval the eggs are mixed with the husband's sperm and then injected through the fimbria into the woman's fallopian tubes for in vivo fertilization. Genitals: The external sex organs, as the labia and clitoris in the woman and the penis and testicles in the man. Also called genitalia. Germ Cell: In the male the testicular cell that divides to produce the immature sperm cells; in the woman the ovarian cell that divides to form the egg (ovum). The male germ cell remains intact throughout the man's reproductive life; the woman uses up her germ cells at the rate of about one thousand per menstrual cycle, although usually only one egg matures each cycle. Germ Cell Aplasia (Sertoli Cell Only): An inherited condition in which the testicles have no germ cells. Since men with this condition have normal Leydig cells, they will develop secondary sex characteristics. May also be caused by large and/or prolonged exposure to toxins or radiation. Gonadotropins Hormones which control reproductive function: Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Lutenizing Hormone. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GNRH) A substance secreted by the hypothalamus every ninety minutes or so. This hormone enables the pituitary to secrete LH and FSH, which stimulate the gonads. See also FSH; LH. Gonad: The gland that makes reproductive cells and "sex" hormones, as the testicles, which make sperm and testosterone, and the ovaries, which make eggs (ova) and estrogen. Gonorrhea: An infection that is usually asymptomatic, but that may cause a bad-smelling yellowish vaginal discharge and red and swollen vaginal walls. If it reaches the fallopian tubes, the woman will suffer pain, develop a high fever, and possibly develop tubal blockage. The responsible organism may also impair sperm and prevent pregnancy. In the man gonorrhea seldom leads to damage, but it may cause a painful infection. Hamster Test A test of the ability of sperm to penetrate a hamster egg which has been stripped of the Zona Pellucida (outer membrane). Also called SPERM PENETRATION ASSAY (SPA). Hirsutism: The overabundance of body hair, such as a mustache or pubic hair growing upward toward the navel, found in women with excess androgens. Host Uterus Also called a "surrogate gestational mother." A couple's embryo is transferred to another woman who carries the pregnancy to term and returns the baby to the genetic parents immediately after birth. Hostile Mucus Cervical mucus that impedes the natural progress of sperm through the cervical canal. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) The hormone produced in early pregnancy which keeps the corpus luteum producing progesterone. Also used via injection to trigger ovulation after some fertility treatments, and used in men to stimulate testosterone production. Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (HMG - PERGONAL, HUMEGON) A combination of hormones FSH and LH, which is extracted from the urine of post-menopausal women. Used to induce ovulation in several fertility treatments. Humegon (HMG) The lutenizing and follicle-stimulating hormones recovered from the urine of post-menopausal women. Used to stimulate multiple ovulation in some fertility treatments. Hyperprolactinemia A condition in which the pituitary gland secretes too much prolactin. Prolactin can suppress LH and FSH production, reduce sex drive in the man, and directly suppress ovarian function in the woman. Hyperstimulation (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome, OHSS) A potentially life-threatening side effect of Pergonal ovulation induction treatment. Arises when too many follicles develop and hCG is given to release the eggs. May be prevented by withholding the hCG injection when ultrasound monitoring indicates that too many follicles have matured. Hyperthyroidism: Overproduction of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. The resulting increased metabolism "burns up" estrogen too rapidly and interferes with ovulation. Hypoestrogenic: Having lower than normal levels of estrogen. Hypogonadotropic Hypopituitarism: A spectrum of diseases resulting in low pituitary gland output of LH and FSH. Men with this disorder have low sperm counts and may lose their virility; women do not ovulate and may lose their secondary sex characteristics . Hypospermatogenesis: Low sperm production. Hypothalamus: A part of the brain, the hormonal regulation center, located adjacent to and above the pituitary gland. In both the man and the woman this tissue secretes GnRH every ninety minutes or so. The pulsatile GnRH enables the pituitary gland to secrete LH and FSH, which stimulate the gonads. See also FSH; LH; Ovary; Pituitary Gland; Testicle. Hypothyroidism: A condition in which the thyroid gland produces an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone. The resulting lowered metabolism interferes with the normal breakdown of "old" hormones and causes lethargy. Men will suffer from a lower sex drive and elevated prolactin (see Hyperprolactinemia), and women will suffer from elevated prolactin and estrogen, both of which will interfere with fertility. Hysterectomy: The surgical removal of the uterus. May also include the removal of other reproductive structures, such as the fallopian tubes and ovaries. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) An x-ray of the pelvic organs in which a radio-opaque dye is injected through the cervix into the uterus and fallopian tubes. This test checks for malformations of the uterus and blockage of the fallipian tubes. Hysteroscopy A procedure in which the doctor checks for uterine abnormalities by inserting a fiber-optic device. Minor surgical repairs can be executed during the procedure. IAIH (Intrauterine Artificial Insemination Homologous): Artificial insemination where the husband's sperm is injected directly into the uterus to avoid cervical mucus problems or to maximize the potential for poor semen. See also Artificial Insemination. ICSI See also Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection Immature Sperm (Germinal Cell): A sperm that has not matured and gained the ability to swim. In the presence of illness or infection such sperm may appear in the semen in large numbers.Imperforate Hymen: A condition where the membrane (hymen) covering the vagina fails to open and allow menstrual flow. Implantation (Embryo): The embedding of the embryo into tissue so it can establish contact with the mother's blood supply for nourishment. Implantation usually occurs in the lining of the uterus; however, in an ectopic pregnancy it may occur elsewhere in the body. Impotence: The inability of the man to have an erection and to ejaculate. Incompetent Cervix: See Cervix, Incompetent Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI): A micromanipulation procedure where a single sperm is injected into the egg to enable fertilization with very low sperm counts or with non-motile sperm. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Literally means "in glass." Fertilization takes place outside the body in a small glass dish. Infertility: The inability to conceive after a year of unprotected intercourse or the inability to carry a pregnancy to term. Inhibin: A male feedback hormone made in the testicles to regulate FSH production by the pituitary gland. Inhibin-F (Folliculostatin): A female feedback hormone made in the ovary to regulate FSH production by the pituitary gland. IUD (Intrauterine Device): A device placed into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. IUD insertion has been associated with an increased incidence of infection, which may damage the fallopian tubes, and is therefore not recommended for women with multiple sexual partners. Kallman's Syndrome: A congenital hypothalamus dysfunction which has multiple symptoms including the failure to complete puberty. Karyotyping: A test performed to analyze chromosomes for the presence of genetic defects. Klinefelter's Syndrome: A genetic abnormality characterized by having one Y (male) and two X (female) chromosomes. May cause a fertility problem. Laparoscope: A small telescope that can be inserted into a hole in the abdominal wall for viewing the internal organs; the instrument used to perform a laparoscopy. Used to diagnose and treat a number of fertility problems including endometriosis, abdominal adhesions, and polycystic ovaries. Also used in egg retrieval for in vitro fertilization. Laparoscopy Examination of the pelvic region by using a small telescope called a laparoscope. Laparotomy: Major abdominal surgery where reproductive organ abnormalities can be corrected and fertility restored, such as tubal repairs and the removal of adhesions. Leiomyomata: See Fibroid. Leydig Cell: The testicular cell that produces the male hormone testosterone. The Leydig cell is stimulated by LH from the pituitary gland. Luteal Phase Post-ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle. The corpus luteum produces progesterone, which cause the uterine lining to thicken to support the implantation and growth of the embryo. Luteal Phase Defect (or deficiency) (LPD) A condition that occurs when the uterine lining does not develop adequately because of inadequate progesterone stimulation; or because of the inability of the uterine lining to respond to progesterone stimulation. LPD may prevent embryonic implantation or cause an early abortion. Luteinized Unruptured Follicle (LUF) Syndrome A condition in which the follicle develops and changes into the corpus luteum without releasing the egg. Luteinizing Hormone (LH) A pituitary hormone that stimulates the gonads. In the man LH is necessary for spermatogenesis (Sertoli cell function) and for the production of testosterone (Leydig cell function). In the woman LH is necessary for the production of estrogen. When estrogen reaches a critical peak, the pituitary releases a surge of LH (the LH spike), which releases the egg from the follicle. Luteinizing Hormone Surge (LH SURGE) The release of luteinizing hormone (LH) that causes release of a mature egg from the follicle. Ovulation test kits detect the sudden increase of LH, signaling that ovulation is about to occur (usually within 24-36 hours). Masturbation: A technique used to collect semen for analysis and for artificial insemination; manual stimulation of the penis leading to ejaculation. Maturation Arrest: A testicular condition in which at one stage of sperm production all sperm development halts throughout all testicular tubules. May result in oligospermia or azozoospermia. Meiosis: The cell division, peculiar to reproductive cells, which allows genetic material to divide in half. Each new cell will contain twenty-three chromosomes. The spermatids (immature sperm) and ova (eggs) each contain twenty-three chromo-somes, so when they combine (fertilize), the baby will have a normal complement of forty-six. Menorrhagia: Heavy or prolonged menstrual flow. Menstruation: The cyclical shedding of the uterine lining in response to stimulation from estrogen and progesterone. Metrodin (Pure FSH) An injectable form of Follicle Stimulating Hormone used to stimulate ovulation. Metrorrhagia: Menstrual spotting during the middle of the cycle. Miscarriage: Spontaneous loss of an embryo or fetus from the womb. Mitosis: The division of a cell into two identical cells in which all forty-six human chromosomes are duplicated; the first division of the germ cell. Mittleschmerz: The discomfort felt on one side of the lower abdomen at the time of ovulation. Mycoplasma: See Ureaplasma. Myomectomy: Surgery performed to remove fibroid tumors. Oligomenorrhea Infrequent menstrual periods. Oligospermia, Oligozoospermia A sperm count below 20 million; a low sperm count; a sperm count low enough to cause a fertility problem. Orgasm: The psychological and physical thrill that accompanies sexual climax. For the man orgasm causes ejaculation. Ovarian Cyst: A fluid-filled sac inside the ovary. An ovarian cyst may be found in conjunction with ovulation disorders, tumors of the ovary, and endometriosis. See also Chocolate Cyst. Ovarian Failure: The failure of the ovary to respond to FSH stimulation from the pituitary because of damage to or malformation of the ovary. Diagnosed by elevated FSH in the blood. Ovulation: The release of the egg (ovum) from the ovarian follicle. Ovulation Induction: Medical treatment performed to initiate ovulation. See also Clomiphene Citrate; Pergonal. Ovulatory Failure (Anovulation): The failure to ovulate. Ovum: The egg; the reproductive cell from the ovary; the female gamete; the sex cell that contains the woman's genetic information. Panbypopituitarism: Complete pituitary gland failure. Parlodel: See Bromocriptine. Patent: The condition of being open, as with tubes that form part of the reproductive organs. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) An infection of the pelvic organs that causes severe illness, high fever, and extreme pain. PID may lead to tubal blockage and pelvic adhesions. Penile Implant: A device surgically inserted into the penis to provide rigidity for intercourse. Used to treat impotence. Penis: The male organ that becomes enlarged and erect for the purpose of depositing semen in the woman's vagina. Pergonal (HMG) A medication used to replace the pituitary hormones, LH and FSH. May be used to induce ovulation in women who do not respond to clomiphene citrate. Most frequently used with women who do not normally produce estrogen because of a pituitary gland or hypothalamic malfunc-tion. May also be used with men to stimulate sperm production. PID See also Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Pituitary Gland: The master gland; the gland that is stimulated by the hypothalamus and controls all hormonal functions. Located at the base of the brain just below the hypothalamus, this gland controls many major hormonal factories throughout the body including the gonads, the adrenal glands, and the thyroid gland. Placenta: The embryonic tissue that invades the uterine wall and provides a mecha-nism for exchanging the baby's waste products for the mother's nutrients and oxygen. The baby is connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord. Polar Body: The discarded genetic material resulting from female germ cell division. See also Meiosis. Polycystic Ovaries (PCO or "Stein-Leventhal Syndrome") A condition found in women who don't ovulate, characterized by excessive production of androgens (male sex hormones) and the presence of cysts in the ovaries. Though PCO can be without symptoms, some include excessive weight gain, acne and excessive hair growth. Post Coital Test (PCT) A microscopic examination of the cervical mucus best performed twelve or more hours after intercourse to determine compatibility between the woman's mucus and the man's semen; a test used to detect sperm-mucus interaction problems, the presence of sperm antibodies, and the quality of the cervical mucus. Posttesticular System: The ducts that store and deliver the sperm to the opening of the penis; also includes the glands that produce seminal fluids. Premature Ejaculation: A condition in which the man becomes so sexually excited that most of the time he ejaculates prior to penetrating the woman's vagina. Premature Ovarian Failure: A condition where the ovary runs out of follicles before the normal age associated with menopause. Pretesticular System: The male hormonal system responsible for stimulating sperm production and the development of male secondary sex characteristics. Progesterone The hormone produced by the corpus luteum during the second half of a woman's cycle. It thickens the lining of the uterus to prepare it to accept implantation of a fertilized egg. Progesterone Withdrawal: A diagnostic procedure used to analyze menstrual irregularity and amenorrhea; uterine "bleeding" that occurs within two weeks after taking progesterone; a procedure used to demonstrate the presence or absence of estrogen and to demonstrate the ability of the uterus and reproductive tract to "bleed." Prior to ovulation induction therapy, progesterone withdrawal may be used to induce a menstrual period. Prolactin The hormone that stimulates the production of milk in breastfeeding women. Excessive prolactin levels when not breastfeeding may result in infertility. Prostaglandin: A hormone secreted by the uterine lining. It is hypothesized that prostaglandins secreted by active, young endometrial implants may interfere with the reproductive organs by causing muscular contractions or spasms. Prostate Gland: A gland in the male reproductive system that produces a portion of thesemen including a chemical that liquefies the coagulated semen twenty minutes togo one hour after entering the vagina. Puberty: The time of life when the body begins making adult levels of sex hormones - (estrogen or testosterone) and the youngster takes on adult body characteristics: developing breasts, growing a beard, pubic hair, and auxiliary hair; attaining sexual maturity. Refractory Period: A period of time after orgasm during which a man or woman cannot have another; a recovery period. Resistant Ovary: An ovary that cannot respond to the follicle-stimulating message sent by FSH. Primitive germ cells will be present in the ovary; however, they will not respond to FSH stimulation. Retrograde Ejaculation: A male fertility problem that allows the sperm to travel into the bladder instead of out the opening of the penis due to a failure in the sphincter muscle at the base of the bladder. Salpingectomy: Surgical removal of the fallopian tube. Salpingolysis: Surgery performed to remove adhesions that restrict the movement and function of reproductive organs. Salpingostomy/Fimbrioplasty: Surgical repair made to the fallopian tubes; a procedure used to open the fimbria. Scrotum: The bag of skin and thin muscle surrounding the man's testicles. Secondary Infertility The inability of a couple which has successfully achieved pregnancy to achieve another. This strict medical definition includes couples for whom the pregnancy did not go to term. The common vernacular, however, refers to a couple which has one biological child but is unable to conceive another. Secondary Sex Characteristics: The physical qualities that distinguish man and woman, such as beard, large breasts, and deep voice. Formed under the stimulation of the sex hormones (testosterone or estrogen), these characteristics also identify those people who have gone through puberty (sexual maturity). Semen: The fluid portion of the ejaculate consisting of secretions from the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and several other glands in the male reproductive tract. The semen provides nourishment and protection for the sperm and a medium in which the sperm can travel to the woman's vagina. Semen may also refer to the entire ejaculate, including the sperm. Semen Analysis: A laboratory test used to assess semen quality: sperm quantity, concentration, morphology (form), and motility. In addition, it measures semen (fluid) volume and whether or not white blood cells are present, indicating an infection. Semen Viscosity: The liquid flow or consistency of the semen. Seminal Vesicles: Glands in the male reproductive system which produce much of the semen volume, including fructose (sugar) for nourishing the sperm and a chemical that causes the semen to coagulate on entering the vagina. Seminiferous Tubes: The testicular tubules in which the sperm mature and move toward the epididymis. Septate uterus A uterus divided into right and left halves by a wall of tissue (septum). Women with a septate uterus have an increased chance of early pregnancy loss. Serophene Brand name for clomiphene citrate. (See CLOMID.) Sertoli (Nurse) Cell: A testicular cell responsible for nurturing the spermatids (imma-ture sperm). Secretes inhibin, a feedback hormone, which regulates FSH produc-tion by the pituitary gland. When stimulated by FSH, the Sertoli cell initiates spermatogenesis . Sheehan's Syndrome: A condition caused by profuse hemorrhage at the time of delivery. The severe blood loss shocks the pituitary gland, which dies and becomes nonfunctional. Short Luted Phase: A condition in which the corpus luteum deteriorates prematurely, causing the menstrual period to begin approximately ten days (instead of fourteen) after ovulation. Frequently found with women undergoing ovulation induction treatment. Sonogram (Ultrasound) Use of high-frequency sound waves for creating an image of internal body parts. Used to detect and count follicle growth (and disappearance) in many fertility treatments. Also used to detect and monitor pregnancy. Sperm: The microscopic cell that carries the male's genetic information to the female's egg; the male reproductive cell; the male gamete. Sperm Agglutination: Sperm clumping caused by antibody reactions or by infection. Sperm Antibodies: Antibodies that attack and maim sperm. May be formed by either the man against his own sperm or by the woman against her husband's sperm. Sperm Bank A place where sperm are kept frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use in artificial insemination. Sperm Count The number of sperm in ejaculate. Also called sperm concentration and given as the number of sperm per milliliter. Sperm Maturation: A process during which the sperm grow and gain their ability to swim. Sperm take about ninety days to reach maturity. Sperm Morphology A semen analysis factor that indicates the number or percentage of sperm in the sample that appear to have been formed normally. Abnormal morphology includes sperm with kinked, doubled, or coiled tails. Sperm Motility The ability of sperm to swim. Poor motility means the sperm have a difficult time swimming toward their goal---the egg. Sperm Penetration: The ability of the sperm to penetrate the egg so it can deposit the genetic material during fertilization. Spermatogenesis: Sperm production in the testicles. Spinnbarkeit: The stretchability of cervical mucus; the stringy quality that occurs at midcycle under the influence of estrogen. See also Postcoital Test. Split Ejaculate: A method used to concentrate the sperm for insemination; separating the semen into two portions: the first portion of the ejaculate, which is rich in sperm, and the second portion, which contains mostly seminal fluid. Spontaneous Abortion: See Abortion, Spontaneous. Stein-Leventhal Disease: Another name for polycystic ovaries. Sterility: An irreversible condition that prevents conception. Stillbirth: The death of a fetus between the twentieth week of gestation and birth. Superovulation Stimulation of multiple ovulation with fertility drugs; also known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Surrogate Mother: A woman who is artificially inseminated and carries to term a baby which will be raised by its genetic father and his partner. Testicular Biopsy: A minor surgical procedure used to take a small sample of testicular tissue for microscopic examination; a test used to diagnose male fertility problems when no other means is available (this is because the biopsy procedure itself may cause testicular damage). Testicular Enzyme Defect: A congenital enzyme defect that prevents the testes from responding to hormonal stimulation. Will result in oligospermia or azozoospermia. Testicular Failure, Primary: A congenital, developmental, or genetic error resulting in a testicular malformation that prevents sperm production. Testicular Failure, Secondary: Acquired testicular damage_for example, from drugs, prolonged exposure to toxic substances, or a varicocoele. Testicular Feminization: An enzymatic defect that prevents a man from responding to the male hormone testosterone. The man will look like a woman, but karyotyping will reveal a normal XY male chromosome pattern, and testosterone levels will be in the normal male range. Testicular Function: The ability of the testicles to produce sperm and testosterone. Testicular Stress Pattern: A semen analysis result showing depressed sperm produc-tion, poor sperm motility, and poor sperm morphology. The pattern is consistent with secondary testicular failure or illness. Testosterone: The male hormone responsible for the formation of secondary sex characteristics and for supporting the sex drive. Testosterone is also necessary for spermatogenesis. Thyroid Gland The endocrine gland in the front of the neck that produces thyroid hormones to regulate the body's metabolism. Torsion: The twisting of the testis inside the scrotum. Besides causing extreme pain and swelling, the rotation twists off the blood supply and causes severe damage to the testicle. Torsion of the ovary may also occur in a woman suffering from hyperstimulation, a complication of ovulation induction treatment. Trichomonas: An infection that may produce a greenish, bad-smelling vaginal discharge. Tubocornual Anastomosis: Surgery performed to remove a blocked portion of the fallopian tube and to reconnect the tube to the uterus. Tubouterine implantation may also be performed to remove fallopian tube blockage near the uterus and reimplant the tube in the uterus. Tubotubal Anastomosis: Surgery performed to remove a diseased portion of the fallopian tube and reconnect the two ends; sterilization reversal. Turner's Syndrome: The most common genetic defect contributing to female fertility problems. The ovaries fail to form and appear as slender threads of atrophic ovarian tissue, referred to as streak ovaries. Karyotyping will reveal that this woman has only one female (X) chromosome instead of two. Ultrasound: A test used instead of X rays to visualize the reproductive organs; for example, to monitor follicular development and to examine the tubes and uterus. The instrument works by bouncing sound waves off the organs. A picture displayed on a TV screen shows the internal organs. Umbilical Cord: Two arteries and one vein encased in a gelatinous tube leading from the baby to the placenta. Used to exchange nutrients and oxygen from the mother for waste products from the baby. Undescended Testicles (Cryptorchidism): The failure of the testicles to descend from the abdominal cavity into the scrotum by one year of age. If not repaired by age six, may result in permanent fertility loss. Unicornuate Uterus An abnormality in which the uterus is "one sided" and smaller than usual. Ureaplasma (Mycoplasma): An infection that may cause the formation of sperm antibodies and an inflammation of the uterine lining, either of which may interfere with implantation of the embryo. Urethra: The tube that allows urine to pass between the bladder and the outside of the body. In the man this tube also carries semen from the area of the prostate to the outside. Urologist: A physician specializing in the genitourinary tract. Uterus: The hollow, muscular organ that houses and nourishes the fetus during pregnancy. Vagina: The canal leading from the cervix to the outside of the woman's body; the birth passage. Vaginitis: Yeast, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomonas infections of the vagina. Frequent va-ginitis may indicate the presence of pelvic adhesions and tubal blockage from other infections, such as chlamydia. Vaginitis may interfere with sperm penetration of the cervical mucus, and the symptoms may even interfere with the ability and desire to have intercourse. Varicocoele: A dilation of the veins that carry blood out of the scrotum. The resulting swollen vessels surrounding the testicles create a pool of stagnant blood, which elevates the scrotal temperature. A major cause of male infertility. Vas Deferens: One of the tubes through which the sperm move from the testicles (epididymis) toward the seminal vesicles and prostate gland. These tubes are severed during a vasectomy performed for birth control. Vasectomy: The accidental or elective surgical separation of the vasa deferential a procedure used for birth control. Venereal Disease: Any infection that can be sexually transmitted, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, ureaplasma, and syphilis. Many of these diseases will interfere with fertility and some will cause severe illness. See also PID. Virility: Masculinization; having male secondary sex characteristics; being able to perform sexually. X Chromosome: The congenital, developmental, or genetic information in the cell that transmits the information necessary to make a female. All eggs contain one X chromosome, and half of all sperm carry an X chromosome. When two X chromosomes combine, the baby will be a girl. see also Y. Chromosome. Y Chromosome: The genetic material that transmits the information necessary to make a male. The Y chromosome can be found in one-half of the man's sperm cells. When an X and a Y chromosome combine, the baby will be a boy. see also X Chromosome. Zygote A fertilized egg which has not yet divided. Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT) An ART in which eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries, fertilized with the man's sperm in a lab dish, and the resulting embryos are transferred into the woman's fallopian tubes during a minor surgical procedure.

Please note that every reproductive endocrinologist (RE) has his or her own standard protocol, and the following is intended to be a basic guideline. If you are not seeing an RE and your OB/GYN does not have the facilities to conduct these routine tests, you should seriously consider switching to a doctor who does. Minimally, a doctor treating fertility patients should have the following: 1. Availability of staff and technicians seven days per week. If your doctor or clinic does not offer weekend and holiday hours, you are clearly not in the hands of someone whose priority is helping you get pregnant. 2. Transvaginal ultrasound equipment. You should not undergo clomid, metrodin or pergonal treatment unless this equipment is available for routine monitoring. Though many OBs prescribe Clomid without doing this monitoring, it is in your best interest to have periodic ultrasounds to ensure that the Clomid is indeed stimulating ovulation and that the follicles are releasing the eggs. Under no circumstances should a patient undergo metrodin or pergonal treatment without ultrasound monitoring. If you are using intra-uterine insemination (IUIs), ultrasounds are required for accurately timing insemination with ovulation. 3. An on-site, certified lab to do semen testing and prep for IUIs and post coital tests, as well as facilities to do E-2, blood HCG beta and progesterone tests. YOUR FIRST APPOINTMENT: Try to schedule your first appointment with your RE during the first week of your cycle. This will enable him/her to take baseline levels of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (lutenizing hormone). Most REs also do routine screening of both partners---AIDS, hepatitis, etc. Medical histories for both partners will be taken. Try to keep track of the length of your menstrual cycles for several months beforehand. Charting Basal Body Temps (BBTs) for several months will also give your doctor some insights---as will using home Ovulation Predictor Kits and recording the results. YOUR SECOND APPOINTMENT: This appointment should be scheduled on the day of LH surge---BEFORE ovulation. In most cases, you will be directed to use home ovulation test kits and call for an appointment on the day you detect a surge. Included in this exam will be: CERVICAL MUCUS TESTS: including a post-coital test (PCT) to see that sperm can penetrate and survive in the cervical mucus, and a bacterial screening. It is important to note that the appropriate time to do PCTs is just before ovulation when mucus is the most "fertile." PCTs at other times may give false results. ULTRASOUND EXAM(S): On the day of LH surge are used to assess the thickness of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), monitor follicle development and assess the condition of the uterus and ovaries. If the lining is thin, it indicates a hormonal problem. Fibroid tumors can often be detected via ultrasound, as well as abnormalities of the shape of the uterus and ovarian cysts. In some cases, endometriosis can also be detected. Many doctors order a second ultrasound two or three days after the first. This second ultrasound confirms that the follicle actually did release and can rule out lutenized unruptured follicle (LUF) syndrome---a situation in which eggs ripen but do not release from the follicle. HORMONE TESTS: if the blood test at your first appointment indicated a high LH to FSH ratio, an indication of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), your doctor will order an "Androgen Panel" to check levels of free testosterone and dihydroeprandrostone (DHEAS). Other tests tests that should be conducted on the day of LH surge include LH, FSH, Estradiol and Progesterone. Tests which can be done at any time (and therefore done at the second appointment) include: Prolactin, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Free T3, Free Thyroxine (T4), Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone, DHEAS and Androstenedione. The normal hormone levels for each of these during specific parts of your cycle are as follows: Lutenizing Hormone (LH) Follicular Phase (day two or three): <7mIU/ml Day of LH Surge: >15mIU/ml Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) Follicular Phase: <13mIU/ml Day of LH Surge: >15 mIU/ml Estradiol Day of LH Surge: >100 pg/ml Mid Luteal Phase (seven days after O): >60 pg/ml Progesterone Day of LH Surge: <1.5 ng/ml Mid Luteal Phase >15 ng/ml Prolactin: <25 ng/ml Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH): 0.4 to 3.8 uIU/ml Free T3: 1.4 to 4.4 pg/ml Free Thyroxine (T4): 0.8 to 2.0 ng/dl Total Testosterone: 6.0 to 89 ng/dl Free Testosterone: 0.7 to 3.6 pg/ml DHEAS: 35 TO 430 UG/DL Androstenedione: 0.7 to 3.1 ng/ml <= less than; >= greater than; mIU=milli International Units;ml=milliliter; pg=picograms; ng=nanograms; uIU=microInternational Units; dl=deciliter; ug=micrograms NOTE: These levels are those used at the Chapel Hill Fertility Center laboratory, and have been excerpted from "The Couple's Guide to Fertility" by Berger, Goldstein and Fuerst, published by Doubleday. ADDITIONAL TESTING: After the initial workup, many doctors continue with some of the following tests. HYSTEROSALPINOGRAM (HSG): This test is used to examine a woman's uterus and fallopian tubes. It is essentially an x-ray procedure in which a radio-opaque dye is injected through the cervix into the uterus and fallopian tubes. This "dye" appears white on the x-ray, and allows the radiologist and your doctor to see if there are any abnormalities, such as an unusually shaped uterus, tumors, scar tissue or blockages in the fallopian tubes. If you are trying to get pregnant in the same cycle as an HSG, make sure to schedule the test PRIOR to ovulation so that there is no danger of "flushing out" a released egg or developing embryo. Although most women report only minor cramping and short-term discomfort during this procedure, some women, especially those who DO have blockages, report intense pain. Speak to your doctor about taking a pain medication about 30 minutes prior to the actual procedure. HYSTEROSCOPY: If a uterine abnormality is suspected after the HSG, your doctor may opt for this procedure, performed with a thin telescope mounted with a fiber optic light, called a hysteroscope. The hysteroscope is inserted through the cervix into the uterus and enables the doctor to see any uterine abnormalities or growths. "Photos" are taken for future reference. This procedure is usually performed in the early half of a woman's cycle so that the build-up of the endometrium does not obscure the doctor's view. However, if the doctor is planning to do an endometrial biopsy at the same time, it is done near the end of the cycle. LAPAROSCOPY: A narrow fiber optic telescope is inserted through a woman's abdomen to look at the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries and to discern endometriosis or pelvic adhesions, and is the best diagnostic tool for evaluating the ovaries. This test us usually done two or three days before menstruation is expected, and only after an HCG beta blood test ensures the woman is not pregnant. ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY:This procedure involves a scraping a small amount of tissue from the endometrium shortly before menstruation is due---between 11 and 13 days from LH surge. It should ONLY be performed after an HCG blood test shows the woman is not pregnant. This test is used to determine if a woman has a luteal phase defect, a hormonal imbalance which prevents a woman from sustaining a pregnancy because not enough progesterone is produced.

Sample Issue Renea Alexander & Boyd Anderson, News Editors Human Uterine Amylase Amylase Related to Infertility Amylase activity in the uterine fluid of infertile women is significantly lower than that in parous women during the different menstrual cycle phases. This low enzyme activity may impair sperm capacitation and adversely affect fertility. The uterine fluid consists of glandular secretions and endometrial serum transudates. It provides shelter and nourishment to the developing blastocyst. As uterine fluid undergoes cyclic changes during the reproductive cycle, it affects the metabolism and capacitation of sperm during their transport through the female genital tract. Uterine amylase activity is influenced by endogenous ovarian hormones (Murdock and White, 1969; Skerlavay, Epstein and Sobrero, 1968). These hormones promote the fertilization ability of the sperm. Amylase activity is also negatively correlated with acid phosphatase (Singh and Singh, 1988). Elevated acid phosphatase activity in uterine fluid leads to infertility (Singh, 1991). V.N. Singh, et al., Bhagalpur University, India, conducted an investigation of 60 healthy women, ages 20-35, with no gynecological problems, (Human Uterine Amylase in Relation to Infertility," Hormonal Metabolism, 1995;27:35-36). Thirty of these women were considered parous - having had one or more children. The remaining 30 were considered infertile - having had no successful pregnancy even after five or more years of conjugal life. All of these women had normal menstrual cycles and no fallopian tube occlusion. The serum samples from the husbands of the infertile women were collected after 4 days of sexual abstinence; the number, morphology, and the motility of the sperm provided normal values, so were considered fertile. The uterine fluid samples were collected after 4 or more days of abstinence. The menstrual cycle was divided into 6 phases of four days each, beginning from the 5th day of the cycle. The phases were phase I (early follicular phase - days 5-8), phase II (late follicular phase - days 9-12), phase III (ovulatory phase-days 13-16), phase IV (early luteal phase - days 17-20), phase V (mid-luteal phase - days 21-24), and phase VI (late luteal phase - days 24-28). The amylase activity of the uterine fluid was evaluated using the method of Rice (1959). In the uterine fluid of the parous women, amylase activity showed a significant decrease from Phase I to II, and a significant increase from II to III. Activity declined from III to IV and IV to V. There was a highly significant increase from V to VI. In the infertile women there was no significant change in amylase activity from phase I to II. Activity declined significantly from II to III, then increased significantly from III to IV. From phase IV to V there was a highly significant decrease. Activity highly increased from phase V to VI. In comparison of the two groups it was noted that the activity level was significantly low at all phases of the menstrual cycle in the infertile women. This could have made their uterine environment nonconductive to sperm capacitation. Endogenous levels of ovarian hormones are reported to affect amylase activity.

Sperm Motility Anesthesia may Decrease Effect In GIFT One of the reasons for conflicting pregnancy rates in GIFT may be found in a motility inhibiting substance existing in human peritoneal fluid (hPF). This factor from hPF is a heat-resistant volatile molecule with a very small molecular mass and a possible origin from general anesthesia. In a study conducted by Dr. W. Miska, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany, and associates the influence of peritoneal fluid on sperm motility was examined in patients under general anesthesia ("Effect of Anesthesia on Sperm Motility in Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer", Archives of Andrology, Jan./Feb. 1995; 34:43-45). Peritoneal fluids were obtained from the Douglas pouch of women having laparoscopy for infertility work-up. They were in a pre-ovulatory phase and had no peritoneal pathology. Pre-operatively they received 7.5 mg Midazolam po. General anesthesia was induced with 2 mg vecuronium bromide and 6 mg thiopental /kg body wt. Intubation was facilitated with 1 mg succinylcholine /kg body wt. Then halothane 0.6-1.0% and 66% N(2)O in O(2) was given by controlled ventilation in a nonrebreathing circuit. A slight hyperventilation was maintained. Spermatozoa were obtained from healthy semen donors with normal semen parameters and purified by the swim-up method in BWW. Separated spermatozoa were incubated with fractions of peritoneal fluid for 30 minutes at 22(degree)C. Sperm motility was measured at 22(degree)C by a computer-aided sperm analysis system (Stromberg-Mida GmbH, Bad Feilnbach, Germany). Motile and immotile spermatozoa were divided in categories according to WHO criteria. Gamete interactions occur in vivo in the environment of the fallopian tubes. This environment consists of tubal secretions and peritoneal and follicular fluids. Miska writes "Any substance present in hPF with strong influence on the gametes (e.g., inhibiting sperm motility) may be fatal to the success of GIFT. Our results concerning the characterization of a sperm motility-inhibiting factor in hPF indicate a heat-resistant, volatile molecule with a very small molecular mass. This ... factor might be one of the substances that are applied for general anesthesia, such as halothane ... This suggests that the use of local anesthesia(spinal or epidural) for laparoscopic GIFT may confer significant advantages concerning pregnancy rates." The corresponding author for this study is W.

Luteinizing Hormone Overexpression of LH Leads to Infertility in Transgenic Mice Infertility, polycystic ovaries, and ovarian tumors are directly associated with overexpression of luteinizing hormone (LH) in transgenic mice. A transgenic mouse model has been generated which may prove valuable in studies where excess LH implicates infertility and increased miscarriage rates in women. "The bLH(beta)-CTP transgenic mouse model will be invaluable for these and other studies as it provides a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms whereby elevated LH leads to prolonged luteal life span, cyst formation, tumorigenesis, and perhaps abnormal fertilization and implantation," according to a report in February 1995 issue of Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 92, 1322-1326, by Kimberly A. Risma et al., Case Western University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio. Fluctuating levels of pituitary gonadotropins: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH are critical to maintain a pregnancy after fertilization. Correlation of hypersecretion of LH and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), infertility, and miscarriage in women, suggests that chronically elevated LH impairs fertility, reports Risma et al. "Unfortunately, there are no studies showing a direct relationship between hypersecreted LH and reproductive abnormalities. Since LH is secreted in regulated pulses and its serum t1/2 is short [20-30 min], it is difficult to devise protocols for chronic administration of exogenous LH that mimic endogenous pulse patterns of LH. To circumvent this limitation, we report a transgenic mouse model in which elevated hormone levels are maintained chronically, without requiring multiple injections, supraphysiologic dosing, or dampening of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis," Risma reports. Two approaches were combined to achieve elevated levels of serum LH. "Increased secretion of hormone from the pituitary was achieved by expression of an LH(beta) subunit transgene, targeted to the pituitary by a previously characterized bovine (alpha)-subunit promoter. The LH(beta) transgene was modified to encode a peptide extension that we proposed would slow the elimination of LH from the serum. This peptide.... is referred to as the C-terminal peptide (CTP). The CTP is thought to be a major determinant of the serum t1/2 of hCG and has been shown to increase the t1/2 of FSH 2- to 3-fold when fused to its (beta) subunit," Risma writes. Risma et al. reports that serum LH levels were elevated in 13 transgenic (39.7 +/- 8.7 ng/ml; P(less than)0.001) vs. 8 control (2.7 +/- 0.48 ng/ml) females, demonstrating that hypersecretion of LH had been achieved. The transgenic mice ovulated infrequently, maintained a prolonged luteal phase, and developed pathologic ovarian changes such as cyst formation, marked enlargement of ovaries, and granulosa cell tumors. Testosterone and estradiol levels were increased compared to nontransgenic littermates. "An unusual extragonadal phenotype was also observed: transgenic females developed hydronephropathy and pyelonephritis. The pathology observed demonstrates a direct association between abnormal secretion of LH and infertility and underscores the utility of the transgenic model for studying how excess LH leads to cyst formation, ovarian tumorigenesis, and infertility." Population Association of America Age Increases Early Fetal Loss, Not Ability To Conceive The age-related decline in ability to have children may be due to early fetal loss rather than an inability to conceive, according to a Penn State, University Park, Pennsylvania, anthropologist. "It appears that age does not affect conception as much as it increases the probability of a high-risk conception that terminates early," Darryl Holman, doctoral candidate in anthropology, told attendees at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America, San Francisco, California, April 8, 1995. "This increased probability of early fetal loss with increased age suggests that future research in assisted pregnancy might benefit from the careful screening of harvested eggs for genetic defects before in vitro fertilization." The results of his study indicate that 18 year-old women have a 63.6% chance of fetal loss with each conception, 28 year-old women have an 85% chance of fetal loss with each conception, 38-year-old women, a 95.5% chance of fetal loss with each conception, and 48 year-old women a 98.7% chance of fetal loss with each conception. "These numbers may seem astonishing, but a 1990 model using in vitro fertilization data came up with an average of about 76%," says Holman. Working in Bangladesh, Holman carried out a baseline study of 3,200 married women and then a reproductive follow-up survey with 708 women. This nine month-long follow-up survey consisted of twice-weekly visits during which a urine sample was collected and questions on pregnancy, pregnancy sickness and the subject's menstrual cycle were answered. These 19,000 urine samples from a range of women were processed at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Bangladesh. "In the lab we used sensitive chemical assays to detect human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone secreted by the placenta in pregnant women," says Holman. The earliest that this hormone can be detected is seven days after conception, when implantation of the fetus takes place. "The risk of fetal loss follows a pattern," says Holman. "Initially it is very high and drops with time through the pregnancy." The researchers, who included Dr. James Wood, professor of anthropology, Penn State, and Dr. Kenneth L. Campbell, associate professor of biology, University of Massachusetts, Boston, modeled conceptions as falling into one of two groups, high-risk and low-risk. The high-risk group consists of fetal loss resulting from genetic abnormalities. The low-risk group consists of fetal loss resulting from such events as trauma, infection, placental failure or cervical incompetence. High-risk conceptions lead to fetal loss very early, while the low-risk conceptions usually lead to fetal loss later in pregnancy. The researchers believe that the increase in fetal loss with age is due to an increase in more high-risk conceptions, and increase in genetic abnormalities in the eggs with age. Wood's model, based on biological concepts rather than strictly on mathematical principles, modeled these two subgroups of fetal loss to establish the overall risk and effects of age on fetal loss. "Because this model is biologically based, we were also able to extrapolate back through the initial seven days of pregnancy when existing tests do not identify women as pregnant," says Holman. Conventional studies have not been able to accurately estimate the number of conceptions because of this seven-day window when women, their doctors and sensitive tests cannot determine pregnancy. These missing seven days appear to be significant in early fetal loss events. "The percentage of fetal loss that takes place during these seven days is estimated at 24% for an 18 year-old up to 45% for a 45-year-old," says Holman. "A 28 year-old woman has a 37% chance of losing a pregnancy in the first week." The researchers were able to compare their results to a 1988 study of natural conceptions in U.S. women. They found that Bangladesh women lose only about 5% more pregnancies than do U.S. women. Understanding the rate of subclinical fetal loss - events that occur without the woman knowing - and the effect that age has on early fetal loss may eventually help to improve the rates of successful in vitro fertilization. From the anthropological viewpoint, the researchers would like to know how these very early terminated pregnancies affect the birth interval, the time between the birth of one child and the next. This is important because pregnancy hormones take some time to clear the body and early fetal loss may provide a time period during which hormones make ovulation and consequently conception impossible. The researchers are also testing the urine samples for metabolites of progesterone and estrogen to help determine how long after fetal loss ovulation begins. Cryopreserved Embryos Tubal Versus Uterine Transfer of Embryos "We speculate that tubal transfer of cryopreserved embryos may prove to be the optimal assisted reproductive method in women without tubal occlusion," researchers report. The first pregnancy achieved after transfer of cryopreserved human embryos was announced in 1983. Since then, cryopreserved embryos have become an important part of assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Bradley Van Voorhis, M.D., et al. noted a high pregnancy rate in their preliminary experiences with the transfer of cryopreserved embryos to the fallopian tube by laparoscopy (i.e., four pregnancies in six transfers). This laparoscopic tubal transfer is expensive and provides greater medical risk to the patient. "Because of the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy of tubal transfer, we thought it imperative to compare this method of transfer with transcervical transfer of embryos in a prospective randomized trial. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the pregnancy rate after tubal transfer of cryopreserved embryos is higher than the pregnancy rate after uterine transfer." (Tubal Versus Uterine Transfer of Cryopreserved Embryos: A Prospective Randomized Trial", Fertility and Sterility, March 1995;63(3):578-582). Nineteen couples were randomly assigned to fallopian transfer and 21 to uterine transfer. Causes of infertility were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups in gravidity, parity, age at retrieval, age at transfer, outcome of the retrieval cycle, or endometrial stripe thickness. There was no difference in embryo numbers or quality. Survival of the embryo after thawing was 93% in the fallopian transfer group and 88% in the uterine transfer group. Fallopian transfer was related to a significant increase in the clinical pregnancy rate and the ongoing pregnancy rate. In fallopian transfer the ongoing rate was 58% and only 19% in the uterine. After fallopian transfer the implantation rate was 19.4% and after uterine it was 10.4%. Van Voorhis summarizes that the results of the study indicate tubal transfer of cryopreserved embryos results in a higher pregnancy rate than uterine transfer in women with patent fallopian tubes and at least 3 cryopreserved embryos. There was no difference in embryo quality as assessed before cryopreservation. In addition, there was no difference in the factors known to influence pregnancy rates. So, none of these factors can account for the increased pregnancy rates observed with the fallopian transfers. Van Voorhis states, "Tubal transfer of cryopreserved embryos closely mimics a natural conception in terms of early embryo development and implantation. By performing the transfer at the pronuclear stage of development, embryos are in culture for only 26 hours, allowing early embryo development to occur in the fallopian tube. Tubal transfer also allows the embryos to enter the uterine cavity at the appropriate stage of development and precludes any endometrial trauma, which can be associated with uterine transfer." Therefore the results indicate that "tubal transfer of cryopreserved embryos leads to a significantly higher pregnancy rate than uterine transfer in women with patent fallopian tubes and at least 3 cryopreserved embryos."

Improved Pregnancy Rates Cumulus Removal and Addition of Follicular Fluid Pregnancy can be achieved without micromanipulation in patients with male factor infertility. In a recent study Jerome Check et al. evaluated the efficacy of nonmicromanipulation for male factor. Included were two modified in vitro insemination techniques - removal of the cumulus cells with and without the addition of follicular fluid (FF) - in couples with "male factor' problems. (Cumulus Removal and Addition of Follicular Fluid Possibly Improves Pregnancy Rates with In Vitro Fertilization for Male Factor," Archives of Andrology, January 1995;34:47-52). Check et al. wrote "One of the indications for in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) is male factor. However, a problem in assessing the efficacy of IVF for male factor lies in identifying the subfertile male based on merely the semen analysis. Some semen samples with subnormal count, motility, and/or morphology are capable of fertilizing oocytes in vitro, while sperm that appears normal may actually be incapable of resulting in pregnancy. Once the problem has been identified as male factor, the difficulty is in selecting an appropriate treatment." The newer methods of micromanipulation and modified insemination techniques are available when fertilization is not accomplished with conventional methods. Check notes that it is unclear as to what factors should be included in the definition of severe male factor. "While various semen parameters can indicate a reduced chance of success with fertilization, they cannot accurately predict the outcome following IVF." Their goal was to evaluate the success of patients who had subnormal motility density and subnormal morphology. Their results confirmed that subnormal semen parameters cannot predict poor outcome. Average pregnancy rates presented following IVF-ET. Check et al. also suggest that treatment for male factor be based on the severity of the problem. High-cost treatments, such as micromanipulation, should be considered only for the most severe. In their program, they "attempted to enhance the cell culture environment to improve the conditions necessary for IVF." This was accomplished by removing the cumulus cells from around the oocytes, pooling more oocytes in a small volume, and adding FF. This removal of cumulus cells may improve the chances of sperm with low or abnormal motility by allowing contact with the zona pellucida. Cumulus removal also allows more pooling of oocytes to increase proximity of sperm and oocytes. "Human FF has been found to contain factors that improve the rate of fertilization of human oocytes in vitro, possibly by enhancing sperm motility, or by providing factors necessary for the completion of the acrosome reaction in vitro". The study of Check et al. has shown that "pregnancies can be achieved without ... micromanipulation..." Because of the expense of the procedure, they should not be used without discrimination.

Ectopic Pregnancy Predisposing Risk Factors Pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal damage have been identified as the two main risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. The first pregnancy reported after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) was ectopic (Steptoe and Edwards, 1976), and there have been reports ever since of ectopic pregnancies occurring after IVF and embryo transfer. Because the data on the risk factors associated with ectopic pregnancies after IVF and embryo transfer are conflicting, Samuel Marcus and Peter Brinsden conducted a study to analyze the incidence and risk factors associated with ectopic pregnancy ("Analysis of the Incidence and Risk Factors Associated with Ectopic Pregnancy Following In-Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer," Human Reproduction, January 1995;10(1):199-203). Data on 135 ectopic pregnancies was taken from records at Bourn Hall Clinic and compared with random samples of 135 singleton deliveries from the same time period. All of the patients received IVF treatment. Ovarian stimulation was accomplished using either clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin with or without follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) or Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist buserelin. Ovulation was induced with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Oocyte retrieval was obtained by vaginal ultrasound-guided method or by laparoscopic or transabdominal recovery. Both fresh and cryopreserved embryo transfer cycles were completed. Of the 135 ectopic pregnancies there was no evidence of an association between the ectopic pregnancy and a past history of abortion, termination of pregnancy, still birth, neonatal death, or tubal surgery. There was a positive correlation between a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. There was also clear evidence of an association of tubal damage with ectopic pregnancies. A strong association existed between tubal damage and pelvic inflammatory disease. In both normal and ectopic pregnancies the incidence of tubal disease was significantly higher in patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. There was no evidence of a link between the type of ovarian stimulation and ectopic pregnancy. The concentrations of estradiol, LH, and progesterone at the time of ovulation induction did not correlate to ectopic pregnancies. Since the embryo transfer technique did not change during the study period, none of the parameters related to this were analyzed. There was statistical evidence that the ectopic group received a higher volume of culture medium than the control group. "This result confirms the finding of Knutzen et al. (1989) which showed that after injection of ... radio-opaque fluid through a standard embryo transfer catheter, the material was passed either totally or partially into the Fallopian tubes in 44% of patients, suggesting that the chance of the embryo being carried into the tube immediately after transfer is high. The fact that most ectopic pregnancies occur in patients with damaged tubes supports the hypothesis that the embryo is not transported back to the uterine cavity because of tubal dysfunction". Samuel Marcus writes, "The overall incidence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF in this series was 135/3000. Although the incidence is comparable with other reports, it is much higher than that following natural conception." The study also revealed that one in four ectopic pregnancies following IVF and embryo transfer are heterotopic, ovarian or bilateral tubal. Seventy-five percent were single tubal, 15% were heterotopic, 6% ovarian, and 4% were bilateral tubal pregnancies. Marcus states "This should be considered whenever the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is made". In conclusion he adds, "Patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and/or tubal damage are at a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy following IVF and embryo transfer and we recommend injecting the minimum volume of culture medium during embryo transfer."

Hysterosalpingogram Determining Diagnostic course After Normal Hysterosalpingogram Women failing to conceive within one year after a normal hysterosalpingogram demonstrate a high incidence of pelvic pathology with laparoscopy. To assess the intraluminal environment of the fallopian tube and endometrium the hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is used. However, its ability to evaluate other pelvic pathologies is limited. Laparoscopy (LSC) in conjunction with the HSG will accomplish this. Various studies have indicated the discrepancies between the findings of HSG and LSC in the same patient. Therefore, some researchers recommend LSC as the initial assessment tool. Most physicians agree that abnormalities discovered with HSC be followed up with LSC and/or hysteroscopy, but there are questions as to what the follow-up should be for patients with a normal HSG. Bruce Carr M.D. et al., evaluated infertile couples with a normal HSG and assessed their subsequent fertility rates, their laparoscopic findings after a normal HSG, and their historical data ("Infertile Couples with a Normal Hysterosalpingogram," Journal of Reproductive Medicine, January 1995; 40:19-23). Of the 132 couples with a normal HSG, 29% achieved a pregnancy without having a LSC. There was a fourfold higher pregnancy rate during the first three months post HSG than any other three month period. The pregnancy rate after LSC was 35%. Carr and associates indicate that their study "supports the hypothesis that women failing to conceive within one year after a normal HSG have a high incidence of pelvic pathology at LSC. If pregnancy did not ensue following a normal HSC, LSC revealed pelvic pathology in 50-60% of cases. Proper timing of LSC is essential ... because of the potential therapeutic effect of HSG." Their study revealed that this effect was achieved by performing HSGs with water-soluble contrast media. Carr and associates offer some guidelines for timing LSC after a normal HSG. In the women who conceived after HSG but before LSC, the majority of pregnancies occurred in the first three months after the HSG. Also, an increased number of abnormal findings was found on LSC when there was an increase in the time elapsed between the HSG and the LSC. Some tubal diseases are acquired, so their incidence may increase over time. Their recommendation suggests a waiting period of three months after a normal HSG before performing a LSC. In women who have not conceived by one year after HSG, LSC is warranted because of the high incidence of pelvic pathology.

Integrins Assessing Uterine Receptivity Abnormal endometrial integrins may indicate defective uterine receptivity which may result in unexplained infertility. The American Fertility Society estimates that 15% to 20% of couples being evaluated for infertility have no identified explanation for their infertility. Unexplained fertility has been attributed to sperm abnormalities, the oocyte, fertilization, ovarian dysfunction, infection, immune problems and peritoneal factors. Because of the lack of acceptable markers for a fertile endometrium there have been few investigations of uterine receptivity defects. Recently this area has been researched by Bruce Lessey, Ph.D., M.D., and associates ("Integrins as Markers of Uterine Receptivity in Women with Primary Unexplained Infertility," Fertility and Sterility, March 1995;63:535-42). "We described the patterns of expression of integrin cell adhesion molecules in the endometrium of women and noted that one integrin ... abruptly appears in endometrial epithelial cells on post-ovulatory days 5 to 6." The expression of these molecules correlates to the implantation time of the embryo. Previously Lessey and associates demonstrated that histologic delay in endometrium maturation was associated with the loss of a specific integrin. They also demonstrated a relationship between a specific integrin and mild endometriosis. Therefore, integrins may provide a new approach to the assessment of uterine receptivity. In their study eighty-seven nulliparous women were observed at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. All of the women had been previously evaluated for infertility and had been diagnosed with primary infertility of unexplained etiology. The women's endometrial function was assessed using three cycle-dependent integrins as potential markers of uterine receptivity. (alpha)4 and (beta)3 are subunits that are produced only during maximal uterine receptivity (post-ovulatory days 6-10) so each might be considered potentially useful in detecting endometrial defects. In patients with (alpha)4 missing infertility was not diagnosed. However, (beta)3 proved to be a more reliable marker of the "opening of the window of implantation." (beta)3 is also expressed well into the pregnancy. " The absence of the (beta)3 subunit appears to recognize specifically two distinct pathophysiologic conditions that we have chosen to designate as type I and II defects." Various studies have suggested that the timing of implantation is from cycle day 20 through day 24. Embryos enter the uterus and implant around post-ovulatory days 4 and 5. If there is a receptive endometrium, the embryo will adhere and implant. If the window of implantation is shifted (as in luteal phase defect or type I defects), or lost (as in Type II defects), the embryo will fail to implant and be lost. Both types of defects reveal distinct mechanisms of defective endometrial receptivity. With type I defects there is a hormonal inadequacy or responsiveness in an otherwise normal endometrium. With type II defects there is a normal menstrual cycle but abnormal endometrial function. With either defect infertility should be treatable if normal endometrium function can be restored. Therefore, "markers that correctly differentiate such defects could be exceedingly useful in extending our understanding of various infertility states..."

Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation Intrauterine Insemination Versus Timed Intercourse There is increased incidence of conception in patients treated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) as opposed to thoses treated with COH and timed intercourse (TI). A. Gargaropoulos, University of Athens, Areteion Hospital, Athens, Greece, and his associates conducted a crossover study to determine whether there is a benefit from IUI as opposed to TI in ovulated cycles of couples with long standing, unexplained infertility ("Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation with or without Intrauterine Insemination for the Treatment of Unexplained Infertility, "International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 1995;48:55-59). For the study, forty-six couples were randomly divided into two groups. Each group began one of the two treatment methods: COH/IUI or COH/TI for two consecutive cycles. They then changed to the alternative treatment after a rest cycle, unless pregnancy was achieved. Thus, each patient was her own control. The patients were given hMG for 7 days. If at the end of 7 days there was no increase in serum E(2), the dosage was increased. Human chorionic gonadotropin was injected 24 hours after the last dose of hMg if not more than four leading follicles were seen on ultrasound and the plasma E(2) level was (less than) 1500 pmol/l. The couples were instructed to have intercourse 36-40 hours after the administration of the hCG or insemination was performed approximately 36 hours later. The couples completed 141 cycles, 67 were with COH/TI and 74 were with COH/IUI. The pregnancy rate after COH/TI was 17.1% and after COH/IUI 45.2%. The difference was significant. The cycle fecundity was 8.9% in those receiving COH/TI and 25.7% in those treated with COH/IUI. There were no reported signs or symptoms of pelvic infection or significant uterine cramping in the women treated with COH/IUI. Of the 19 pregnancies following IUI, 10 have been delivered and seven are at greater than 20 weeks gestation. Only two spontaneous abortions occurred. In conclusion Gargaropoulos et al. writes "Although our study indicated favorable results with hMG/IUI treatment over hMG alone ... additional randomized studies will help to clarify the efficacy of hMG/IUI treatment. However, a trial of human menopausal gonadotropin and IUI is justified in couples with prolonged infertility of unknown cause." The corresponding author of this study is A. Gargaropoulos, 17 Dim.

Negative Post-Coital Tests In-Vitro Cervical Mucus - Sperm Penetration Tests In in-vitro cervical mucus-sperm penetration tests (CMSPT), reduced cervical mucus receptivity is a more frequent cause of negative post-coital tests and infertility than is a male factor. In the in-vivo assessment of sperm-mucus interaction the post-coital test (PCT) is the method generally used. Although it is frequently used, there is little agreement on the interpretation of the results or the optimal mode of treatment for the infertility. Negative PCT results are associated with various clinical problems and are equated with low pregnancy rates. Further evaluation tools of abnormal PCTs are the in-vitro study of cervical mucus-sperm interaction and cross-hostility tests. By comparing the results of the couple's cervical mucus-sperm penetration test (CMSPT) and the cross-hostility test with the donors' sperm, the cause of the failed sperm-cervical mucus interaction can be better identified. In their investigation H.S. Jacobs and colleagues evaluated the CMSPT and cross-testing in patients with repeatedly negative PCTs and sought to determine the relationship between the in-vitro test results, different modes of infertility treatment and the pregnancy rate ("In-vitro Cervical Mucus-Sperm Penetration Tests and Outcome of Infertility Treatments in Couples with Repeatedly Negative Post-coital Tests," Human Reproduction January 1995;10(1): 85-90). "The cervical mucus is the route of access for spermatozoa from the vaginal environment into the upper genital tract and acts as a regulator and filter of sperm transport (Fredricsson and Bjork, 1977). The interaction between the semen and the mucus can be abnormal and lead to infertility. This interaction of male and female secretions can be studied in-vivo using the PCT, but interpretation of the results is difficult and poorly defined. Also, the results have not been proven to correlate with fertility potential. CMSPT has two parameters: distance of penetration and quality of motility. Each of these contribute to the migration of spermatozoa towards the upper female genital tract. Abnormal PCTs are also evaluated by cross-hostility. This provides a clearer explanation of the factor responsible for the abnormal interaction, be it cervical or the male factor. Positive results from CMSPT correlates with a greater chance of conception. Jacobs et al. note that their studies "imply that in correctly timed and performed PCTs and CMSPTs, sperm characteristics should be considered the major components that affect the results of penetration tests." In their study only 31% of patients with repeated negative PCTs had a male factor, but 63% of the couples had decreased cervical mucus receptivity. "Stimulation by estrogen on production of cervical mucus results in the secretion of thin, watery cervical mucus, which allows easy penetration by spermatozoa" (Moghissi, 1972; Wold et al., 1978.) "Abnormalities in cervical mucus are believed to be responsible for 5-10% of female infertility" (Balsco, 1977; Roumen et al., 1982). Jacobs et al. concluded that "Once the limitations of PCT as a qualitative rather than a quantitative study are accepted, the PCT remains an important tool in the evaluation of infertility. If the results ... are repeatedly negative or poor in the absence of proven male factor, the cervical mucus and sperm properties have to be tested not only by CMSPT but should also include a cross-hostility test to determine the etiology of the sperm-cervical mucus interaction." Jacobs et al. wrote "a decision to progress to assisted reproduction because of a failure of spermatozoa to penetrate cervical mucus in male factor infertility cases should probably be deferred until an attempt has been made to reverse the infertility by treatment with intrauterine insemination. In women with polycystic ovaries and repeatedly negative PCTs, cervical mucus with low quality in terms of sperm receptivity should be suspected. Ovulation induction, together with IUI, should be used ... as the preferred mode of treatment to improve the success rate of infertility treatment."

Testing/Controversy The Reliability of Postcoital Test The postcoital test has been found to have poor to fair reproducibility according to a recent study. The postcoital test has received widespread use in the evaluation of infertile couples. Many consider it the cornerstone. Because of the controversy over the test's lack of validity for the prediction of pregnancy Mark Hornstein, M.D., and associates have conducted a study to determine the test's reproducibility and to develop a standardized scoring system for the test ("The Reproducibility of the Postcoital Test: A Prospective Study," Obstetrics and Gynecology, March 1995; 85:396-400). Twenty-eight infertile patients (after 2-3 days of abstinence) were instructed to engage in intercourse 2-12 hours before their examination. They were to refrain from bathing and douching after intercourse. After a standardized collection of post-coital specimens, four reproductive endocrinologists evaluated six postcoital test characteristics and gave their overall impression of the test. The six characteristics were an assessment of the cervical mucus by ferning, cellularity, spinnbarkeit, and consistency, and of sperm by total count and motility. The results indicated that, except for the determination of sperm number, all other test elements had minimal reproducibility among observers. To further examine the variability Hornstein et al. analyzed the percentage of cases in which all four observers rated the characteristics with the same score. The greatest agreement was in the sperm elements: total number and motility. All four observers gave identical ratings in 39% of the tests. The poorest agreement was in cellularity with perfect agreement in only 11% of the cases. Each characteristic of the test was also examined to determine their correlation with the observers' score for overall impression. For each observer sperm motility and number were "significantly associated with overall impression." The remaining characteristics were not significantly associated with the overall impression. According to Hornstein "The postcoital test ... has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. Concerns that have been raised include a lack of standardization in the test's performance and timing, an absence of agreement in defining the 'normal' range of motile sperm for an adequate test, and its poor sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value for forecasting pregnancy. In addition, test reproducibility has not been defined." The latter was the focus of Hornstein's study. It was demonstrated that "there is poor to fair reproducibility within the individual categories.

Tripterygium Male Infertility Plant Six male antifertility diterpene epoxides have been isolated from Tripterygium. Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (Celastraceae) is a perennial vine growing in southern China. The herb, also called Lei Gong Teng (Thunder God Vine or "three-wing nut"), has been used in Chinese medicine for treatment of fever, edema, and carbuncles for centuries. The powdered roots of the plant were also used as an insecticide. Over the last 30 years it has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic nephritis, chronic hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, ankylosing spondylitis, and skin diseases ("Tripterygium wilfordii, a Chinese herb effective in male fertility regulation" Contraception 1987; 36:335-45). According to a study by D.Y. Yu in nine rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with Tripterygium for 2 to 56 months, necrospermia or azoospermia occurred. In experimenting with Wistar rats it was discovered that the seminiferous epithelium was damaged and the serum testosterone levels were decreased when the rats were fed with Tripterygium. In another study rats became infertile after 8 weeks of receiving Tripterygium. Sperm motility decreased sharply and sperm concentration decreased. There was no evidence of toxicity and after 4-5 weeks without the Tripterygium there was full recovery of fertility. Qian Shao Zhen, Xu Ye, and Zhang Jian Wei observed 26 fertile men being treated with Tripterygium for psoriasis.("Recent Progress in Research on Tripterygium: A Male Antifertility Plant," Contraception, February 1995; 51:117-120). After one month of treatment, the sperm density and motility significantly decreased. After two months of treatment the density and motility decreases further. After one month without the treatment sperm density and motility significantly increased to fertile standards. After another month they were restored to pre-treatment levels. Dr. Zhen et al. concluded that even a small dose of Tripterygium could cause reversible infertility and one of the main sites of action could be the epididymal sperm. Zhen and associates write that six male antifertility diterpene epoxides have been isolated from Tripterygium. They state "At the ED95 dosage levels, they act mainly on metamorphosing spermatids and testicular and epididymal spermatozoa with exfoliation and inhibition of basic nuclear protein turnover of late spermatids, delayed spermiation and sperm head-tail separation and microtubule, microfilament and membrane damages. A preliminary toxic evaluation indicated that these compounds were immunosuppressive at dose levels 5-12 times their antifertility doses. Immunosuppression is an important weakness for an antifertility agent, but if the immunosuppressive dose of a drug is much higher than its antifertility dose, it could yet be regarded as a safe contraceptive.

Kallmann's Syndrome Pregnancy More Than Doubles in Women With Syndrome More than double the number of pregnancies previously recorded with confirmed Kallmann's syndrome have been obtained in a study published in the March 1995 issue of Fertility and Sterility, by Umit Sungurtekin, M.D. et al., King George V and Royal Prince Alfred Hospitals; Sydney IVF; and University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. An association of underdeveloped genitalia and absent olfactory lobes, representing a genetic syndrome, was first described by Kallmann et al. in 1944. Further study by De Morsier and Gauthier lead to a suggested a hypothalamic origin in 1963. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with the association of anosmia has been referred to as Kallmann's syndrome, De Morsier's syndrome, olgactogenital syndrome, or olfactogenital dysplasia. Kallmann's syndrome occurs approximately 1:10,000 in males and 1:50,000 in females. Eight pregnancies in females with Kallmann's syndrome have been previously reported. Out of six women diagnosed with Kallmann's syndrome from 1974-1994, three wished to undergo induction of ovulation to conceive (ovulation in women with Kallmann's syndrome does not occur without ovulation induction). All six women presented with primary amenorrhea and absence of spontaneous development of secondary sexual characteristics. None of the women complained about the lack of the sense of smell until directly questioned. Anosmia was confirmed with detailed testing. Human pituitary gonadotropins (hPG) were used for induction until 1985, when hMG superseded the local highly purified extract. Pulsatile GnRH was introduced in 1983. Ovulation was induced successfully in all three patients, with each patient having multiple conceptions. Of nine pregnancies, there were seven conceptions. One patient had one miscarriage at 6 weeks gestation and a twin pregnancy ending in a pre-term delivery at 29 weeks of gestation. Both infants died due to neonatal sepsis. This patient had previously had a successful single birth and a successful twin pregnancy after the unsuccessful events. Sungurtekin et al. noted that "the total doses of hPG and hMG used in the pregnancy cycles (mean +/- SEM; 2,850 +/- 375 IU; 40 +/- 5 ampules) and the follicular phase stimulations (mean 15.6 days) were substantially higher than the mean doses used in an age-matched group of women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism without anosmia (six women; 2,100 +/- 150 IU; 28 +/- 2 ampules; 10.7 days). The follicular phase stimulation with pulsatile GnRH in [one] case (18 and 19 days) were also substantially longer than in our regular program (usually 10 to 14 days)." "Clearly, more information is required on the range of responses that may occur in women with Kallmann's syndrome. The data currently available are insufficient to make dogmatic statements, and we would like to see data from a standardized GnRH stimulation test in unprimed and GnRH- (and estrogen-) primed women with Kallmann's syndrome compared with their responses to induction of ovulation with pulsatile IV GnRH. In the absence of this definitive predictive information, we currently recommend an initial attempt at induction of ovulation in these women using pulsatile IV GnRH, with the knowledge that some of them will require gonadotropins, usually at a higher dosage than most other hypogonadal patients. It is self-evident that a patient diagnosed with Kallmann's syndrome should be given estrogen and progestogen therapy for development of secondary sexual characteristics, to mature the uterus, ovaries, and other genital tract tissues, and to protect the bones and cardiovascular system." Hyperestrogenism Patients Undergoing IVF with Elevated E(2) Levels at Increased Risk Because of a report of severe phlebitis and death occurring in two patients after undergoing hyperstimulation, concern exists that patients undergoing IVF techniques resulting in elevated E(2) levels could be at some level of increased risk. An increased level of coagulation parameters due to pregnancy and oral contraceptive (OC) use has generally been thought to be a result of the estrogen component. Few to minor changes in the hemostatic mechanism have been reported with the newer progestins currently being used in OCs. Undefined coagulation abnormalities have recently been reported after hMG- and hCG-induced hyperstimulation of the ovary in several women. A study in the March 1995 issue of Fertility and Sterility, Charles Lox, Ph.D., et al., Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, helps to clarify what role high levels of endogenous steroids might play on the potential for thrombosis in women and provides evidence that short-term use of fertility-enhancing drugs and their resultant hyperestrogenism does not induce hypercoagulability. "We were interested to see if molecular activation of a number of the coagulation factors could be detected after two different IVF regimes that induced high circulation levels of natural endogenous E(2). If evident, this might suggest an increased risk factor for bleeding problems in patients predisposed to thrombosis, for whatever reason," states Lox. Patients used ranged in age from 26-41 years of age undergoing IVF, with no history of bleeding disorders or coagulation abnormalities, including OC-induced thrombophelebitis or obstetrical bleeding. The first regimen used hMG stimulation only, with the second phase using hMG plus leuprolide acetate (LA). Fifteen patients in part one were stimulated with 150 IU of FSH and 150 IU of LH. Blood samples were collected for E(2) and coagulation factor analysis. The ten patients in part two were down-regulated with LA, 0.2 mL/d, on cycle day 21. After at least a 10-day treatment period or a 3-day withdrawal bleed, LA was decreased to 0.1 mL and hMG was initiated. Only the hepatic synthesized clotting factor activities were evaluated in this part due to costs. "When looking at both parts of the study, the rise in endogenous E after 10 days of menotropin stimulation was predictable. Levels reached a mean of 1,163 +/- 870 pg/mL (SD), with the maximum level being 2,935 pg/mL. Pooled pretreatment E(2) had a positive correlation with factor VII activity (0.003) and protein C antigen (0.009). After treatment with hMG, the only positive correlation found was with factor V (0.04). There was no significant alteration in either the activity or protein antigen levels before or after 10 days of hMG treatment, nor were the overall measures of hemostatic function altered, the prothrombin (PT) and activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT)." "In the second part of the study, LA plus menotropins, changes in E levels were similar to part 1. Levels before hCG ranged from 20 to 4,949 pg/mL while levels after hCG ranged from 26 to 2,287 pg/mL. Progesterone levels in the period before hCG ranged from 0.5 to 4.4 ng/mL and from 0.9 to 204 ng/mL in the period after hCG. The net effect on clotting variables was also minimal. As expected circulating E(2) increased during the period before hCG with a concomitant increase in P during the period after hCG in each patient over the time course of treatment.. All clotting activity increased minimally, although significantly, during the period after hCG except for factor X. Both the PT and APTT minimally decreased in time. All of these changes are still well within the normal ranges for these factors and do not suggest any alteration in the factors that would suggest any type of coagulapathy." Lox et al. concluded that statistically significant activation of clotting factors occurred during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). None of these patients experienced any clinically significant coagulation disorder that may be explained by either of the following: [1] the increased levels of clotting activity were still "within normal limits;" [2] none of the patients had any conditions known to predispose to coagulapathies (history of coagulapathies, phlebitis, damaged or compromised endothelial cells, etc.); or [3] a combination of the two. "Based on the results of this study, our recommendations are that patients predisposed to coagulapathies who also are undergoing COH should be better studied to see if they develop clinically significant clotting activity." Meiosis-Activating Sterols Improved Treatment of Infertility, As Well As Hormone-Free Contraception Researchers at Rigshospitalet University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk have discovered a group of compounds that could lead to a treatment for infertility problems, according to Novo Nordisk. Paradoxically, the compounds also seem to be capable of preventing unwanted pregnancy. The discovery, published in the April 6, 1995, issue of Nature, is the result of collaboration between researchers at Rigshospitalet and Novo Nordisk. The compounds meiosis-activating sterols (MAS) are present in women's ovaries and in male testes. Under normal circumstances, the compounds will induce the egg cell to complete meiosis, the cell division which results in halving the genetic material. Meiosis is a prerequisite for fertilization of the egg cell. In men, MAS stimulates the formation of sperm cells. Infertility may be due either to the failure of the egg to divide, or to failing sperm cell formation. And since MAS works on both sexes, the discovery holds promise of offering a unique supplement to hormone therapy offered to infertile couples today. "I believe that in the next few years MAS could play an important role as a fertility agent for a certain group of people with fertility problems. Especially in the case of in vitro fertilization we believe we will be able to achieve improved results," says Anne Grete Byskov, Doctor of Science, chief of clinic, Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Rigshopitalet, who heads up the research team. MAS is different from sex hormones in that it acts on human egg cells and sperm cells only, and apparently has no effect on the rest of the body. Therefore treatment with MAS is believed to have few or no side effects. With the new knowledge about MAS and its significance for both male and female fertility, it seems likely that it will become possible, in the longer term, to block MAS, thereby preventing unwanted pregnancy. Perhaps we are moving towards a novel, hormone-free contraceptive pill that can be used by both men and women. "We find this long-term potential for the prevention of pregnancy particularly interesting," says project manager Lars Nordholm, Novo Nordisk, a co-author of the Nature article. "It is our hope that, in collaboration with external partners, we can further develop the project into effective drugs for the treatment of infertility and, later, contraception."

Most couples experience the struggle in much the same way. This is related to the traditional ways men and women have been trained to think, feel, and act. Women are typically seen (by others as well as themselves) as the emotional caretakers or providers of the relationship. Women typically feel responsible not only for everyone's bad feelings, but also for anything bad that happens. Women in infertile couples often protect their husbands from their own pain and feelings of failure by taking much of the responsibility for the treatments upon themselves. When I suggest that men accompany their wives for appointments, couples get concerned about issues like income loss, use of time, etc. While these concerns are usually relevant and important, they also serve the purpose of protecting husbands from their own responsibility (taking part in the conception process) and from their own feelings, which could easily be intensified by so much contact with the medical process. Men are seen, traditionally, as the financial providers of the relationship and are responsible for protecting the family from real or imagined dangers. They are trained to be more instructional: to take charge, to make decisions, and to think without being sidetracked by emotions. Males in infertile couples often feel overwhelmed by the intensity of the woman's emotions as well as an inability to access their own. They tend to focus their energy back into their work, a place where they feel they can have more success. As a result of taking responsibility for the emotional impact of the infertility, the woman experiences intense feelings: pain, anger, fear, etc. which, combined with the messages that her way of dealing with things is in some way dysfunctional or "crazy", causes her to feel an anxious depression. As feelings spill out, she feels out of control and doesn't really know how to ask for what she needs, especially from the husband she is struggling so hard to protect. She may yearn for an emotional connection/interaction at one moment, and in the next, withdraw emotionally from her husband when she fears she has overwhelmed him. Men find themselves in a position where, no matter how well they've been trained to solve problems, they are helpless to make this situation better for the woman and, as a result, may give off messages that she is "too" emotional or sensitive, hoping that this will calm her down. The wife hears this as criticism of her coping and caretaking skills rather than as an expression of her husband's fears. Many couples I've worked with have described this painful cycle. This is the time when couples cling together for dear life, feeling that they've failed in the most basic of all roles: that of reproduction. Couples are hesitant to admit the problems in their marriage, feeling that having problems coping would indicate that their marriage too is a failure. The questions then arise: how to get what you need from your partner...How to be there for your partner? Obviously, more open communication helps; getting in touch with what you're feeling will help you know what you need. Then you can clearly and specifically tell your partner how to give it to you. Ask your partner what she/he needs rather than assuming that you can't give it. Recognize the differences between men and women so it doesn't always feel like your partner is withholding what you need. (Read Intimate Strangers by Lilian Rubin). Share more in the process of treatment and see if you can't teach each other some of the skills you've learned from your years as a man and as a woman. As you share the burdens and joys of your different perceptions/experiences of infertility, it will help to balance the intensity and bring you closer with a deeper respect for each other.

Snails undergoing the change, which some scientists think is caused by tin-based contaminants in the water, have been found by University of Victoria biologist Derek Ellis and his colleagues. The females have been turning into males in harbors and marinas throughout the Strait Juan de Fuca, Ellis said. "Most of the harbors on the west coast of Vancouver Island... show the same effect," he said. 'So we know that the whole of the southern B.C. coast is affected, or was when we looked." Ellis said the phenomenon called imposex has affected almost all species of carnivorous snails. In some species not only do the females grow a penis, but the ovaries turn into testicles. In others, females that retain their ovaries are prevented from releasing eggs by the growth of a penis. The animals die out because they cannot breed said Ellis, who has studied imposex in snails at several polluted locations around the world. Ellis found females with penises in 49 of the 50 locations examined. Ellis and environmental authorities suspect tributyltin (IBT), a potent compound once widely used in boat paint and at salmon farrns, is responsible, although not enough research has been done to confirm their theory. Canada brought in regulations to reduce the use of TBT in 1989. Paints containing TBT can now only be used on vessels more than 80 feet in length, on outboard motor shafts and aluminum boats. Ellis would like to find out if the regulations have had the desired effect of bringing the tin levels down and reducing the level of imposex in snails. A lack of ressearch dollars has prevented Ellis or environmental agencies on this coast from folIowing the fate of the snails. Environment Canada official, Lee Harding said money is scarce and monitoring of TBT and imposex in snails has not been a top priority. He will suggest TBT contamination be investigated and imposex in the snail population get more attention. "From an ecological point of view, to have the gastrpods (snail) population diminishing could be quite profound," be said, adding that at this stage it is not even clear how long it will lake for the snail population or the enviromnent to recover from pollution. Researcher Carol Stewart, who is involved in a study of tin compounds at the federal Insititute of Ocean Sciences, said she is just as concerned about the invisible effects of pollution. "The masculinization of snails is some-thing that you can see. What about the things you can't see?" asked Stewart, who suspects micro-organisms might also be affected and that patterns of predation might be altered. "One of the scary things to me is that the effects occur in snails at levels that we as chemists can't even measure."

Do you ovulate? ARE YOUR PERIODS NORMAL? Menstrual Cycle Evaluation Ovulation assessment is an important part of every infertile couple's evaluation. A complete history and physical by your physician can often uncover obvious concerns. Although regular menstrual cycles suggest normal ovulation, that is not always the case. Normal ovulation is a complex process that requires many things to happen properly and at the correct time with the proper hormone levels. Often subtle hormonal imbalances or ovulation abnormalities result in "suboptimal fertility potential". There are a number of tools that enable us to evaluate both overt and subtle disturbances of ovulation. We employ these techniques in performing an initial menstrual cycle evaluation or to assess the effectiveness of prescribed treatment plans. Thus, ovulation testing and monitoring become important tools for both detecting ovulation problems and monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. A menstrual cycle evaluation may consist of many different components. You may need all or just some of the testing. This depends on which aspects of your ovulation we want to evaluate more closely. Thus, your cycle study will be personalized for your specific situation. Evaluating your ovarian function may require the following tests: BBT's (basal body temperatures) Urinary LH testing Transvaginal pelvic ultrasounds Huhner's Test (post coital test) Endometrial biopsy Blood hormone testing (drawing blood to measure TSH & Prolactin. If you have excessive hairgrowth, obesity or acne we may add testosterone, DHEAS, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, fasting insulin and glucose, or dexamethasone suppression test). Evaluation of ovarian reserve (either cycle day 3 FSH/Estradiol hormone testing or a clomiphene challenge test). You will be given specific information on each of the components that your physician has decided is needed to evaluate your ovulatory function. The results of these tests individually or in combination with other information will help your physician better determine the nature of your ovulatory function. The specific ovulation disorders that these tests are being utilized to rule out include: 1. Inadequate follicle growth patterns. Each month (ovulation cycle) a follicle should develop and grow within one of the ovaries. This follicle is a small fluid filled cyst that contains the ovum (egg) destined to ovulate. It also produces the hormones estrogen and progesterone that ready the reproductive tract for conception and implantation. Disorders of follicular development can cause an inadequate follicular size or inadequate estrogen production which can interfere with implantation. 2. Premature luteinization. In response to a sharp rise in LH, the follicle ruptures and the egg is released. The collapsed follicle forms a corpus luteum and begins to produce progesterone to ready the uterine lining for implantation (attachment) of a fertilized egg. In patients with higher than normal serum LH levels, premature production of progesterone by the follicle may result in improper changes in the cervical mucus, tubal mobility, or endometrium (uterine lining). The elevated LH levels may also adversely effect egg quality. This problem is diagnosed by correlating follicle ultrasound results with hormonal testing. 3. Luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUF syndrome). Follicle rupture and release of the egg should occur within 38 hours of the urinary LH surge. Abnormal follicular development as well as pelvic adhesions can result in failure of the ovary to actually release the egg into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity at the time of ovulation. This problem may be detected by correlating the follicle ultrasound results with urinary LH testing. HCG administration should correct this problem if it is due to a hormonal abnormality. 4. Inadequate luteal phase. The uterine lining, stimulated by estrogen and progesterone, prepares itself each month to accept implantation of a fertilized egg. This preparation requires an orderly growth of the lining. Hormonal imbalances can result in the development of a uterine lining that is out of phase with the fertilized egg. Thus, implantation or attachment of the egg to the uterine wall does not occur appropriately. This problem can cause infertility as well as recurrent miscarriages and is called an inadequate luteal phase. An endometrial biopsy timed 12-13 days after your LH surge is utilized to assess the uterine lining development. 5. Diminished Ovarian Reserve. With advancing age, egg quality and subsequently the chance of a normal pregnancy diminishes. The presence of normal, regular menses, does not necessarily mean you are releasing healthy eggs with each ovulation. This is most simply checked by measuring FSH and estradiol levels on the thrid day of the menstrual cycle. The predictability of this test can be improved by taking two tablets (100 mg) of clomiphene for five days and rechecking the FSH, LH and Progesterone levels. If the LH/FSH ratio is greater than 3 to 1, pregnancy is unlikely with clomiphene and other therapy may be indicated. If the FSH or progesterone are elevated, you are demonstrating decreased ovarian reserve and may need to consider egg donation. The clomiphene challenge and the cycle day 3 FSH are usually reserved for those with unexplained infertility or those over age 35.

Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) A hysterosalpingogram is an X-ray of the uterus and fallopiantubes which allows visualization of the inside of the uterus andtubes. The picture will reveal any abnormalities of the uterusas well as tubal problems such as blockage and dilation (hydrosalpinx). If sterilization reversal is planned, the point at which thetubes are blocked can be seen. This helps to plan the reconstructiveprocedure. If the tubes are not blocked by scar tissue or adhesions, the dye will flow into the abdominal cavity. This is a good signbut it does not guarantee that the tubes will function normally. It does give a rough estimate of the quality of the tubal structureand the status of the tubal lining. Some cases where the tubesappear to be blocked where they join the uterus, may in fact benormal. Often blockage at this location may be due to spasm ofthe opening from the uterus into the tube or from accumulateddebris and mucus blocking the opening. This can be managed bypassing a very thin catheter into the fallopian tube either atthe time of hysterosalpingogram or during a hysteroscopic procedure. A hysterosalpingogram may also indicate endometrial polyps, submucusfibroids, intrauterine adhesions (synechia), uterine and vaginal septauterine cavity abnormalities, or the after-effect of genital tuberculosis. The hysterosalpingogram may or may not be able to detect pelvicadhesions, mild hydrosalpinx, small polyps, endometriosis, tubalphimosis (clubbing of the fimbria at the end of the tube), orimmotility of the tube. Other tests, such as hysteroscopy saline sonohysterography or laparoscopy may be necessary to accurately evaluateyour uterus. Although the purpose of the hysterosalpingogram is not therapeutic,sometimes forcing dye through the tube will dislodge any materialwhich blocks it. A number of women have become pregnant followinga hysterosalpingogram without further treatment. Generally there is no special preparation needed for this test. However, depending upon your diagnosis, you may need to takeantibiotics to guard against possible infection. To ensure thatyou are not pregnant, the study is done between Day 7 and 10 ofyour cycle. Prior to the procedure you may take an anti-inflammatorymedication (Aleve or Motrin). A small catheter is placed intothe cervix and the dye is injected. You may feel heavy crampingduring, and for several hours following this procedure. Expecta sticky vaginal discharge for a few days as the dye is expelledfrom the uterus. Use a pad or panty liner during this time toallow fluid to escape. Any dye that remains will be absorbedwithout any ill effect. NOTE: Be sure we are aware of any allergies you may haveto Iodine, Betadine, or Novocaine prior to the procedure. If cramping does not subside or if you develop severe abdominalpain or fever following this test, please notify Atlanta ReproductiveHealth Centre at 265-3662.

Unfortunately, this permanent form contraception will not allow you to change your mind and attempt pregnancy unless you undergo another surgical procedure. This operation is known as a reversal of tubal sterilization or microsurgical tubal reanastomosis. The surgery is considerably more involved than the operation performed for the sterilization. Whereas the sterilization involved simply tying, clipping, banding, or burning of the fallopian tubes, this procedure employs the use of very thin microsuture to carefully put the tubes back together. In many respects, the operation is very similar to the delicate repair of small blood vessels and/or nerves that plastic surgeons perform in cases of hand injury. It is necessary to use an operating microscope or another magnifying source to adequately visualize the tubal anatomy, and this makes for a tedious surgery that may take from one to two hours to perform. Tubal sterilization is frequently performed through the laparoscope or small incision(minilaparotomy), and because the surgery takes so little time (15 - 30 minutes), is a day surgery. Reversal of tubal sterilization can be performed through a minilaparotomy incision, however, due to the length of operating time, patients usually need to spend one to two days in the hospital to recover. Unlike laparoscopy, where patients can be expected to resume all normal physical activities without restriction within 48 hours of surgery, minilaparotomy patients must be restricted from lifting and exercising for two weeks after surgery. Patients usually require slighty more pain medication after tubal reanastomosis, than after laparoscopic procedures. After leaving the hospital, patients are allowed to drive, walk, use stairs, and have no dietary restrictions. The success of this type of surgery is dependent upon several factors. Foremost of these is the amount of fallopian tube remaining after the sterilization. If at least 4 centimeters of healthy tube is present then pregnancy rates of 60 - 85% are not uncommon. The amount of tube remaning can usually be determined by having one of our physicians review the operative report from your sterilization operation. If your surgery involved the use of cautery or burning the fallopian tube your chances of getting pregnant after this operation may be less, and in these cases, patients would more likely achieve pregnancy by undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). Another extremely important factor in determining the success of tubal reanastomosis is the expertise of the surgeon. The surgeons at the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre (AHRC) have undergone two year subspecialty training in the area of tubal microsurgery as well as the advanced assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF. You need to be aware that if you become pregnant you may be at high risk for ectopic pregnancy (i.e. tubal pregnancy) An early pregnancy test and ultrasound evaluation can help may the diagnosis. Frequently, early therapy (with either surgery or medication) can save the involved fallopian tube. If you do not desire more than one pregnancy, AHRC can offer another option that may be more cost effective. In Vitro Fertilization involves the use of powerful fertility drugs to stimulate the ovary to make multiple follicles that contain eggs. The patient then undergoes an outpatient procedure using local anesthesia and ultrasound where the eggs are removed from the ovary. The male partner's sperm are added to the eggs in a petri dish and the eggs are checked for fertilization after 18-24 hours. During a simple office procedure that requires no anesthesia, the embryos are then placed into the uterus. Any excess embryos can be frozen (cryopreserved) and replaced at a later date. IVF does not require hospitilization, and does not involve the pain and/or recovery time associated with tubal reanostomoses. Pregnancy rates with IVF have been rapidly improving, and now the cost of this process is at least equal to and in many cases less than the cost of tubal surgery especially when you consider your lost time at work after inpatient surgery. This review has provided you with general overview only. If you have further questions please feel free to contact AHRC for further details.

The laparoscopy is an instrument somewhat like a miniature telescope with a fiber optic system which brings light into the abdomen. It is about as big around as a fountain pen and twice as long. An instrument to move the uterus during surgery will be placed in the vagina. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is put into the abdomen through a special needle that is inserted just below the navel. This gas helps to separate the organs inside the abdominal cavity, making it easier for the physician to see the reproductive organs during laparoscopy. The gas is removed at the end of the procedure. Microlaparoscopy a new minimally invasive diagnostic surgical procedure uses telescopes and instruments that are much smaller than normal. If this procedure is appropriate for your condition, smaller incisions will be made and postoperative abdominal tenderness may be reduced. Prior to Surgery Please refer to your ambulatory surgery center folder for specific information as to date, time, location, and preparation for surgery. Arrangements should be made for child care outside the home for the day of surgery and possibly the next day. A quiet, restful environment is needed when you return home. Make arrangements for someone to be there with you for at least 48 hours after surgery. Expect your first night to be restless. You may wish to have the following items at hand to avoid having to send someone out after your surgery: prescription pain medication, heating pad, over-the-counter pain medications (tylenol, aspirin, aleve, etc.), food (oatmeal, ice cream, rice, steamed vegetables, bread, fruit, yogurt, soup and saltine crackers may be easier on the stomach), thermometer, feminine pads, loose comfortable clothing to wear, throat lozenges, and a good book or video to watch while resting. Do not eat or drink anything after 12:00 midnight the night before surgery. Do not smoke or chew gum after 12:00 midnight. If you are currently taking medication, ask you doctor if you should stop taking it. Bowel Preparation: You may be given instructions regarding this during your preoperative office visit. Bowel preparation is usually recommended for patients with endometriosis, pelvic adhesions or pelvic pain. Preparing the bowel with a purging agent such as Go-lytely or Magnesium Citrate is often followed by an oral antibiotic and enemas. While unpleasant, this procedure minimizes the risk of surgical complications from bowel injury during your surgery. Patient must shower or bathe the night prior to surgery. Vaginal Prep: None is usually required. Nail polish, make-up and jewelry should be removed the night before surgery. Wear loose-fitting clothes to prevent any unnecessary pressure on the umbilicus on the day of surgery. Immediately before Surgery After you check in at the Ambulatory Surgery Center, the nurse will call you into the changing room. You will take off all your clothing and put on a patient gown, robe and slippers. The nurse will complete a questionnaire about medications, allergies, you health status and other information prior to your surgery. Please ask any questions and express any concerns you may have. Immediately prior to surgery, you will be asked to empty your bladder. Glasses, contact lenses, dentures and jewelry should be romoved. Valuables should be left in the safekeeping of the person who accompanies you or should be left at home. In the Operating Room The anesthesiologist or one of the nurses will walk you into the operating room. The nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist will place four adhesive tabs on your back or on your chest to monitor your heart rate. While watching the monitor, do not be alarmed about sudden changes in your heart rate or pattern. This may be caused by interference and are not related to your heart activity. You will be given medication that will make you drowsy and possibly make your vision blurry. Shortly after this, you will drift off to sleep. After Surgery After surgery, you will wake up in the recovery room. The nurse will check your blood pressure, pulse and temperature frequently. The nurse will check your dressing and intravenous. If you are cold, ask for an extra blanket. The nurse will check your dressing and intravenous. If you are cold, ask for an extra blanket. The nurse or physician will tell you when you will be allowed to drink something. As soon as you are transferred from the Recovery Room (about one hour after surgery), you may have visitors. You may not remember conversations immediately after surgery, which is normal and lasts only a short period. Your physician will discuss the findings with your family immediately after the surgical procedure is complete. If your family leaves the waiting area please have them notify the receptionist regarding how they can be contacted. Medication will be available for pain or nausea. Ask your nurse for this medication if you are uncomfortable. Medication will be in the form of injections until you are able to drink. Once you are able to drink, the doctor will change your medication to pills. Pain medication is usually allowed every 3-4 hours. Medication for nausea is usually allowed every 4-6 hours. Sore Throat: You may experience a sore throat. This is caused by irritation from a tube placed in your throat (trachea) during anesthesia. It usually lasts for just a few days and can sometimes be helped by throat lozenges. You will remain in the Outpatient Surgery Center for approximately three or four hours after the procedure. After you are able to empty your bladder, you will be allowed to go home. If additional medications are required, you will be given prescriptions to take with you. If you are unable to empty your bladder or nausea is severe, a 23 hour hospital stay over night may be considered. Care after Surgery at Home Incisions. You will have a 1/2" incision just below your navel. This incision will have one suture which will dissolve. You will have 2 to 4 tiny (1/4") incisions near the pubic hair line. These incisions accommodate the instruments needed to perform the surgery. They may or may not have a suture. They will be covered with small strips of adhesive. These strips may be removed two or three days following surgery. You may have drainage from these incisions for a day or two. It will be watery and pink-tinged. If needed, you may reinforce your dressings or change them if they become saturated. In most cases, this drainage lasts less than 48 hours. You may go without dressings 48 hours after surgery if you so desire. You may want to cover your incisions with a light dressing to protect your clothes or to prevent your clothing from rubbing on your incisions. If you have had a microlaparoscopy no sutures will be used and bandaids can be removed the next morning. Diet You may be given specific instructions regarding diet prior to leaving the hospital. In general, you must consume only clear liquids (juices, Jello, or both) until you pass gas from you rectum or have a bowel movement. At this time, you may begin to advance your diet. Eat light, easily digested food for a few days. In the event that you have not passed gas the morning after surgery AND have no nausea, you may try something light to eat, such as a piece of toast. If you are able to tolerate this, you may then begin advancing your diet very slowly. If you do experience nausea at this time, please call the office and speak either with the physician or with the nurse. Activity Expect to feel sore and "washed out" for a few days following surgery. Remember to get up and move about, even through you may not want to. Increase your activity gradually during this time. For a week or two after surgery expect to tire easily even after the slightest effort of work or exercise. Do not engage in strenuous activity until after your first post-op visit at our office. If you plan to travel, please check with your physician prior to surgery if possible. If an emergency arises and you must travel during the first week of surgery, please notify our office before you leave. The pain pills do what they are supposed to do, which is mask your pain. Therefore, you may feel a false sense of wellness due to the pain pills, so even though you feel fine the next day or two, be aware that your body is still recovering and take it easy. Eat and drink carefully. The last thing you will want to do following this type of surgery is choke or cough. Sneezing, laughing, crying and shivering from the cold may also be uncomfortable. So snuggle up and treat yourself well. Gas Pains You may experience some gas pains from residual carbon dioxide that may remain in your abdomen following the procedure. This pain usually presents as shoulder pain or sharp pain underneath your diaphragm. The pain is usually transient and will disappear in a day or two. It helps if you get up and move around while you are having this pain, and also if you drink either hot water or hot tea with fresh lemon. Heat, massage and exercise can also help to alleviate this pain. Infection Take your temperature every morning for one week. Please notify our office if your temperature is above 101 degrees. If you note increasing redness, swelling, pain or unusual drainage from your incisions, please call our office. If you experience frequent urination, burning with urination, or spasmodic pain in the lower abdomen above the pubic bone, you may have a bladder infection. Please notify our office if you have any of these symptoms. Sexual Activity Sexual activity may be resumed approximately two to three days following surgery unless you are told otherwise. However, if you have any pain, vaginal bleeding, or discharge, please do not resume sexual intercourse until these symptoms have subsided.

Mark Perloe, M.D. Microlaparoscopy is the newest minimally invasive surgical technique that revolutionizes diagnostic laparoscopy. Just as rapid advances in electronics have shrunk computers to a fraction of their original size, similar advances in surgical instrumentation have offer new opportunities to diagnose and treat surgical disease. While a standard laparoscope is about 10-12mm in size, (slightly less than 1/2 inch) recently developed microlaparoscopes are less than 3mm (slightly more than 1/10th of an inch). While previously small incisions were made inside the belly-button, now, certain surgical procedures can be performed with only a needle stick. I can place small scissors, graspers, biopsy instruments or a laser fiber through one or two additional 3mm needles. This enables me to perform diagnostic laparoscopy or simple surgical procedures using a local anesthetic and sedation through an intravenous catheter. This means much less incisional pain after your surgery. It also means less anesthetic, no sore throat, and less nausea. In many cases you may be able to resume all normal activities in just a few hours. Frequently, laparoscopy is used to insure that the fallopian tubes are normal and there are no factors contributing to infertility. Unfortunately, sometimes I will find a problem that cannot be corrected with microlaparoscopy. If you have significant adhesions, endometriosis or other abnormalities, you will receive a general anesthetic and the operation is completed using standard laparoscopic techniques. Pain mapping is another useful microlaparoscopic technique. If you are suffering from chronic pain and previous surgical procedures have not localized the cause, a microlaparoscopic procedure may provide the answer. A microlaparoscopic diagnostic procedure is performed while you are sedated, but still awake. I will use a probe to gently touch various structures such as the uterosacral ligaments, the ovaries, tubes, uterus, bladder or an adhesion to see it that area duplicates your pain. If the source of your pain is located, surgery may be more effective at providing relief. Microlaparoscopy is in its infancy. Its' primary uses are for diagnostic surgery. But, as new instruments become available our capabilities will increase. I am very excited to offer my patients microlaparoscopy and truly believe this technique will simplify and reduce the cost of diagnosing of the cause of pelvic pain and infertility.

Frequently found in women between the ages 30-45, fibroids are the most common type of abnormal pelvic growth in women. They account for about one quarter of all hysterectomies performed in the United States each year. Types and Symptoms Fibroids develop from cells in the wall of the uterus. Tumors that grow within the uterine wall rarely produce symptoms if they are small. Fibroids can also grow beneath the uterine lining. As they expand, they can stretch the endometrium, causing heavy menstrual bleeding and severe pain as the uterus tries to expel the mass. Even small fibroids in this location may cause these symptoms. Some fibroids grow beneath the outside covering of the uterus, or appear to be attached by a stemlike structure to the uterus. All these tumors can grow much larger than the uterus itself. Large uterine fibroids can cause pain, constipation, frequency of urination and increased menstrual pain and irregularity. These tumors also can obstruct the fallopian tubes or block implantation of the fertilized egg. If conception does take place, the tumors can cause a miscarriage or premature labor. Rarely, a tumor can block the vagina, forcing a caesarean section. The cause of uterine fibroids is unknown, but evidence suggests that their growth is tied to estrogen. When a woman is pregnant or takes certain birth control pills, both of which increase estrogen levels, the normally slow growth rate of the fibroid often accelerates. Treatment Alternatives Fibroid tumors that cause no symptoms can be left untreated as long as they are monitored closely. However, large uterine fibroids usually require treatment. Hysteroscopy Submucus leiomyomas bulging into the uterine cavity can be removed with a simple outpatient procedure where a telescope is placed into the uterine cavity and the tumor is cut out. Myomectomy To preserve fertility, physicians often elect to perform a myomectomy, or surgical removal of the tumors only, which leaves the uterus in place. A woman who becomes pregnant after a myomectomy may require a caesarean delivery to prevent rupture of the uterus at the myomectomy site. Hysterectomy Hysterectomy, the only real "cure" for fibroids, is the surgical removal of the entire uterus. Hysterectomies are recommended for women with very severe fibroids, and for those who do not intend to become pregnant. GnRH Agonist Therapy Because growth of uterine fibroids is tied to estrogen production, the tumors often stop growing or even shrink after menopause. To create a similar effect in women without rendering them sterile, some physicians have been successfully using GnRH agonists; synthetic forms (analogs) of the naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH agonists prescribed before surgery offer these advantages: reduces blood loss during surgery, and may eliminate the need for blood transfusions. Mechanism of Action Natural GnRH acts on the pituitary gland in the brain. It stimulates the secretion and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones then trigger the ovary to secrete estrogen and progesterone. Ovarian hormones must be produced for ovulation to take place and for uterine fibroids to grow. However, with continued administration of a GnRH agonist, production of these hormones decreases to menopausal or castrate levels. Lupron� (leuprolide acetate) Injection and Lupron Depot� (leuprolide acetate for depot suspension), manufactured by TAP Pharmaceuticals, are being prescribed by many physicians. As a result, uterine fibroids shrink, providing relief of the symptoms. Maximum shrinakage occurs after three months of treatment. Leuprolide acetate may be used alone or in conjunction with surgery, depending on the patient and the extent of her fibroids. For the perimenopausal woman, a menopause induced by a GnRH agonist may provide the bridge to the natural state. For the woman of childbearing age, GnRH agonists can often shrink fibroid tumors enough to eliminate the need for a hysterectomy, thereby preserving fertility, when the fibroids alone are removed. Alternatively, their use may allow a simpler laparoscopic hysterectomy, thereby avoiding abdominal surgery. Dosage Although Lupron can be administered daily as a subcutaneous injection, more commonly patients receive a once-a-month injection of Lurpon Depot. Side Effects GnRH agonists�side effects are common to menopause. These effects may include hot flashes, mood swings, headaches and vaginal dryness, and are reversible upon cessation of treatment. Patients may experience bone loss during prolonged medically induced menopause. Studies have shown bone loss to be reversible after treatment stops, and may be prevented by use of calcium supplements. Allergic reactions may occur in some women. Although generally appearing as a localized reaction at the injection site, any type of welt, itching, or redness should be reported to the doctor. Animal studies showe no evidence of cancer. Women should use barrier contraception during the entire course of GnRH agonist therapy. Lupron is not indicated for women who are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant while using the drug. Why Should I Consider This Therapy? GnRH agonists offer a way of altering reproductive hormones to treat conditions that are hormone dependent. Therefor they lessen many of the symptoms of uterine fibroids. A growing body of scientific evidence is showing that Lupron can safely and effectively treat a number of women's reproductive disorders.

Blockage where the tubes connect to the uterus. This may be due to adhesions, spasm of the opening from the uterus to the tube (tubal osteum) or dryed up dead cells and mucus. The first probably can't be helped. We often see it with a condition called SIN (salpingitis isthmica nodusum) seen after sever pelvic infection. Spasm means the tubes are not really blocked but they show up that way. It's the dried up stuff blocking the tube that makes a difference. Selective hysterosapingography, or proximal tubal cannulization may open the tubes avoiding surgery. Recannulization is usually painless. It can be performed in Xray with Xanax, Toradol and local block or during a hysterosocpy procedure in the operating room if you also need laparoscopy. First a 5.5 french 2 mm catheter is steered into the corner (cornua) of the uterus. An attempt is made to pass dye (selective hsg) if this is ok, you probably had spasm. Your tubes were never really blocked. That is one of the weaknesses of regular HSG. If you are scared or in pain, the tubes go into spasm and appear blocked even if they are not. If they are still not open, I will pass a 1 mm catheter into the tube. Then I pass a .018mm guide wire into the fallopian tube. This dislodges the debris. The other catheters are then passed over the wire. Sometimes I will use a balloon catheter to dilate the tubes. Once the catheter is into the tubes, the selective HSG is repeated. If the end of the tube is ok, your chances of conceiving may be pretty good. About 85-90% of women will have at least one tube opened. 60% will remain open at 6 months if rechecked. 30-40% will conceive. If one tube is already open and the ends of the tube look ok, recannulization is not likely to improve the chances of pregnancy. AGAIN, if one side is perfectly normal, you are not likely to benefit from this procedure. Risks include: perforating the tube. The wire is so narrow, this is rarely a problem. Pain should not be as bad as regular HSG. Infection and allergy are risks similar to HSG. This page, and all contents, are Copyright (C) 1995 by Mark PerloeM.D., P.C.

C. Elizabeth Carney, P.O. Box 829, Great River, NY 11739 Fourteen years ago I gave birth to a baby girl. Four hours later she died because of an internal malformation that was undetectable during my pregnancy. During my short hospital stay, nurses and doctors seemed to avoid me and my questions. What they did say was about the same as what my friends and family were saying. "You're young. You'll have other babies. Try to forget." I didn't want any other baby; I wanted that one! Forget? How could I forget? Instead I was overwhelmed with crushing, breathtaking grief. I remember how empty I felt the day I left the hospital...an empty womb and empty arms. I never really knew her but I missed her and ached for her so desperately. Soon after I returned home, everyone acted as if they had already forgotten her, as if they expected me to also. Someone had removed all the baby items I had acquired before coming home, hoping to spare me the pain. Instead, it felt like a further denial of her existence. When I tried to talk about her everyone became very quiet, or changed the subject, or left the room. Friends were very careful not to say anything that might remind me of my experience. Baby shower invitations didn't come in the mail. Birth announcements didn't come in the mail. Many stayed away because they simply did not know what to say. My husband had three days to "get over it" before he was expected back at work. The world kept on spinning as if nothing had happened. I remember thinking that I must have lost my mind. I thought that if my baby had lived for a while, if people had gotten to know and love her, maybe then I would have been given the affirmation to grieve the way I needed to. But I was the only one with any memory of her, the only one who had the chance to love her. I had no one to share that with, not even my husband. Most of his grief was for me and for the dreams we had shared for this child. I felt all alone as I began my mourning. Over the years, after much healing, I have had the opportunity to speak with other parents who have had experiences which were similar to mine. As a result of that, and also as a result of my search for answers to all those unanswered questions, I have compiled a list of several "truths and non-truths" concerning the grieving process as it relates to perinatal bereavement. This is not intended to be the absolute word on the subject, but rather a gauge for the unexpected emotions felt by parents who have suffered this type of loss. Most of the parents I have spoken to agreed that the uncertainty of their grief was frightening and may have been alleviated had they known what to expect. Friends and family may also benefit from reading this over so they might understand the special kinds of pain and emotions involved in this type of loss and allow them to be expressed. "THE TRUTH IS..." The truth ISN'T that you will feel "all better" in a couple of days, or weeks, or even months. The truth IS that the days will be filled with an unending ache and the nights will feel one million sad years long for a while. Healing is attained only after the slow necessary progression through the stages of grief and mourning. The truth isn't that a new pregnancy will help you forget. The truth is that, while thoughts of a new pregnancy soon may provide hope, a lost infant deserves to be mourned just as you would have with anyone you loved. Grieving takes a lot of energy and can be both emotionally and physically draining. This could have an impact upon your health during another pregnancy. While the decision to try again is a very individualized one, being pregnant while still actively grieving is very difficult. The truth isn't that pills or alcohol will dull the pain. The truth is that they will merely postpone the reality you must eventually face in order to begin healing. However, if Your doctor feels that medication is necessary to help maintain your health, use it intelligently and according to his/her instructions. The truth isn't that once this is over your life will be the same. The truth is that your upside-down world will slowly settle down, hopefully leaving you a more sensitive, compassionate person, better prepared to handle the hard times that everyone must deal with sooner or later. When you consider that you have just experienced one of the worst things that can happen to a family, as you heal you will become aware of how strong you are. The truth isn't that grieving is morbid, or a sign of weakness or mental instability. The truth is that grieving is work that must be done. Now is the appropriate time. Allow yourself the time. Feel it, flow with it. Try not to fight it too often. It will get easier if you expect that it is variable, that some days are better than others. Be patient with yourself. There are no short cuts to healing. The active grieving will be over when all the work is done. The truth isn't that grief is all-consuming. The truth is that in the midst of the most agonizing time of your life, there will be laughter. Don't feel guilty. Laugh if you want to. Just as you must allow yourself the time to grieve, you must also allow yourself the time to laugh.Viewing laughter as part of the healing process, just as overwhelming sadness is now, will make the pain more bearable. The truth isn't that one person can bear this alone. The truth is that while only you can make the choices necessary to return to the mainstream of life a healed person, others in your life are also grieving and are feeling very helpless. As unfair as it may seem, the burden of remaining in contact with family and friends often falls on you. They are afraid to "butt in," or they may be fearful of saying or doing the wrong thing. This makes them feel even more helpless. They need to be told honestly what they can do to help. They don't need to be told, "I'm doing fine" when you're really NOT doing fine. By allowing others to share in your pain and assist you with your needs, you will be comforted and they will feel less helpless. The truth isn't that God must be punishing you for something. The truth is that sometimes these things just happen. They have happened to many people before you, and they will happen to many people after you. This was not an act of any God; it was an act of Nature. It isn't fair to blame God, or yourself, or anyone else. Try to understand that it is human nature to look for a place to put the blame, especially when there are so few answers to the question, "Why?" Sometimes there are answers. Most times there are not. Believing that you are being punished will only get in the way of your healing. The truth isn't that you will be unable to make any choices or decisions during this time. The truth is that while major decisions, such as moving or changing jobs, are better off being postponed for now, life goes on. It will be difficult, but decisions dealing with the death of your baby (seeing and naming the baby, arranging and/or attending a religious ritual, taking care of the nursery items you have acquired) are all choices you can make for yourself. Well-meaning people will try to shelter you from the pain of this. However, many of us who have suffered similar losses agree that these first decisions are very important. They help to make the loss real. Our brains filter out much of the pain early on as a way to protect us. Very soon after that, we find ourselves reliving the events over and over, trying to remember everything. This is another way that we acknowledge the loss. Until the loss is real, grieving cannot begin. Being involved at this early time will be a painful experience, but it will help you deal with your grief better as you progress by providing comforting memories of having performed loving, caring acts for your baby. The truth isn't that you will be delighted to hear that a friend or other loved one has just given birth to a healthy baby. The truth is that you may find it very difficult to be around mothers with young babies. You may be hurt, or angry, or jealous. You may wonder why you couldn't have had that joy. You may be resentful, or refuse to see friends with new babies. You may even secretly wish that the same thing would happen to someone else. You want someone to understand how it feels. You may also feel very ashamed that you could wish such things on people you love or care about, or think that you must be a dreadful person. You aren't. You're human, and even the most loving people can react this way when they are actively grieving. If the situations were reversed, your friends would be feeling and thinking the same things you are. Forgive yourself. It's OK. These feelings will eventually go away. The truth isn't that all marriages survive this difficult time. The truth is that sometimes you might blame one another, resent one another, or dislike being with one another. If you find this happening, get help. There are self-help groups available or grief counselors who can help. Don't ignore it or tuck it away assuming it will get better. It won't. Actively grieving people cannot help one another. It is unrealistic, like having two people who were blinded at the same time teach each other Braille. Talking it out with others may help. It might even save your marriage. The truth isn't that eventually you will accept the loss of your baby and forget all about this awful time. The truth is that acceptance is a word reserved for the understanding you come to when you've successfully grieved the loss of a parent, or a grandparent, or a beloved older relative. When you lose a child, your whole future has been affected, not your past. No one can really accept that. But there is resolution in the form of healing and learning how to cope. You will survive. Many of us who have gone through this type of grief are afraid we might forget about our babies once we begin to heal. This won't happen. You will always remember your precious baby because successful grieving carves a place in your heart where he or she will live forever. A Mother's Prayer/ Affirmation After Miscarriage In this time of loss I call upon my spirit within to guide me to my strength so that I may find peace and completion. I will use this strength to demand of myself and others my need to grieve completely, for this will be my first stepto healing. During my time of grief I will seek guidance not only from my inner spirit but from loving persons who may offer wisdomand comfort. I need to understand that the soul as well as the physical body needs healing and to pay attentio to this. I will learn to accept that the soul may never heal completely. I will learn to live not in fear and once again see beauty in my world and purpose in my existence. In spite of my new knowledge that things happen that cannot be controlled, I must call upon the places within me that tell me I do have control over much of my life and use this control to aid my healing. Let me recognize the gift in my ability to conceive and carry life however briefly. Let me take joy in my ability to love so deeply and desire to nurture a soul unbeknownst to me. Let me find healing in the belief that this oul knew my love for it and that that love helped it to pass to another place. Let me honor this short life not only with my love but infinding meaning in its existence. Let me recognize this meaning in not only my ability to survive, but in my fullest appreciation of all the moments motherhood will bring me, along with my deeper compassion and sisterhood to other women who've experienced loss. Let a part of this soul be reflected in the spirit of my future children, born or adopted, so that I may know it through them. I will listen to and trust the place in my deepest heart that tells me I will once again be reunited with this soul and will fulfill the need to hold it in my arms. I will help myself to feel comfort in the knowledge that there is a star in heaven that belongs to me. by Stacey Dinner-Levin WT01-B10-36IA090-000968-B018-211http://ivf.com:80/ilist.html 206.185.60.251 19970123212114 text/html 985HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 23 Jan 1997 21:22:54 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 815Last-modified: Tue, 04 Jul 1995 20:14:12 GMT Infertility Listserve Infertility Support Group Mailing List How to sign up Title: Infertility Support Group Mailing List Description: Discussion of infertility with emphasis on support.

It is used to treat infertile women who have an ovulation problem. It works by helping your pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain) improve the stimulation of developing follicles (eggs) in the ovaries. Clomiphene may not help a woman become more fertile if she is already ovulating normally. For that reason, clomiphene is most often prescribed to those patients who have been found to have an abnormality with their cycle. Clomiphene is usually prescribed for five days each cycle, usually beginning on day three and continuing through day seven. The usual initial dose is one tablet daily. The number of tablets can be increased to as many as four daily if a lesser dosage does not result in ovulation, but rarely are more than two tablets required. Clomiphene only works for the cycle in which it is taken. Clomiphene should be repeated each cycle until pregnancy occurs, or your doctor discontinues it. Of all women treated with clomiphene 60% to 80% will ovulate normally. However, only half of those patients who ovulate will become pregnant. It is not known why only half of the women who apparently ovulate with clomiphene therapy become pregnant. It is suspected that factors other than inadequate ovulation may be contributing to the fertility problem. Therefore, if you are not pregnant after three or four cycles, additional testing such as a post-coital test, endometrial biopsy or hysterosalpingogram may be necessary. If tests reveal normal ovulation, a total of four to six cycles of clomiphene therapy is recommended. Some 10% to 20% of women taking clomiphene will experience side effects. By far, most of these are minor and temporary in nature. They include such things as hot flashes, blurred vision, nausea, bloating sensation, and headache. Serious side effects are rarely seen with clomiphene therapy. There are two side effects associated with clomiphene therapy that warrant specific discussion. The first is the possibility of multiple pregnancy. The frequency of twins occurring in women who conceive while taking clomiphene has been reported to be as high as 10%. Triplets may occur as frequently as 1 in 400 births, and quadruplets in 1 in 800 births. Clomiphene is not the "fertility drug" you may have heard in the news bulletins often associated with large numbers of infants, such as quintuplets. Newer studies suggest that long-term use of clomiphene for more than 12 cycles may place you at an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Clomiphene has also been associated with the occasional development of ovarian cysts. These cysts are not true growths of the ovary and within a few weeks will resolve without treatment. However, on an extremely rare occasion, these cysts have been known to cause internal bleeding or twist, requiring surgery and removal of the involved ovary. I must again emphasize, however, that such a complication is extremely rare. Clomiphene stimulated cycles are not unlike normal cycles in that there is only a 20-25% chance of conception occurring each cycle, even if the medication is working properly. This means that at least four to six cycles of treatment are necessary before one has given clomiphene an adequate trial. Recent studies indicate that if a pregnancy occurs as a result of the clomiphene treatment, there is no clinically significant increased risk of miscarriage or congenital birth defects when compared to other infertile couples who conceived without clomiphene treatment. CLOMIPHENE PROTOCOL at ARHC At the onset of menstrual flow, before day three, you need to be seen for a "clomiphene check". A clomiphene check will be required each month prior to prescribing the medication. The clomiphene check allows us to review your previous treatment cycle and a pelvic exam or ultrasound ensures that the clomiphene has not stimulated the development of an enlarged ovarian cyst. If your exam is normal and the clomiphene is working properly, it will again be prescribed to start on day three of your cycle. If either you or your physician feel that you might be pregnant, do not take clomiphene as there may be a possibility of increased risk of congenital defects. IF YOU THINK YOU MAY BE PREGNANT, DO NOT TAKE CLOMIPHENE. NOTIFY YOUR PHYSICIAN! You will begin by taking a single clomiphene 50mg tablet daily from the third through the seventh day. Two or three days later I will do a bloodtest to check both LH and FSH levels. If the LH is three times the FSH level, then you most likely have sever polycystic ovarian disease and clomiphene is unlikely to work for you. On cycle day 11 or 12 you will begin daily urine testing to detect an LH surge, the signal that ovulation will occur within 24-36 hours. When the surge occurs on the 11th or 12th cycle day, an ultrasound is done to confirm that you have developed a normal follicle and that the uterine lining is ready. If you do not have a surge by the 16-18th cycle day an ultrasound is done to check for follicular development and measure the thickness of the uterine lining. If things are ready (follicle>19mm and endometrium>7mm) an hCG injection is given to trigger release of egg(s). If things are almost ready, you can continue checking your urine and give hCG in 1-2 days. If follicular development is good but the uterine lining has not yet developed, an estrogen level will be checked. If follicular development is poor, the cycle will be canceled and next month a larger dose will be administered. More than half the clomiphene pregnancies occur during the first three cycles and more than 3/4 occur at the 50mg. dose. Rarely, will pregnancy occur when more than 100mg/day (two tablets) are necessary. If you have not conceived after three cycles, intrauterine insemination will be recommended to improve your chances of conceiving. If you have not conceived after four to six cycles, either combined clomiphene/metrodin/insemination or Pergonal/Humegon/Metrodin/Insemination will be recommended.

You will need to schedule an appointmentfor a baseline ultrasound sometime between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30a.m. You may schedule your ultrasound appointment for cycle day1, 2, or 3. (weekdays only) Cycle Day 2: No appointment or treatment necessary. Cycle Day 3: A brief office visit to have an ultrasoundis required (if not performed on CD1 or CD2). Injections starton the eve of CD3 and usually continue for 5 to 12 days. Thenumber of injections and dosage of medication you receive willdepend upon your individual response. The injection should begiven at approximately the same time every evening. (4-8 p.m.) Cycle Day 4-6: Daily injections to be taken as ordered. Cycle Day 7: You will have an ultrasound between 7:30 and8:30 a.m. Depending on the results of the ultrasound, we maydraw your first estradiol (blood) level. Ultrasound examinationsand estradiol levels will be repeated every one to two days untilthe follicle(s) have developed enough so that HCG may be given. HCG is an injection taken once in the afternoon or evening. Be sure to take this injection promptly at the designated time.This visit may be delayed in subsequent cycles if we can predictwhen your follicles may be ready. HCG + 18 Hrs: If indicated, an insemination will be scheduledfor approximately 7:30 a.m. Your husband will be asked to providea specimen. Processing varies and may take 30-60 minutes. Insome cases a single insemination is performed 36 hours after HCGinjection. HCG + 42 Hrs: The insemination may be repeated. HCG + 1-14 Days: Progesterone vaginal suppositories, oralprogesterone or additional hCG injections may be ordered. HCG + 5-7 Days: You may have a follow-up ultrasound andserum progesterone to confirm ovulation. Pregnancy Test: You can perform a urine hCG test at hometen days after your final hCG injection or 12 days after the lastinsemination whichever is later. NOTE: If your period starts on Friday, you must come inthat day for an ultrasound. If you start on Saturday,you must come in Monday (Day 3).

Even though your FSH was high, were youstill making eggs that fertilized? I've heard of that being the case.It's quite possible that this RE is concerned with his success rates,although an RE at another clinic also told me that in women over 40they prefer the FSH to be single digits to be for the cycle to have areasonable chance of success. But perhaps this RE was also concernedabout his stats. I was also told that since my periods are still regular and by allsigns apparently still ovulate that I probably did not have an elevatedFSH, so maybe I just assumed that double digits meant the decline ofovarian function. I'm still interested to hear what others' experience has been withtheir clinic's preferred day 3 FSH levels. Is it more that your chancesof getting pregnant in a given cycle are just a little less likely ifthe FSH is more than 10, or that it's a complete waste of time? BB wrote: There's an interesting article called "Prognostic assessment of ovarianreserve" in the January 1995 issue of the Journal "Fertility andSterility" (available at medical libraries, among other places).The study talks about basal FSH on day 3 as well as something calledthe "Clomid challenge test". The article says that "elevated basal day 3 FSH concentrations arehighly predictive of diminished ovarian reserve as defined by poorgonadotropins responsiveness and pregnancy rates in patientsundergoing complex ovulation induction or one of the assistedreproductive technologies." A study using the clomiphene challenge test is described in the articleThe clomiphene challenge test was used to evaluate 51 infertile women > 35years old. All 51 patients had normal basal FSH concentrations but 18had elevated values after clomiphene was adminstered (100 mg on days 5through 9). Those 18 were categorized as having diminished ovarianreserve. Of those 18 only 1 (6%) conceived although 14 of 33 (42%) ofthe adequate reserve group became pregnant. The article talks about the importance of having valid ways to assessthe measured values: "the threshold values for a normal and abnormaltest should be based on clinically defined endpoints." "For thosecenters that do not have a large clinical volume or who would like toapply these screening tests without waiting the required time toaccumulate all the follow-up data, comparison of their assay systemwith those from one of the centers where the original research wasdone is indicated." In the summary it says that "all women > 30 should be screened because thethe rise in incidence of diminished ovarian reserve begins at approximatelythat time." As I interpret the article, the idea is that if you have poor ovarianreserve (i.e. no good eggs left) then you are wasting your time doinganything but donor eggs. I would like to add that the editor of the journal had an articlewhich directly followed this article questioning some of what waswritten in the article. "However, neither baseline values of FSH northe clomid stimulation test provies 100% prognostic reliability." "Theuse of the Clomid challenge test to study ovarian reserve is notprecise enough to merit total reliance on the results". Another question pertains to the significance of alternating values. Some women will have an elevated value one month and the succeeding month's value will be normal. I suspect that the clomiphene challenge test would be helpful for these women. While my personal experience has been that with our FSH assay those with elevated FSH values over 10 or those with elevated Day 3 Estradiol have not been successful with IVF or ovulation induction. Dr. Check has written that treatment with high dose oral estrogen prior to initiating superovulation and IUI may temporarily restore fertility. However, the take-home-baby rate is very low and donor oocytes should be considered.

The purpose of this drug is to induce ovulation. Description GnRH is administered either subcutaneously (a small needleinserted into the abdomen) or intravenously (a small needle insertedinto a vein in the arm). The needle is attached to a long plastictubing which attaches to a syringe inserted in a pump. Multipledoses of the drug are injected by use of a battery-powered infusionpump. The pump is set to administer a set dosage of GnRH every90 minutes. The pump will make a small noise when each dose isgiven. The pump is worn during the entire period of drug administration.This period of time usually begins on day 3 of your menstrualcycle and ends at the time you ovulate. Procedure 1. You will need an ultrasound appointment on the day of pumpinsertion (the third day of your menstrual cycle). This is necessaryto check that your ovaries are normal size. This appointment ismade by calling Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre at 265-3662.All pump appointments are scheduled between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m. 2. At this appointment, the doctor will begin the GnRH therapyby inserting the needle and setting the proper dosage of GnRHfor you. 3. You will have to return to our office to have the pump refilled.This is usually 7 days. During these visits, the doctor will checkthe needle site to make sure it is working properly and that thereare no signs of infection. You will need to return more frequentlyto have the needle changed if there is any redness or sorenesssurrounding the site. 4. Beginning approximately Day 10 of your cycle, you will needto be scheduled for ultrasounds during your visits. This is doneto monitor the growth of your follicle and to determine the timeof ovulation. You may also have a blood test for estradiol - ahormone in your blood that rises as ovulation time nears. We willschedule repeat ultrasound examinations and estradiol levels willbe tested depending upon how rapidly your follicle is growingand how high your estradiol levels are. 5. When it has been determined by an LH surge and ultrasound thatyou have ovulated, the pump will be discontinued. You will returnto the office every three to four days for injections of a drugcalled hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) which is given to maintainproper hormone levels to support a pregnancy. If you do not ovulatespontaneously, we may give you an injection of hCG to induce ovulation.This is done when you have a follicle that is large enough toovulate (about 20 mm. in diameter). CARE OF THE PUMP 1. The pump is an expensive piece of equipment and must betreated carefully. 2. Pumps can be carried in your pocket or worn strapped to thewaist with a narrow belt. If you strap it to your waist, you areless likely to forget that it is there and you are less likelyto drop it accidentally. 3. During sleep, the pump can be set on a bedside stand or strappedto the bed with a belt. Do not forget to take it with you if youget up during the night! 4. We do not recommend tub baths, swimming or other water sportswhile the pump is in, especially if the needle is insertedin the abdomen. If you do not have a shower, keep the water levelin the tub below the injection sight or sponge bathe at the sink.When showering, the pump can be hung from the shower rod or showerhead encased in a plastic bag. Otherwise, you can place it ona stool outside the shower curtain. The important thing is tokeep the pump dry at all times. 5. The plastic tubing attached to the pump will be securely tapeddown at the time the pump is started. This tubing will not collapseif pressure is applied to it. Be careful around pets and children,however, because the tubing can come apart. 6. Check the needle site every day, looking for bleeding, redness,soreness, or drainage. If any of these symptoms appear, make anappointment for a pump check by calling the office at 265-3662.

Almost Free Pergonal Is there really a pergonal Shortage? or Almost Free Pergonal It's difficult enough going through ovulation induction cycles. The time, money, and sore buttocks. You would think that at the exorbitant prices being charged in the U.S., these drugs would be available without any problem. Karen shares information about purchasing Pergonal from a foreign country. Humegon and Metrodin may also be available at similar savings. One of my patients recently traveled to Paris and saved enough on Pergonal purchases to pay airfare for she and her husband. And they say taking a vacation doesn't help you get pregnant! Yes, Pergonal is difficult to get in this country and over-priced. Because of the difficulty in obtaining it, you are legally allowed to search for it in other countries. My clinic encourages obtaining Pergonal in Mexico where a perscription is not necessary. I live near Tijuana and can send you addresses ofpharmacies there. There are whole blocks of streets in Tijuana that have pharmacies selling Pergonal. I bought it for $13.00 per 75 iu amp. It was storedin a refrigerator and all the expiration dates were good. It is also possible tomail order from Mexico. That address often appears on alt.infertility. I have recently bought Pergonal from France and was also pleased with the pharmacy I used. British and American Pharmacy (phone) 47 42 49 40, fax 42 65 2942 1, rue Auber Place de l'Opra 75009 Paris. Fax your prescription and credit card number first, then follow up with a phone call to Rachel who speaks English. I paid $10.60 am amp and about a $60 mail and insurance fee. The package arrived within 2 days. If you need more info, feel free to contact me. Karen S-Los Angeles Karen@EQL12.Caltech.edu Debbie from Paris writes: I highly doubt that the British and American Pharmacy here in Paris could be selling generic Pergonal and Metrodin, but I'd be interested in seeing the Email you received about it. If there is anything to this accusation, I would want to alert the French authorities. Legislation is extremely strict concerning medication in France. It is also very beneficial to the big pharmaceutical companies -- all drugs are sold directly in their pharmaceutical company packaging (the pharmacist does not get to chose or mix anything), and generic drugs are basically non-existant here (the doctor has to specify the brand-name of the medicine he prescribes, and the pharmacist is not allowed to substitute an equivalent). Furthermore, Sereno Labs (makers of Pergonal and Metrodin) has a big and active presence here in France (they are a family-owned Italian company, for those of you who didn't know it). They constitute a very strong lobby with pharmacists, doctors and politicians. By the way, prices of these drugs are lower in France simply because the government sets the final price (fixing wholesale drug prices and retail drug prices), and therfore decides on the margin which the drug companies, the middlemen and the pharmacist will make on a given item. Pharmacies are only free to set over-the-counter prices (and the products which fall into this category are much more limited than in the US). Finally, you should note that Pergonal is called "Neopergonal" here, and that Metrodin is spelled "Metrodine". Maybe this difference is what made someone think it was a "fake". Also, and most importantly, the Metrodin currently available in the US is no longer on the market here. It has been replaced by "Metrodine HP", where HP stands for highly purified. This new drug is bio-equivalent to the old Metrodine, but has been better purified to remove unwanted proteins. It is currently in the process of getting its FDA approval, and should be on the US market before the end of the year (or so a Sereno rep told me this summer).

Normal Pregnancy Rates The chance of conception in any given month among fertile couples attempting to conceive is approximately 20%. Clinical studies of couples having unexplained infertility of mild endometriosis, however, have indicated that the chance of achieving a pregnancy in any given month (referred to as "fecundity") is severely reduced compared to normal couples. Only 2-5% of these couples conceive each month. The appropriatness of any therapy for these patients must be decided only after that therapy has been shown to increase the monthly fecundity rate beyond the 2-5% noted in couples receiving no therapy. II. Early Developments and History In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) was originally devised as an alternative treatment for women with irreparable or .absent fallopian tubes. It's success, however, has lead to the application of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) to treat fertility problems other than tubal abnormalities, (endometriosis, unexplained infertility, cervical factors and even male infertility). Further studies indicated that IVF is generally as effective for treatment of these "nontubal" problems as it is for tubal disorders. The notable exception was male infertility. The rational for IVF in women with blocked fallopian tubes is easy to understand. Fertilization outside the body and placement of early pre-embryos directly into the uterus bypasses the blokced fallopian tube. The application of IVF in patients with disorders other than tubal problems is not as easily understood. Physicians began to notice pregnancies in patients who had received Pergonal, but for various reasons did not complete their IVF cycle. This lead investigators to suspect that many IVF successes in patients with normal fallopian tubes might be due to factors other than fertilization outside the body. Perhaps these pregnancies were due to other aspects of the IVF treatment protocol, such as the release of more eggs as a result of Pergonal stimulation. Since the initial publications in 1985 there have been a number of clinical studies that have confirmed a significantly improved pregnancy rate with Pergonal stimulated superovulation. This improvement in fecundity (monthly pregnancy rate) was noted in couples having: cervical factors, luteal phase defects, mild endometriosis or infertility of unknown etiology and who have failed the usual therapeutic approaches. III. Explanation of Procedure "Fertility drugs" usually Serophene (comiphene), Pergonal, Humegon or Metrodin (potent and widely used drugs to induce ovulation) are administered beginning on the second or third cycle day and given for six to nine consecutive days. While serophene is taken orally, the others are administered by intramuscular injection in the buttocks. Response to these drugs is monitored by frequent vaginal ultrasounds and blood estrogen determinations. At a time in the cycle when the ovarian follicles reach a designated size, and estrogen levels are appropriate, an injection of the hormone HCG is given to trigger ovulation. Ovulation usually occurs 36-48 hours after the HCG injection. Thus, intercourse or insemination should be timed accordingly. For some patients, a combination or Serophene and Metrodin provides an easier, less costly alternative. Serophene is administered as one or two tablets orally for five days from the third through the seventh day. Metrodin is then administered for three to six days at one ampule per day. A followup ultrasound on about the tenth cycle day predicts how many more days of injections will be necessary. Urinary LH monitoring will insure that you don't ovulate too early. This protocol minimizes drug dosages, ultrasound examinations and blood tests. It may cost half as much as a regular Pergonal/insemination cycle. Not all women have a satisfactory response from the ovary. In that event, future cycles will use only injectable medications. Performing intrauterine insemination may result in an increase in the number of sperm at the site of fertilization in the fallopian tube. Generally only 1 of 2000 sperm ejaculated into the vagina make can later be found in the fallopian tube. Therefore, adding insemination to Pergonal stimulated cycles may further improve the pregnancy rate. Although there is no "proof" that adding intrauterine insemination to Pergonal induced superovulation definitely improves the chance of pregnancy, most scientific reports suggest an increased pregnancy rate associated with the addition of intrauterine insemination. One of these reports demonstrated a 26% pregnancy rate per cycle with intrauterine insemination and superovulation versus 6% with superovulation alone. At this point, we recommend adding intrauterine insemination to superovulation, based on the results of these studies. The additional cost and risk of insemination are minor. In order to perform the intrauterine insemination (I.U.I) the man produces the sperm specimen by masturbation. The sperm are concentrated and "washed" by a centrifugation technique. The specially prepared and concentrated sperm are then instilled directly into the uterus through the cervix with a small plastic tube. The specimen can be obtained at home using a special condom and sperm nutrient media. Care must be taken to insure that the specimen does not get chilled or overheat prior to processing. If the specimen is obtained in the office, about 45 minutes to one hour will be required for processing. The insemination procedure is usually no more painful than a pap smear. After this minor office procedure the patient remains lying flat for ten minutes and then can resume all normal activities. Some patients bring candles and music to make the occasion special! IV. Results Several reports in the fertility literature discuss the results of superovulation and intrauterine insemination. The fecundity (the odds of getting pregnant each treatment cycle), in most cases equaled or exceeded the success reported with in vitro fertilization and G.I.F.T. For couples with normal fallopian tubes and sperm, the chance of becoming pregnant in a treatment cycle was consistently between 10-20%. If the same couple was treated for three or four cycles, they had a cumulative pregnancy rate of between 30% and 50%. These results were also noted in the recent evaluation at the University of Minnesota. Figure 1. The diamond line represents the 5% fecundity expected in couples receiving no therapy at all. The boxed line represent the fecundity expected in normally fertile couples. The triangle line demonstrates the pregnancy rate found in patient's treated with superovulation and I.U.I.Another key issue is that the monthly cycle fecundity is the same for the first four to six treatment cycles. Thus the chance of conceiving during any of the first four cycles is identical and a couple should not become discouraged if they do not become pregnant in the first few treatment cycles. Unfortunately, it also appears that after approximately four to six cycles of treatment, the chance of obtaining a pregnancy with further superovulation treatment falls off dramatically. This has lead most infertility clinics to recommend no more than a four cycle trial of this therapy. V. Potential Risks. The major risk of superovulation is directly related to the use of these potent ovulation inducing drugs. Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon induced superovulation has been shown to have an increased multiple pregnancy rate. Approximately 20% have twins, 2-3% are triplets and 1% or less have 4 or more. Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon stimulated cycles may have a slightly higher than normal incidence of miscarriage. The incidence of premature delivery will also be higher if a multiple pregnancy in conceived. Some studies have indicated an increased frequency of tubal pregnancies in patients undergoing superovulation with Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon. This is probably the result of the multiple eggs ovulated during a treatment cycle. Early pregnancy monitoring is suggested to determine the number of pregnancies conceived as well as ruling out a tubal pregnancy. A tubal pregnancy usually requires surgery for its removal. Another possible side effect of Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon administration is ovarian hyperstimulation. This condition results from enlarged tender ovaries often beginning approximately one week after ovulation. Mild ovarian hyperstimulation is common, rarely causes difficulty, and is self limited. In severe ovarian hyperstimulation the ovaries become very large and painful. The woman may have swelling from retaining excessive amounts of body fluid in the tissues. Fluid may leak from the vessels into the abdomen and chest resulting in serious fluid and electrolyte imbalance and potentially significant complications. Fortunately, severe hyperstimulation is rare, occurring in only about one percent of treatment cycles. If pregnancy and ovarian rupture do not occur, the syndrome resolves in approximately one week. Should the patient become pregnant, the syndrome may last for several weeks. This problem rarely occurs if the ovulatory dose of HCG is withheld. The major reason for the lower incidence of severe hyperstimulation is the close monitoring with frequent blood estrogen determinations and ultrasounds during the critical part of the treatment. If a patient is judged to be at high risk for hyperstimulation, the Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon is stopped and the HCG injection withheld. Unfortunately, however, even close monitoring cannot completely eliminate the risk of hyperstimulation. Recent studies have suggested that patients having taken clomiphene for 12 cycles or more may be at greater risk for developing ovarian cancer.If intrauterine insemination is used as part of the treatment protocol, it has its own risks different from those of Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon. Two potential risks of intrauterine insemination have been identified. The cervix and its mucus are a natural barrier to infection. In the process of intrauterine insemination, this natural barrier is bypassed by placing the sperm into the uterine cavity. If the sperm or cervical mucus are infected with bacteria, an infection could be introduced into the uterus and, subsequently, the fallopian tubes. An infection in the uterus or fallopian tubes is potentially serious and could result in irreparable tubal blockage and subsequent sterility. A recent study in California of approximately 100 patients undergoing intrauterine insemination found a 5% risk of pelvic infection following intrauterine insemination. Our own experience has indicated an even smaller risk than 5%. Even though the chance of a damaging infection is small, its potential consequences may be serious. A rare, but potentially severe side effect of intrauterine insemination is a sudden allergic reaction to the sperm similar to the dramatic allergic reaction that some people experience to bee stings, certain foods, or medications. This type of allergic reaction can be severe and even result in death. Fortunately, this potential severe reaction is extremely rare. Uterine cramping, either during or following insemination, is common and does not denote either an allergic reaction or an infection. The development of fever, pelvic tenderness, or abdominal pain within the first week following an intrauterine insemination may be the signs of an early infection and should be reported immediately. VI. Cost Benefit Analysis. As with any medical treatment, attention needs to be paid to the relative costs and benefits of treatment. The expected benefit of superovulation and I.U.I. is a normal pregnancy. The value of a biological pregnancy can only be determined by each couple. The cost can be broken down into four categories: Financial cost. A combined Serophene/Metrodin/IUI cycle will cost approximately $1200. A single cycle of Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon induced superovulation combined with intrauterine insemination usually costs between $2,000 and $3,000. Your health insurance may cover all, part, or none of the expense. Time cost. While Serophene/Metrodin/IUI usually involves only three or four office visits, Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon superovulation is more involved and may take up to ten office visits to complete a cycle. Because of the specialized ultrasound monitoring and need for frequent blood estrogen determinations, these appointments must grouped between 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. each morning. Once a treatment cycle has begun, daily drug administration and monitoring are necessary until ovulation occurs. Every attempt will be made to expedite your appointment and minimize the amount of time spent in the office. Physical Health Risk. As previously discussed, there are risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, multiple births and their potential complications, risks associated with insemination and potential increased risk of ovarian cancer.. Emotional Cost. There is often a significant amount of stress associated with the prolonged treatment of Pergonal/Metrodin/Humegon ovulation induction. Even couples who have noted only minimal stress associated with their infertility treatment often note a significant decline in their coping skills when undergoing this type of therapy. VII. Summary. Unfortunately, a number of couples have infertility of unknown etiology, or have failed to conceive following the standard therapies for endometriosis, cervical factor, and ovulatory dysfunction. Superovulation with or without insemination offers a pregnancy rate approximately equal to that of in vitro fertilization of G.I.F.T. Because this alternative is less expensive and less stressful, it is reasonable to offer superovulation to couples with these problems before attempting either in vitro fertilization of G.I.F.T.

Normal endometrial development depends upon secretion of the hormone progesterone by the corpus luteum (collapsed egg follicle) and the action of progesterone upon the uterine lining. As progesterone production rises after an LH-surge and ovulation the endometrial biopsy is best performed 11 or 12 days following a urinary LH-surge. This is detected by daily testing with a urinary ovulation predictor kit. To perform the biopsy, a thin, flexible catheter is passed into the uterus and a small fragment of tissue is removed. Since the catheter is a foreign body being placed in the uterus, some heavy cramping is usually experienced during this procedure. The procedure generally takes less than a minute to perform. Some of the cramping may be avoided by taking one or two Aleve or Advil tablets about one hour prior to the biopsy. In addition, prior to the procedure, an injection into the cervix with a local anesthetic minimizes discomfort. After the tissue is obtained, it is sent to the pathologist for examination to determine if the endometrium is adequately developed. Since this procedure is performed late in the menstrual cycle, the possibility of pregnancy exists. Studies have reported that endometrial biopsy may increase the chance of miscarriage by about 1%. At Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre we recommend a pregnancy test prior to the procedure in order to minimize this risk. Although these tests are very sensitive, in about 3% of women tested they may not indicate pregnancy this soon after ovulation. If a couple wishes to be certain to avoid the possibility of pregnancy during a biopsy cycle, we recommend abstaining or using barrier contraception during this month. Following the biopsy, spotting and cramping occur often. Both should lessen as time passes. If cramping remains severe or increases, or if your temperature rises higher than 100.0º F, please notify Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre at (404) 265-3662. The onset of your next menses should be reported. This is necessary to interpret your biopsy results. Occasionally, it is difficult to determine when spotting from the biopsy ends and menses begin. If you are unsure, please call and speak with a nurse. If an abnormality is found, treatment with ovulation induction medications or progesterone suppositories may be instituted. If medications are prescribed, it may be necessary to repeat the biopsy during a treatment cycle to ensure correction of the problem.

Our own practical experienceconfirms this, since we have seen patients improve when they switch fromvaginal to rectal use. In addition, most of the physicians we work withspecify rectal use, and in those cases where it is not specified, we alwaysrecommend rectal use. In terms of the diarrhea, that is typically related to the suppository basematerial that is chosen by the pharmacy doing the compounding. Mostpharmacies are forced to use a PEG (polyethylene glycol) base, because itmelts at a slightly higher temperature. Since most pharmacies do not have the capability to seal the suppositories in a leakproof plastic shell, the higher melting point gives them a bit more leeway in dispensing the suppositories in warm weather. However, the PEG base is much, much harsher, and almost universally causes diarrhea, gas, cramping, bloating etc. The other base that is available is called a fatty acid base (FA), and although it melts at a lower temperature, it is much less problematic for the patient. It is a specially fractionated fatty acid derivative, and does not cause any of the reactions that are typical for the PEG base. However, unless one has the capability to make and seal the finished suppository in a plastic shell, you cannot compound with the FA base, since it melts easily in warm weather. We use only the FA base unless the physician specifically requests a PEG base, and this has eliminated the diarrhea problems for almost all of our patients who use suppositories. In addition, the use of a sealed plastic shell is cleaner and more hygienic, since the suppository itself is never handled by the pharmacist, and it remains sealed until the patient opens the shell at the time of use. Regardless of where your patients get their suppositories, you might want to consider specifying a fatty acid base on the prescription itself in order to minimize problems from rectal suppository use. If your patients typically get their suppositories from a single local pharmacy, you might want to check with the pharmacist there and verify what base they are using. If you would like us to work with your patients, you can be assured that we only use the fatty acid base (unless directed otherwise), and that we form and seal our suppositories in individual, sealed, plastic shells. If you need anything else, just let me know.

A woman has approximately a 1.8% risk of developing ovarian cancer in her lifetime. This can be compared to a 12% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. A small number of ovarian cancers arise in the setting of �familial ovarian cancer syndrome�. However, most ovarian cancers occur without a significant tendency. There are three main theories on what causes ovarian cancer: Repeated ovulations, disruption the ovarian surface, and leading to malignant transformation. Persistent stimulation of the ovary by pituitary hormones, LH and FSH, may have a direct carcinogenic effect, or may act through the increased concentration of estrogen caused by the ovarian stimulation. Processing of chemical carcinogens in the local ovarian environment. It has been known for some time that pregnancy, breast feeding, use of oral contraceptives (birth control pills), and early menopause decrease the risk of developing the most common forms of ovarian cancer. Thus, it appears that any phenomenon that decreases ovarian activity may have a beneficial effect in reducing a woman�s lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. This has lead to the concern that the opposite situation, i.e. increased ovarian activity may increase the lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. One example is that several studies have indicated that women who are infertile and do not become pregnant may have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Is there a link between the use of ovulation induction drugs and ovarian cancer? In recent years, a multitude of studies have been published, attempting to find an association between the risk of ovarian cancer and environment factors, hereditary factors, and reproductive history. However, conclusive studies are scarce for a number of reasons. All examined associations appear to be weak, and the etiology of ovarian cancer appears to be multifactorial. This requires a large number of patients to reach any firm conclusion, and, based on the small number of ovariancancers in the general popuylation, it is difficult to find enough cases to demonstrate that a certain factor increases the risk of developing cancer. Ovulation induction medications fall into two groups: The first type of medication is clomiphene citrate (Clomid and Serophene). This medication stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete the hormones LH and FSH, which in turn stimulate the ovaries. It is not a natural compound, and is a relative of tamoxifen and DES. The second group of ovulation inducing medications are naturally occurring compounds that are normally found in the body. These include the human menopausal gonadotropins (Pergonal and Metrodin) and GnRH (Factrel and LutrePulse). Like clomiphene, GnRH stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete the hormones LH and FSH, which in turn stimulate the ovaries. Human menopausal gonadotropins, on the other hand, directly stimulate the ovary without going through the intermediary step of the pituitary gland. A possible association between ovulation inducing agents and an increased risk of ovarian cancer has been suggested by the following findings: The theoretical possibility previously discussed, which would suggest that any medication that would increase ovarian activity could result in an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Isolated case reports of individual women who have taken ovulation inducing medications and were found to have developed ovarian cancer. Retrospective case controlled studies. These studies analyzed a group of women who are known to have already developed ovarian cancer. It was noted that more of these women had taken �fertility medications� than would have been expected when compared to a �control group� of women who had not taken these medications. Individual case reports only demonstrate that a patient was known to have certain separate findings: In other words, that an individual person who at sometime in their life has taken a particular medication such as ovulation inducing medications was subsequently noted to have developed cancer of the ovary. The only value of these case reports are to alert medical researchers of a possible association so that proper studies can be initiated to address this question. The case reports in themselves have absolutely no value in proving any type of �cause and effect� relationship between the medication and the subsequent development of a cancer. The most well known case report of this type was when comedian Gilda Radner who had undergone Pergonal treatment and IVF, later died of ovarian cancer. More reliable information concerning the possible association between ovulation inducing medications and an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer has been suggested in two recently published retrospective case controlled studies.In December of 1992, Whittmore and colleagues published a summary of a number of case controlled studies in the literature looking for an association between several factors and an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. When infertile women who had taken any form of �fertility drugs� were compared to women who had never taken these medications, it was found that they had a 2.7 times increased relative risk of developing ovarian cancer. In other words, women who had taken the medication had a 3 to 4% risk of developing ovarian cancer compared to a 1 to 2% risk in women who had never taken the medications. It was also noted that women who took the medications, and became pregnant, did not have an increased risk of cancer. This study has been criticized by a number of experts for many shortcomings. No attempt was made to determine: why the patients had taken the medications, the type and dose of medication that was taken, and the length of time the medication was taken. The study was also based on a small number of patients. Their conclusions were based on comparing 20 patients who had taken any form of �fertility medication� and developed ovarian cancer vs. 11 control patients who had not. Although there were many legitimate criticisms about the validity of this study, it certainly raised the possibility that the use of any type of �fertility medication� might be associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, and thus sported the theoretical concerns and the original case reports.about the validity of this study, it certainly raised the possiblility that the use of any type of �fertility medication� might be associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, and thus spported the theoretical concerns and the original case reports. More recently, a second retrospective case cohort study by Rossing, et al, has appeared in our literature supporting the possible association between an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer and the use of ovulation inducing medications. In this study, the authors randomly selected a group of women who had attended an infertility clinic in the Seattle area. They then analyzed this group, comparing a number of factors to the risk of developing ovarian cancer. They noted that women who had used clomiphene citrate (Clomid, Serophene) were 3.1 times more likely to have developed ovarian cancer than women with no history of exposure to this drug. This suggested a lifetime risk of approximately 4 to 5% among exposed women. The increased risk associated with clomiphene was most evident among those women who had used the drug for more than 12 cycles. In fact, there was no significant increased risk noted in women who had taken clomiphene for less than 12 months, or who had taken Pergonal, Metrodin or HCG. Summary and Recommendations Because of theoretical concerns and two recent limited case controlled studies, there appears to be a concern of a possible increased risk of developing ovarian cancer in women exposed to ovulation inducing medications. These studies suggest the risk may be greatest in exposed women who do not become pregnant, and in those women who utilized clomiphene citrate for greater than 12 months. It must be emphasized that this data is preliminary and these conclusions are tentative. At the present, uncertainty makes it difficult to balance the risks and benefits of medications that enhance fertility. To address this problem, it is useful to put into perspective the likely magnitude of the risk of ovarian cancer associated with such treatment. If ovulation induction medications induce ovarian cancer, the risk appears to be about 2 to 3 times that of the general population. Ovarian cancer is an uncommon disease. The lifetime risk of a U.S. woman is approximately 1.0 to 1.8%. These estimates suggest the lifetime risk of at most approximately 4 to 5% among women who have taken ovulation inducing medications. This figure should be compared with a 12% lifetime risk of breast cancer for the average U.S. woman. It is our recommendation that all women who are considering the use of ovulation inducing medications should be appraised of possible adverse effects of taking these medications. In addition, it seems prudent to minimize exposure to these medications by carefully considering the reasons for their usage and not continuing the medication for any longer period of time than one can expect to obtain benefit from them. It is for this reason each couple and their physician must consider the appropriateness of the use of ovulation inducing medication, in their individual situation. Once a decision has been made to utilize a given medication, limited lengths of therapy will be decided upon, at which time you will again meet in consultation with your physician to reevaluate the appropriateness of its continued use. Typically patients will not be treated for more than 4 to 6 cycles without a follow-up consultation with the physician and a complete case review. In addition, prior to initiating ovulation inducing medications, other fertility investigations such as semen analysis and testing for tubal patency will be suggested to lessen the likelihood that other factors may be limiting the success of the ovulation therapy. Also, patients will be monitored monthly with urinary LH testing or transvaginal ultrasound assure the maximum effect from the medication while limiting your risks and costs. We feel that the continued prudent use of these medications is warranted in well selected patients who are monitored carefully and well informed. At present, experts are unsure whether special long-term follow-up should be recommended for women who have taken ovulation induction medications. Certainly routine yearly pelvic exams and immediate investigation of any persistent ovarian abnormalities are appropriate. In addition, all future healthcare providers should be informed of your history as additional recommendations may be forthcoming. If you have any questions about your treatment of any information concerning the use of your medications, please make an appointment with your physician. John W.

This operation involves surgical removal of the uterus. Many of the women who have this operation do so because of heavy or prolonged periods. An alternative Endometrial ablation offers an effective alternative to hysterectomy for patients suffering from heavy or prolonged bleeding during their period. It is often chosen when other medical treatments have failed or are otherwise undesirable. This procedure involves the removal of the lining of the uterus, which is the source of the bleeding. According to recent studies, most women feel that endometrial ablation relieves the problem with their period. Up to 90% of women who have this procedure are satisfied with the results. After the procedure, the women who were satisfied with it reported lighter periods or normal periods. Some women said that their periods stopped completely after endometrial ablation. Tests Your physician will take your medical history and perform a physical exam to see if endometrial ablation is right for you. Other tests could include some blood tests, uterine lining sampling (biopsy), and hysteroscopy and/or ultrasonography. These procedures are usually done in your physician's office and are quick and relatively painless. Drugs For 1 to 2 months before the procedure you may have to take medication, possibly injections, to decrease the thickness of the endometrium (uterine lining).A GnRH analog may be used for this purpose. Thinning the uterine lining exposes the lower (basal) layer of endometrial cells; this is the tissue your physician will remove with electrosurgery. The day prior to surgery, your physician may choose to place a laminaria to gradually dilate your cervix the night before your surgery. What to expect Endometrial ablation is an outpatient surgical procedure; this means that you will enter the hospital, have surgery, and usually go home the same day. The entire procedure usually takes only 15 to 45 minutes. You will then be taken to the recovery room for rest and observation, and will be allowed to go home when you have fully recovered from the anesthesia. It usually takes an hour or two to recover from anesthesia. The procedure Endometrial ablation is performed during a procedure called operative hysteroscopy. A narrow viewing tube is inserted through the vagina and the cervix into the uterus. A tiny camera attached to the viewing tube (hysteroscope) allows the uterine cavity to be shown on a TV monitor during surgery. Your uterus is filled with a harmless liquid to make the procedure easier. The lining of the uterus is then burned away or vaporized, using a heat generating tool inserted through the viewing tube. Your physician may decide to perform a laparoscopy at the same time to rule out other conditions that could require further therapy. Afterwards Your doctor may advise you to: Avoid strenuous activity for a period of time, usually 24 hours following the procedure. Refrain from sexual intercourse for a specified period, usually 2 weeks or until the discharge stops. Schedule an appointment for about a week after your surgery. In addition, you may experience some of the following: Frequent urination during the first 24 hours; this is normal. A small amount of bloody, watery discharge for up to 6 weeks following the procedure. It is impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of your surgery until at least three months postoperatively. Some cramping, for which your doctor may prescribe or recommend pain medication. Many over the conter medications such as Motrin, Aleve, Advil or Nuprin. The anesthesia may cause mild nausea and vomiting. Rarely, more serious problems such as cardiac arrest (heart stoppage) and pulmonary arrest (no breathing) have been caused by general anesthesia. Rarely, the viewing tube can puncture the uterus and injure the bowel. This seldom happens, but if it does your physician will generally stop the procedure and postpone it until the puncture heals by itself. Another possible risk is fluid overload. If your body absorbs too much of the liquid used to fill up your uterus during the operation, the procedure will be discontinued. It is unlikely that the operating tool will puncture the thick uterine wall, but this is a potential risk. The bowel could also be damaged by heat from this tool. Infections developing from either of these rare complications could require additional surgery. Can I still get pregnant? Probably not. Most women cannot have children after this procedure. Because there is still a slight possibility of pregnancy, however, you should continue to use contraception until you have entered menopause. Or you can ask your physician about other contraceptive measures. Endometrial ablation is a safe, effective alternative to hysterectomy. You may also wish to learn more about another alternative, laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. I hope this information has helped you to better understand endometrial ablation and how it can work for you. If you have any questions that this brochure has not answered, please ask your physician. Some Medical Terms Endometrial Ablation Removing the lining of the womb. Removing the uterine lining will decrease your menstrual flow or even stop it completely. Endometriurn (Uterine Lining) The cells that line the womb. This tissue sheds in response to the hormonal changes of your monthly period. Electrosurgery Instead of a scalpel, a heat-generating electrical device is used to burn-away, removeor vaporize tissue in this type of procedure. GnRH Analog This type of drug acts like a natural hor-mone your body produces. It produces hormonal changes which decrease the thickness of the endometrium. Hysterectomy The surgical removal of the uterus. Hysteroscopy A procedure used to see inside the womb, using a viewing tube inserted into the vagina. Laminaria A laminaria is a small rod shaped pieced of dried seaweed, that when placed in your cervix provides for more gentle dilation of your cervix minimizing the risk of cervical tears. Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH) A simpler form of hysterectomy (LAVH) used the laparoscope to avoid a large abdominal incision. Laparoscopy In this procedure, the physician inserts a viewing tube through the skin to see inside the body. Other tubes can be pushed through the skin to introduce probes or instruments; in this way a number of surgical procedures can be performed without a large surgical mclslon. Ultrasonography A procedure used to "see" inside the body, using high-pitched sound waves. This is a little like radar or sonar. Uterus The womb. Uterine Lining Sampling (Biopsy) In this procedure, a small piece of tissue is removed from the lining of the womb and analyzed in the lab. If further information is needed to help you with the decision, please feel free to ask your physician.

Its greatest benefit is the potential to convert what would have been an abdominal hysterectomy into a vaginal hysterectomy. An abdominal hysterectomy requires both a vaginal incision and a four to six inch long incision in the abdomen, which is associated with greater post-operative discomfort and a longer recovery period than for a vaginal procedure. Another advantage of the LAVH may be the removal of the tubes and ovaries which on occasion may not be easily removed with a vaginal hysterectomy. This does not mean that all hysterectomies could or should be done by LAVH. There are certain conditions that will necessitate abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. In fact a vaginal hysterectomy by itself, if indicated, is less time consuming, less expensive, and can be less dangerous. When LAVH is performed, several small abdominal incisions are made. Through these small incisions slender metal tubes known as �trocars� are inserted. They provide passage for a laparoscope (which is like a tiny telescope) and other microsurgical tools. A camera attached to the laparoscope provides a continuous image that is magnified and projected onto a television screen. It provides the view by which the surgeon operates. The uterus is detached from the ligaments that attach it to other pelvic structures using laparoscopic tools, electro-coagulation or a laser. Adhesions may have to be freed and, if the tubes and ovaries are to be removed, they are detached from their ligaments and blood supply. They then can be removed with the uterus through an incision made in the vagina. Since the incisions are small, the scarring and pain from LAVH is often less than that associated with abdominal hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is the second most frequently performed surgery in the United States. As with any surgical procedure, the decision to undergo a hysterectomy should not be taken lightly. You should discuss this thoroughly with your doctor. The most common medical reasons for performing hysterectomies include uterine fibroids (30 percent of cases), abnormal uterine bleeding (20 percent), endometriosis (20 percent), genital prolapse (15 percent), and chronic pelvic pain (about 10 percent). For most of these conditions, other treatments should first be considered, and hysterectomy should be reserved as a last resort.

Frequently patients remain relatively pain free after major abdominal surgery are able to return home the next morning! During surgery, smaller incisions are made. A local anesthetic is injected into the incision site before surgery. If uterine surgery is to be performed the uterus is also injected with a local anesthetic. Additional local anesthetic is used after closing the incision. Surgical cautery is limited and surgical retractors and operative packs to hold the bowel from the pelvic cavity are avoided if possible. While these techniques are not feasible for every operation, they may be of benefit when appropriately utilized. We are familiar with attempts to reduce medical costs. Staffing levels at most hospitals have been reduced. Unfortunately that means that a nurse will not always be immediately available when you need a pain shot. Luckily, we now have techniques that previously were only employed in the operating room that can now be safely utilized post-operatively and enable you to receive pain medication upon demand! The following types of pain relief are available: 1. Opioid Infusion Analgesia The two most commonly used drugs are morphine and fentanyl. They are given through the drip continuously at a fixed rate for one day. Some patients may develop drowsiness, nausea and vomiting with opioids. This can be used in addition to PCA. 2. Patient-controlled Analgesia (PCA) The patient administers a fixed dose of opioid in the drip by pressing a button whenever she feels the pain. A bleep is heard whenever the button is pressed, indicating a successful administration by the patient. There is no fear of an overdose as the patient presses the button only when she feels the pain. The device insures that an overdose is not administered. 3. Epidural Analgesia An injection of local anaesthetic is given through a catheter placed into the lower back, which temporarily blocks off any feeling of pain from the waist down. An epidural is administered by a trained anaesthesiologist before the start of a surgery. Following the surgery, a steady drip of medication may be used to control pain during the first 24 hours after your surgery. How is an epidural performed? An epidural is performed by a trained anaesthesiologist. An intravenous drip is first inserted into the back of your hand. This enables you to get enough fluids. Then, while you lie on your side, a needle is inserted into your lower back, into the epidural space. It is important to remain still at this stage as a headache may occur if the needle is inserted deeper than desired. However, this rarely occurs and it is treatable. A fine plastic tube is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. The needle is removed, while the tube is held in place with a sticky tape. This allows you to move around without discomfort. Slight soreness may occur at the site of the injection but this is usually temporary. The local anaesthetic solution is then given through the tube at intervals or continuously in diluted form for as long as pain relief is required. The effect is felt in 10 to 15 minutes. An opioid may also be given through the tube during surgery to provide pain relief for 12-24 hours after surgery.

Immediately after fertilization, the egg contains two pronuclei. Each contains half the chromosomal material from the one of the genetic parents. A four cell pre-embryo. Each of the cells is called a blastomere. The embryo is surrounded by a protein matrix "shell" called the zona pellucida. On the third day after egg retrieval eight cell pre-embryos can be tranferred to the uterus. On average, 15% of embryos such as this will implant after being transferred. Prior to implantation, the pre-embryo, now at the blastocyst stage, must hatch out of the zona pellucida prior to implantation. ARHC Homepage.

Since then the technology has been further refined and developed by physicians and embryologists, with over 20,000 babies born worldwide. The possibility of a continuing pregnancy being achieved by IVF has improved from practically nil to one chance in 4 to 6 at IVF centers worldwide. The possibility of a pregnancy being achieved for any one patient cannot be predicted, as it depends on many variables - such as age and the reproductive health of both the wife and the husband. Although the chance of success varies from case to case, a thorough evaluation is required to predict the probability of pregnancy in any given situation. IVF Without Surgery - Transvaginal Oocyte Retrieval Due to improvements in ultrasound imaging, surgery is no longer necessary for most In Vitro Fertilization patients. A technique for recovery of eggs from the ovary is described below. It uses a sonographically-guided needle to replace the surgical procedure which previously was used to recover oocytes (eggs). This procedure, which we call Transvaginal Oocyte Retrieval), requires neither hospitalization nor general anesthesia. In order to prepare a proper environment in the woman and to increase the chances of recovering several healthy and mature eggs, the woman will undergo about two weeks of intensive preparation. This will include hormonal therapy with "fertility drugs." Blood tests and ultrasound scans of the ovaries are used to determine the optimal time to retrieve the eggs from the ovary. This optimal time is just before ovulation when the oocytes are almost ready for fertilization. At the proper time, an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia will allow the wife's eggs to be visualized by ultrasound and retrieved from the ovary by placing a needle through the vaginal wall. The mild discomfort that the patient feels has been described as similar to a Pap smear or endometrial biopsy. After a short rest, the wife will be able to go home and resume a normal activities. The fluid from the follicles is examined under the microscope by the embryologist, who locates the eggs and keeps them in the laboratory under physiologic conditions. The embryologist will place the sperm with the eggs when they are ready for fertilization. Usually, the eggs will develop into cleaving pre-embryos, whose cells divide 2 or 3 times to become preimplantation embryos (pre-embryos). They are maintained in laboratory dishes, in a nutrient mixture which acts as a substitute for the environment that would otherwise have been provided by the fallopian tubes. Using a special catheter, the couple's pre-embryos will be passed through the vagina and into the uterus at the time the pre-embryos would normally have reached the uterus (2 tdays after retrieval). After the pre-embryo placement in the uterus, the wife will lie quietly in a bed for about an hour, and then will return home. IVF-ET- Questions and Answers Q: Will the IVF technique damage my ovaries? A: There is no evidence to suggest that either normal laparoscopy or ultrasound egg retrieval damages the ovaries. In fact, some reports in the medical literature suggest that following ovarian biopsy, pregnancies occur in couples with a long-term history of infertility. Q: Will scar tissue around my ovaries make it impossible to retrieve the eggs? A: Not ordinarily. The surgeon must be able to see the follicles in order to guide the needle to the proper spot for retrieval of the eggs whether by sonographic (ultrasound) or surgical methods. Q: What if I ovulate before oocyte (also called egg or ovum) retrieval? A: Once ovulation has occurred it is impossible to retrieve the eggs. The entire team of physician, nurse and embryologist will monitor your cycle very carefully to avoid premature ovulation. Q: If an egg is not retrieved or if the technique does not produce a pregnancy on the first attempt, how soon can the procedure be repeated? A: This depends on the individual. The primary reason for delay is to allow the patient's normal menstrual cycle to resume, which may take 2 to 3 cycles. Q: How many times will IVF be repeated per couple? A: There is no specific number. This is determined by the couple together with the physician. Q: Can we have intercourse during the two-week period before a IVF procedure is performed? A: Most definitely. We recommend that the husband refrain from ejaculation for at least 48 hours, but for no more than 5 to 6 days preceding egg retrieval. This precaution assures that the semen sample obtained for IVF will contain a maximum number of healthy, motile sperm. Q: After the IVF procedure, how long must we wait to have intercourse? A: Although a definite time of abstinence to avoid damage to the pre-embryo has not been determined, most experts recommend abstinence for two to three weeks. Theoretically, the uterine contractions associated with orgasm could interfere with the early stages of implantation. However, intercourse the night before pre-embryo transfer is acceptable. Some physicians will advise intercourse before transfer as they feel that this will improve the chances of a pregnancy. Q: What about other activities? How soon can I resume my normal routine? A: The IVF team recommends that the patient be sedentary for a full 24 hours following pre-embryo placement in the uterus. Strenuous exercises such as jogging, horseback riding, swimming, etc. should be avoided until pregnancy is confirmed. Otherwise, the patient is free to return to her regular activities. Q: How soon will I know if I'm pregnant? A: Pregnancy can be confirmed using blood tests about 13 days after egg aspiration. Pregnancy can be confirmed by ultrasound 30 to 40 days after aspiration. Q: I had my tubes tied ( tubal ligation) several years ago. Would I be a candidate for IVF? A: Perhaps, in certain situations, IVF may be cheaper and physically less demanding than surgery to repair you fallopian tubes. Q Is IVF covered by insurance companies? A: Unless your health insurance policy provides infertility coverage it is unlikely that IVF coverage is provided. Frequently insurance policies will cover infertility but exclude IVF. This has been successfully challenged in the legal system. Consultation with your lawyer may be necessary to review you insurance companies refusal to provide IVF coverage. If, however, IVF is combined with surgical procedures used for diagnosis, insurance carriers may pay for much of the procedure. However, coverage will depend on the terms of your policy. If IVF is performed for infertility alone, most insurance policies will not cover. Q: What drugs are given to stimulate the ovarian follicles and to maintain the lining of the uterus prior to implantation of the pre-embryo? A: Four to five medications normally are given: Leuprolide acetate (Lupron), an injectable drug that blocks secretions of the pituitary gland, thereby optimizing the number of oocytes retrieved; Human menopausal gonadotropin (Pergonal or hMG) or Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Metrodin or FSH), hormones that stimulate ovarian activity, are injected daily for about 6-10 days prior to the procedure; Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that mimics the action of the hormone which naturally induces ovulation, is injected 34 to 36 hours before retrieval and may be used after retrieval to supplement natural progesterone production; Progesterone, a natural hormone that enables the uterus to support pregnancy, may be used as a daily injection after egg retrieval; and Serophene, a pill used to promote egg development. Q: What side effects, if any, can these drugs cause? A: No pronounced side effects have been associated with any of these drugs. However, the patient should inform the physician of ANY allergies she has or of any previous adverse reactions to drugs. Q: Will I have an egg in every follicle? A: It varies from patient to patient . As many as half of the follicles may not contain an egg in some patients. Q: Is there a possibility of multiple births with IVF? A: Yes, when multiple pre-embryos are transferred. 25%. of pregnancies with IVF are twins. (In normal population, the rate is one set of twins per 80 births.) Triplets are seen in approximately 2-3% of pregnancies. Q: Is there an increased chance of birth defects if I become pregnant through IVF? A: There are no known ill effects. Abnormal pre-embryos, even those produced through normal fertilization, do not seem to mature. However, any long-term effects of IVF remain to be determined. Q: How much time does the entire procedure require? A: Approximately three weeks (all as an outpatient). Fertility drugs are administered to stimulate the ovaries. Then during the four to six days prior to ovulation, the patient is monitored by ultrasound as well as by hormone levels. Q: What happens to any extra pre-embryos? A: A maximum of four pre-embryos will be transferred to the uterus for possible implantation. Patients will have several other options regarding the disposition of the remaining pre-embryos. One option is to freeze pre-embryos for your later use. Other options are to donate or simply dispose of them. Excess pre-embryos, if any, belong to you, and you will determine what is to be done.

As you approach each step we recommend that you re-read that particular section and ask any questions at that time. This will prevent you from becoming confused with too many answers at one time. It is important to remember that each patient has their own unique response to the medications they receive and that each ART cycle is different. This means, not only are you unlikely to respond as others do, but you may actually respond differently from one cycle to the next. For this reason, you will find that your treatment and testing differs from those of other patients. Please do not compare your test results and medication plans with others to whom you may speak. Although you may find much in common with other patients here, please keep in mind that IVF/GIFT is a very private matter and that some patients do not feel comfortable discussing this. The schedule you find here is to help guide you through your treatment cycle. Time changes and other adjustments will frequently be made in order to individualize your treatment. Pre-Cycle Counseling We recommend that when your period begins, on the cycle preceding the one you choose to undergo in vitro fertilization/GIFT, that you contact the IVF nurse coordinator at (404) 265-3662 for approval to start. At this time, arrangements will be made to complete any pre-cycle testing, provide you with the necessary prescriptions for medications, complete the appropriate informed consent documents, and review and clarify your financial obligations. Separate consent forms are available for IVF, GIFT, embryo freezingand donor sperm or eggs. All consent forms must be signed by you and your partner, prior to initiating your treatment cycle. You will have an IVF teaching appointment at which time you will meet with both the doctor and nurse to review these documents and have any questions answered. You are to avoid the possibility of pregnancy during this cycle by using barrier contraception. Maximizing Chances For Success Females: Avoid all medications other than Tylenol. If you are taking other prescription medications check with us prior to beginning your treatment cycle. No smoking or alcohol use. No more than two caffeinated beverages per day. Avoid change in diet or weight loss diet during IVF cycle. Refrain from intercourse three to four days prior to egg retrieval and following embryo replacement until pregnancy determination is made. Normal exercise may continue unless enlargement of your ovaries produces discomfort. Avoid hot tubs or saunas. Males: Fever greater than 99o one to two months prior to IVF/GIFT treatment may adversely effect sperm quality. If you are sick, please take your temperature and report any febrile illnesses. Sitting in hot tubs and saunas is not recommended and can permanently effect sperm function. Please refrain from this for at least three months prior to treatment. Drugs, alcohol, and cigarette smoking should be avoided for three months prior to treatment and at all times during the ongoing IVF/GIFT cycle. If you have a history of genital herpes infection, you must report any pre-herpes symptoms, active lesions, or healing herpes lesions. In either the male or the female, each of theses stages will require cessation of the IVF/GIFT treatment . Do not begin any new exercise sport or marathon training within three months of planning IVF or GIFT. If you are a runner, please decrease jogging to a total of less than 20 miles a week. Refrain from wearing tight underwear. Abstain from intercourse for at least three days, but not more than seven days prior to collection of semen for egg collection and during treatment. IVF/GIFT Treatment Treatment begins during the menstrual cycle before your planned treatment with urinary LH testing. When an LH-surge is noted, call the office. You will be asked to report to the office for an ultrasound examination to evaluate the mid-cycle development of the uterine lining and for a trial transfer. This procedure consists of a pelvic examination and placement of a tiny catheter inside the uterus to determine the direction and length of the uterine cavity prior to your treatment cycle. This procedure minimizes trauma to the uterine lining during your actual IVF treatment cycle and may enhance pregnancy rates. You are to avoid the possibility of pregnancy during this cycle by using barrier contraception. Approximately seven days after the surge you will begin therapy with subcutaneous Lupron. This will continue for a period of about ten days, but maybe longer if necessary. You may be asked to return to the office for an estradiol value and ultrasound examination. If these tests are normal, you will initiate therapy with Pergonal, Metrodinor Humegon within several days. The first day of medication will be considered day one of your cycle. All consent forms must be signed and deposits must be paid prior to receiving medication and further instructions. Your treatment may stop at any stage if the medical team feels that successful completion of treatment is unlikely. A credit or refund will be given for services that are not actually performed. Specific instructions regarding drug doses and upcoming appointments will be given. Ovulation Induction The purpose of "super ovulating drugs" is to stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg. Humegon, Pergonal (HMG) and Metrodin (FSH) are given as an injection once or twice a day to recruit multiple eggs. This will require you to make arrangements with someone (husband or friend) to give you your injections. Arrangements should be made prior to initiation of your therapy to teach him/her how to mix the drugs and give the injections. Transvaginal ultrasounds will be performed at the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre usually beginning on treatment day 6. You will be asked to empty your bladder and proceed to the examining room. There, you will undress from the waist down. A vaginal transducer with be inserted into your vagina. This procedure is not uncomfortable. You may experience some vaginal discharge after the procedure as transmission gel is used on the vaginal probe. Ultrasound is a process whereby high frequency sound waves, not radiation, are transmitted through tissue. As the ultrasound waves strike the tissues they project a white image on the ultrasound screen. Follicles are round sacs of fluid within the ovaries. Therefore, the follicles appear as dark circles on the ultrasound screen. Hopefully, each follicle contains an egg. The eggs can not be seen. Sometimes the follicle has no eggs and sometimes the follicle contains more than one egg. The number of follicles, therefore, does not correspond to the number of eggs. We monitor follicular growth and also the number of follicles being produced. Beginning approximately treatment day 6 you will undergo daily blood sampling to determine your estradiol level. This level is used to individualize your medication treatment for that afternoon and the following morning. Estradiol is produced by the lining of the follicle (fluid filled structure where the egg develops). In addition, a progesterone and LH determination may be made if your estradiol level is rising rapidly. If your progesterone level is also rising, administering hCG a day earlier may be advisable. When your physician determines that you are ready for surgery, therefore retrieval, you will be given an injection of hCG, also called Profasi. This injection is given late in the evening approximately 37 hours prior to retrieval. This medication ripens the developing eggs and initiates ovulation. Ovulation occurs about 42 to 48 hours from the time of injection if you do not have an egg-retrieval procedure. Many patients experience abdominal discomfort after the hCG due to ovarian enlargement and are convinced that they are ovulating. Rest assured that we are monitoring you very closely and the chance of ovulating prior to retrieval is extremely slim, and almost zero if you are receiving Lupron. Sexual abstinence too long before retrieval (more than five days), or relations too close to retrieval (24 hours) could possibly decrease the quality of the semen sample. If you did not have sexual relations the day before hCG, we recommend that you do the day of hCG. If your husband has a low sperm count you may need a four to five day period of abstinence. Discuss this with your physician early in your cycle. Immediately following your first ultrasound visit after you have started Pergonal/Metrodin you will be required to undergo a preadmission assessment in the Outpatient Department. Your deposits to Georgia Baptist Medical Center are due at this visit. It is very important for you to be one time in the morning in order for your lab results to be available for physician review early in the afternoon. After review, you will be notified of any change in your medication dosages. It is very important not to quote numbers with other patients. This may cause you unnecessary anxiety. Each person is going to respond differently. We are not looking for specific numbers when we perform ultrasounds and run blood work. We are looking for the relationships between the blood work and the ultrasound findings. Your physician will review your results and you will be the first one to know if there is any problem. Medications Lupron (leuprolide acetate) is an analog of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). When given in this form, it will stimulate the "turning-off" of your pituitary gland. We are able to take advantage of the suppressive actions to improve the recruitment of multiple follicles and prevent premature ovulation. At present, it is available in the U.S. only as a subcutaneous injection, like diabetic insulin injections. Room temperature storage is advised. Be sure not to keep each vial past the expiration date. One vial will provide approximately two weeks of injections. Side effects are short term. Hot flashes may be felt when your estrogen level lowers and will disappear when you begin Pergonal or Metrodin. Occasionally patients experience headaches as well. A consistent time within the same hour each day should be chosen to give the injection. Lupron comes in a kit with alcohol wipes, small syringes, and container. However, the supplies can be carried in your purse and the shot can be conveniently given in a couple of minutes. Lupron Injection Instructions: Wash and dry hands thoroughly. Assemble supplies: two alcohol wipes, one Kleenex, one syringe, medication. At first use, remove and discard plastic cap off the medication. Cleanse the Lupron vial with an alcohol wipe. Remove cap from syringe exposing needle. Insert needle straight and firmly into the rubber center of the vial. Turn the vial upside down. Pull the syringe plunger down filling the medication slightly below the line adding 0.2cc (or 0.1cc if that is your dose) and remove from the vial. Hold the syringe needle up and flick with finger to remove any air bubbles. Hold the syringe and new alcohol wipe in the right hand. Choose injection site rotating sides daily. Grasp skin gently with the left hand. Wipe area then flip wipe under left thumb or finger. Holding the syringe like a dart, briskly insert small needle quickly and entirely into the skin. Smoothly inject all medication and remove syringe covering area with alcohol wipe then Kleenex. When you begin Pergonal or Metrodin, Lupron dosage will usually decrease to half. This amount can be estimated with yellow line syringes. Medication may continue through the day of hCG administration. Humegon, Pergonal (HMG) is a combination of the hormones FSH (follicular stimulating) and LH (luteinizing). Metrodin contains only FSH. They effect the ovaries directly to rescue multiple follicles before normal selection of a single dominant follicle. It is available only by intramuscular injection. Side effects may include abdominal destination/discomfort, bloating sensation, mood swings, fatigue, or restlessness which is relieved in most cases by follicular aspiration. Multiple births may be seen with this medication. The medication comes in ampoules of powder which need to be diluted with water. Several such ampoules or ampoules are combined into just one syringe with a single ampoule or water. Humegon\Metrodin\Pergonal Injection: Wash and dry hands thoroughly. Assemble supplies: one syringe, one 25 gauge needle, one filter needle, two alcohol wipes, one Kleenex, one ampoule of water, and the designated ampoules of medication. Unwrap supplies. Attach syringe to a 19 gauge large filter needle. A filter needle is not necessary for Humegon. Using an alcohol wipe, cover finger and thumb and snap open all glass ampoules. For Humegon, remove the plastic protective caps and wipe the rubber stopper. Insert the needle through the rubber stopper. Remove needle cover and draw 1 to 2cc of water into the syringe then distribute between the powder and ampoules. It dissolves immediately. Fill the syringe with all the medication by inserting the needle as far into the ampoule as possible and at an angle then pulling back the syringe plunger. Stop before it reaches the end of the syringe, even if there is more medication. Pull the syringe straight up and flick firmly with the finger. Change needles to the thinner 25 gauge needle and express a drop of medication. Hold syringe and new alcohol wipe in the right hand. Select injection site, rotating sides for comfort. Grasp your skin gently with the left hand. Standing on the opposite leg relaxes the muscle to be used. Wipe skin with alcohol then slide under left thumb. Hold syringe like a dart, insert needle quickly to 1 1/2" of depth to pass the skin and fat to the muscle. Smoothly inject medication and withdraw the needle swiftly. Slide alcohol wipe over the area then Kleenex. All supplies are discarded in a milk carton or strong containers after single use. You may place all needles in a glass jar and bring them to the office for disposal. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone closely similar in its biologic effect to LH which normally induces ovulation. hCG initiates follicular changes triggering ovulation approximately 42 to 48 hours later. Retrieval must occur before ovulation or the follicles will be empty. hCG is also secreted by the placenta during pregnancy. hCG is available only by intramuscular injection. Room temperature storage is adequate prior to dilution. The powder is diluted just prior to injecting. Side effects similar to those encountered with Pergonal maybe briefly noticed. hCG Injection: Timing of hCG is critical and should be performed within 30 minutes of the designated time. Wash and dry hands thoroughly. Assemble supplies: one syringe, one 22 gauge and one 25 gauge needle, 2 alcohol wipes, one Kleenex, and medication. Remove all wrappings, snap off plastic caps from medication. Attach syringe and needle. Wipe each vial with alcohol wipes. Remove cover from the needle, insert straight and firmly into the center rubber top of the water. Turn the vial upside down. Pull plunger of syringe to fill to 3cc of water then remove. Insert water into the powder and gently roll between hands with needle inside. The powder dissolves rapidly. Holding the vial upside down, slowly lower the needle between the rubber sides to obtain all the medication, then remove the needle. Remove air bubbles from the syringe by firmly flicking with a finger. Change needle to a 25 gauge needle. Choose injection site, as done for Pergonal and grasp skin with the left hand. Hold syringe and alcohol wipe in right hand. Wipe skin and slide alcohol wipe under left thumb. Hold syringe like a dart, inject 1 1/2" and quickly inject medication then withdraw needle briskly. Slide alcohol wipe over the area to clean it. Dispose supplies safely in a strong container. Egg Retrieval You should have nothing to eat or drink in the eight hours prior to your retrieval. Egg retrievals are performed in the Outpatient Center on the ground floor, 285 Boulevard, N.E. Patients undergoing natural cycle IVF will undergo retrieval in the office. This procedure begins in the same fashion as vaginal ultrasound. You will receive small doses of medication given intravenously, which will make you relaxed and sleepy. In addition, a local anesthetic will be used in the vagina. Recovery from these drugs, for most patients, is rapid and generally nausea is minimal. Your vagina will be cleansed to minimize the risk of infection. The vaginal transducer is inserted into your vagina and the eggs are retrieved with a needle inserted through the vaginal wall under the guidance of ultrasound. No abdominal incisions are required. Under special circumstances, your physician may recommend a laparoscopic retrieval. As we do not know the effects of anesthesia on the eggs, we will try to avoid administering anesthetic agents or any other drugs until the last minute. This means you will not have any pre-anesthesia medication. You will go into the operating room fully conscious and will be prepared for surgery before the anesthesia starts. Once asleep, the laparoscope is inserted through a small incision in your belly button. The eggs are again retrieved with a needle that is inserted through the laparoscope directly into the ovary. Also, one or two small incisions may be made in your pubic hair line to place instruments into your abdomen to stabilize your ovary. Patients undergoing the GIFT procedure will require a laparoscopy under general anesthesia for transfer of the sperm and eggs into the fallopian tube. However, in order to limit your exposure to anesthetic medications, a vaginal ultrasound guided egg retrieval may be performed prior to your going to sleep for laparoscopy. Pre-Retrieval Instructions: Report to the Outpatient Center at your assigned time. DO NOT EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING AFTER MIDNIGHT. This also means not to chew gum. When you arrive, tell the clerk that you are an IVF/GIFT retrieval patient, and let her know what time you are posted for surgery. Please make sure to arrive without jewelry, nail polish, make-up, or contact lenses. You may wear your wedding rings. Approximately one-half hour prior to your retrieval an operating room attendant will come for you and take you to the OR preparation area. Please note that usually no preoperative sedatives are administered. While you are in the operating room preparation area, please try to empty your bladder completely. If general anesthesia is planned, the anesthesiologist will confer with you and answer any questions you may have regarding your anesthesia. When all is ready you will be taken into the procedure room and asked to lie on the procedure table. If you do not yet have an intravenous line, one will be started. Shortly after that you will receive medication to make you feel relaxed and drowsy, or you will receive medication to put you to sleep (as discussed earlier under anesthesia). The procedure will last about 25 to 45 minutes. Your husband will provide a semen specimen sometime around the time of your retrieval. If you are undergoing the GIFT procedure the sample must be obtained prior to surgery. If you need special arrangements regarding the semen collection please contact Dr. Pyrzak at 265-3662 at least 24 to 48 hours before retrieval. If you are undergoing retrieval for IVF, your husband will be with you throughout the procedure and your recovery. If you are undergoing general anesthesia for a GIFT procedure, your husband will not be allowed to accompany you. However, following your initial recovery your husband may be with you. The time you will be required to remain for observation will vary between patients. IVF retrieval patients will generally stay approximately 90 minutes while patients undergoing the GIFT procedure will remain for approximately two or three hours. When the nurse feels that your condition is stable, you will be discharged. Patients are not allowed to drive themselves home after retrievals. Following your retrieval, you may eat or drink when you feel well enough. At this point, following either procedure, you should begin taking your antibiotic. Sometimes, when immature eggs are retrieved, male factor fertility is present, or if fertilization does not take place, your husband may be required to provide a second semen sample. This generally will occur the day after retrieval, but may occur later the same day. Arrangements will be made to contact him between 8:00 and 9:30 a.m. the morning following retrieval to see if this is necessary. Post-Retrieval Instructions Following transvaginal ultrasound retrieval you may experience some pelvic area tenderness and feel tired or sleepy from the medications you've received during the procedure. You will also have some light vaginal spotting. This is usually from the vaginal wall where the local anesthetic was injected. This should be scant in amount and may be red to brown in color. If you had a laparoscopy, you will experience an ache in your abdomen and possibly some shoulder discomfort due to the use of carbon dioxide gas during the procedure. Extra-strength Tylenol usually controls the discomfort. Do not take aspirin or anti-inflammatories (Motrin, Anaprox, etc.). You will have a small incision in your navel and one or two small incisions just above your pubic bone. These incisions are covered with band-aids. Please keep the dressings dry. Two days after the surgery, you may remove the band-aids and shower as normal. Antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize the risk of infection following this procedure. An antibiotic will be given immediately after your retrieval, the day after the retrieval, and early in the morning on the day of pre-embryo transfer. Progesterone is a hormone produced by the remains of the ruptured follicle (corpus luteum). Progesterone helps the lining of the uterus become thick and is therefore, essential for the implantation of the pre-embryo. As estrogen levels are higher in stimulated ovarian cycles, it is necessary to administer progesterone supplements to establish a normal estrogen/progesterone ratio. Therefore, HCG or additional progesterone supplements may improve the uterine lining and enhance the possibility of pre-embryo implantation. You will be contacted by the embryologist on the day following your egg retrieval and given the status report on your eggs and sperm. At this time fertilization will be seen in most cases, but embryo replacement can only be confirmed when the fertilized egg divides normally, usually after one additional day. As you know, one of the risks of IVF is lack of fertilization. Sometimes the reason for this is understood that many times no reasons are apparent. If this occurs, monitoring will be discontinued. You will be given an opportunity to meet with your physician and or the embryologist regarding the implications of this finding. You should abstain from sexual intercourse for two weeks after the treatment. You should also abstain from strenuous physical activity during those two weeks. You should not sun bathe for prolonged periods if taking tetracycline, doxycycline, or their derivatives. If you have any questions about a particular activity, please contact your physician. Please contact your doctor if any of the following occur: Fever greater than 100.8o F. Excessive vaginal bleeding. Unusual and increasing pelvic area discomfort. Difficulty with urination or change in bowel activity. Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Sharp or shooting pains. Pain or burning on urination. Abdominal swelling. Unusual back pain. Embryo Replacement On the day of your embryo replacement, report to the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre approximately 10 to 15 minutes prior to your scheduled embryo-transfer time. Husbands are encouraged to be present, however, their presence is not imperative. The embryo replacement will take place in the office. The procedure is similar to a pap smear. A speculum is inserted in to your vagina. Then a catheter and guide is inserted into the cervical canal and the catheter is fed into the uterus. Occasionally you may feel some cramps as the catheter is placed into the uterine cavity. The embryos are then placed into the uterus. The embryologist then expects the catheter under a microscope to make sure that all the pre-embryos were transferred. Embryo transfer is usually a very short procedure. The is generally very little discomfort, if any at all. So RELAX! Following embryo transfer, you will lie flat for a period of one to two hours. Therefore, it is recommended on the day of transfer, that you eat a light breakfast, but limit your fluid intake. This will minimize the discomfort associated with a full bladder. Following recovery, you may get dressed and be driven home. You will NOT be able to drive yourself home. Please relax in bed the rest of the day, getting up only to use the bathroom. Please remember that you are to continue your progesterone until we have the results of your pregnancy test. Following transfer, some patients may pass a small amount bloody fluid or air from the vagina. Please do not worry about this, it does not mean that you are expelling the embryo(s). From the time of transfer until your pregnancy test you can resume most of your regular activities. It is normal to blame yourself for something you may or may not have done during this time if your pregnancy test is negative. Therefore, in general, try not to do anything for which you will blame yourself if you are not pregnant. In general the following guidelines are offered: No tub baths or swimming for 24 hours after replacement. No douching. No tampons. No intercourse until after the first pregnancy test. No jogging, aerobics, tennis, skiing, mountain climbing, etc. (you get the idea). Do not begin any new physical activity. No heavy lifting. You may return to "work" after 24 hours of bed rest (getting up for bathroom and meals only) and one to two days of light activity. Try to keep busy; remaining mentally distracted will help the twelve days pass easier. You may have some vaginal spotting before your pregnancy test. Approximately 50% of our pregnancy patients had spotting prior to pregnancy tests or even afterward. THINK POSITIVE! You must have the blood work drawn even if you think your period has started. Quantitative hCG pregnancy testing will be done. Pregnancy Testing: Quantitative hCG pregnancy testing will be done twelve days after the embryo transfer or fifteen days after GIFT. If, however, this falls on a weekend, in which case a Saturday test would be done on Friday and a Sunday test would be done on Monday. Arrangements will be made to have your blood drawn at ARHC between 7:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. If you live out of town, this may be done at your private physicians office and reported to us. The results will be called to you as soon as possible, usually in the afternoon. Most of the testing reveals either positive or negative results; however, occasionally we see a test that is "weakly positive". If you have a " weekly positive" pregnancy test, this is seen in four situations. Late but normal implantation of the embryo. Discontinuing pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy. Lab error. Further hCG monitoring is extremely important in any of the above situations occur. Two days after an initial positive or weakly positive pregnancy test you will return for a second test. This blood work will enable us to determine if your pregnancy is beginning to progress along the normal course. We look for your hCG level to double every two to three days. If your test is positive, you may choose to continue on oral progesterone three times daily or to switch to a weekly progesterone injection. An ultrasound examination will be performed approximately four weeks after your retrieval. This early ultrasound is critical to evaluate the possibility of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies. An ectopic (tubal) pregnancy can occur in 2�% of IVF or GIFT pregnancies. If diagnosed early, this unfortunate complication may be treated as an outpatient with medication. Once we determine the presence of fetal heart beat, we will refer you back to your obstetrician. If you do not have one we will be happy to make a recommendation. If your pregnancy test is negative you may stop taking progesterone. You will get a period within three to five days, if you have not already started bleeding. This period may be different from your normal period (lighter, heavier, shorter, longer). If you do not get a period within one week, please call and return for blood work. After investing so much time and money for your ART treatment failure to have fertilized eggs or a negative pregnancy test can be an abrupt shock. You may wish to make an appointment to meet with your physician to review your treatment and discuss your feelings with us. All that it may take to achieve your IVF/GIFT success is time and another attempt. Telephone Calls The answering service has been instructed not to page the on call staff after hours and on weekends unless you consider your call an emergency. However, patients who have had surgery that day or the day prior with bleeding, temperature elevation, nausea and vomiting, or difficulty urinating should not hesitate to call and are considered emergencies. Calls regarding the beginning of your period, questions concerning instructions and appointments are not considered emergencies. Calls regarding the scheduling of appointments will not be returned after office hours. Please keep in mind that some days are extremely busy, and most phone calls will be returned as soon as possible. However, some phone calls may not be returned until after hours or the next day. Our office hours are from 7:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. When leaving a phone message please let us know how long you will be available at that number and provide us with a number to reach you later in the day. If your call is emergent in nature, please keep your phone line open for a return call.

You have decided to conquer your infertility. You have come to the right place. The following pages are written to help you understand exactly what will happen during your in vitro cycle. Please remember, everyone experiences their cycle differently. What I am about to describe is a general outline. If your experience differs from what is described, don't worry - everyone is different! You will spend a lot of time in the waiting room with a lot of other women going through the same thing. I am sure, in no time, conversation will arise. We call this waiting room gossip. If your experience differs form what you hear in the waiting room, please don't panic. I can't stress enough - EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT! Of course if you are truly worried, ask a nurse or doctor, not a friend. All procedures and timing are done for a reason. This is not to say you shouldn't keep abreast of your dosage and treatment; just keep in mind everyone responds differently. The purpose of this reading is to hopefully answer questions that may come up. If you have other questions, feel free to ask the appropriate staff member. They will be happy to help. Your cycle begins with day 1, being the first day of your period of the month prior to your planned IVF. On this day, you are to call the office and let them know you are ready to begin. In doing this, you allow the doctors to acquaint themselves with your history. Most women will begin Lupron shots three weeks into the cycle. Lupron is usually given in your belly or thigh. I know it sounds horrible, however, it is probably the least of your worries. You won't feel a thing. After about ten days, you will be asked to come in for blood tests and an ultrasound examination to see if you are ready to begin. In most cases, you will have one tube of blood drawn. I have found that keeping pressure on the area where the blood was drawn from, and holding your arm in a bent position with your elbow elevated alleviates the black and blues. Pergonal (HMG) and Metrodin (FSH) are administered in one shot in your upper buttocks are intramuscularly. This shot is no big deal. Honestly, you will become immune. Many of us give ourselves shots and, in many cases, husbands are giving the shots. If you are interested in learning how, tell one of the nurses and she will be happy to instruct your husband. Basically, your first several days will require morning shots, and afternoon shots. Once you have received your morning injection, you can go about your day. The office lab and ultrasound usually opens around 7:30 AM and so does the office. Please have your blood work done by 9:00 AM. This way, the doctors can have your results back in time to analyze them and decide on your medication for that afternoon. If you are having your afternoon injection administered by an IVF nurse, they like for you to return by 2:30 PM. If you will be doing it yourself, you need to call by 2:30 PM to find out your dosage. They like for you to get your injections around the same time every day. Don't panic is you are off by a few hours. You are probably wondering what types of side effects you may encounter from these drugs. Well, remember everyone is different. Many people have complained of headaches, drowsiness and short term weight gain. If your headache is persistent, you are allowed to take Tylenol and only Tylenol. Evidently, this has proven not to affect the other drugs. Drowsiness, well, if possible try to take an afternoon nap. Remember, you are probably up and out much earlier than you are accustomed. Weight gain, unfortunately this just kinda happens. Again, everyone is different. If you happen to be one of the ones it happens to, don't fret, you can lose it. Anyway, who cares, especially if you get a baby out of it. Your response to the drugs determine when you will start ultrasounds. The nurse will tell you when you call or come in for your afternoon shot, whether you need an ultrasound the next morning. For the doctors to see your follicles on an ultrasound machine, which is done transvaginally. You do not need a full bladder. On the screen, the doctor will locate your ovaries. In your ovaries, he is looking for follicles. Follicles house the eggs. There is no way to determine the status of the eggs until after retrieval. All they can do at this point is see follicles. They will measure the follicles on the screen. This will be done daily until they reach a certain size. When they are big enough and your estrogen levels are high enough, retrieval will be scheduled. Before you are actually scheduled for surgery, a decision needs to be made. Should you have intravenous sedation or an epidural block? When the doctors seem satisfied that you are ready for retrieval, they will schedule for your HCG shot. Timing is essential. The doctors want to retrieve your eggs just before they release on their own (Ovulation). This HCG shot will be scheduled based on the time you are scheduled for surgery. You will need your HCG shot 37 hours prior to surgery. This could end up being at midnight. On the morning of your retrieval, you don;t get to have breakfast. You will be asked to arrive approximately 1 hour prior to retrieval unless additional sperm processing will be required. A Unit nurse will come down and talk to you and tell you what to expect. You will be asked to change into a hospital gown. You will be asked to empty your bladder and proceed to the room for retrieval. You may not recognize you doctor because he is in scrubs from head to toe. At this point, climb up onto the table and the rest is history. I can't describe to you what happens next, because I don't remember too much. The IV sedation made me pretty drowsy. I remember hearing the doctor report when an egg was retrieved. But, I lost count. I was surprised that it didn't really hurt as much as I expected. What I can tell you is that the follicles are aspirated and, if there are eggs present, they are removed and are immediately put into incubation. While you are in the recovery room, your husband will be asked to provide a specimen. This specimen will be washed and the good sperm will be united with your good eggs for hopefully fertilization. Don't be alarmed if your husband is asked to return the next day to provide another specimen. In many cases, your eggs could be immature at the time they were retrieved. Overnight they can mature and a fresh sample is needed for fertilization. You will be instructed to start taking progesterone shots. This is done to help your uterus house the baby should you become pregnant. You will be given the choice of taking progesterone shots or suppositories - the choice is yours. Two or three days after retrieval, you will return to the office for embryo transfer. At this time, he will tell you how many embryos he is transferring. It's pretty much like a pap smear. First, a speculum is inserted then a catheter with a syringe on the end. Seconds later, the syringe is emptied into the catheter. You may feel slight cramping but nothing serious. Then you may be asked to lie on your belly for about an hour before going home. Don't worry, the eggs will not expel themselves. You can then eat lunch and stay in bed for a few more hours once you get home. Take it easy when you go home. About 12 days after the retrieval, you will be given a pregnancy test. You may be surprised, but as early as 10-12 days blood samples will show if you are pregnant. Your HCG needs to be over 5 to be pregnant, although over 20 is a more stable pregnancy result. All your levels should be higher than usual. Probably one of the most important points to convey in this reading is that should you become pregnant, of course be happy. However, it is essential that you put it in prospective and realize that it is very early in the pregnancy and the next few weeks are crucial. For all of us, hearing that we are pregnant will be the most wonderful news. Remember, as easily as they told you that you are pregnant, it can be as easy to tell you that you aren't any more. This is not intended to scare you, but merely to help you understand the waiting is not yet over - it has just begun. A note of advice is to keep the happy news between yourself and your very immediate family. This will save you numerous phone calls should you miscarry, thus allowing you to get over the pain and get psyched to start in vitro again. Be prepared to stay with the program. It works. Believe me, if there is no chance for you, The doctors will not let you go through it. For those of you who do not get pregnant - hang in there. It will happen. Remember, your mind can work against you. Think POSITIVE! For those of you who get pregnant, spread the word of this miracle. To all - GOOD LUCK!

We understand that the sperm used in these procedures and referred to in this consent form will be obtainedfrom (Circle appropriate source) The husband An anonymous donor A known donor If we have requested donor semen (semen from another person) to be used to fertilize the egg(s), myhusband and I will each sign a separate document to indicate our decision and acceptance of thatoption, and we will also indicate our decision for donor semen by initialinghere:______________________ (initials of husband and wife) If donor sperm is selected (Circle appropriate choice) Use only donor sperm. Divide the eggs between donor sperm and husbands sperm. ___%donor; ___% husband(selection of which sperm sample used for each egg will be at the discretion of the embryologist.) If in the embryologist's opinion, the husband's sperm specimen is not likely to result in fertilization,use donor sperm. If no fertilization on first day using the husband's sperm, reinseminate with donor sperm. PURPOSE OF PROCEDURES The purpose of this procedure is to provide a means for us to achieve pregnancy when conventional therapyhas failed or is unacceptable. Surgical and/or medical therapy has been tried with adequate periods of follow-up for pregnancy to occur after thorough evaluation of coital, male, cervical, ovulatory, ovarian, uterine, tubaland peritoneal factors. REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATION We understand that the following are requirements for participation in this procedure and we represent that wemeet each of the requirements. We are legally married. We have a history of infertility from female or male factors or an unknown cause. We acknowledge and agree that our acceptance into the program and our continuing participation is at thediscretion of the staff of the program. Correspondingly, we understand that we can withdraw from the programat any time without affecting the availability of other present or future medical care. We understand that insurance coverage for any or all of the above procedures may not be available. Weacknowledge that we have been made aware of our financial obligations and we have made appropriatefinancial arrangements and understand we are responsible for payments on services performed regardless ofwhether a pregnancy is achieved. We also understand that we are financially responsible for any othermedical costs incurred through Georgia Baptist Medical Center or Paces Cryobank. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES We understand the IVF-ET procedure involves the removal of egg(s) from the wife's ovary(ies) by a needleand the fertilization of those eggs with the husband's/donor's sperm in the laboratory. The fertilized egg(s) willbe cultured in a laboratory environment for approximately two days and then transferred to the wife's uterus. We consent to the following surgical, medical, and/or diagnostic procedures: Pre-IVF screening: Determination by medical history, physical examination, and standard infertility teststhat we are candidates for this procedure; Ovulation Induction: The use of fertility drugs (usually Lupron, Pergonal, Metrodin and human chorionicgonadotropin (HCG)) to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles (eggs) in the ovary; Laboratory tests: Frequent blood samples will be taken from the woman to monitor hormone secretionsfrom the ovary and pituitary gland; Ultrasound: Ultrasonography is a diagnostic procedure using sound waves to provide a picture of theovaries and the follicles to monitor the development of the egg(s); Egg retrieval: Vaginal introduction of a needle into the ovary to obtain one or more eggs. This isperformed with ultrasound guidance. A local anesthetic and pain medication is used to minimizediscomfort. Semen Specimen: Collection of a semen specimen (by masturbation) or the thawing of donor semen andlaboratory treatment of the specimen to prepare it for fertilization; Fertilization: Placing the egg(s) and the sperm together in a suitable medium to allow fertilization; If thereis no evidence of fertilization after 72 hours of incubation, the oocytes (incompletely developed eggs) andsperm will be disposed of in an ethically-acceptable manner. Micromanipulation: A procedure where either a few sperm are injected beneath the outer layer of theegg(s) or directly into the egg(s) to increase the possibility of fertilization. Embryo Culture: Development of the fertilized egg(s) and pre-embryo formation; Embryo transfer: Placement of the embryo(s) into the uterus by means of a small plastic tube insertedthrough the cervix into the uterus; Assisted Hatching: A slit is made in the outer protective layer surrounding the fertilized egg(s) to removefragments and to increase the possibility of implantation; Cryopreservation: If there are more pre-embryos than can be safely transferred, excess pre-embryos canbe cryopreserved, donated, or discarded. Alternatively, the physician and the couple may elect to limit thenumber of follicles aspirated. Luteal Phase Support: During the first two weeks after embryo transfer, additional hormonal support,Progesterone or HCG, may be administered in the form of tablets, injections or suppositories; Pregnancy testing: Following transfer of embryo(s) blood tests may be obtained to insure normal hormonelevels and to detect pregnancy. If pregnancy is confirmed, the wife will proceed with obstetrical carethrough a physician of her choice, upon release from care of the IVF team. MICROMANIPULATION Micromanipulation is used either to enhance fertilization, or alternatively, it may be utilized to increase thechances that the pre-embryo(s) will attach to the uterus. Microfertilization is performed immediately after theoocytes (eggs) are retrieved, or the following day if fertilization is not confirmed. To enhance fertilization, theembryologist will choose between three different types of micromanipulation procedures; PZD involves slicinga hole in the zona pellucida or "shell" of the egg; SZI involves placing 2-4 sperm beneath this outer layer justajacent to the inner egg membrane; ICSI, direct injection of the sperm into the egg. Each of these proceduresmay be chosen based on a number of factors. No one procedure is appropriate for everyone. Therefore, theembryologist will individualize treatment and will decide whether to perform micromanipulation and whichprocedure to use at his discretion. Fertilization rates with micromanipulation may vary between 20% and 50%. There is also no guaranteethat any of the eggs undergoing micromanipulation may fertilize or implant. Repeat IVF with othermodifications may result in similar fertilization rates. Failure of the egg to fertilize and divide may be related tothe stress of micromanipulation, egg injury or fertilization with more than one sperm. There is no way to knowwhich are the best sperm to choose for injection. This may result in the selection of chromosomally abnormalsperm. Early reports have suggested that the incidence of major chromosomal anomalies is increased 2-4times in patients undergoing micromanipulation. Prenatal genetic diagnosis of all resultant pregnancies isstrongly recommended. In addition, the incidence of identical twins may be increased. If the fertilized egg demonstrates increased fragments, micromanipulation and removal of fragments mayenhance attachment to the uterus. In older patients, those with borderline FSH levels, previous IVF failures ora thick outer layer (zona), assisted hatching may be recommended. I understand that these procedures are new and all potential complications resulting from micromanipulationmay not yet be known. I understand that neither Dr. Perloe, Dr. Pyrzak, Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre,Paces Cryobank or Georgia Baptist Medical Center or their designees have warranted the success of thisprocedure or the health of any child developing from such a procedure. I consent to any or all of theprocedures described aboveand indicated below: The necessity of these procedures will be determined by theMD and embryologist during the treatment cycle. Choosing one of these options does not guarantee that anyof them will be performed. (husband & wife signify consent by initialing each procedure and signing below.) ______partial zona dissection ______subzonal insertion ______intracytoplasmic sperm injection ______assisted hatching SUCCESS RATE From the information currently available, we understand that the chances of obtaining a pregnancy by thisprocedures is between 20% and 30%. We have discussed our particular fertility factors and chances forsuccess with our physician. We acknowledge, agree and understand that neither the Atlanta ReproductiveHealth Centre, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, and the IVF programpersonnel and associates have made any promises or warranties regarding the success rate or results of InVitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer or the health and characteristics of any child or children that may beconceived by the procedure. Because IVF-ET is a relatively new procedure, insufficient data are available toexpress an exact success rate. Failure to achieve a pregnancy may result from any of the following or from other reasons: Maturation of the egg(s) may not occur, or the time of egg maturation may be misjudged, may not bepredictable, may occur prior to egg retrieval or may not take place in the monitored cycle. The procedure to obtain all or a number of eggs from the wife's ovary may not be successful. Medical emergencies with other patients may restrict availability of the procedure room or the necessarypersonnel at the appropriate time for obtaining the egg(s). The egg(s) obtained from the wife may not be normal. The husband may be unable to provide a suitable semen specimen, or if used, the donor semenspecimen may not have an adequate number of viable sperm after freezing and thawing. Fertilization of the egg(s) by the sperm may not occur. Egg(s) may not survive the micromanipulation process. Cleavage or cell division of the embryo(s) may not occur or the embryo(s) may not develop normally. The embryo(s) may become infected in the laboratory or a laboratory accident or equipment malfunctionmay result in loss or damage to the eggs, sperm, or embryo(s). Transfer of the embryo may not be successful. Implantation of the embryo(s) in the uterus after embryo transfer or gamete transfer may not occur. Even if a pregnancy is established, we understand that delivery of a child may not occur due tomiscarriage, ectopic pregnancy (outside the uterus), stillbirth, or other complications associated withpregnancy and delivery. POSSIBLE RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IVF-ET Potential fertility drug side effects: Along with their intended benefits, fertility drugs have a potential to causeside effects. The most common side effect is increased stimulation of the ovary. Occasionally, ovarianenlargement with symptoms of abdominal discomfort can occur. Mild to moderate uncomplicated ovarianenlargement, sometimes accompanied by abdominal distension and/or abdominal pain occurs in about 20%of those treated with Pergonal, Metrodin and HCG. This is generally reversed without treatment within 2-3weeks. Severe ovarian enlargement, known as the hyperstimulation syndrome is characterized by suddenenlargement of the ovary and an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. This fluid can also accumulate aroundthe lungs and may cause breathing difficulties. If the ovary ruptures, blood can accumulate in the abdominalcavity, as well. The fluid imbalance can also affect blood clotting and could be life-threatening. Fortunately,the hyperstimulation syndrome occurs in only about 1.3% of patients. Treatment consists of bed rest andcareful monitoring of fluid levels. Other adverse reactions that have been reported with Pergonal, Metrodin, HCG or Lupron are: allergicsensitivity, pain, rash, swelling at the injection site, and ectopic pregnancy. Adverse reactions have also beenreported with HCG and include: headache, irritability, restlessness, depression, and fatigue. Patients takingLupron may experience hot flashes. We understand that we should report symptoms to our physicianimmediately. Recent studies have suggested that fertility medication may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. However, these studies involve a small number of patients and the results are not well accepted. I have hadan opportunity to discuss my concerns with my physician. Blood tests may cause mild discomfort and a risk of developing a bruise or an infection at the needle site. Discomfort may be caused by ultrasound procedures. From the ultrasound needle aspiration, there is a possibility of bleeding, infection or injury to the bladder orabdominal organs that may require immediate or later major surgery. Infection may further impair fertility orresult in a loss of fertility potential. Transferring the embryo into the uterus may cause discomfort and a risk of developing infection or bleeding. In addition, there is the possibility that the early embryo(s) may implant into a fallopian tube causing an ectopic(tubal) pregnancy that usually requires surgical treatment. Some women have experienced multiple pregnancies after multiple embryos were transferred. The risk formultiple pregnancies after transferring three embryos is 27% for twins and 3% for triplets. Multiple pregnancies (twins or more) carry higher than normal risks for the mother due to extra fetuses andmay be associated with emotional and financial strain for the family, and prolonged hospitalization of themother before the birth and after birth for both the mother and infants. Mothers are at higher risk for high blood pressure, miscarriage, premature labor and delivery and otherpregnancy complications. Both the number of neonatal deaths and the number of long term handicaps areseveral times more frequent in multiple pregnancies than in single born infants. This results primarily frompremature delivery. Triplet pregnancy (as well as quadruplets and quintuplets) increase the risk that delivery will be much too soonfor survival of the infants. A procedure known as selective reduction may be considered in cases where threeor more gestational sacs are seen. More information about this procedure is available on a personal basis. General anesthesia involves the use of an anesthetic for the prevention of pain. Certain complications mayresult from the use of any anesthetic. These include: respiratory problems, drug reactions, paralysis, braindamage, or even death. Other risks range from minor discomforts, to injury of the vocal cords, teeth, or eyes. The risks associated with local anesthesia and IV sedation are greatly reduced. The Food and Drug Administration has advised that progesterone use should be avoided during pregnancy. Synthetic progesterones have been reported to increase the risk of congenital heart malformations from 8 in10,000 births to 15 in 10,000 births. Additional abnormalities reported include: anal blockage, abnormalities ofbones, brain, spinal cord, vertebrae, kidney, esophagus and sex organs. The progesterone injections that thewife will receive are made from natural progesterone and are chemically different from the syntheticprogesterone resulting in the small risk of increased abnormalities noted above. The natural progesteroneinjections are identical to that made by the woman's own body and therefore is unlikely to cause any badeffects to the woman or a baby if the woman becomes pregnant while using this medication. It is possible that a fetus conceived by IVF-ET could develop some abnormality. Three out of 100 births fromspontaneous conception in fertile couples have some type of birth defect and this rate appears to be similar inbirths from IVF-ET. There are a few studies suggesting that pregnancies resulting micromanipulationtechniques such as partial zona dissection (PZD), subzonal insertion (SZI) or intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI)may be at greater risk for congenital abnormalities. These findings have not been confirmed by otherinvestigators. Such abnormalities may not always result in miscarriage or be detectable by prenatal tests. Although amniocentesis and/or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed to analyze fetal cells forchromosomal abnormalities, some defects cannot be determined by this or other tests; it is possible that anabnormal child could be born as a result of IVF-ET. CVS is available at 9-11 weeks gestation andamniocentesis is available for pregnant patients at 14-16 weeks of gestation. We understand that these are new clinical procedures and that it is possible that there may as yet be unknownrisks related to pregnancy achieved by this method, or to the mental or physical health of any children soproduced. We, therefore, do jointly and severally release and forever discharge Atlanta Reproductive HealthCentre, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees,successors, and assigns and the IVF program personnel from any and all claims, demands, costs, expensesand loss of services incurred as a result of the physical or mental nature or character of any child or childrenso produced. ALTERNATE FORMS OF TREATMENT We understand that if we choose not to proceed with IVF-ET, the chances of our obtaining a pregnancy at thistime are low or nonexistent. All other possible alternative procedures to enable pregnancy to occur have beenexplained, offered, or attempted. We understand, however, that medical technology is constantly evolvingand developments may take place in the future which might allow us to obtain a pregnancy. We alsounderstand that adoption through other resources may be available to us. TREATMENT DECISIONS We understand that all decisions regarding each step of the procedure involved, including fertilization andimplantation, will be made by our IVF physician based on his independent medical judgment. We understandthat our IVF physician may decide not to proceed with the procedures because of complications or possiblerisks, either to the husband, wife or to the potential child, or because of other reasons and we agree to rely onhis decisions in this regard. LEGAL STATUS We understand that due to the relatively new nature of IVF-ET, many legal issues surrounding the procedurehave not been resolved and the legal status of any resulting child in terms of legitimacy or otherwise isuncertain. It is our intent and understanding that any resulting child be our legitimate child and we accept legalcustody and responsibility for any child or children we may have as a result of this procedure. We, jointly and severally, accept the in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer as our own act and acknowledgethe child or children so produced as our own legitimate child or children and as the heir or heirs of our bodieswith all the rights and privileges accompanying such status. We jointly and severally waive forever any rightwhich we might have to disclaim such child or children as our heir(s). MEDICAL EXPENSES We have been informed that if we should suffer any physical injury as a result of participation in this activity, allof the necessary medical facilities are available for treatment. We understand, however, that we cannotexpect to receive any payment for hospital expenses or any financial compensation for such an injury. CONFIDENTIALITY We understand that the physician and his associates will, unless otherwise compelled by law, make allreasonable efforts to keep information obtained about us during the course of treatment confidential. Weagree that specific medical details may be revealed in professional publications as long as our confidentiality ismaintained. We also authorize the filming, videotaping, and/or photographing of the female reproductiveorgans during the course of the procedure. LIMITING MULTIPLE PREGNANCY We have been informed of the risks of multiple pregnancy. After discussion of the risks of multiple pregnancy,my husband and I have decided to have: (choose one or specify maximum with number to be determined byphysician/embryologist) A maximum of ________ (number of pre-embryos) placed into my uterus. A number to be determined by the physician and the embryologist immediately prior to pre-embryotransfer so as to maximize the possibility of pregnancy and minimize the risk of multiple gestation. Weunderstand that a scoring system will be used to grade pre-embryo quality to indicate the number of pre-embryos to transfer. There is no guarantee that this technique will successfully limit the chance ofmultiple gestations. _____________________ (initials of husband and wife) We have been informed and understand that if we wish to cryopreserve (freeze) any fertilized eggs nottransferred to the uterus, we will be required to sign a separate consent document. We have been informedand understand that if we, as husband and wife, cannot agree or do not consent to either the freezing offertilized eggs or donation, we must either limit the number of eggs to be inseminated to the same number thatare to be transferred to the Wife's uterus or agree to disposal of extra fertilized eggs. If excess pre-embryosare not cryopreserved our chance of achieving a pregnancy may ultimately be decreased. (Choose one option.) We consent to cryopreserve extra pre-embryos. We understand that if for any given pre-embryo thequality is not sufficient to make survival likely, cryopreservation will not be performed on that pre-embryo and itwill be disposed of.. The decision whether to perform cryopreservation will be that of the medical team.(separate cryopreservation consent required) _____________________ (initials of husband and wife) We do not wish to have any pre-embryos cryopreserved and consent to: The disposal of any non transferred pre-embryos. _____________________ (initials of husband and wife) Donation of extra pre-embryos.

As a result of our participation in the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre's and Dr.Perloe's IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) program, GAMETE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER (GIFT) program, orZYGOTE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER (ZIFT) program more eggs may be retrieved or pre-embryos form than Dr.Perloe recommends be placed back into the woman's uterus or fallopian tubes. Accordingly, we desire that surpluseggs be fertilized and excessive pre-embryos be cryopreserved. DEFINITIONS. As used in this INFORMED CONSENT, the following definitions shall apply: "CRYOPRESERVATION" is preservation by freezing. In this case, cryopreservation refers to thepreservation by freezing of human pre-embryos. "A PRE-EMBRYO" is a fertilized egg, or ovum, that has divided to form a small number of simple cells, butnot specialized tissues. At the pre-embryo stage of development each of these primitive cells is identical toall other cells in the fertilized dividing egg. Human pre-embryos are usually cryopreserved when theyconsist of from one (l) to sixteen (l6) cells. "IN VITRO FERTILIZATION" or "IVF" refers to the process whereby egg growth is stimulated in a woman,the eggs are obtained from her ovary or ovaries, the eggs are then fertilized by her husband's sperm or by adonor's sperm, in a laboratory, and the resulting pre-embryos are placed into a woman's uterus. "GIFT" is an acronym for "GAMETE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER". Gametes are sperm and eggs. GIFT is a procedure in which eggs are obtained from a woman's ovary or ovaries by ultrasound guidedretrieval or by a procedure called a laparoscopy. Then, during the same procedure, the eggs are placedinto the woman's fallopian tubes along with some of the husband's sperm or a donor's sperm. "INTRAFALLOPIAN" means "inside the fallopian tube", which is the normal site of fertilization. "ZIFT" is an acronym for ZYGOTE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER. Eggs are obtained and fertilized in afashion similar to IVF. Twenty-four hours following retrieval, pre-embryos are transferred directly into thefallopian tube during an outpatient surgery, laparoscopy. "EMBRYO TRANSFER" means the transfer of up to four or five pre-embryos into the uterine cavity. ABSENCE OF GUARANTEE We have been informed and understand and affirm that no guarantee or representation has been made to us thatthe pre-embryos will survive the cryopreservation, or that pregnancy will be achieved utilizing this process. We havealso been informed and understand that mechanical failures may occur at any point during the process resulting inloss of the pre-embryos. ALTERNATIVES FOR USE OF CRYOPRESERVATION OF PRE-EMBRYOS The cryopreserved pre-embryos may be placed in the uterus of the wife. Alternatively, we may decide to donatethem to another individual or individuals, or we may authorize their disposal, or, if we fail or refuse to make adecision, they may be discarded. If we choose to make our cryopreserved pre-embryos available for donation to another individual or individuals, wewill complete a questionnaire that deals with our physical characteristics, education, and both personal health andfamily health. We agree to have certain blood tests to confirm that we carry no communicable disease. To theextent required by law, both of us and the recipient individual or individuals will remain anonymous to each other. The recipient(s) will not be shown the actual questionnaires we have completed, but may receive information takenfrom the questionnaires for assistance in making a decision regarding receipt of the pre-embryos. In the event of pre-embryo donation, we understand and agree that we will have no further claims or rights of anykind or nature upon or to the pre-embryos or any offspring which may result therefrom. We expressly waive any andall rights with respect to any offspring that may result from the pre-embryos. We further understand and agree thatthe recipient(s) of the pre-embryos will be deemed the parents and shall have all parental rights with respect to anyoffspring which may result from the pre-embryos. We understand that in the event we make our pre-embryosavailable for donation to another individual or individuals, and: (i) after reasonable time and effort has been expended no suitable recipient is available, or; (ii) applicable law prohibits donation of pre-embryos, our pre-embryos will be disposed of, without notice to us or consent by us. We expressly waive any and all rights tothe pre-embryos and authorize that they be disposed of if no suitable recipient is available or applicable law prohibitsdonations of pre-embryos. We have been informed and understand that in the event the pre-embryos are discardedno offspring will result from them. CHANGE OF DECISION We understand that after we have made our decision regarding the use or donation of the cryopreserved pre-embryos, we have no right, at any time in the future, to change any decision about use or donation of the pre-embryos or their disposal. INDECISION, SEPARATION, DIVORCE, DEATH In the event of our disagreement or our failure or refusal to make a decision, for whatever reason, or our separation,or divorce, or the death of either of us, the use or disposal of such pre-embryos shall be in accordance with theapplicable provisions in paragraph titled MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF CRYOPRESERVED PRE-EMBRYOS When we and the program of Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Paces Cryobank, Mark Perloe, M.D., and RomanPyrzak, Ph.D. have determined that the cryopreserved pre-embryos are to be placed in the wife's uterus, they will bethawed and placed in her uterus one (l) to four (4) at a time in subsequent normal ovarian cycles. Only pre-embryos considered by Mark Perloe, M.D., and or Roman Pyrzak, Ph.D. to be potentially viable, usingreasonable medical judgment, will be transferred. We have been informed and understand that placement of thepre-embryos into the uterus requires a normal uterine lining and close synchronization to the normal process ofovulation. Synchronization may require monitoring by frequent blood or urine tests of the wife, and ultrasoundexamination of the wife, and the pre-embryos will only be thawed and so placed into the uterus only if the cycle isdetermined to be normal in all respects by Mark Perloe, M.D. PROCEDURES IN EVENT PREGNANCY IS ACHIEVED If a pregnancy occurs from intrauterine transfer of cryopreserved pre-embryos, prenatal diagnosis, amniocentesis orchorionic villus sampling, may be recommended for the purpose of determining whether the fetus is chromosomallynormal. We have been informed and understand that prenatal diagnosis may detect some, but will not detect allabnormalities that may be present. Given current medical research, there is no present indication of an increase in the rate of anomalies among infantsborn after successful uterine transfer of cryopreserved pre-embryos, nor any indication of increased abnormalitiesafter cryopreservation from extensive experience in animals. Nevertheless, until large numbers of children havebeen born as a result of the cryopreservation process, it will not be possible to ascertain that the rate ofabnormalities truly does not differ from that in spontaneous conceptions. We knowingly accept this risk ofabnormality in any child so conceived through the pre-embryo cryopreservation procedure. COSTS We have discussed in detail with representatives of Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre and Mark Perloe, M.D. thefinancial aspects of cryopreservation of human pre-embryos. We understand that cryopreservation of human pre-embryos is an intricate and time-consuming process. We understand and acknowledge that it is solely ourresponsibility to pay the full costs of freezing, storing and thawing our surplus pre-embryos. We agree to inform the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre and Mark Perloe, M.D. of any change in our addressoccurring while we have cryopreserved pre-embryos in storage. We further agree that if any amount owed by us orthe designated recipient in the event of death of one partner, separation or divorce remains unpaid for more thanone (1) year, the pre-embryos are to be: a. _____________ Donated. ____________(initials of husband and wife) b. _____________ Disposed of. ____________(initials of husband and wife) without any further notice to us or consent by us and we understand that we are still responsible for payment of anoutstanding balance. MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF CRYOPRESERVED PRE-EMBRYOS We hereby express our decision regarding the management and disposal of our cryopreserved pre-embryos in thefollowing situations: In the event of the death of the husband, we wish our pre-embryos to be: a. Placed in the uterus of my surviving wife, if she so desires. ___________________(initials of husband and wife) b. Donated. ___________________(initials of husband and wife) c. Disposed of without any further notice to us or consent by us. ___________________(initials of husband and wife) It is understood that the surviving wife shall have the right, following the husband's death, to forego or change any orall of the above options and in any event she shall have the right to require disposal. However, if after ninety (90) days following the husband's death, the wife fails or refuses to make arrangements forthe disposition of the cryopreserved pre-embryos, the disposition as specified above in paragraph a., b., or c. will becarried out without further notice to or consent of the wife. In the event of the death of the wife, we wish our pre-embryos to be: a.

The name is an acronym, Gamete Intra-Fallopian Transfer. This name summarizes the procedure quite well. Male gametes (sperm) and female gametes (ova or eggs) are placed separately into a special catheter and then injected into the woman's fallopian tube during an outpatient surgical procedure called laparoscopy. In contrast to In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) where eggs are fertilized outside of the body in a laboratory and then placed into the uterus, the GIFT procedure allows fertilization and pre-embryo implantation to occur just as it does during naturally occurring pregnancy. How it works In order to increase the chances of recovering several healthy and mature eggs, and to prepare a proper uterine environment for pre-embryo implantation, the woman will undergo about two to three weeks of intensive preparation. This includes therapy with hormones commonly called "fertility drugs." Blood tests and ultrasound scans of the ovary are used to determine the optimal timing for egg retrieval. When the ideal time arrives, the wife is admitted to the hospital to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure (laparoscopy) to recover the eggs. The GIFT procedure may be combined with other laparoscopic procedures, such as diagnostic laparoscopy or treatment of endometriosis. During the laparoscopy procedure, a small incision is made in the area of the umbilicus (navel), and a telescope-like instrument (laparoscope) is inserted and used to view the ovaries and other pelvic organs. The ovarian follicles, which contain the mature eggs, can then be located. Using a special needle, the fluid inside each follicle is aspirated (suctioned out). The embryologist uses a powerful microscope to examine the fluid and determine whether an egg was present. He then selects a few mature eggs (best) and mixes them with sperm for transfer into the fallopian tube. Occasionally, ultrasound will be used to retrieve the eggs directly through the vaginal wall. Ultrasound guided transvaginal egg retrieval is performed using local anesthesia. If mature eggs are obtained, general anesthesia will be administered and laparoscopy will be performed. Before surgery, the husband provides a semen sample. The sperm sample is prepared for placement in the fallopian tube. At surgery the eggs (up to four of them) are loaded into a special catheter containing the sperm. Normally, fertilization will take place later in the fallopian tube. Usually eggs and sperm are injected into only one fallopian tube. Therefore, only one healthy fallopian tube and one ovary are required for GIFT. Recovery is quick and usually the woman goes home the same day. Activity is limited for 48 hours following surgery. Advantages of the GIFT Procedure Many researchers believe that the higher success rates reported with the GIFT technique (compared to IVF) are related to the fact that GIFT relies on the body's own natural processes and timetable to produce a healthy pre-embryo. This may be particularly the case in programs with poor IVF success rates. At the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre we have found that GIFT offers no advantage over IVF, and it requires surgery and it is generally more expensive than IVF. GIFT may offer a number of distinct advantages over other fertility treatments. Infertility may result from a number of causes: Male factors; low sperm counts or poor sperm function are present in 30-40% of infertility cases. Tubal and pelvic factors; damage or blockage of only one fallopian tubes, or endometriosis that has not responded to surgical or medical treatment are present in 15-20% of cases. Cervical factors: damage to the cervix or lack of adequate mucus occur in 5-10% of cases. Immunological factors; antibodies present on either the sperm or in the woman prevent sperm from reaching or fertilizing the eggs in 5% of cases. Couples whose infertility has occurred as a result of advanced maternal age, endometriosis and those with "unexplained" infertility, have generally been considered the best candidates for GIFT. Couples with cervical or certain immunological factors are also appropriate candidates. Couples with a tubal factor are not usually candidates for GIFT but may be considered if one fallopian tube is normal. Otherwise, these couples should consider IVF as an alternative. The GIFT Program - Questions and Answers Q: Will the GIFT technique damage my ovaries? A: There is no evidence to suggest that either normal laparoscopy or egg retrieval damages the ovaries. Reports in the medical literature suggest that following ovarian biopsy, pregnancies occur in couples with a long-term history of infertility. Q: Will scar tissue around my ovaries make it impossible to retrieve the eggs? A: NO. During laparoscopy, the surgeon must be able to see the follicles in order to guide the needle to the proper spot for egg retrieval. Although, scar tissue can be removed at the same surgical egg retrieval, a transvaginal ultrasound retrieval would be preferable. However, the fallopian tubes must be visualized and be normal for fallopian tube transfer. If the fallopian tube is inaccessible or appears unhealthy, IVF will be indicated. Q: What if I ovulate before oocyte (also called egg or ovum) retrieval? A: Once ovulation has occurred, it is impossible to retrieve the eggs and surgery must be canceled. The entire team of physician, nurse and embryologist will monitor your cycle very carefully to avoid premature ovulation. Lurpon (a GnRH agonist) is used along with other drugs during the stimulation of the eggs. Lurpon is used to prevent ovulation. Q: If an egg is not retrieved or if the technique does not produce a pregnancy on the first attempt, how soon can the procedure be repeated? A: Approximately three months later, depending on the individual. The primary reason for delay is to allow the patient's normal menstrual cycle to resume. The delay also helps avoid any cumulative effects from frequent anesthesias. Q: How many times will GIFT be repeated per couple? A: There is no specific number. This is determined by the couple together with their physician. Q: Can we have intercourse the two-week period before the GIFT procedure is performed? A: Most definitely. The physicians recommend that the husband refrain from ejaculation for 48 hours preceding egg retrieval, but not more than 5 to 7 days. This precaution assures that the semen sample obtained for the GIFT procedure will contain a maximum number of healthy, motile sperm. Q: After the GIFT procedure, how long must we wait to have intercourse? A: Although a definite time of abstinence to avoid damage to the pre-embryo has not been determined, most experts recommend abstinence for two to three weeks. Theoretically, the uterine contractions associated with orgasm could interfere with the early stages of implantation. Q: What about other activities? How soon can I resume my normal routine? A: The GIFT team recommends that the patient be sedentary for a full 24 hours following the procedure. Strenuous exercises such as jogging, horseback riding, swimming, etc., should be avoided until pregnancy is confirmed. Otherwise, the patient is free to return to her regular activities. Q: How soon will I know if I'm pregnant? A: Pregnancy can be confirmed using blood tests 12 to 14 days after GIFT. Q: I had my tubes tied (tubal ligation several years ago. Would I be a candidate for GIFT? A: No, not at this time. Women whose fallopian tubes are blocked due to either previous tubal ligation, infection or congenital defects are not candidates for the GIFT program. Women with tubal obstruction are better candidates for IVF. Q: What drugs are given to stimulate the ovarian follicles and to maintain the lining of the uterus prior to implantation of the pre-embryo? A: Four to five medications normally are given: 1) Luprolide acetate (Lupron), an injectable drug that blocks secretions of the pituitary gland, thereby optimizing the number of oocytes retrieved; 2) Human menopausal gonadotropin (Pergonal or hMG) or Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Metrodin or FSH), hormones that stimulate ovarian activity, are injected daily for about 6-8 days prior to the procedure; 3) freezing for your later use. Other options include donating the eggs to an infertile woman who cannot produce eggs, or to simply dispose of them. Excess eggs, if any, belong to you and you will determine their disposition prior to initiating therapy.

As you approach each step we recommend that you re-read that particular section and ask any questions at that time. This will prevent you from becoming confused with too many answers at one time. The use of donor gametes (sperm and eggs) has a long history in its application to male infertility. When the male partner in an infertile couple has azoospermia (no sperm) or severe oligospermia (low sperm number), the only treatment which allows the female partner to conceive is the utilization of donor sperm for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination with donor sperm is a standard and widely practiced treatment for male infertility. The use of the female gamete, the egg or oocyte, for treatment of certain disorders leading to female reproductive failure has only been possible since 1984. The oocyte from a donor can be either recovered as an embryo after it has undergone fertilization within the body (by uterine lavage(washing) in a process called ovum transfer) or recovered as an egg and inseminated in vitro (in the laboratory) to yield an in vitro fertilized embryo. Ovum transfer, the transfer of a normally fertilized egg from a female donor to an infertile recipient, was developed in the United States and also performed in Italy. It has presently been abandoned in the United States. The major reasons for its present disfavor are: 1) The fertile donor, having to be inseminated with the recipient's husband's sperm would be at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, the most devastating one without a screening procedure being the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), 2) if the conceptus created is not recovered by uterine lavage procedure, there is the risk of establishing an intrauterine pregnancy in the donor woman requiring its termination, and most importantly 3) without use of drugs to induce superovulation, the success of ovum transfer per each natural insemination cycle has been less that 10%. The use of in vitro fertilized donor eggs has been more widely applied with births reported in several countries including Australia, England, Israel, and the United States. There are two major advances in in vitro fertilization technology that have made the use of donor eggs more feasible. The first advance has been the introduction of ultrasound-guided egg recovery techniques. Ultrasound-guided transvaginal oocyte recovery at Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre is performed on an outpatient basis requiring only local anesthesia and sedation. Laparoscopy and general anesthesia are not required, making the procedure less risky and its use more justifiable in women for whom there is no direct medical benefit. The second advance is the success in cryopreservation (freezing) of in vitro fertilized human embryos. The cryopreservation of embryos makes it unnecessary to have perfect synchronization of the donor and recipient women's menstrual cycles making the logistics of donation much simpler. It is important to remember that each patient has their own unique response to the medications they receive and that each ART cycle is different. This means, not only are you unlikely to respond as others do, but you may actually respond differently from one cycle to the next. For this reason, you will find that your treatment and testing differs from that of other patients. Please do not compare your test results and medication plans with others to whom you may speak. Although you may find much in common with other patients here, please keep in mind that IVF/GIFT is a very private matter and that some patients do not feel comfortable discussing this. The schedule you find here is to help guide you through your treatment cycle. Time changes and other adjustments will frequently be made in order to individualize your treatment. Please keep in mind that all costs are the responsibility of the recipient couple. The oocyte donor, have no financial responsibility in this process. Pre-Cycle Counseling Your initial interview at Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre will be with an IVF Nurse Coordinator and will last approximately 90 minutes. During this time the process of oocyte donation will be explained. The nurse will gather more detailed information about you and your medical history as well as explore your feelings regarding oocyte donation. You will also see one of our physicians at this visit and have a physical examination which will include a pelvic ultrasound. Following this visit, the information gathered will be reviewed by our IVF team and, when approved, you will be asked to schedule a visit with our psychologist for further testing. When these tests are completed your file will again be reviewed by the IVF team for acceptance into the program. You will be notified by mail of the results of this review. If you are accepted into the program ARHC will match you with a potential oocyte recipient before any further testing occurs. This process may take several months. When you have been matched with a recipient couple further testing will begin. The purpose of this screening is to protect the health of the recipient/mother. This will include blood tests, a Pap Smear, and cervical cultures. The recipient couple may request genetic testing; this testing is at the discretion of the recipient couple and is not mandatory by ARHC policy. Drug testing may also be requested. We recommend that when your period begins, on the cycle preceding the one you are scheduled to undergo ovulation induction , that you contact the IVF nurse coordinator at (404) 265-3662. First, you will be asked to review and sign the Egg Donor Permit and the Donor-Recipient Agreement. All consent forms must be signed by you and your husband (if applicable) prior to initiating your treatment cycle. At this time, arrangements will be made to provide you with the necessary medications, and review and clarify your obligations. You will have an IVF teaching appointment at which time you will meet with both the doctor and nurse to review these your instructions and have any questions answered. You are to avoid the possibility of pregnancy during this cycle by using condoms.

("ARHC"), Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors, and assigns and the In vitro Fertilization (IVF) program personnel and associates to perform ovulation induction and oocyte retrieval. We warrant that all written representations and information provided to ARHC and to any professional physician, physician's assistant, nurse or embryologist of ARHC or to the Prospective Parents are true, correct and complete. We do not desire to have a parental relationship with any child born pursuant to this Agreement. Further, we believe the child is morally and legally that of the Prospective Parents. PURPOSE OF PROCEDURES The purpose of this procedure is to provide a means for the recipient couple to achieve pregnancy when conventional therapy has failed or is unacceptable. Surgical and/or medical therapy has been tried with adequate periods of follow-up for pregnancy to occur after thorough evaluation of coital, male, cervical, ovulatory, ovarian, uterine, tubal and peritoneal factors. REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATION We understand that the following are requirements for participation in this procedure and we represent that we meet each of the requirements: The oocyte donor is between the age of 18 and 35. The oocyte donor has medical insurance. We acknowledge and agree that our acceptance into the program and our continuing participation is at the discretion of the staff of the program. The Egg Donor agrees to abstain from all sexual activity, including intercourse. This provision of abstinence is waived if the Egg Donor is married/cohabitating with a man and uses condoms. This waiver of abstinence will be limited to the sexual activity between the Egg Donor and her Husband/Cohabitant. The Egg Donor agrees to adhere to all medical instructions given to her by the Physician. The Egg Donor agrees not to drink any alcoholic beverages, not to use any illegal drugs, not to use any nonprescription medications or prescribed medications without the knowledge of and consent from the physicians, commencing one month prior to donating eggs. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES We understand that egg donation involves hormone injections to stimulate the egg donor's ovaries and the removal of egg(s) from the donor's ovary(ies) by a needle and the fertilization of those eggs with the husband's/donor's sperm in the laboratory. If fertilization occurs, the pre-embryo(s) may be replaced into the Prospective Mother's uterus and/or cryopreserved. Subsequently, at the discretion of the Prospective Parents, the resultant cryopreserved pre-embryos may be (1 ) transferred to the Prospective Mother's uterus; (2) donated to an infertile couple; or (3) disposed. I consent to the following surgical, medical, and/or diagnostic procedures: Pre-IVF screening: Determination by medical history, physical examination, and standard infertility tests that I am a candidate for this procedure; Ovulation Induction: The use of fertility drugs (usually Lupron, Humegon, Pergonal, Metrodin and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)) to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles (eggs) in the ovary; Laboratory tests: Frequent blood samples will be taken from the women to monitor hormone secretions from the ovary and pituitary gland; Ultrasound: Ultrasonography is a diagnostic procedure using sound waves to provide a picture of the ovaries and the follicles to monitor the development of the egg(s) and uterine lining; Egg retrieval: Vaginal introduction of a needle into the ovary to obtain one or more eggs. This is performed with ultrasound guidance. A local anesthetic and pain medication is used to minimize discomfort. Fertilization: Placing the egg(s) and the sperm together in a suitable medium to allow fertilization, If there is no evidence of fertilization after 72 hours of incubation, the oocytes (incompletely developed eggs) and sperm will be disposed of in an ethically-acceptable manner. Embryo Culture: Development of the fertilized egg(s) and pre-embryo formation; Embryo transfer: Placement of the embryo(s) into the recipient's uterus by means of a small plastic tube inserted through the cervix into the uterus; Cryopreservation: If there are more pre-embryos than can be safely transferred, excess pre-embryos can be cryopreserved, donated, or discarded. Alternatively, the physician and the couple may elect to limit the number of follicles aspirated. SUCCESS RATE We understand that no guarantees have been made regarding the success of ovarian stimulation and the ability to perform egg retrieval. We understand that the chances of proceeding to egg retrieval is approximately 90%. We also understand that we will not be notified of results of fertilization or of any pregnancy resulting from this procedure. FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION The Prospective Parents will be solely responsible for any and all medical costs of the Egg Donor resulting from any procedures, and resulting from any and all complications that may arise as a result of this treatment. In addition, the Egg Donor will receive a financial consideration of $1,500.00 for her direct and indirect expenses associated with participation. This will be provided as long as an egg retrieval is performed. Correspondingly, we understand that we can withdraw from the program at any time without affecting the availability of other present or future medical care. However, we understand that in the event of withdrawal or failure to meet the requirements for participation, we will be responsible for payments of services performed and that we are financially responsible for any other medical costs incurred through Georgia Baptist Medical Center or Paces Cryobank. POSSIBLE RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IVF-ET Potential fertility drug side effects: Along with their intended benefits, fertility drugs have a potential to cause side effects. The most common side effect is increased stimulation of the ovary. Occasionally, ovarian enlargement with symptoms of abdominal discomfort can occur. Mild to moderate uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, sometimes accompanied by abdominal distension and/or abdominal pain occurs in about 20% of those treated with Pergonal, Metrodin and HCG. This is generally reversed without treatment within 2-3 weeks. Severe ovarian enlargement, known as the hyperstimulation syndrome is characterized by sudden enlargement of the ovary and an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. This fluid can also accumulate around the lungs and may cause breathing difficulties. If the ovary ruptures, blood can accumulate in the abdominal cavity, as well. The fluid imbalance can also affect blood clotting and could be life-threatening. Fortunately, the hyperstimulation syndrome occurs in only about 1.3% of patients. Treatment consists of bed rest and careful monitoring of fluid levels. Other adverse reactions that have been reported with Pergonal, Metrodin, HCG or Lupron are: allergic sensitivity, pain, rash, swelling at the injection site, and ectopic pregnancy. Adverse reactions have also been reported with HCG and include: headache, irritability, restlessness, depression, and fatigue. Patients taking Lupron may experience hot flashes. We understand that we should report symptoms to our physician immediately. Blood tests may cause mild discomfort and a risk of developing a bruise or an infection at the needle site. Discomfort may be caused by ultrasound procedures. From the ultrasound needle aspiration, there is a possibility of bleeding, infection or injury to the bladder or abdominal organs that may require immediate or later major surgery. Infection may further impair fertility or result in a loss of fertility potential. Should I fail to avoid intercourse during the period preceding egg retrieval and for at least one week after, I may become pregnant. TREATMENT DECISIONS We understand that all decisions regarding each step of the procedure involved will be made by our IVF physician based on his independent medical judgment. We understand that our IVF physician may decide not to proceed with the procedures because of complications or possible risks, either to the Egg Donor, the Prospective Parents or to the potential child, or because of other reasons and we agree to rely on his decisions in this regard. LEGAL STATUS We understand that due to the relatively new nature of IVFET and oocyte donation, many legal issues surrounding the procedure have not been resolved and the legal status of any resulting child(ren) in terms of legitimacy or otherwise is uncertain. It is our intent and understanding that any resulting child be the legitimate child of the Prospective Parents, and that neither I (Egg Donor) nor my Husband will ever attempt to form a parent-child relationship with any child or children that may be born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s) into the Prospective Mother. We, jointly and severally, accept egg donation as our own act and acknowledge the child(ren) so produced as the legitimate child(ren) of the Prospective Parents. We jointly and severally waive forever any rights which we might have to claim such child or children as ours. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. All agreements, covenants, representations and warranties, express or implied, oral or written, made by any party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement are embodied herein. All prior agreements and representations, of whatever nature, which relate to this Agreement are waived, merged and superseded. This is a fully integrated Agreement and the terms and conditions of this Agreement are to be governed in accordance with Georgia law. MEDICAL EXPENSES We have been informed that if we should suffer any physical injury as a result of participation in this activity, all of the necessary medical facilities are available for treatment. We understand, however, that payment for physician and hospital expenses will be the responsibility of the Prospective Parents. No other forms of financial compensation for such an injury will be available. CONFIDENTIALITY We understand that the physician and his associates will, unless otherwise compelled by law, make reasonable efforts to keep information obtained about us during the course of treatment confidential. We agree that specific medical details may be revealed in professional publications as long as our confidentiality is maintained. We also authorize the filming, videotaping and/or photographing of the female reproductive organs during the course of the procedure. As the parties desire to maintain confidentialities between and among themselves, one to another, and between themselves and the public, we will not require disclosure of the Prospective Parents name nor any other pertinent information that may identify the Prospective Parents without their prior consent. CONSENT We hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless ARHC, Mark Perloe, M.D., Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank and all of their respective employees and agents, from and against any and all such actions, claims, costs, expenses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, damages, settlements, compromises, judgments and any other losses or expenses they incur or for which they may be responsible with respect to any claim or legal action arising out of the egg donation.

("ARHC"). Whereas, ________________________ and ________________________ being wife and husband desire to conceive a child by receiving oocyte(s) from a donor; and Whereas, said parties seek the assistance of ARHC in said conception of a child; Now, Therefore, in consideration of entry of this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: _______________________ ("wife") and ________________________ ("husband") desire to conceive a child by receiving oocyte(s) from a donor who shall remain anonymous and voluntarily give their consent and authorize ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors and assigns and the In Vitro Fertilization ("IVF") program personnel and associates to perform In Vitro Fertilization-Embryo Transfer ("IVF-ET"), and the procedures necessary for IVF-ET. ________________________ (wife) agrees that the main objective of this treatment is to allow her to carry and deliver a child that she could not otherwise conceive. The proposed medical procedures may afford her the experience of pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood by a treatment called oocyte donation. ________________________ (wife) understands that the child(ren) conceived by this method will not have her genetic material but will have that of the oocyte donor and her husband. However, regardless of the outcome, she will be the mother of any child(ren) born to her as a result of egg donation and hereby accepts all the legal responsibilities required of such a parent. The undersigned wife and husband understand that the sperm used in these procedures and referred to in this consent form will be obtained from (Circle appropriate source) The husband An anonymous donor A known donor If the undersigned wife and husband have requested donor semen (semen from another person) to be used to fertilize the egg(s), the wife and husband each will sign a separate document to indicate their decision and acceptance of that option, and they also indicate their decision for donor semen by initialing here: ____________________ (initials of husband and wife) If donor sperm is selected (circle appropriate choice) Use only donor sperm. Divide the eggs between donor sperm and husband's sperm. _____% donor; _____% husband (selection of which sperm sample used for each egg will be at the discretion of the embryologist). If in the embryologist's opinion, the husband's sperm specimen is not likely to result in fertilization, use donor sperm. If no fertilization on first day using the husband's sperm, reinseminate with donor sperm. PURPOSE OF PROCEDURES The purpose of this Agreement and procedure is to provide a means for ARHC to assist the wife and husband to achieve pregnancy when conventional therapy has failed or is unacceptable. Surgical and/or medical therapy has been tried with adequate periods of follow-up for pregnancy to occur after thorough evaluation of coital, male, cervical, ovulatory, ovarian, uterine, tubal and peritoneal factors. REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATION The undersigned wife and husband understand that the following are requirements for participation in this procedure and they represent that they meet each of the requirements. They are legally married. They have a history of infertility from female or male factors or an unknown cause. The undersigned wife and husband acknowledge and agree that their acceptance into the program and their continuing participation is at the discretion of the staff of the program. Correspondingly, said wife and husband understand that they can withdraw from the program at any time without affecting the availability of other present or future medical care. The undersigned wife and husband understand that insurance coverage for any or all of the above procedures may not be available, acknowledge that they have been made aware of their financial obligations and have made appropriate financial arrangements. The undersigned wife and husband, jointly and individually, are responsible for payments on services performed regardless of whether a pregnancy is achieved. The undersigned wife and husband understand that they are financially responsible for any other medical costs incurred through Georgia Baptist Medical Center or Paces Cryobank. In accepting the gift of donated human eggs, the undersigned wife and husband agree and understand the following: They will not require disclosure of the donor's name or any pertinent information that may identify the donor without the prior consent of the egg donor. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES It is agreed by the abovenamed wife and husband that ARHC will obtain one or more eggs from a donor whom ARHC has chosen due to her desire to donate eggs to infertile women. It is understood that the egg donor has been carefully screened by ARHC to be a suitable donor from a psychological and physical standpoint, having been tested for infectious diseases, and questioned in regard to familial genetic diseases and emotional stability. The undersigned wife and husband understand and agree that no guarantee about the reliability of the history of the donor can be given. It is understood that ARHC will make an effort to match the general physical characteristics of the donor with their general physical characteristics. The undersigned wife and husband understand and agree that the IVFET procedure involves hormone injections to stimulate the egg donor's ovaries and the removal of egg(s) from the donor's ovary(ies) by a needle and the fertilization of those eggs with the husband's/donor's sperm in the laboratory. If fertilization occurs, the pre-embryo(s) may be replaced into the wife's uterus and/or cryopreserved. The undersigned wife and husband consent to the following surgical, medical and/or diagnostic procedures: Pre-IVF screening: Determination by medical history, physical examination and standard infertility tests that they are candidates for this procedure; Fertilization: Placing the egg(s) and the sperm together in a suitable medium to allow fertilization. If there is no evidence of fertilization after 72 hours of incubation, the oocytes (incompletely developed eggs) and sperm will be disposed of in an ethically-acceptable manner. Micromanipulation: A procedure where either a few sperm are injected beneath the outer layer of the egg(s) or directly into the egg(s) to increase the possibility of fertilization. Embryo Culture: Development of the fertilized egg(s) and preembryo formation; Assisted Hatching: A slit is made in the outer protective layer surrounding the fertilized egg(s) to remove fragments and to increase the possibility of implantation; Embryo Transfer: Placement of the embryo(s) into the uterus by means of a small plastic tube inserted through the cervix into the uterus; Cryopreservation: If there are more pre-embryos than can be safely transferred, excess preembryos can be cryopreserved, donated or discarded. Alternatively, the physician and the couple may elect to limit the number of follicles aspirated. Luteal Phase Support: During the first two weeks after embryo transfer, additional hormonal support, including, but not limited to, Progesterone or HCG, may be administered in the form of injections, tablets or suppositories; Pregnancy Testing: Following transfer of embryo(s), blood tests may be obtained to insure normal hormone levels and to detect pregnancy. If pregnancy is confirmed, the wife will proceed with obstetrical care through a physician of her choice, upon release from care of the IVF team. SUCCESS RATE From the information currently available, the undersigned wife and husband understand that the chances of obtaining a pregnancy by this procedure is approximately 40%. They further represent that they have discussed their particular fertility factors and chances for success with their personal physician. They acknowledge, agree and understand that neither ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their owners, doctors and the IVF program personnel and associates have made any promises or warranties regarding the success rate or results of IVF--ET or the health and characteristics of any child or children that may be conceived by the procedure. Because IVF-ET is a relatively new procedure, insufficient data are available to express an exact success rate. Failure to achieve a pregnancy may result from any of the following or from other reasons: Maturation of the egg(s) may not occur, or the time of egg maturation may be misjudged, may not be predictable, may occur prior to egg retrieval or may not take place in the monitored cycle. The procedure to obtain all or a number of eggs from the donor's ovary may not be successful. Medical emergencies with other patients may restrict availability of the procedure room or the necessary personnel at the appropriate time for obtaining the egg(s). The egg(s) obtained from the donor may not be normal. The husband may be unable to provide a suitable semen specimen, or if used, the donor semen specimen may not have an adequate number of viable sperm after freezing and thawing. Fertilization of the egg(s) by the sperm may not occur. Cleavage or cell division of the embryo(s) may not occur or the embryo(s) may not develop normally. The embryo(s) may become infected in the laboratory or a laboratory accident or equipment malfunction may result in loss or damage to the eggs, sperm or embryo(s). Transfer of the embryo may not be successful. Implantation of the embryo(s) in the uterus after embryo transfer or gamete transfer may not occur. Even if a pregnancy is established, they understand that delivery of a child may not occur due to miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy (outside the uterus), stillbirth or other complications associated with pregnancy and delivery. MICROMANIPULATION Micromanipulation is used either to enhance fertilization, or alternatively, it may be utilized to increase the chances that the pre-embryo(s) will attach to the uterus. Microfertilization is performed immediately after the oocytes (eggs) are retrieved, or the following day if fertilization is not confirmed. To enhance fertilization, the embryologist will choose between three different types of micromanipulation procedures; PZD involves slicing a hole in the zona pellucida or "shell" of the egg; SZI involves placing 2-4 sperm beneath this outer layer just ajacent to the inner egg membrane; ICSI, direct injection of the sperm into the egg. Each of these procedures may be chosen based on a number of factors. No one procedure is appropriate for everyone. Therefore, the embryologist will individualize treatment and will decide whether to perform micromanipulation and which procedure to use at his discretion. Fertilization rates with micromanipulationmay vary between 20% and 50%. There is also no guarantee that any of the eggs undergoing micromanipulation may fertilize or implant. Repeat IVF with other modifications may result in similar fertilization rates. Failure of the egg to fertilize and divide may be related to the stress of micromanipulation, egg injury or fertilization with more than one sperm. There is no way to know which are the best sperm to choose for injection. This may result in the selection of chromosomally abnormal sperm. Early reports have suggested that the incidence of major chromosomal anomalies is increased 2-4 times in patients undergoing micromanipulation. Prenatal genetic diagnosis of all resultant pregnancies is strongly recommended. In addition, the incidence of identical twins may be increased. If the fertilized egg demonstrates increased fragments, micromanipulation and removal of fragments may enhance attachment to the uterus. In older patients, those with borderline FSH levels, previous IVF failures or a thick outer layer (zona), assisted hatching may be recommended. We understand that these procedures are new and all potential complications resulting from micromanipulation may not yet be known. We understand that neither Dr. Perloe, Dr. Pyrzak, Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Paces Cryobank or Georgia Baptist Medical Center or their designees have warranted the success of this procedure or the health of any child developing from such a procedure. We consent to any or all of the procedures described aboveand indicated below: (husband & wife signify consent by initialing each procedure and signing below.) ______partial zona dissection ______subzonal insertion ______intracytoplasmic sperm injection ______assisted hatching FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION All of the professional services directly provided to the undersigned wife and husband shall be charged to them at the prevailing professional fee schedule. These services include consultation appointments, monitoring of the success of the hormone treatment regimens including endometrial biopsy, professional fees associated with embryo replacement and monitoring of any early pregnancy, if established. In addition, the undersigned wife and husband will be solely responsible for any and all medical costs of the egg donor resulting from any procedures, and resulting from any and all complications that may arise as a result of this treatment. There will be a one-time fee of $1,000.00 imposed before the first donor egg treatment cycle is begun to cover the costs involved in the necessary screening and assessment of the egg donor. In addition, the egg donor will receive a financial consideration of $1,500.00 for her direct and indirect expenses associated with participation. This $1,500.00 shall be the responsibility of the undersigned wife and husband as long as an egg retrieval is performed, whether or not any eggs are recovered and fertilized or pregnancy is established. The undersigned wife and husband also understand that they are solely responsible to ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center and Paces Cryobank and that the deposits are due prior to treatment of the oocyte donor. Similarly, the undersigned wife and husband understand that these amounts may not cover all expenses and agree that they solely are responsible for all additional costs which are not paid by the oocyte donor. POSSIBLE RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IVF-ET Adverse reactions that have been reported with Estrogen, Progesterone or Lupron are: allergic sensitivity, pain, rash, swelling at the injection site, ectopic pregnancy, headache, irritability, restlessness, depression, fatigue, hot flashes, upset stomach, breast tenderness and abdominal bloating. They understand that they should report symptoms to their physician immediately. Blood tests may cause mild discomfort and a risk of developing a bruise or an infection at the needle site. Discomfort may be caused by ultrasound procedures. Transferring the embryo into the uterus may cause discomfort and a risk of developing infection or bleeding. In addition, there is the possibility that the early embryo(s) may implant into a fallopian tube causing an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy that usually requires surgical treatment. Some women have experienced multiple pregnancies after multiple embryos were transferred. The risk for multiple pregnancies after transferring three embryos is 27% for twins and 3% for triplets. Multiple pregnancies (twins or more) carry higher than normal risks for the mother due to extra fetuses and may be associated with emotional and financial strain for the family, and prolonged hospitalization of the mother before the birth and after birth for both the mother and infants. Mothers are at higher risk for high blood pressure, miscarriage, premature labor and delivery and other pregnancy complications. Both the number of neonatal deaths and the number of long term handicaps are several times more frequent in multiple pregnancies than in single born infants. This results primarily from premature delivery. Triplet pregnancy (as well as quadruplets and quintuplets) increase the risk that delivery will be much too soon for survival of the infants. A procedure known as selective reduction may be considered in cases where three or more gestational sacs are seen. More information about this procedure is available on a personal basis. The Food and Drug Administration has advised that progesterone use should be avoided during pregnancy. Synthetic progesterone has been reported to increase the risk of congenital heart malformations from 8 in 10,000 births to 15 in 10,000 births. Additional abnormalities reported include: anal blockage, abnormalities of bones, brain, spinal cord, vertebrae, kidney, esophagus and sex organs. The progesterone injections that the wife will receive are made from natural progesterone and are chemically different from the synthetic progesterone resulting in the small risk of increased abnormalities noted above. The natural progesterone injections are identical to that made by the woman's own body and, therefore, is unlikely to cause any bad effects to the woman or a baby if the woman becomes pregnant while using this medication. It is possible that a fetus conceived by IVF-ET could develop some abnormality. Three out of 100 births from spontaneous conception in fertile couples have some type of birth defect and this rate appears to be similar in births from IVF-ET. Such abnormalities may not always result in miscarriage or be detectable by prenatal tests. Although amniocentesis and/or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed to analyze fetal cells for chromosomal abnormalities, some defects cannot be determined by this or other tests; therefore, it is possible that an abnormal child could be born as a result of IVF-ET. CVS is available at 9-11 weeks of gestation and amniocentesis is available for pregnant patients at 14-16 weeks of gestation. They understand that these are new clinical procedures and that it is possible that there may as yet be unknown risks related to pregnancy achieved by this method, or to the mental or physical health of any children so produced. They, therefore, do jointly and severally release and forever discharge ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors and assigns and the IVF program personnel from any and all claims, demands, costs, expenses and loss of services incurred as a result of the physical or mental nature or character of any child or children so produced. ALTERNATE FORMS OF TREATMENT The undersigned wife and husband understand that if they choose not to proceed with IVF-ET, the chances of their obtaining a pregnancy at this time are low or nonexistent. All other possible alternative procedures to enable pregnancy to occur have been explained, offered, or attempted. They understand, however, that medical technology is constantly evolving and developments may take place in the future which might allow them to obtain a pregnancy. They also understand that adoption through other resources may be available to them. TREATMENT DECISIONS The undersigned wife and husband understand that all decisions regarding each step of the procedure involved, including fertilization and implantation, will be made by an IVF physician based on his independent medical judgment. The undersigned wife and husband understand that the IVF physician may decide not to proceed with the procedures because of complications or possible risks, either to the donor, wife, husband or to the potential child, or because of other reasons and they agree to rely on his decisions in this regard. LEGAL STATUS This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia. The undersigned wife and husband understand that due to the relatively new nature of IVF-ET and oocyte donation, many legal issues surrounding the procedure have not been resolved and the legal status of any resulting child in terms of legitimacy or otherwise is uncertain. It is the intent and understanding of the wife and husband that any resulting child will be their legitimate child, and they accept legal custody and responsibility for any child or children that result from this procedure. The undersigned wife and husband, jointly and severally, accept the IVF using donor oocyte(s) and embryo transfer as their own act and acknowledge the child(ren) so produced as their own legitimate child(ren) and as the heir(s) of their bodies with all the rights and privileges accompanying such status. The undersigned wife and husband further, jointly and severally, waive forever any right which they might have to disclaim such child or children as their heir(s). Any and all disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall first be submitted in writing to ARHC for resolution and mediation. If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, then the parties shall submit their claim(s) to binding arbitration. The arbitrator shall be an independent third-party arbitrator as agreed to by the parties or shall be appointed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia. Said arbitrator, in his or her discretion, shall be authorized to award costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, to the prevailing party. MEDICAL EXPENSES The undersigned wife and husband have been informed that if they should suffer any physical injury as a result of participation in this activity, necessary medical facilities are available for treatment. The undersigned wife and husband understand, however, that they cannot expect to receive any payment for hospital expenses or any financial compensation for such an injury. CONFIDENTIALITY The undersigned wife and husband understand that the physician and associates will, unless otherwise compelled by law, make all reasonable efforts to keep information obtained during the course of treatment confidential. The undersigned wife and husband agree that specific medical details may be revealed in professional publications as long as confidentiality is maintained. The undersigned wife and husband also authorize the filming, videotaping and/or photographing of the female reproductive organs during the course of the procedure. LIMITING MULTIPLE PREGNANCY We have been informed of the risks of multiple pregnancy. After discussion of the risks of multiple pregnancy, my husband and I have decided to have: (choose one or both) A maximum of ________ (number of pre-embryos) placed into my uterus. _____________________ (initials of husband and wife) A number of pre-embryos to be determined by the physician and the embryologist immediately prior to pre-embryo placement into the uterus so as to maximize the possibility of pregnancy and minimize the risk of multiple gestation. We understand that a scoring system will be used to grade pre-embryo quality to indicate the number of pre-embryos to transfer. There is no guarantee that this technique will successfully limit the chance of multiple gestations. _____________________ (initials of husband and wife) We have been informed and understand that if we wish to cryopreserve (freeze) any fertilized eggs not transferred to the uterus, we will be required to sign a separate consent document. We have been informed and understand that if we, as husband and wife, cannot agree or do not consent to either the freezing of fertilized eggs or donation, we must either limit the number of eggs to be inseminated to the same number that are to be transferred to the Wife's uterus or agree to disposal of extra fertilized eggs. If excess pre-embryos are not cryopreserved our chance of achieving a pregnancy may ultimately be decreased. (Choose one option.) We consent to cryopreserve extra pre-embryos. (separate consent required) We do not wish to have any pre-embryos cryopreserved and consent to: The disposal of any non transferred pre-embryos. _____________________ (initials of husband and wife) Donation of extra pre-embryos. (separate consent required) We here indicate our decision for only ______________ (number of eggs/all) to be inseminated (mixed with sperm) _________________ (initials of husband and wife) The undersigned wife and husband hereby knowingly and voluntarily release ARHC, Mark Perloe, M.D., Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, Roman Pyrzak, Ph.D. and all of their respective employees and agents, from any and all actions, claims, costs, expenses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, damages, settlements, compromises, judgments and any other losses or expenses they incur or for which they may be responsible with respect to such discarding of either fertilized or unfertilized eggs. CONSENT We hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless ARHC, Mark Perloe, M.D., Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank and all of their respective employees and agents, from and against any and all such actions, claims, costs, expenses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, damages, settlements, compromises, judgments and any other losses or expenses they incur or for which they may be responsible with respect to any claim or legal action arising out of the egg donation. We have been informed and understand that ARHC is a tradename under which Mark Perloe, M.D. practices medicine. We have been informed and understand that neither ARHC nor Mark Perloe, M.D. are employees or agents of Georgia Baptist Medical Center. We understand and acknowledge that Mark Perloe, M.D. is an independent practicing physician and in our discussions with representatives of ARHC and with Dr. Perloe, and in reaching our decision evidenced herein, we have been dealing with and relying upon the ARHC and Mark Perloe, M.D. The undersigned wife and husband acknowledge by their signatures below that they have read the foregoing and that all questions asked have been answered to their satisfaction, they understand the answers, and they acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Agreement.

Now, therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties acknowledge and agree as follows: The Prospective Parents are entering into this written contractual Agreement with the Egg Donor and her Husband, whereby the Egg Donor shall undergo medical testing and psychological testing and screening, fertility drug therapy, transvaginal aspiration of her egg(s) (a medical procedure which has been fully explained to the Egg Donor and to her Husband by the physician performing the procedure, which is hereby acknowledged), so that the Egg Donor's egg(s) shall be removed from her body, fertilized with the semen of the Natural Father/Sperm Donor, and the said egg(s), having become fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s), will be implanted into the body of the Recipient Mother for the purpose of carrying the pregnancy to term. Any and all child/children born thereby shall in all respects be the child/children of the Natural Father and Recipient Mother. The terms "child" and "children" as used herein, shall include all children born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s) into the Recipient Mother pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the legal parentage of all such child or children shall be determined pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Prospective Parents assume all legal and parental responsibilities for any and all child or children as defined herein, born as a result of the implantation of the ovum/zygote into the Recipient Mother, irrespective of whether any such child or children may possess congenital abnormalities or defects, and the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that they have been advised of and counseled with respect to, and are fully aware of the risk of such abnormalities and/or defects. The Egg Donor and her Husband, based on her/their information and belief, represent that the Egg Donor is capable of producing healthy, normal egg(s) and agree that neither the Egg Donor nor the Egg Donor's Husband will ever attempt to form a parent-child relationship with any child or children that may be born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/ pre-embryo(s) into the Recipient Mother pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. All parties hereby agree to undergo medical evaluations by physicians and psychological evaluations by psychologists and/or psychiatrists licensed in the State of Georgia. The Prospective Parents shall pay for the cost of said medical evaluations and psychological evaluations. Prior to their medical evaluations and/or psychological evaluations, a medical release form authorizing the release of all such medical information and/or psychological information to ARHC will be completed. All parties hereto also agree to undergo such psychological counseling and/or therapy and as recommended by said physicians, psychologists and/or psychiatrists prior to and while this Agreement is in effect. Prior to undergoing any medical procedure contemplated hereunder, the Egg Donor shall undergo a medical examination under the direction of and in the sole discretion of the ARHC physician to determine whether her physical health and well-being are satisfactory. All parties shall undergo testing for sexually transmitted diseases (including, but not limited to, Human Immunodeficiency Virus) in order to protect the health of the Recipient Mother and the child. The Egg Donor and the Prospective Parents also agree to undergo such medical testing that the physician recommends prior to and while this Agreement is in effect. The Egg Donor further agrees to abstain from all sexual activity, including intercourse, that would allow the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (including, but not limited to Human Immunodeficiency Virus). This provision of abstinence is waived if the Egg Donor is married or cohabitating with a man and her partner uses condoms. In such event, this waiver of abstinence shall be limited to the sexual activity between the Egg Donor and her Husband/Cohabitant. During the term of this Agreement, the parties agree to immediately inform the physician at ARHC in writing of any change in their circumstances which may affect their health or any of their duties or obligations under this Agreement. These changes include, but are not limited to, any illness or death of a party, any exposure to any toxic chemical or substance, any change in physical condition or mental condition, any change of address, any change of employment, any loss of employment, change in insurance coverage, any exposure to any communicable illness. The Egg Donor further agrees to adhere to all medical instructions given to her by the physician. The Egg Donor agrees not to drink any alcoholic beverages, not to use any illegal drugs, not to use any nonprescription medications or prescribed medications without the knowledge of and consent from the physicians, commencing one month prior to donating eggs. The Egg Donor further agrees to submit to such medical test or procedures as the physician deems necessary or advisable, including, but not limited to, blood sampling, urine sampling or drug screening. Failure to conform to all or any of the provisions of this paragraph shall constitute a breach of the Agreement by the Egg Donor. The Recipient Mother and the Natural Father agree to submit to the ARHC full payment in advance to the Egg Donor for which ARHC will arrange prompt payment pursuant to this Agreement. Medical costs and expenses relating to the medical screening of the Egg Donor and her Husband, the medical screening of the Recipient Mother and the Natural Father, all medication and all surgical procedures, laboratory fees, pharmaceutical costs, etc., are the sole responsibility of the Prospective Parents and shall be deducted from the deposit to be paid in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

Said risks have been explained to the Egg Donor and her Husband by a physician and are understood. The Egg Donor and her Husband agree to and hereby assume all such risks, and hereby release the Prospective Parents, ARHC, their agents and employees, including the professionals and others contemplated and/or involved in any aspect of this Agreement, from any and all legal or financial liability, except for professional negligence. All eggs produced by the Egg Donor pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be and are the property of the Prospective Parents, jointly and severally. The Prospective Parents, jointly and severally, shall have the sole right to determine the disposition of said egg(s). In recognition of the Prospective Parents' obligation to pay for the Egg Donor's eggs and services, the Prospective Parents agree to pay the amounts indicated in Exhibit A which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The Egg Donor and/or her Husband shall maintain her/their existing medical insurance plan during the entire term of this Agreement. In the event that the Egg Donor's medical insurance does not cover catastrophic illness and major hospitalization, the Prospective Parents shall be financially responsible for all costs and expenses of medical care required by the Egg Donor relating to the subject medical procedures. Coverage under said insurance shall commence prior to the transvaginal aspiration and continue in force until all medical procedures contemplated being done to the Egg Donor are completed. The entire amount (excluding costs of other procedure related medical care) anticipated by this Agreement shall be covered in the deposit paid to ARHC prior to the commencement of the transvaginal aspiration of the Egg Donor. The Egg Donor and her Husband agree that she/they will not seek to view or contact the child or children after the child's or children's birth(s), nor will the Egg Donor and her Husband seek to view or meet the Prospective Parents or their families, unless this provision is expressly waived in writing by each of the Prospective Parents. The parties agree that they will not provide any information to the public, news media or any other individual regarding the specifics of their involvement in egg donation or the involvement of any other party in egg donation or the identity of any party herein without the express written permission of all other parties hereto. Since any child or children born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s) into the Recipient Mother is the genetic product of the Natural Father or Sperm Donor and the Egg Donor, it may in the future be necessary to obtain information of a medical nature from a party to this Agreement.

You ask about the risk of transmitting HIV by ICSI. Here is some general information. Both free HIV and cell-associated virus is found in semen. The virus is not found in the DNA of the sperm. Sperm preparation procedures to separate the sperm from the seminal plasma have been used in order to reduce the risk of transmission. Whether any virus is carried into the uterus by adhering to the sperm surface is a concern. Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoea and Ureaplasma urealyticum do attach to sperm so this mode of pathogen transport is not uncommon. Since sperm may express HIV gp120 receptors (Ashida & Scofield, 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 84, 3394), it is reasonable to postulate that the virus might adhere to spermatozoa. Artificial insemination has resulted in seroconversion of some women (Stewart et al., 1985, Lancet II, 581-2) but insemination with washed samples has been reported to be safe. Insemination of 29 women resulted in 17 pregnancies and no infections (Semprini et al., 1992,Lancet 340, 1317-19). However, virus shedding into the ejaculate depends on many factors and no PCR studies have yet been published to define whether viruswas present in the ejaculate and was absent after sperm preparation for artificial insemination. Adherence of HIV to spermatozoa may occur but it is probably not a major factor in heterosexual transmission. You may want to read one of my reviews on sexual transmission: Alexander, N. J. 1990 Sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus; virus entry into the male and female genital tract. Fertil. Steril., 54, 1-18.

Design: Data were collected from all the procedures performed (5/92-12/94). Comparisons of ART data was performed between SART data collected from the annual (1992, the latest report available) summary report. Main Outcome Measures: The outcomes include the results of all ART procedures. A comparison of these outcomes was performed between IVF procedures only, due to the higher number of these procedures. Results: The Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre program initiated 100 cycles (as of 12/31/94) of ART treatment, including FET and donor oocyte. Of these, 2 cycles initiated (1-canceled) were IVF-natural cycles, no pregnancy achieved; 77 cycles initiated (13 - canceled) were IVFstimulated cycles, with 30.6% deliveries per retrieval (SART=16.8%); 5 cycles initiated (2 canceled) of GIFT with 33.3% deliveries per retrieval, 16 cycles initiated (4 canceled) were FET, No pregnancy achieved. In 31.2% or our cases, the women were greater than or equal to 40 years old (SART=12.6%). Male factor was present in 64% of the cases (SART=23.5%). Conclusions: The patient age and percentage of male factors were significantly higher at Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre then those reported by SART. However, the outcome as reported by deliveries or pregnancies per retrieval or transfer were significantly higher than those reported by SART. As reported by SART only 8.7% of the ART programs reported success rate of >30% deliveries per retrieval. This indicates that the success rate of this ART program is equivalent to the results of the top 10% ART programs in the nation.

For Husbands Only! Fertility problems affect both men and women. As many as two out of every five couples with fertility problems require treatment of both spouses, and in 25 percent of the couples their fertility problem rests with the husband alone. Fertility diagnosis and treatment is lengthy, time consuming and expensive. The process can frequently be eased and shortened by both partners working together with their fertility physicians from the beginning. In addition to the tests done on a woman, it is often necessary to perform a semen analysis to be sure a husband has sufficient normally functioning sperm for fertilization to occur. Human conception is a difficult and complex process, even under the best conditions. Normally functioning sperm will ultimately complete the path to fertilization. This means first breaking through cervical mucous, traveling up the length of the uterus and entering the fallopian tube. Once in the fallopian tube, sperm must meet an egg, penetrate the eggs protective coating and inner membrane, and finally, fertilize the egg. Then, and only then, has fertilization occurred. To increase a couple's chances for conception it may be necessary for the husband to undergo special sperm studies. Sometimes a semen condition will not respond to medical treatment. In these circumstances, it may be possible to treat the sperm in the laboratory in an attempt to enhance fertilization. More information about these tests are available from your physician. In order to obtain an optimal semen specimen, the husband may be requested to refrain from ejaculation for at least 48 hours prior to providing a specimen. DO NOT ABSTAIN for longer than 5 to 7 days, as the quality of sperm decreases with prolonged storage in the body. A private room is provided near the Reproductive Assays Laboratory for the collection of semen specimens. The wife may accompany her husband if he wishes. Many factors affect the quality of sperm produced by an individual at any given time. These factors include items such as: unusual stress, fever, certain medications, or any injury to the testicles. Therefore, the husband will be asked to complete a brief reproductive history as well as note any temporary conditions which may affect sperm quality. When making an appointment for semen analysis, please inform us if there has been a fever or illness within the last three months as this may affect the specimen. If the wife's ovulatory cycle is being monitored for purposes of follicular maturation studies, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer, the physician's office should be alerted if any conditions occur which may affect sperm quality, such as illness or extreme stress. This will enable the physician to evaluate the condition for potential adverse effects upon the husband's sperm production at the time of his wife's ovulation. During ovulation, one or more "fresh" semen specimens may be needed to increase chances of conception. The entire ARHC staff have had special training in fertility problems. Please feel free to ask questions at any time, as we all want to help you in working with your physician. Since fertility problems affect the couple, we want to remind you that husbands are welcome, and encouraged to attend all consultations and appointments with their wives.

Of these, approximately 50% are due to cases of low male fertility. Artificial insemination, utilizing donor semen, has become an acceptable alternative to many of these patients. It is estimated that in 1983 over 20,000 births in the United States were the result of donor insemination. Artificial insemination utilizing an anonymous donor, may be necessary for a number of reasons. The absence of sperm in the husband is, by far, the most common. In other cases, husbands may have a low sperm count or immotile sperm which are incapable of fertilizing an egg. Other men are unable to ejaculate because of neurologic disorders. Donor insemination may also be indicated when the husband is a carrier or a victim of a serious inherited disease. Although adoption can be an attractive alternative as well, there has been a growing scarcity of adoptable babies and prospective parents may have to wait a long time before adoption becomes possible. Artificial insemination, in selected cases, may have certain advantages. The child conceived by artificial insemination is biologically closer to the parents both physically and, in some cases, emotionally. The wife has an opportunity to experience pregnancy, birth, nursing, and all the other roles of motherhood she wishes. Arrangements will be made for your physician to obtain frozen specimens from a local "sperm bank." The bank is directed by a physician assisted by staff with a special interest in male infertility and who maintain the highest standards possible. The physician is a member of the American Fertility Society and observes their guidelines for donor insemination. Donors are carefully selected by obtaining the donors' background in depth, taking a careful history to rule out hereditary diseases, chronic infections, or any venereal diseases. The majority of the donors are knowledgeable graduate students who, in most cases, have demonstrated previous fertility. Donors may be chosen to represent the race, blood type, and physical characteristics of the husband, including eye and hair color as well as complexion and height. All donors are screened for AIDS and hepatitis, and their specimens are cultured for venereal disease. The arrangement with donors are kept in strict secrecy and it is impossible to connect a donor with a recipient since these records are never established. At the beginning of the insemination process, both the husband and wife are asked to sign a consent form. The husband consents to the artificial insemination of his wife and agrees that if the wife should bear any child as a result of the artificial insemination process that the child will be treated by law as if it were the husband's natural child. Naturally, the outcome of any pregnancy would be subject to the same risks and possible complications affecting pregnancies in the general population. Artificial insemination has become an acceptable and recognized practice throughout the world. The moral, philosophical, and religious aspects must be considered by each couple on an individual basis. Therefore, we ask you to visit with a counselor prior to initiating therapy. If further information is needed to help you with the decision, please feel free to ask your physician. ARHC Homepage This HTML code is Copyright (C) 1995 by Mark Perloe, M.D., P.C. Atlanta, GA, USA.

Through the cervix into the uterine cavity: intrauterine insemination. Through the cervix and uterine cavity into the fallopian tube: intratubal insemination. Intracervical insemination is performed by placing an "unprocessed" semen specimen into the cervical mucus and then placing a cervical cap or specially designed vaginal tampon to hold the semen against the cervix. Success rates with intracervical insemination have varied widely, but unfortunately, only 10 to 15% of couples will obtain a pregnancy following 4 to 6 well timed cycles of insemination. Intrauterine insemination was developed in an attempt to improve the chance of pregnancy. Intrauterine insemination involves both a special processing of the semen to maximize its fertility potential and its placement into the uterine cavity. Thus the maximum number of sperm are placed in close proximity to the egg. Recent scientific studies found a significantly increased number of patients had living sperm within the fallopian tubes and peritoneal cavity surrounding the ovary following intrauterine insemination. Couples underwent either intracervical or intrauterine insemination 2 to 4 hours prior to a laparoscopy. At laparoscopy, fluid from the peritoneal cavity was sampled for the presence of live sperm. He found live sperm 50% of the time following intracervical insemination and 85% of the time following intrauterine insemination. Undoubtedly this is only 1 element involved in the establishment of pregnancy, but considering the magnitude of differences between the 2 routes (intracervical versus intrauterine insemination) one can justify intrauterine insemination as a clinical treatment. The placement of sperm into the uterine cavity involves a special processing procedure of the semen sample. The seminal fluid that contains the sperm does not normally pass the cervical mucus barrier and gain access to the uterine cavity. Thus it is generally best not to artificially place the seminal fluid into the uterine cavity. The first step of the semen processing procedure is to separate the sperm from the seminal fluid so that only the sperm are placed beyond the cervical mucus into the uterine cavity. Secondly, the semen processing procedure is performed to maximize the husband's fertility potential. In some cases the artificial insemination is performed to overcome a sperm abnormality. A semen processing procedure is selected which will attempt to specifically improve upon the identified abnormality. The exact type of semen processing will be individualized after the best technique has been determined for the husband. He will be given specific instructions on how to collect the semen sample and what particular semen preparation procedure we will utilize. Once a couple has entered the insemination program the semen samples will be monitored carefully at each insemination procedure and we will make any necessary adjustments in either collection or processing. A detailed assessment of each semen sample allows us to adjust, if necessary, any factors that may maximize your overall chance of pregnancy. Kerin and Associates performed a randomized clinical trial of artificial insemination. In this study 30 couples, all of whom have been attempting pregnancy for at least 3 years were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: A single timed intercourse on the day of ovulation as predicted by temperature charts. A single timed intercourse on the day of ovulation as predicted by ovulation predictor kits (LH surge). A single intrauterine insemination on the day of ovulation as determined by ovulation predictor kits (LH surge). Less than 3% of the timed intercourse cycles resulted in pregnancy while 9 of 39 intrauterine inseminations resulted in pregnancy (23%). Intratubal insemination has been investigated in an attempt to improve upon the success rates already obtained by intrauterine insemination. The same processing techniques as used for intrauterine insemination separates the sperm from the seminal fluid and maximizes the sperm's fertility potential. Intratubal insemination, however, involves a more difficult and involved technique of placing the sperm. This requires the use of a specially designed catheter that is placed through the cervix, into the uterine cavity, and into the uterine opening of the fallopian tube. This is technically a much more difficult procedure than intrauterine insemination and may carry with it more risk. The use of hysteroscopy or ultrasound is necessary to guide the catheter appropriately into the fallopian tube. Unfortunately, studies have not demonstrated an significant improvement in pregnancy rates with this technique. In couples where the husband has very low sperm count or motility this technique may possibly improve the odds of pregnancy more significantly than intrauterine insemination. There is also the possibility that this method may be superior to intrauterine insemination in couples where a strong antisperm antibody is suspected. At this point, intratubal insemination is investigational, but the initial results are encouraging. Clinical indications for intra-uterine insemination. A. Cervical factors Mucus - poor quality and/or quality Good cervical mucus should change its physical characteristics so that it can store, mature, and transport sperm from the cervix where it is deposited to the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes where fertilization occurs. Abnormalities in the production of "fertile" cervical mucus are sometimes correctable with medical treatment. When medical treatment fails to normalize cervical mucus production, intrauterine insemination is utilized to bypass the cervical mucus and place the sperm directly into the uterine cavity. Anatomic - Stenosis The cervical openings can sometimes be excessively narrowed, causing a "stenotic cervix". This is usually a result of a prior surgical procedure performed on the cervix such as a conization, but it can also occur after vaginal delivery, or in some cases be congenital in origin. Cervical stenosis can result in poor mucus production and decreased sperm transport. If an insemination devise can be passed through the narrowed cervix, this problem can be bypassed. Immunologic - presence of antibodies directed against sperm A woman's body does not normally make antibodies that are specifically targeted towards killing or immobilizing sperm. As part of our natural defense mechanismwe develop an immune response to foreign material such as viruses and bacteria which allows us to fight off infections. Part of this immunological response is the making of a specific antibody that is targeted towards the bacteria, virus, or foreign tissue. The antibody is manufactured by our white blood cells. Although sperm are foreign cells to a women's body, they do not usually trigger an immunological response. In some instances however, for reasons that are unclear, some women develop an immunological response that produce antibodies directed against sperm. These antibodies may appear in the blood, tubal fluid, uterine fluid, or cervical mucus. When these antibodies occur in the woman's reproductive tract they can immobilize and kill the sperm before they have a chance to reach the egg within the fallopian tube. A number of therapies have been proposed to overcome antisperm antibodies: Condom Therapy The use of condoms limits the exposure of sperm to the female genital tract, hopefully reducing the stimulus to produce further antibodies. This does not appear to be successful. It is only applicable for sperm antibodies in the women. Steroid Therapy The use of high dose steroids (cortisone-like medication) suppresses the immunological system and decreases all antibody formation. This technique has resulted in serious side effects and is rarely recommended. Intrauterine Insemination Placement of a large number of sperm within close proximity to the egg, bypassing cervical mucus antibodies. Intratubal Insemination Placement of a large number of motile sperm at the point of fertilization within the fallopian tube bypassing the cervical mucus and uterine fluid which may contain antisperm antibodies. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Gamete intrafallopian tube transfer, In Vitro Fertilization, etc.) Placing sperm and egg with direct contact with each other, thus minimizing the effects of antibodies in all areas of the reproductive tract. Short of the assisted reproductive technologies, intrauterine insemination has been shown to be the most effective mode of therapy. Experimental evidence has indicated that antisperm antibody levels tend to be the highest concentration within the cervical mucus. Bypassing the cervical mucus, therefore, places the maximum number of sperm beyond its biggest barrier. Antibody concentrations with the uterine fluid and fallopian tube fluid are often not great enough to immobilize all of the sperm if sufficient numbers are placed in the uterine cavity. Thus, placement of a large number of motile sperm within the uterine cavity offers the advantages. Intratubal insemination is presently under investigation with the hopes that this will further improve results by placing the sperm even closer to the point of fertilization. Intratubal insemination, however, is technically more difficult, expensive and possibly may carry a greater risk of complications. B. Male factors Sperm quality - Defects in sperm production such as decreased sperm count and/or diminished sperm motility. Any sperm production problem that results in a decreased number of normal motile sperm can result in a decreased male fertility potential. A normal ejaculate contains millions of normally formed motile sperm. It is estimated that following intercourse only a few hundred sperm make it to the point of fertilization. This is because the vast majority of sperm are lost from their point of deposition in the vagina as they make their way up the reproductive tract to the point of fertilization in the fallopian tube. When a decreased number of normally functioning sperm are ejaculated into the vagina during intercourse there is a decreased chance that an adequate number of normal spermatozoa will reach the crucial point of fertilization by providing an increased number of sperm in closer proximity to the egg. Although insemination procedures can provide an increased number of sperm at the fertilization site, the sperm reaching the egg must be able to penetrate and fertilize the egg. Insemination procedures can not improve the chance of pregnancy if the sperm are unable to fertilize the egg. The ability to improve fertility through artificial insemination is highly depended upon the sperm defect and its severity. Immunological - sperm directed autoantibodies in the male reproductive tract. Sperm are normally kept isolated from the male immunological system by the blood-testis barrier. Under normal condition sperm within the male reproductive tract never stimulate the male immunological system to produce antibodies against sperm. In certain situations however, this separation mechanism fails and sperm are exposed to the immunological system, stimulating the production of antisperm antibody. The antibody is present in the seminal fluid which is mixed with the sperm at the time of ejaculation. The antibody coats the sperm and can immobilize them, cause the sperm to react adversely to the cervical mucus, or disrupt their ability to penetrate the egg. The process of intrauterine insemination of intratubal insemination attempts to select out those sperm that have not been coated with antibody and place as many as possible in close proximity to the egg. The insemination procedure is sometimes coupled with steroid therapy in the male in order to decrease the amount of antibody production. Ejaculatory Any sexual disfunction or ejaculatory abnormality that interrupts the normal placement of sperm during intercourse reduces the possibility of pregnancy. Depending on the specific problem being treated, one of the artificial insemination procedures should be ideal for placing the sperm in the female reproductive tract. C. Miscellaneous Abnormal Huhner's Post Coital Test The post coital test is a clinical exam that checks for the number of motile sperm within the cervical mucus following intercourse. A normal post coital test requires that an adequate number of motile sperm be deposited correctly during ejaculation and are able to survive for the appropriate length of time in the cervical mucus. A normal post coital test is associated with a good fertility potential. A poor post coital test often reflects a sperm production problem, sperm placement problem, or hostile cervical mucus. A persistently abnormal post coital test is often an indicator for an artificial insemination procedure, regardless of the etiology. Infertility of unclear ediology. Some couples remain infertile in spite of the fact that a complete infertility evaluation has not elucidated a clear cause for the infertility. Many of these couples will be helped through intrauterine insemination alone or in combination with superovulation. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is thought that the placement of an increased number of motile sperm higher in the reproductive tract is responsible for the increased chance of pregnancy. This may be because some patients have an undetectable abnormality in sperm transport from the cervix to the fallopian tube. Success of conception with artificial insemination A cumulative pregnancy rate (the overall chance of a couple obtaining a pregnancy with four to six cycles of intrauterine insemination) averages about 25% (1 in 4 couples will achieve a pregnancy). The result varies significantly however, depending on the reason that the insemination is being performed. Male factor infertility with severe abnormalities and sperm count or motility have the worse prognosis with only 10 to 15% of couples achieving a pregnancy. Male factor infertility with only moderate abnormalities, couples with cervical factor or immunological factor infertility has been shown to have the best prognosis with 35 to 40% of couples achieving a pregnancy. Unfortunately there is no direct correlation between the absolute values of sperm count, motility, morphology, and the chance of obtaining a pregnancy. Certainly the more severe the sperm production abnormality, the less likely pregnancy will occur. Pregnancy has been achieved with as few as 400,000 progressively motile sperm placed within the uterus at the time of insemination. Thus it is usually impossible for the physician to give a specific percentage chance of success for a given couple. If a minimum number of motile sperm are present most physicians will recommend a trial of intrauterine insemination as an appropriate course of therapy. We recommend a 4 to 6 cycle trial of intrauterine insemination. Most pregnancies that occur as a result of insemination do so in the first 4 cycles of therapy. During those 4 cycles the chance of obtaining a pregnancy is about the same each cycle. This means that the chance of becoming pregnant on the 3rd or 4th cycles is similar to the chance of obtaining a pregnancy on the 1st or 2nd cycle. Beyond 4 cycles pregnancies are uncommon and beyond 6 cycles are highly unlikely. Because pregnancy rates vary considerably depending on a couple's individual situation your chance of success will have to be individualized. Through your course of insemination therapy, every attempt will be made to maximize the chance of success by minimizing all other possible factors that may lesson fertility potential. Care will be taken to individualize semen collection procedures, sperm preparation procedures, and the insemination technique to maximize results. The semen specimen will be analyzed at each insemination procedure and all results monitored. Intratubal insemination is presently being investigated to determine whether further improvement in pregnancy rates can be obtained by use of this technique. Results are preliminary but there is a possibility that in certain situations intratubal insemination may offer a better chance of pregnancy than intrauterine insemination. Possible complications of intrauterine insemination. Fortunately the side effects, adverse reactions, or possible complications from intrauterine insemination are infrequent and rarely severe. All of the potential problems associated with intrauterine insemination are associated with the bypassing of the normal cervical mucus barrier to the female reproductive tract and the artificial placement of sperm beyond the cervical mucus. The possible problems associated with artificial insemination can be categorized as follows: Uterine cramping Uterine cramping will occur in approximately 5% of all patients undergoing intrauterine insemination. The suspected causes of uterine cramping are as follows: Introduction of the catheter into the uterine cavity which may act as a foreign body causing a cramping reflex. Disruption of a small portion of the endometrium (uterine lining) by the insemination cannula causing the release of prostaglandin (a hormone responsible for causing intrauterine cramps) leading to cramping 2 to 4 hours following the procedures. Residual seminal fluid prostaglandins remaining in the semen despite the wash procedures resulting in cramping occurring within a few minutes following the actual insemination procedure. Uterine cramping is not a serious problem and can be easily treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication such as Anaprox. It does not denote infection. Mild spotting Mild spotting occurs in approximately 1% of the patients following intrauterine insemination. This spotting is a result of minor irritation to the cervical glands caused by threading the insemination cannula through the cervical os into the uterine cavity. This bleeding will usually subside without any treatment within several hours of the procedure. Gastrointestinal Upset Mild nausea or diarrhea occur in approximately 0.5% of patients undergoing intrauterine insemination. Like uterine cramping, this is usually secondary to the presence of prostaglandins which can be upsetting to the gastrointestinal tract. This usually subsides within a few hours of the insemination procedure. Pelvic Infection The potentially most serious complication and fortunately the most infrequent, is infection. In a recent study from the University of California at Irving, less than 0.2% of their patients developed pelvic infections following over 3,000 intrauterine inseminations during a 3 year period. Most studies to date have shown less than 1% of couples experience pelvic infection following intrauterine insemination. Although this complication is uncommon, if it occurs the results can be devastating. An infection in the uterine cavity can spread to the fallopian tubes and the surrounding pelvic structures, which can lead to the need for hospitalization, and intravenous antibiotics. The infection can cause permanent scarring within the fallopian tubes and surrounding structures, leaving a patient sterile. The reason for pelvic infection following intrauterine insemination is that the normal mucus barrier of the cervix is broken at the time of the placement of the catheter. If an aggressive bacteria is present in the cervical mucus or in the sperm placed into the uterine cavity, infection may occur. It appears that patients who have had previous pelvic infections or certain types of tubal surgery may be at increased risk of infection. This increased risk is likely due to the decreased natural defense mechanisms resulting from previous tubal damage. The use of artificial insemination in patients at increased risk for infection should be weighed carefully. There are many times, however, when the potential benefit from intrauterine insemination in these patients outweighs the potential risk. The early symptoms of pelvic infection are cervical or uterine tenderness during intercourse, lower abdominal pain made worse by movement or activity, fever, and possibly a foul or bloody vaginal discharge. If an infection follows artificial insemination, the symptoms generally begin within a few days to a week after the insemination procedure. Should a patient who has undergone artificial insemination begin experiencing any symptoms of pelvic infection, they should notify their physician immediately and if infection is suspected, promptly start antibiotic therapy. The Insemination Procedure Timing of the Insemination Procedure The proper timing of artificial insemination is vital when attempting to maximize success. A number of techniques have been developed to insure optimum timing so that the sperm and egg will meet at the time of ovulation. Ovulation Predictor Kits Ovulation is triggered by the release of LH from the pituitary gland. The ovulation predictor kits measure the presence of the LH hormone in the urine. The daily measurement of urinary LH concentrations with the predictor kits will accurately predict ovulation in most patients. We recommend that our patients test their urine before noon. When testing urine in this manner, most patients will ovulate in the morning following a positive test. Although the ovulation predictor kits are expensive, they ultimately save money by eliminating the need for extra inseminations per cycle. The improved accuracy of the insemination is also more likely to make it successful early in the treatment program, lessening the need for multiple insemination cycles. The majority of patient will have their insemination timed in this manner. Ultrasound Timing Some patients will be undergoing specialized ovulation induction treatment for the purpose of stimulating ovulation. These patients often have ovulation triggered artificially with an injection of human chronic gonadotropin (HCG). In this case the HCG is often administered in the early evening as directed by the physician with artificial insemination scheduled 36 to 40 hours after the injection. The timing for insemination timing is a result of a slightly different timing of egg release that results from the use of HCG vs. the natural LH surge. Scheduling Artificial Insemination When you experience an LH surge please call Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre 265-3662 prior to 4:00 p.m. You will need to tell the receptionist that you have surged and need an appointment for an insemination the following morning. Inseminations are scheduled between 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. Monday through Friday.If you surge over a weekend or on a holiday, please call the office number and have the answering service page the physician on call who will give you further instructions as to when to come in for your insemination.

Most authorities define these patients as primarily infertile if they have been unable to achieve a pregnancy after one year of unprotected intercourse. Conception normally is achieved within twelve months in 80-85% of couples who use no contraceptive measures, and persons presenting after this time should therefore be regarded as possibly infertile and should be e valuated. Data available over the past twenty years reveal that in approximately 30% of cases pathology is found in the man alone, and in another 20% both the man and woman are abnormal. Therefore, the male factor is at least partly responsible in about 50% of infertile couples. Important issues related to the evaluation of the male factor include the most appropriate time for the male evaluation, the most efficient format for a comprehensive male exam, and definition of rationale and effective medical and surgical regimens in the treatment of these disorders. It is extremely important in the evaluation of infertility to consider the couple as a unit in evaluation and treatment and to proceed in a parallel investigative manner until a problem is uncovered. It has been shown that the longer a couple remains subfertile, the worse their chance for an effective cure. Many couples experience significant apprehension and anxiety after only a few months of failure to conceive. Unduly prolonged unprotected intercourse should not be advocated before a workup of the man is instituted. Initial screening of the man should be considered whenever the patient presents with the chief complaint of infertility. This initial evaluation should be rapid, non-invasive and cost effective. Of interest is the fact that pregnancy rates of up to 50% have been reported when only the woman has been investigated and treated even when the man was found to have moderately severe abnormalities of semen quality. MALE REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis The hypothalamus is the integrative center of the reproductive axis and receives messages from both the central nervous system and the testes to regulate the production and secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides have both inhibitory and stipulatory influence on the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases GnRH in a pulsatile nature which appears to be essential for stimulating the production and release of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Interestingly and paradoxically, after the initial stimulation of these gonadotropins, the exposure to constant GnRH results in inhibition of their release. LH and FSH are produced in the anterior pituitary and are secreted episodically in response to the pulsatile release of GnRH. LH and FSH both bind to specific receptors on the Leydig cells and Sertoli cells within the testis. Testosterone, the major secretory product of the testes, is a primary inhibitor of LH secretion in males. Testosterone may be metabolized in peripheral tissue to the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone or the potent estrogen estradiol. These androgens and estrogens act independently to modulate LH secretion. The mechanism of feedback control of FSH is regulated by a Sertoli cell product called inhibin. Decreases in spermatogenesis are accompanied by decreased production of inhibin and this reduction in negative feedback is associated with reciprocal elevation of FSH levels. Isolated increased levels of FSH constitute an important, sensitive marker of the state of the germinal epithelium. Prolactin also has a complex inter-relationship with the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. In males with hyperprolactinemia, the prolactin tends to inhibit the production of GnRH. Besides inhibiting LH secretion and testosterone production, elevated prolactin levels may have a direct effect on the central nervous system. In individuals with elevated prolactin levels who are given testosterone, libido and sexual function do not return to normal as long as the prolactin levels are elevated. The Testes Leydig; Cells Testosterone is secreted episodically from the Leydig cells in response to LH pulses and has a diurnal pattern, with the peak level in the early morning and the trough level in the late afternoon or early evening. In the intact testis, LH receptors decrease or down-regulate after exogenous LH administration. Large doses of GnRH or its analogs can reduce the numbers of LH receptors and therefore inhibit LH secretion. This has been applied clinically to cause medical castration in men with prostate cancer. Estrogen inhibits some enzymes in the testosterone synthetic pathway and therefore directly effects testosterone production. There also appears to be an intratesticular ultrashort loop feedback such that exogenous testosterone will override the effect of LH and inhibit testosterone production. In normal males, only 2% of testosterone is free or unbound. 44% is bound to testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin or TeBG, also called sex hormone-binding globulin. 54% of testosterone is bound to albumin and other proteins. These steroid-binding proteins modulate androgen action. TeBG has a higher affinity for testosterone than for estradiol, and changes in TeBG alter or amplify the hormonal milieu. TeBG levels are increased by estrogens, thyroid administration and cirrhosis of the liver and may be decreased by androgens, growth hormone and obesity. The biological actions of androgens are exerted on target organs that contain specific androgen receptor proteins. Testosterone leaves the circulation and enters the target cells where it is converted to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone by an enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. The major functions of androgens in target tissues include 1) regulation of gonadotropin secretion by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis; 2) initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis; 3) differentiation of the internal and external male genital system during fetal development; and 4) promotion of sexual maturation at puberty. Seminiferous Tubules The seminiferous tubules contain all the germ cells at various stages of maturation and their supporting Sertoli cells. These account for 85-90% of the testicular volume. Sertoli cells are a fixed-population of non-dividing support cells. They rest on the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules. They are linked by tight junctions. These tight junctions coupled with the close approximation of the myoid cells of the peritubular contractile cell layers serve to form the blood-testis barrier. This barrier provides a unique microenvironment that facilitates spermatogenesis and maintains these germ cells in an immunologically privileged location. This isolation is important because spermatozoa are produced during puberty, long after the period of self-recognition by the immune system. If these developing spermatozoa were not immunologically protected, they would be recognized as foreign and attacked by the body's immune system. Sertoli cells appear to be involved with the nourishment of developing germ cells as well as the phagocytosis of damaged cells. Spermatogonia and young spermatocytes are lower down in the basal compartment of the seminiferous tubule, whereas mature spermatocytes and spermatids are sequestered higher up in the adluminal compartment. The germinal cells or the spermatogenic cells are arranged in an orderly manner from the basement membrane up to the lumen. Spermatogonia lie directly on the basement membrane, and next in order, progressing up to the lumen, are found the primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes and spermatids. There are felt to be 13 different germ cells representing different stages in the developmental process. Spermatogenesis is a complex process whereby primitive stem cells or spermatogonia, either divide to reproduce themselves for stem cell renewal or they divide to produce daughter cells that will later become spermatocytes. The spermatocytes eventually divide and give rise to mature cell lines that eventually give rise to spermatids. The spermatids then undergo a transformation into a spermatozoa. This transformation includes nuclear condensation, acrosome formation, loss of most of the cytoplasm, development of a tail and arrangement of the mitochondria into the middle piece of the sperm which basically becomes the engine room to power the tail. Groups of germ cells tend to develop and pass through spermatogenesis together. This sequence of developing germ cells is called a generation. These generations of germ cells are basically in the same stage of development. There are six stages of seminiferous epithelium development. The progression from stage one through stage six constitutes one cycle. In humans the duration of each cycle is approximately 16 days and 4.6 cycles are required for a mature sperm to develop from early spermatogonia. Therefore, the duration of the entire spermatogenic cycle in humans is 4.6 cycles times 16 days equals 74 days. Hormonal Control of Spermatogenesis An intimate structural and functional relationship exists between the two separate compartments of the testis, ie. the seminiferous tubule and the interstitium between the tubules. LH effects spermatogenesis indirectly in that it stimulates androgenous testosterone production. FSH targets Sertoli cells. Therefore, testosterone and PSH are the hormones that are directed at the seminiferous tubule epithelium. Androgen-binding protein which is a Sertoli cell product carries testosterone intracellularly and may serve as a testosterone reservoir within the seminiferous tubules in addition to transporting testosterone from the testis into the epididymal tubule. The physical proximity of the Leydig cells to the seminiferous tubules and the elaboration by the Sertoli cells of androgen-binding protein, cause a high level of testosterone to be maintained in the microenvironment of the developing spermatozoa. The hormonal requirements for initiation of spermatogenesis appear to be independent of the maintenance of spermatogenesis. For spermatogenesis to be maintained like for instance after a pituitary obliteration, only testosterone is required. However, if spermatogenesis is to be re-initiated after the germinal epithelium has been allowed to regress completely, then both FSH and testosterone are required. Transport-Maturation-Storage of Sperm Although the testis is responsible for sperm production, the epididymis is intimately involved with the maturation, storage and transport of spermatozoa. Testicular spermatozoa are non-motile and were felt to be incapable of fertilizing ova. Spermatozoa gain progressive motility and fertilizing ability after passing through the epididymis. The coiled seminiferous tubules terminate within the rete testis, which in turn coalesces to form the ductuli efferentes. These ductuli efferentes conduct testicular fluid and spermatozoa into the head of the epididymis. The epididymis consists of a fragile single convoluted tubule that is 5-6 meters in length. The epididymis is divided into the head, body, and tail. Although epididymal transport time varies with age and sexual activity, the estimated transit time of spermatozoa through the epididymis in healthy males is approximately four days. It is during the period of maturation in the head and body of the epididymis that the sperm develop the increased capacity for progressive motility and also acquire the ability to penetrate oocytes during fertilization. The epididymis also serves as a reservoir or storage area for sperm. It is estimated that the extragonadal sperm reservoir is 440 million spermatozoa and that more than 50% of these are located in the tail of the epididymis. The sperm that are stored in the tail of the epididymis enter the vas deferens which is a muscular duct 30-35 cm in length. The contents of the vas are propelled by peristaltic motion into the ejaculatory duct. Sperm are then transported to the outside of the male reproductive tract by emission and ejaculation. During emission, secretions from the seminal vesicles and prostate are deposited into the posterior urethra. Prior to ejaculation peristalsis of the vas deferens and bladder neck occur under sympathetic nervous control. During ejaculation, the bladder neck tightens and the external sphincter relaxes with the semen being propelled through the urethra via rhythmic contractions of the perineal and bulbourethral muscles. It is true that the first portion of the ejaculate contains a small volume of fluid from the vas deferens which is rich in sperm. The major volume of the seminal fluid comes from the seminal vesicles and secondarily the prostate. The seminal vesicles provide the nourishing substrate fructose as well as prostaglandins and coagulating substrates. A recognized function of the seminal plasma is its buffering effect on the acidic vaginal environment. The coagulum formed by the ejaculated semen liquefies within 20 to 30 minutes as a result of prostatic proteolytic enzymes. The prostate also adds zinc, phospholipids, spermine, and phosphatase to the seminal fluid. The first portion of the ejaculate characteristically contains most of the spermatozoa and most of the prostatic secretions, while the second portion is composed primarily of seminal vesicle secretions and fewer spermatozoa. Fertilization Fertilization normally takes place within the uterine tubes after ovulation has occurred. During the menstrual mid cycle, the cervical mucus changes to become more abundant, thinner and more watery. These changes serve to facilitate entry of the sperm into the uterus and to protect the sperm from the highly acidic vaginal secretions. Physiologic changes in the spermatozoa known as capacitation occur within the female reproductive tract in order for fertilization to occur. As the sperm cell interacts with the egg, there is initiation of new flagellar movement called hyperactive motility and morphologic changes in the sperm that result in the release of lytic enzymes and exposure of parts of the sperm's structure known as the acrosome reaction. As a result of these changes, the fertilizing sperm cell is able to reach the oocyte, traverse it's various layers, and become incorporated into the ooplasm of the egg. CLINICAL FINDINGS History The cornerstone of the evaluation of infertile man is a careful history and physical examination. Specific childhood illnesses should be sought including cryptographies, post pubertal mumps orchitis and testicular trauma or torsion. Precocious puberty may indicate the presence of an adrenal-genital syndrome, whereas delayed puberty may indicate Klinefelter's syndrome or idiopathic hypogonadism. Prenatal exposure to diethylstilbesterol should be ascertained because this may cause an increased incidence of epididymal cysts or a slightly increased frequency of cryptorchidism. A detailed history of exposure to occupational and environmental toxins, excessive heat, or radiation should be elicited. Cancer chemotherapy has a dose-dependent and potentially devastating effect on the testicular germinal epithelium. The drug history should be reviewed for anabolic steroids, cimetidine, and spironolactone which can effect the reproductive cycle. Medications like sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin may effect sperm motility. Illicit drugs and excessive alcohol consumption are associated with a decrease in sperm count and hormonal abnormalities. Previous medical and surgical diseases and their treatment may occasional compromise reproductive function. Men with unilateral undescended testes will have overall semen quality of considerably less than normal. Previous surgical procedures such as bladder neck operations or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer may cause retrograde ejaculation or absent emission. Diabetic neuropathy may result in either retrograde ejaculation or impotence. Both the vas deferens and the testicular blood supply can easily be injured during hernia repair. In patients with cystic fibrosis, the vas deferens or epididymis and seminal vesicles are usually absent. Any generalized fever or illness can impair spermatogenesis. The ejaculate may be affected for three months after the event, as spermatogenesis takes about 74 days from initiation to the appearance of mature sperm. There is also a variable transport time in the ducts. Sometimes events that have occurred in the previous 3-6 months are extremely important. Sexual habits including frequency of intercourse, frequency of ejaculation, use of coital lubricants and the patient's understanding of the ovulatory cycle should be discussed. Previous infertility evaluation and treatment and the reproductive history from previous marriages should be ascertained. A history of recurrent respiratory infections and infertility may be associated with the immotile cilia syndrome, in which the sperm count is normal but the spermatozoa are completely non-motile due to ultrastructural defects. Kartagener's syndrome, which is a variant of immotile cilia syndrome, consists of chronic bronchiectasis, sinusitis, situs inversus and immotile spermatozoa. In Young's syndrome, also associated with pulmonary disease, the cilia ultrastructure is normal but the epididymis is obstructed due to inspissated material, and these patients present with azoospermia. Loss of libido associated with headaches, visual abnormalities and galactorrhea may suggest a pituitary tumor. Other medical problems that have been associated with infertility include thyroid disease, seizure disorders, and Liver disease. Interestingly it is not the seizure disorder itself that causes infertility but it is the typical treatment of it with Dilantin (phenytoin). Dilantin decreases FSH. Chronic systemic diseases such as renal disease and sickle cell disease are associated with abnormal reproductive hormonal parameters. Physical Examination During the physical examination, particular attention should be paid to discerning features of hypogonadism. Typically this would be viewed as poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, eunuchoidal skeletal proportions ie. irm1span two inches greater than height, ratio of upper body segment (crown to pubis) to lower body segment (pubis to floor) less than 1, and the lack of normal male hair distribution ie. sparse axillary, pubic, facial, and body hair in conjunction with lack of temporal hair recession. One should be on the lookout also for infantile genitalia ie. small penis, testes, and prostate with under-developed scrotum. One may also see a diminished muscular development and mass. A careful examination of the testes is an essential part of the examination. Normal adult testes are on the average about 4.5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide with a mean volume of about 20 cc. A caliper or orchidometer may be used to measure testicular size. If the seminiferous tubules were damaged before puberty, the testes are small and firm. With postpubertal damage, they are usually small and soft. Gynecomastia is a consistent feature of a feminizing state. Men with congenital hypogonadism may have associated midline defects such as anosmia, color blindness, cerebellar ataxia, hair lip, and cleft palate. Hepatomegaly may be associated with problems of hormonal metabolism. Proper neck examination may help rule out thyromegaly, a bruit or nodularity associated with thyroid disease. Neurologic exam should test the visual fields and reflexes. Irregularities in the epididymis suggest a previous infection and possible obstruction. Examination may reveal a small prostate with androgen deficiency or slight tenderness (bogginess) in men with prostatic infection. Any penile abnormalities like hypospadias, abnormal curvature, phimosis, should be looked for. The scrotal contents should be carefully palpated with the patient in both the supine and standing positions. Many varicoceles are not visible and may only be discernable when the patient stands or performs the Valsalva maneuver. Varicoceles can often result in a smaller left testis, and a discrepancy in size between the two testes should arouse suspicion. Both vas deferens should be palpated, as 2% of infertile men have congenital absence of the vasa and seminal vesicles. PRE-TESTICULAR CAUSES OF INFERTILITY Hypothalamic disease Isolated gonadotropin deficiency (Kallmann's syndrome) Isolated LH deficiency ("Fertile eunuch") Isolated FSH deficiency Congenital hypogonadrotropic syndromes Pituitary disease Pituitary insufficiency (tumors, infiltrative processes, operation, radiation) Hyperprolactinemia Hemochromatosis Exogenous hormones (estrogen-androgen excess, glucocorticoid excess, hyper and hypothyroidism) Hypothalamic Disease Kallmann's syndrome which is an isolated gonadotropin (LH and FSH) deficiency occurs in both a sporadic and familial form and although uncommon ie. 1 in 10,000 men, it is second to Klinefelter's syndrome as a cause of hypogonadism. The syndrome is often associated with anosmia, congenital deafness, hair lip, cleft palate, craniofacial asymmetry, renal abnormalities, color blindness. The hypothalamic hormone GnRH appears to be absent. If exogenous GnRH is administered, both LH and FSH are released from the pituitary. Except for the gonadotropin deficiency, anterior pituitary function is intact. The syndrome appears to be inherited either as an autosomal recessive trait or an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. The differential diagnosis should include delayed puberty. Kallmann's syndrome distinguishing features though are testes less than 2 cm in diameter and positive family history with the presence of anosmia. "Fertile eunuch" are individuals with isolated LH deficiency. They have eunuchoid proportions with variable degrees of virilization and gynecomastia. They characteristically have large testes and semen containing a few sperm. Plasma FSH levels are normal but both the serum LH and testosterone concentrations are low normal. The cause appears to be a partial gonadotropin deficiency in which there is adequate LH to stimulate testosterone production with resultant spermatogenesis but insufficient testosterone to promote virilization. In isolated FSH deficiency which is rare, patient's are normally virilized and have normal testicular size and baseline levels of LH and testosterone. Sperm counts range from O to a few sperm. Serum FSH levels are low and do not respond to GnRH stimulation. Congenital hypogonadotropic syndromes are associated with secondary hypogonadism and a multitude of other somatic findings. Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by hypogonadism, hypomentia, hypotonia at birth and obesity. Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedel syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait characterized by mental retardation, retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly and hypogonadism. These syndromes are felt to be due to a defect in hypothalamic deficiency of GnRH. Pituitary Disease Pituitary insufficiency may result from tumors, infarctions, iatrogenic causes like surgery and radiation or one of several infiltrative processes. If pituitary insufficiency occurs prior to puberty, growth retardation associated with adrenal and thyroid deficiency is the major clinical presentation. Hypogonadism that occurs in a sexually mature male usually has its origin in a pituitary tumor. Decreasing libido, impotence and infertility may occur years before symptoms of an expanding tumor ie. such as headaches, visual abnormalities, or thyroid/adrenal hormone deficiency. Once an individual has passed through normal puberty, it takes a long time for secondary sexual characteristics to disappear unless adrenal insufficiency is present. The testes will eventually become small and soft. The diagnosis is made by low serum testosterone levels with low or low normal plasma gonadotropins concentrations. Depending on the degree of panhypopituitarism, plasma corticosteroids will be reduced with plasma TSH and growth hormone levels. Hyperprolactinemia can cause both reproductive and sexual dysfunction. Prolactin-secreting tumors of the pituitary gland whether from a microadenoma (less than 10 mm) or a macroadenoma, can result in loss of libido, impotence, galactorrhea, gynecomastia and alter spermatogenesis. Patients with a macroadenoma usually first present with visual field abnormalities and headaches. They should undergo CT or MRI scanning of the pituitary and laboratory testing of anterior pituitary, thyroid and renal function. These patients have low serum testosterone levels but basal serum levels of LH and FSH are either low or low normal and reflect an inadequate pituitary response to depressed testosterone. Approximately 80% of men with hemochromatosis have testicular dysfunction. Their hypogonadism may be secondary to iron deposition in the liver or may be primarily testicular as a result of iron deposition in the testes. Iron deposits have also been found in the pituitary, implicating this gland as the major site of abnormality. With regard to the role of exogenous hormones, adrenocortical tumors, Sertoli cell tumors, interstitial cell tumors of the testes may all at times be estrogen-producing. Hepatic cirrhosis is associated with increased endogenous estrogens. Estrogens act primarily by suppressing pituitary gonadotropin secretion, resulting in secondary testicular failure. Androgens can also suppress pituitary gonadotropin secretion thereby leading to secondary testicular failure. The current use of anabolic steroids by certain athletes may result in temporary sterility. Endogenous androgen excess may be due to an androgen-producing adrenocortical tumor or testicular tumor but more likely to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. As a consequence of this disease, the production of androgenic steroids by the adrenal cortex is increased, resulting in premature development of secondary sexual characteristics and abnormal phallic enlargement. The testes failed to mature because of gonadotropin inhibition and are characteristically small. In the absence of precocious puberty, the diagnosis is extremely difficult since excessive virilization is difficult to detect in an otherwise normally sexually mature man. Careful laboratory evaluation is essential. Infertility caused by documented congenital adrenal hyperplasia is treatable with corticosteroids. Physicians have used corticosteroids in individuals with idiopathic infertility, but unless these abnormalities can be documented, steroid therapy has no place. Sometimes glucocorticoid excess (prednisone usage) is exogenous in the therapy of ulcerative colitis, asthma, or rheumatoid arthritis. The result is decreased spermatogenesis. The elevated plasma cortisone levels depress LH secretion and can cause secondary testicular dysfunction. Correction of the glucocorticoid excess results in improvement in spermatogenesis.Hyper and hypothyroidism can alter spermatogenesis. Hyperthyroidism effects both pituitary and testicular function with alterations in the secretion of releasing hormones and increased conversion of androgens to estrogens. TESTICULAR CAUSES OF INFERTILITY Chromosomal abnormalities (Klinefelter's syndrome, XX disorder (sex reversal syndrome), XYY syndrome) Noonan's syndrome (male Turner's syndrome) Myotonic dystrophy Bilateral anorchia (vanishing testes syndrome) Sertoli-cell-only syndrome (germinal cell aplasia) Gonadotoxins (drugs, radiation) Orchitis Trauma Systemic dissease (renal failure, hepatic disease, sickle cell disease) Defective androgen synthesis or action Cryptorchidism Varicocele Several somatic chromosomal abnormalities are associated with gale infertility. In a study of 1,263 barren couples, it was found that the overall incidence of male chromosome abnormalities was 6.2%. In a subgroup in which the male partner's sperm count was less than 10 million, the incidence rose to 11%. In azoospermic subjects, 21% had significant chromosomal abnormalities. Only in isolated cases however, has infertility been documented in association with a specific chromosomal abnormality ie. D-D translocations, ring abnormalities, reciprocal translocation, and various other aberrations. Chromosomal studies though should be considered in men with severe oligospermia or azoospermia to look for autosomal and sex chromosomal abnormalities. Klinefelter's Syndrome is a genetic disorder due to the presence of an extra X chromosome in the male, the common karyotype being either 47,XXY which is the classic form or 46,XY/47,XXY the mosaic form. The incidence is about 1:500 males. Characteristically, these individuals have small, firm testes, delayed sexual maturation, azoospermia and gynecomastia. Because the features of hypogonadism are not evident until puberty, the diagnosis is delayed. The decrease in testicular mass is usually due to sclerosis and hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules. The testes characteristically have a length of less than 2 cm and 12 cc volume. LH and FSH levels are characteristically elevated. Testosterone levels can range from normal to low and decrease with age. Serum estradiol levels are often increased. The higher estrogen levels relative to testosterone cause the feminized appearance in gynecomastia. About 10% of these patients have chromosomal mosaicism. The mosaics have less severe features of Klinefelter's Syndrome and may be fertile, as there may be a normal clone of the cells within the testes. Mild mental deficiency and restrictive pulmonary disease occur more frequently in these patients than in the general population. The infertility is reversible and later in life most of these men will require androgen replacement therapy for optimal virilization and normal sexual function. XX Disorder or Sex Reversal Syndrome is a variant of Klinefelter's Syndrome. The signs are similar except for the average height is less than normal, hypospadias is common and a decreased incidence of mental deficiency. These patients have a 46,XX chromosome complement. This paradox is explained by the fact that their cells express H-Y antigen and are presumed to have a Y chromosome somewhere in their genomes. The incidence of the XYY syndrome is the same as that of Klinefelter's Syndrome but its phenotypic expression is more variable. Semen from these subjects may vary from azoospermic to normal. These patients are excessively tall and have had pustule acne. A percentage have anti-social behavior. Most have a normal LH and testosterone level with the FSH level dependent on the extent of germ cell damage. There is no treatment for their infertility. Noonan's Syndrome is the male counterpart of Turner's Syndrome (X0), and these individuals typically have similar features ie. short stature, web neck, low-head ears, cubitus valgus, ocular abnormalities and cardiovascular abnormalities. Most males with Noonan's Syndrome have cryptorchidism and diminished spermatogenesis and are infertile. Those with diminished testicular function will have elevated serum FSH and LH levels. They demonstrate on chromosomal analysis a sex chromosome abnormality such as X0/XY mosaicism. There is no treatment for their infertility. Patients with myotonic dystrophy suffer from delayed muscle relaxation after initial contraction. The major clinical features also include lenticular opacities, frontal baldness and testicular atrophy. Inheritance is autosomal dominant and the expression is variable though 80% will develop testicular atrophy. Pubertal development is usually normal and testicular damage occurs later in adult life. Leydig cell function remains normal and there is no gynecomastia. Bilateral anorchia or vanishing testes syndrome is an extremely rare disorder effecting about 1 in 20,000 males. Patients will present at birth with non-palpable testes and sexual immaturity later in life because of the absence of testicular androgens. The karyotype is normal, but LH and FSH levels are elevated and testosterone is extremely low. In utero the testes may have been lost due to torsion, trauma, vascular injury or infection. However, functioning testicular tissue must have been present at least for the first trimester of fetal life in order for the male reproductive ducts and for the external genitalia to differentiate along male lines. Testosterone does not increase in response to HCG stimulation. These patients have eunuchoid proportions but no gynecomastia. Therapy can only be directed at the testosterone deficiency. Sertoli-cell-only syndrome or germinal cell aphasia may have several causes including congenital absence of the germ cells, genetic defects, or androgen resistance. Upon testicular biopsy there will be complete absence of germinal elements. Clinical findings include azoospermia in association with normal virilization, testes of normal consistency but slightly smaller in size, and no gynecomastia. Testosterone and LH levels are normal but FSH levels are usually elevated. Sometimes in patients who have had other testicular disorders like mumps, cryptorchidism or radiation/toxin damage, the seminiferous tubules may also contain only Sertoli cells, but in these men the testes are small and the histologic pattern is not as uniform. These patients are more likely to have severe sclerosis and hyalinization as prominent features as well. There is no treatment for their infertility. Gonadotoxins like drugs and radiation can effect the germinal epithelium because it is a rapidly dividing tissue and susceptible to interference of cell division. Cancer chemotherapy has a dose-dependent effect on testicular germinal epithelium. The germinal epithelium appears to be more resistant to toxic drugs before puberty than in adulthood. The alkylating agents like chiromancies, cyclophosphamide and nitrogen mustard are particular toxic to the testes. In some patients, cryopreservation of semen can be performed before cancer chemotherapy is begun. Cyproterone, ketoconazole, spirolactone and alcohol all interfere with testosterone synthesis. Cimetidine is a testosterone antagonist, blocking peripheral testosterone action. These men will often present with gynecomastia and have decreased sperm counts. Recreational drugs like marijuana, heroin, and methadone are associated with lower serum testosterone levels without a concomitant elevation in LH levels. This suggests a central abnormality as well as a testicular defect. Certain pesticides like dibromochloropropane have been found to impair testicular function in men. Germ cells are particularly sensitive to radiation while the Leydig cells are relatively resistant. At exposures below 600 rads, germ cell damage is reversible. Above this level of exposure though permanent damage is likely. Recovered spermatogenesis may take up to 2-3 years even in men who receive low doses of radiation. Elevated FSH levels reflect the impaired spermatogenesis, with return to normal once the testes recover. About 15-25% of adult men who contract mumps can develop orchitis which is more commonly unilateral though bilateral involvement occurs in about 10% of affected men. Testicular atrophy can develop within 1 to 6 months or may take years. Fewer than one-third of men with bilateral orchitis recover normal semen parameters. The exposed position of the testicles make them susceptible to trauma and subsequent atrophy. Iatrogenic injury may occur during inguinal surgery and interfere with testicular blood supply or damage the vas deferens. Systemic diseases like renal failure resulting in uremia in males is associated with decreased libido, impotence and altered spermatogenesis and gynecomastia. LH and FSH levels are elevated and testosterone levels are decreased. The cause of hypogonadism in uremia is probably multifactorial. It has been found that serum prolactin levels are elevated in one-fourth of the patients. An excess in estrogen may be contributory. Anti-hypertensive drugs and uremic neuropathy may also play a role in uremic impotence and hypogonadism. After successful renal transplantation, uremic hypogonadism improves. A large percentage of males with cirrhosis of the liver have testicular atrophy, impotence and gynecomastia. Testosterone levels are decreased. Estradiol is increased as a result of decreased hepatic extraction of androgens with increased conversion to estrogen peripherally. LH and FSH levels are only moderately elevated relative to the low serum testosterone levels. Ethanol also acutely reduces testosterone levels by inhibiting testicular testosterone synthesis. Many men with sickle cell disease have evidence of hypogonadism. Even though LH and FSH levels may be variable, testosterone levels are low. Hypogonadism of sickle cell disease is likely secondary to a mixture of testicular and pituitary-hypothalamic causes. Rare heredity disorders due to enzymatic defects can result in defective testosterone synthesis and are associated with an adequate virilization that is evident at birth as ambiguous genitalia. Several forms of androgen resistance result in under masculinization and infertility in males with otherwise normally developed external genitalia. Diagnosis is made by the finding of abnormal androgen receptors in a culture of genital skin fiberblasts. Characteristically, there is an elevation testosterone and LH levels. Proof of this is costly and there is no treatment for their infertility. Cryptorchidism is a common developmental defect incidence of 0.8% in adult males. The undescended testes become morphologically abnormal after age 2. Though in spite of prophylactic orchidopexy, unilateral cryptorchid patients have reduced fertility potential. It appears that in the cryptorchid individual, there is dysgenesis of both the normally and abnormally descended testis. Semen quality is particularly poor in patients with bilateral undescended testicles. Even though baseline serum FSH, LH and testosterone levels may be normal, there is a super normal response of both LH and FSH to generate stimulation which reflects compromised testicular function. A scrotal varicocele is the most common causative finding in infertile men. It results from backflow of blood secondary to incompetent or absent valves in the spermatic veins. This valvular deficiency combined with the long vertical course of the internal spermatic vein on the left side, leads to the formation of most varicoceles on the left side (90%). Varicoceles are not as commonly seen on the right side because of the oblique course of the right internal spermatic vein from the vena cava. A unilateral right-sided varicocele suggests venous thrombosis/tumor or situs inversus. Newer diagnostic tests have shown the incidence of bilateral varicoceles to be greater than 40%. The incidence of varicoceles in the adult male population is approximately 20% and in the infertile population approximately 40%. 50% of men with varicoceles will have impaired semen quality, but many men with varicoceles are fertile. To explain the abnormalities in spermatogenesis with varicocele, the following theories have been proposed: elevation of testicular temperature due to venous stasis retrograde flow of toxic metabolites from the adrenal or kidney blood stagnation with germinal epithelial hypoxia; and alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated bilateral increase in both testicular blood flow and temperature with altered spermatogenesis. Unfortunately, at least 25-40% of infertile men have idiopathic infertility for which no cause can be identified. More known causes will be discovered hopefully as knowledge of male reproductive physiology expands. POST-TESTICULAR CAUSES OF INFERTILITY Disorders of sperm transport Congenital disorders Acquired disorders Functional disorders Disorders of sperm motility or function Congenital defects of the sperm tail Maturation defects Immunologic disorders Infection Sexual dysfunction Disorders of Sperm Transport Congenital disorders of sperm transport are rarely due to absence or atresia of portions of the male ductal system. Males with cystic fibrosis have a high incidence of congenital hypoplasia or absence of the major portion of the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. Absence of the seminal vesicles is always associated with azoospermia, semen that does not coagulate at ejaculation, and absence of fructose. In Young's Syndrome which is associated with pulmonary disease, the ultrastructure of the cilia is normal but the epididymis is obstructed due to inspissated material leaving these patients azoospermic. Acquired disorders of sperm transport are usually due to bacterial infections which may acutely or chronically involve the epididymis with subsequent scarring and obstruction. Apart from vasectomy, the vas may accidentally be ligated during hernia repair, orchiopexy, and even during varicocelectomy. Functional obstruction of sperm transport results from neuropathic insults like injuries to the sympathetic nerves during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or pelvic surgery. This may cause lack of peristalsis of the vas deferens with resultant lack of emission and/or failure of the bladder neck to close at the time of ejaculation leading to retrograde ejaculation. Diabetic males with autonomic neuropathy frequently present with both erectile dysfunction and/or retrograde ejaculation. Spinal cord injury can result in paraplegia or quadriplegic with resultant erectile dysfunction and lack of emission and ejaculation. There are many medications such as tranquilizers, antidepressants, and antihypertensives that may interfere with the sympathetic nervous system as well. Disorders of Sperm Motility or Function Disorders of sperm motility and function exist secondary to problems that include congenital defects of the sperm tail, maturation defects and immunologic defects. Immotile cilia syndrome is a group of disorders characterized by immotility or poor motility of spermatozoa tie. Kartagenerss Syndrome). In these disorders, testicular biopsy is normal and the sperm count adequate but sperm motility is either markedly reduced or absent. The defective structural abnormality leading to impairment of both the cilia and spermatozoa is seen only with the electron microscope. The defects known to cause immotile cilia syndrome include absent dynein arms, short or absent spokes with no central sheath and missing central microtubules. Motility problems may also be associated with a deficiency of the protein carboxylmethylase in the tail of the sperm. Normal sperm counts with poor motility following vasectomy reversal may be a result of epididymal dysfunction. Chronic intratubular pressure following vasectomy may have a deleterious effect on the epididymis such that spermatozoa may not gain their usual maturation and capacity for motility. Breakdown of the blood-testes barrier by infection, trauma or operation allows sensitization of the spermatozoa antigens. Sperm antibodies may be a relative cause of infertility in about 3-7% of infertile males. Immunity does not appear to be an all-or-none phenomenon but may contribute to reduced fertility potential. Infections. High concentrations of gram-negative bacteria like E-coli in the semen can impair sperm motility. Sexually transmitted organisms such as chlamydia trichomatous, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticulum have rarely been implicated in reproductive failure. In both animals and humans, there is no convincing evidence to support the use of routine cultures or empiric therapy in asymptomatic infertile males. Sexual dysfunction has been reported in up to 20% of infertile males. Decreased sexual drive, erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation and failure of intromission are all potentially correctable causes of reproductive failure. Decreasing libido and erectile dysfunction may reflect low serum testosterone levels with an organic cause. Performance anxiety is also often reported and often abated with reassurance. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SEMEN ANALYSIS Although semen analysis is not a test of fertility, a carefully performed semen analysis is a highly predictive indicator of the functional status of the male reproductive hormonal cycle, spermatogenesis and the patency of the reproductive tract. The initiation of a pregnancy is the only true measure of fertility and is a couple-related phenomenon. One must keep in mind that normal values have been difficult to determine for fertile men in their reproductive years. Clinical studies of infertile patients have established "limits of adequacy" below which the chance of initiating a pregnancy becomes more difficult. These parameters are not absolute because some fertile men may have values below these "limits of adequacy". Conversely, infertile men may have normal semen parameters by standard analysis techniques because standard evaluation does not assess the functional integrity of the sperm. The World Health Organization Laboratory Manual for Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical Mucous Interactions is highly recommended for technical details. Most specialists collect at least three specimens in which the seminal parameters are within 20% of each other before establishing a baseline for semen quality. The semen specimen is best obtained by masturbation after a two to three day period of abstinence. The specimen should be assessed within 1-2 hours of collection. Samples obtained by coitus interruptus or from silastic condoms devoid of spermatocidal agents are less desirable but satisfactory. Therefore, collection at the site of analysis is ideal. Besides laboratory error, there are variations in sperm density, motility and morphology among multiple samples from a given man. Abstinence intervals give s large source of variability. With each day of abstinence (up to one week) semen volume increases by 0.4 cc, sperm concentration by 10-15 million per cc, and total sperm count by 50-90 million. Sperm motility and morphology appear to be unaffected by 5-7 days of abstinence, but longer periods lead to impaired motility. Interpretation of semen analysis must take into consideration the variations between samples that exist in individuals. The minimum number of specimens to define good or poor quality of semen is three samples over a 6-8 week interval with a consistent period of abstinence of 2-3 days. In a longitudinal analysis of semen from both fertile and infertile men, it was found that 97% of men with initial good sperm concentration would continue to show good density after as many as 3-6 specimens. Those rated poor at first also remained poor in future visits. For those rated equivocal, first visit was of little value and at least three visits were needed to obtain stability. Semen volume must be taken into consideration assessing total sperm production by the testes. Semen volume per se, however, effects fertility only when it falls below 1.5 cc due to the inadequate buffering of vaginal acidity or when the volume is greater than 5 cc. Low volumes may be associated with incomplete collection, retrograde ejaculation, ejaculatory duct obstruction, or androgen deficiency. For most clinicians, a sperm concentration of less than 20 million per cc is the lower limit of normal. Sperm motility is the single most important measure of semen quality and can be a compensatory factor in men with low sperm counts. Sperm motility is usually rated in two ways: the number of motile sperm as a percentage of the total, and the quality of forward progressive sperm movement ie., how fast and how straight the sperm swims. The degree of forward progression is a classification based on the pattern displayed by the majority of motile sperm. It ranges from zero (no movement) to 4 (excellent forward progression). Typically, you want to see at least 50% of the sperm with good forward progression. Microscopic evaluation of the liquefied semen may reveal agglutination (clumping) of sperm. Agglutination may be head-to-head, head-to-tail, or tail-to-tail and may suggest an inflammatory or immunologic process. Sperm morphology is subject to great variation and it is unusual to see specimens that contain more than 80% normal sperm heads. Morphology is assessed on stained seminal smears and is scored; after viewing at least 100 cells. Typically, you like to see at least 30% of the sperm having normal oval heads, mid piece and tail. No longer is it felt that increased numbers of tapered, amorphous and immature cells (stress pattern) are pathonomic of varicoceles, but rather represent altered testicular function. Semen from normal men coagulates and then over 20-30 plus minutes liquifies. Delayed liquefaction of semen greater than 60 minutes may indicate disorders of accessory gland function. Diagnosis of the liquefaction problem should be made if there is absence of sperm in the post coital test. If sperm are capable of reaching the cervical mucus, problems of semen liquefaction are not clinically relevant. Increased semen viscosity, which is unrelated to the coagulation-liquefaction phenomenon, signifies a disorder of accessory gland function and may effect the accuracy of assessment of both sperm density and motility. It is only clinically relevant when there are very few sperm in the post coital test. The presence of white blood cells in semen should be noted. It is difficult to differentiate between white blood cells and immature spermatozoa on routine analysis, because both may appear as round cells in the semen. Peroxidase stain and, more recently monoclonal antibodies have been utilized to aid in this differentiation. Excessive white cells ( > 1 million/cc) may indicate an infection that may contribute to subfertility.If no spermatozoa are observed, a qualitative test for fructose should be performed. A low ejaculate volume and lack of fructose, along with failure of the semen to coagulate, suggest congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles or obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts. Fructose is androgen-dependent and is produced in the seminal vesicles. Computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) systems couple video technology and sophisticated microcomputers for automatic image digitalization and processing. This technology was developed for more objective measurements of seminal parameters over the subjective measures of standard semen analysis. CASA permits the measurement of additional motility parameters such as curvalinear velocity, straight-line velocity, linearity, and flagellar beat frequency. Under certain circumstances, CASA has been found to be less accurate than the standard semen analysis and the biological and clinical relevance of some of these new parameters has yet to be validated. HORMONE EVALUATION Most cases of male infertility are non-endocrine in origin. Routine evaluation of hormonal parameters is not warranted unless sperm density is extremely low or there is clinical suspicion of an endocrinopathy. The incidence of primary endocrine defects in infertile men is less than 3%. Such defects are rare in men with a sperm concentration of greater than 5 million per cc. When an endocrinopathy is discovered, however, specific hormonal therapy is often successful. Because of the episodic nature of LH secretion and its short half life, a single LH determination has an accuracy of plus or minus 50%. Similarly, testosterone is secreted episodically in response to LH pulses and has a diurnal pattern with an early morning peak. Serum FSH has a longer half life, and these fluctuations are less obvious. Therefore, I usually just check an FSH and testosterone level. A low testosterone level is one of the best indicators of hypogonadism of hypothalamic or pituitary origin. Low LH and FSH values concurrent with low testosterone levels indicate hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Elevated FSH and LH values help to distinguish primary testicular failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) from secondary testicular failure (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Most patients with primary hypogonadism have severe, irreversible testicular defects. On the other hand, secondary hypogonadism has a hypothalamic or pituitary origin and infertility may be correctable. Elevated FSH levels are usually a reliable indicator of germinal epithelial damage and are usually associated with azoospermia or severe Rligospermia, depicting significant and usually irreversible germ cell damage. In azoospermic and severely oligospermic patients with normal FSH levels, primary spermatogenic defects cannot be distinguished from obstructive lesions by hormonal investigation alone. Therefore, scrotal exploration and testicular biopsy should be considered. An elevated FSH level associated with small, atrophic testes implies irreversible infertility and a biopsy is not warranted. The diagnostic value of prolactin measurement is extremely low in men with semen abnormalities unless these are associated with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and evidence of hypogonadism. Prolactin measurement is warranted in patients with low serum testosterone levels without an associated increase in serum LH levels. Individuals with gynecomastia, obesity, history of alcohol abuse, or suspected androgen resistance should have a serum estradiol level. In men with a history of precocious puberty, one should consider congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In the common variant (21-hydroxylase deficiency), serum levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone are elevated. In 11-hydroxylase deficiency, serum 11-Deoxycortisol levels are elevated. In patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the pituitary hormones other than LH and FSH should also be assessed like adrenal corticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and growth hormone (GH). Thyroid dysfunction is such a rare cause of infertility that routine screening for thyroid abnormality should be discouraged. CHROMOSOMAL STUDIES Only in isolated cases has infertility been documented in association with a specific chromosomal abnormality. Subtle genetic studies can be considered in men with severe oligospermia and azoospermia to look for both autosomal and sex chromosomal abnormalities. The diagnostic yield is greatest in men with small testes, azoospermia, and elevated FSH levels. IMMUNOLOGIC STUDIES Antisperm antibodies, although not an absolute cause of infertility, appear to be capable of reducing the likelihood of pregnancy. The concentration of antisperm antibodies in the semen influence the degree of impairment. Antisperm antibodies do not lyse or immobilize sperm. They have not generally been found to be associated with decreased density or motility, but they do appear to interfere with sperm function by simply attaching to the plasma membrane of the spermatozoa. Sperm agglutination may be caused by antisperm antibody attachment. Infections may lead to agglutination of sperm as well though. Whenever agglutination is observed, the possibility of infection should be evaluated with appropriate semen cultures. Antisperm antibodies should be suspected in couples with repeated abnormal post coital tests. Antisperm antibodies appear to interfere with normal penetration and transit of sperm through normal cervical mucus. Antisperm antibodies also should be suspected in subfertile men with a history compatible with disruption of the integrity of the genital tract, and when sperm agglutination or reduced motility is observed on semen analysis. Immunological factors may also play a role in the pathogenesis of 10-20% cases of "unexplained infertility". Antisperm antibodies can be found either in the circulation or in the seminal plasma or directly on the sperm surface. Studies have shown a discordance between the results of sperm antibody tests in matching serum and sperm samples. The presence of humoral antibodies directed against sperm is not relevant to fertility unless these circulating antibodies are also present within the reproductive tract. Therefore, the convenience of assaying blood for antisperm antibodies is outweighed by the lack of clinical relevance of these measurements in comparison with assays that identify the immunoglobulins directly on the sperm surface. It appears therefore that tests capable of detecting antisperm antibodies on living sperm are the most direct way to determine whether a significant autoimmunity to sperm exists. The immunobead binding test (IBT) is one of the most informative and specific of all assays currently available to detect antisperm antibodies bound to the surface of sperm. SPECIAL AND SPEED FUNCTION TESTS Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction For fertilization to take place in-vivo, the sperm must be able to get past the cervical mucus. The post coital test assesses the ability of sperm to penetrate and progress through cervical mucus. Cervical mucus is examined 2-8 hours after intercourse at the time of expected ovulation. The presence of greater than 10-20 motile sperm per high power field is generally accepted as a normal post coital test. Post coital testing is a bio-assay that provides information concerning sexual function, motility of the sperm, and the sperm-mucus interaction. A positive result implies normal semen and mucus. A poor result in an individual with normal semen parameters implies either cervical abnormality or the presence of sperm antibodies. Sperm-mucus interaction may also be assessed in-vitro. This allows for some degree of standardization. Human or bovine ovulatory mucus is placed in a capillary tube. Sperm penetration into the mucus is measured over a fixed period of time. These in-vitro techniques enable one to compare patient specimens with fertile sperm and control some of the variables associated with standard post coital testing. Sperm Penetration Assays Penetration of an oocyte requires sperm capacitation, acrosome reaction, fusion and incorporation into the oocyte. Cross-species fertilization is normally prevented by the zona pellucida. Hamster eggs stripped of the zona pellucida can be penetrated by human sperm. This in-vitro functional test measures the penetration ability of the sperm. The end point of this assay is penetration of the ovum and decondensation of sperm heads. The percentage of oocytes penetrated and the number of sperm penetrating each oocyte are measured. Sperm that are capable of multiple penetrations per oocyte appear to have greater fertilizing potential than sperm that do not penetrate. The results of the sperm penetration assay (SPA) have primarily been used to predict the results of assisted reproductive techniques, in particular, in-vitro fertilization. Men with sperm of low SPA score are less likely to achieve a spontaneous pregnancy than those with a high SPA score. It must be emphasized that the abnormal penetration does not indicate that fertilization cannot occur, nor does good penetration assure fertilization. Although variations still exist between laboratories, there appears to be general agreement that less than 10% penetration is evidence of sperm dysfunction and male infertility. Indications for SPA include unexplained infertility, and its use is also recommended prior to expensive assisted reproductive techniques. Although the SPA is a reliable indicator of the fertilizing capacity of human spermatozoa, it does not predict the ability of sperm to bind to and penetrate zona pellucida or the sperm's motility and progression in the female reproductive tract. For as SPA with zona free hamster eggs can demonstrate completion of the human sperm acrosome reaction and sperm oocyte plasma membrane fusion, only tests with human zona pellucida can assess the capability of human sperm to bind to the human oocyte. The hemizona assay uses zona pellucida from non-living human oocytes that have been microsurgically bisected. Sperm are allowed to interact and bind with the hemizona. The patient's sperm and fertile sperm are compared utilizing the identical halves of hemizona. The results are expressed as the hemizona index, ie. bound sperm by the subfertile man divided by bound sperm from the fertile donor multiplied by 100. This assay requires significant expertise in micromanipulation. The hemizona assay is not indicated in the routine evaluation of the subfertile man. Acrosome Evaluation The acrosome reaction is necessary for fertilization to take place. Evaluating the ability of sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction may provide an additional assessment of sperm function. It is possible to determine the acrosomal status of sperm by utilizing electron microscopy, staining, immunofluorescent techniques and monoclonal antibodies. It is also possible to induce an acrosome reaction with ionophores and human zona pellucida. These techniques are labor-intensive and the ability of the acrosomal status to predict fertility must be confirmed. Hypo-osmotic Swelling It has been found that when sperm from normal fertile men are exposed to a known solution of fructose and sodium citrate, 33-80% of the spermatozoa will exhibit tail swelling. Sperm that are not viable or sperm with non-functioning membranes do not swell. This appears to be explained by the ability of the normal cell membrane to maintain an osmotic gradient. Attempts have been made to correlate this finding with the fertilization potential for semen samples. Samples with greater than 62% swelling are able to fertilize ova, whereas less than 60% swelling is observed in samples of infertile semen. This test has not been widely embraced and is currently a research tool. BACTERIOLOGIC INVESTIGATION If urinalysis is abnormal or bacterial prostatitis is implicated by either the history or physical examination, appropriate cultures are indicated. The common sexually transmitted organisms such as chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominus and ureaplasma urealyticulum have been implicated in reproductive failure in animals and humans. On the basis of this supposition, physicians have instituted antibiotic therapy without obtaining evidence of infection in the hope of improving fertility. We currently could find no evidence for the role of current asymptomatic infection due to the above organisms in male infertility. Without evidence of inflammation, there is no indication for routine culture or antibiotic treatment of infertile men. TESTICULAR BIOPSY AND VASOGRAPHY In azoospermic patients or selected cases of severe oligospermia with normal FSH levels, primary spermatogenic defects cannot be differentiated from obstructive lesions by hormonal investigation alone, and testicular biopsy and sometimes vasography should be considered. When patients have azoospermia or severe oligospermia in conjunction with markedly shrunken testes and serum FSH levels that are at least twice normal, testicular biopsy can be avoided as it will indicate untreatable testicular pathology and only provide a definitive diagnosis which allows the patient to investigate alternatives. The exception is the patient who has undergone chemotherapy in whom the elevated FSH level may normalize with return of spermatogenesis. Before biopsy, at least two semen analysis should reveal azoospermia and retrograde ejaculation should be ruled out by examining a post ejaculatory urine specimen. In men with acidic semen, ie. pH of less than 7.0 and a volume of less than 1 cc, suspect ejaculatory duct obstruction or congenital absence of the seminal vesicles and vas deferens.

Sample Issue Information About Research Worldwide American Roentgen Ray Society "Male Infertility: Role of Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) in Diagnosis and Management" E. Kuligowska, M.D., J.A. Soto, M.D., R.D. Oates, M.D Boston University Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 95th Annual Meeting of the American Roentgen Ray Society, held April 30 - May 5, 1995, in Washington, D.C., "Purpose: Ultrasound (US) has become crucial in the evaluation of infertile couples, in 50% of whom the male partner is responsible. The purpose of our study is to define the current role of TRUS in the assessment of male infertility caused by abnormalities of the distal reproductive tract. Methods: The study population includes 128 men with azoospermia or oligospermia and low ejaculate volume who were referred for urologic evaluation to our institution during the past 7 years. All patients underwent TRUS using either a General Electric RT 3600 or an ATL Ultramark 9 system. The US findings were correlated with findings on digital rectal examination (DRE) and semen analysis. Results: Sixty patients (46.9%) had congenital bilateral absence of vas deferentia. Twenty (15.6%) had congenital unilateral absence of a vas deferens. In the remaining 48 patients (37.5%) other lesions directly related to semen deficiencies were detected. Thirty-three of them had abnormalities in the seminal vesicles or vas deferentia such as calcifications, cysts, and/or fibrosis. Fifteen had uni- or bilateral ejaculatory duct obstruction caused by cysts, stones or strictures; all of them were correctable by surgery. Conclusions: TRUS enables an accurate diagnosis of certain congenital and acquired anomalies of the lower urogenital tract associated with male infertility. Furthermore, it helps dictate appropriate clinical and surgical management." American Urological Association "The Results of Direct Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection Using Testicular Sperm" M.A. Witt, R. Burt, J. Massey, C. Elsner, A. Toledo, D. Mitchell-Leef, H. Kort and M. Tucker Atlanta, Georgia According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 90th Annual Meeting of the American Urological Association, held April 23 - 28, 1995, in Las Vegas, Nevada, "Direct intracytoplasmic sperm injection (DICSI) has significantly decreased the minimum sperm density requirements for assisted reproduction. DICSI with ejaculated sperm produces fertilization and pregnancy rates equal to that of conventional in vitro fertilization. Using DICSI in conjunction with microscopic epididymal sperm aspiration has improved fertilization rates per cycle to 100% and pregnancy rates per cycle to 50%. We asked the questions can sperm be successfully harvested from testicular parenchyma and if this is possible what are the fertilization and pregnancy rates when combined with DICSI? Six consecutive couples prospectively underwent six cycles of parenchymal sperm retrieval (PSR) in combination with DICSI. The indications for PSR were bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens and failed vasal reconstruction. Ovulation induction was carried out using a combined treatment of GnRH agonist and hMG in a short protocol. 0.5 grams of testicular parenchyma was obtained by excisional biopsy. Sperm were retrieved by micromanipulation after incubation of the testicular parenchyma in human tubal fluid. The retrieved sperm were sequentially washed through micro droplets and then injected. This processing yielded an average of 1.2 million sperm per cycle with an average motility of 5%. A total of 72 oocytes were retrieved (12/cycle). DICSI was performed on 59 oocytes, yielding 20 embryos (3.3/cycle). Sixteen embryos underwent uterine transfer (2.7/cycle). The fertilization rate with DICSI using testicular sperm was 100% per cycle. Three ongoing and one full term pregnancy were produced (67%/cycle). The pregnancies consisted of four singletons. Sperm can be successfully retrieved from testicular parenchyma and used to initiate fertilization and pregnancy. Fertilization and pregnancy rates using testicular sperm in conjunction with DICSI are comparable to those using epididymal sperm. Testicular parenchyma can now be utilized as a new reservoir for sperm retrieval in conjunction with DICSI when vasal reconstruction is not feasible." American Urological Association "Human Pregnancies Achieved by Intra-Ooplasmic Injections of Round Spermatid (RS) Nuclei Isolated from Testicular Tissue of Azoospermic Men" N. Sofikitis, I. Miyagawa, I.Sharlip, W. Hellstrom, G. Mekras, E. Mastelou Yonago, Japan, San Francisco, California, New Orleans, Louisiana, Miami, Florida, Athens, Greece According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 90th Annual Meeting of the American Urological Association, held April 23 - 28, 1995, in Las Vegas, Nevada, "Successful fertilization and normal embryonic development in vivo after RS nuclear injections (ROSNI) into rabbit oocytes and embryo transfer procedures (J. Urol. 1994, 311A;Fertil. Steril.; In Press) was recently reported. This study evaluates the role of ROSNI in azoospermic men with maturation arrest after the RS stage. Right testicular biopsy was performed in 89 non-obstructed azoospermic men. RS nuclei were isolated in 83 men using methods previously described for rabbit and hamster RS nuclei collection (J. Urol. 1994, 311A;Biol. Reprod. 48:219) and oocytes (n=391) were retrieved from their wives. All oocytes were stimulated mechanically or by a combination of electrical and mechanical stimulation. Then, one husband RS nucleus as microinjected into the corresponding spouse oocyte. A total of 373 oocytes were successfully microinjected and then cultured for 36 hours in BWW medium containing serum at 37(degree)C under 5% CO2. At completion of the culture period 115(31%) 2-to 4-cell stage embryos were transferred to 63 women. Seven weeks following embryo transfer two pregnancies (one twin, one singleton) were identified by ultrasonography. These pregnancies represent 3% (2/63) of the couples in whom embryo transfer was performed and 2% (2/89) of the couples who initially entered the study. The two pregnant women were at the end of the first trimester in October 1994. The etiology of azoospermia in these two ongoing successes were mumps orchitis and varicocele with serum FSH levels of 28 and 23 IU/L, respectively. These results substantiate that ROSNI and subsequent embryo transfer can provide a novel treatment for azoospermic men. These findings further indicate that post-meiotic modifications of the human RS are not required for the pairing of male gamete chromosomes with those of the oocyte." American Urological Association "Intracytoplasmic Insertion of Sperm (ICSI) for Severe Male Factor Infertility" A. Visoski, L.I. Lipshultz, W.S. Wun, G. Grunert, C. Valdes, R. Dunn, S.A. Carson, P. Cisneros, D.J. Lamb Houston, Texas According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 90th Annual Meeting of the American Urological Association, held April 23 - 28, 1995, in Las Vegas, Nevada, "ICSI has provided an important approach to the treatment of severe male factor infertility. Our results demonstrate that this technique results in a significant enhancement of fertilization rate compared with routine IVF for the male factor patient. At the completion of 70 cycles for 69 couples, 504 oocytes have undergone ICSI, with 400 oocytes surviving (79%). 242 of the 400 surviving oocytes (61%) fertilized normally, while 3% had 3 pronuclei and 2% exhibited activation with 1 pronucleus. 93% of the 70 cycles resulted in embryo transfer with a pregnancy rate of 27% (5 tests are pending). In 16 of the cases, routine IVF was performed in parallel with an average fertilization rate of 33% (n=120 ova). Of note, 23 cycles had less than one million motile sperm prior to processing and in 7 of these the semen analysis could not be performed due to severely impaired semen parameters. For these severely oligospermic patients, the ICSI fertilization rate of 50% was similar to that observed above. One of these patients, considered to be Sertoli cell only based upon a testis biopsy, achieved fertilization and pregnancy with only 14 sperm found in the ejaculate. Similarly, excellent fertilization rates of 50% and 55% were obtained with sperm obtained by electroejaculation (n=4 cycles), and MESA (n=15 cycles). Following in vitro maturation of oocytes (n=14 cycles) and ICSI, or day 2 ICSI for IVF failure (n=15 cycles), the fertilization rates are lower (37% and 34%, respectively). For day 2 ICSI there is also a higher incidence of egg activation and of 3 pronuclei. In our program, the implementation of the ICSI procedure has not only resulted in excellent fertilization rates and embryo transfer rates, but has also enabled us to successfully treat patients whose sperm numbers were too low even for assisted fertilization with subzonal insertion of sperm." Pacific Coast Fertility Society "Comparative Study Between Two Ovarian Stimulation Protocols: CC/FSH/hMG Versus CC/hMG" J.J. Stern, J.R. Verez, F. Ortiz, R. Venegas, O. Arroyo and A. Gutierrez-Najar Grupo de Reproduccion y Genetica AGN y Asociados, Hospital Angeles del Pedregal, Mexico D.F., Mexico According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Fertility Society, held April 26 - 30, 1995, in Coronado, California, "Objective: Induction of ovulation has been accomplished by different stimulatory protocols using clomiphene citrate (CC), human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) or the combination of both (CC/hMG). Objective: Test if the increase in the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) at the beginning of the ovulation induction with CC/hMG produces better recruitment and selection of follicles compared with CC/hMG. Design: Prospective comparative study between CC/FSH/HMG (protocol A) vs. CC/HMG (protocol B), from January to December 1993. Material and Methods: Blood determination of FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E(2)), prolactin (PRL) and transvaginal ultrasound (TUS) were done on day 3 of the cycle. Based on these results induction was initiated. 50 mg of CC was given from day 5 to day 9 of the cycle. Patients in the first protocol received 75 IU of FSH (Fertinorm, Serono, Mexico) on days 6, 7, 8 of the cycle. Patients in the second protocol received 75 IU of FSH/LH (Pergonal, Serono, Mexico). FSH was changed to 75 IU hMG when E(2) reached levels higher than 260 pg/mL. 10,000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) when at least one follicle measured 16 mm. E(2) and progesterone (P4) were drawn 9 days after hCG. Results: 288 cycles were included in this study, 117 cycles in protocol A and 171 cycles in protocol B. No statistical difference was seen between the groups in: age, duration of infertility, diagnosis, FSH/LH ratio on day 3 of cycle, in ranges of age. (P(greater than).05). We observed consistently better response in protocol A demonstrated by a higher number of follicles (greater than)15 mm, higher E(2) at hCG administration, thicker endometrium and higher P4 levels. When analyzed by diagnosis, protocol A produced a statistical better response (p{{(less than)=}}0.05) than protocol B in patients with endometriosis, polycystic ovaries and unexplained infertility. Pregnancy rate in protocol A was 17.9% vs. 9.9% in B. Conclusion: the addition of FSH in the CC/HMG protocol induces an increment in the recruitment and maturation of follicles." Pacific Coast Fertility Society "Programmed Cycles for Frozen Embryo Transfer: a Simplified Approach" T.B. Koopersmith, M.V. Sauer, R.A. Lobo and R.J. Paulson Department of OB/GYN, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Fertility Society, held April 26 - 30, 1995, in Coronado, California, "With improvement in cryopreservation techniques, replacement of frozen embryos is increasingly utilized for the attainment of pregnancy. In order to maximize endometrial receptivity and allow elective scheduling of frozen embryo transfers (FET), GnRH analogs such as leuprolide acetate (LA) have been used to down regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis prior to stimulation of the endometrium by exogenous estrogens and progestins. The use of LA, while successful, necessitates 2 to 3 weeks of injections and is accompanied by the cost of the LA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of a regimen of exogenous oral estradiol (E) and IM progesterone (P) commencing with spontaneous menses as compared with LA down regulation prior to hormone replacement (HRT) in the success of FETs. Since we have previously shown that exogenous E alone does not prevent ovulation, a serum P level was obtained prior to starting supplemental P. Between January 1, 1994, and October 31, 1994, a total of 77 frozen embryo replacement cycles were undertaken. In 43 cycles, the patients received only E and P (E/P), while in 34 cycles, the patients were treated with LA, followed by E and P (L/E/P). A total of 166 and 126 embryos were replaced in the E/P and L/E/P groups respectively, with a mean of 3.95 and 3.82 embryos per transfer in each of the two groups. No significant differences in implantation rates per embryo (7.2% vs. 11.1%) were noted in the E/P and L/E/P groups. When we subdivided each group by the source of the oocytes (patient or donor), there was again no significant difference between the two groups (for patient oocytes: 5.1% (5/99) vs. 0% (0/14) and donor oocytes: 10.5% (7/67) vs. 12.5% (14/112) for the E/P and L/E/P group respectively). There was no difference in the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer (23.8% vs. 26.5%) between the two groups. The source of the oocytes did not significantly affect outcome (patient oocytes: 22.7% (5/22) vs. 0% (0/6), donor oocytes 24% (6/24) vs. 32% (9/28) for E/P and L/E/P respectively. One cycle in the E/P group (2.4%) was cancelled due to premature ovulation. The E/P regimen required significantly less days (31 vs. 14) prior to transfer and was less costly ($263 vs. $586) than the L/E/P regimen. We conclude that an artificial regimen for FET utilizing solely estradiol and progesterone is as efficacious, less costly, and easier to administer than a regimen which utilizes a GnRH analog prior to hormonal supplementation." Pacific Coast Fertility Society "Embryo Implantation After Repetitive Cycles of Oocyte Donation" I.E. Hatch, M.V. Sauer, R.A. Lobo and R.J. Paulson Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Fertility Society, held April 26 - 30, 1995, in Coronado, California, "Oocyte donation (OD) is now a well-established modality in the treatment of infertility among women with poor oocyte quality or among those who do not wish to reproduce a genetic defect. Because of the simultaneous optimization of both embryo quality and endometrial receptivity, OD consistently produces the highest per embryo implantation rates (IRs) of the assisted reproductive techniques. To investigate whether success rates decrease with repetitive cycles, we analyzed up to the first 4 cycles in 287 recipients of OD performed at our institution with respect to clinical IRs and delivery rates (DRs). For cumulative pregnancy analyses, only the cycles prior to and including the first cycle producing either a clinical pregnancy or a delivery were considered and the remaining cycles of that recipient censored. In this manner, 397 cycles were observed to result in 134 clinical pregnancies (33.8%, 95% C.I., 30-38%). Per cycle IRs were 13.9% (169/1219), 9.3% (35/376), 7.6% (8/105), and 31.6% (6/19) for cycles 1-4, respectively while the per cycle PRs were: 35.9% (103/287), 24.7% (21/85), 38.1% (8/21), and 50% (1/2) for cycles 1-4, respectively. Cumulative PRs by life-table analysis were: 35.9%, 51.7%, 70.1 % and 85.1% for cycles 1-4, respectively. Analysis of DRs revealed 112 total deliveries in 419 evaluable cycles (26.7%, 95% C.I., 23-31%). Per cycle ongoing IRs (babies per embryos transferred) were 11.2% (136/1219), 7.4% (28/376), 6.7% (7/105), and 26.3% (5/19) for cycles 1-4, respectively, while the per cycle DRs were 27.9% (80/287), 21.1% (20/95), 28.0% (7/25), and 62.5% (5/8) for cycles 1-4, respectively. Cumulative DRs were: 27.9%, 43.1%, 59.0%, and 84 6% for cycles 1-4, respectively. No decrease in per cycle IRs, PRs or DRs was observed. We conclude that 1) no decrease in IRs, PBs or DRs is observed in up to 4 cycles of OD, and 2) OD produces high cumulative success rates with a greater than 80% delivery rate after 4 cycles."

Behre Institute of Reproductive Medicine and Department of Urology of the University and Clemens-Hospital, Munster, Germany According to an abstract presented by the authors to the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Fertility Society, held April 26 - 30, 1995, in Coronado, California, "Occlusion of the vena spermatica is generally accepted as the treatment of choice in infertile patients with idiopathic varicocele. Recently, we demonstrated that surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the vena spermatica are equally effective in terms of pregnancy rates following treatment [Nieschlag et al. (1993):Andrologia 25, 233-237]. However, it remained unclear whether any treatment at all is more effective than no treatment. The current study was initiated to address this question. Materials and Methods: Infertile patients with varicocele were investigated at least twice, including Doppler sonography, ultrasonography of the scrotal contents, continuous scrotal temperature recording over 24 h, semen analysis according to WHO guidelines and hormone measurements. Other pathologies possibly leading to infertility were excluded and the patients' wives had to be free of obvious causes of infertility such as anovulation or tubal blockage. The patients fulfilling the admission criteria were randomly allocated to groups receiving either treatment (ligation or embolization) or no treatment. Thereafter, all patients were investigated and counselled every 3 months over 1 year. Results: In total, 47 couples in the treatment group (23 ligations and 24 embolizations) and 49 in the non-treatment group concluded the study. During the 1 year observation period, 14 pregnancies (28%) were recorded in the treatment group and 15 (31%) in the non-treatment group. Conclusions: These results challenge the current approach to the management of varicocele patients and emphasize the need for controlled studies in infertility treatment."

While it's often assumed the problem stems with thewoman, the fact is that up to 50% of these cases involve whatis called a "male factor problem." When seeking information on infertility couples often misunderstand the current literature and are often confused at the various lectures they attend. When in the doctor's office, many get too emotional to focus in on the proper questions to ask within the time frame they have with the physician. Only with the proper understanding of this complex subject can the couple make informed decisions and properly communicate with their physician. INFERTILITY -- Exploring The Male Factor is geared toward those couples who are just starting there fertility evaluation and hope to understand the basics of male factor fertility. It is aimed at couples who desperately seek concise no nonsense information; information vital to the couples success! Now couples can learn in the privacy of their own home, and review the tape as often as needed to learn the material. Starting with determining the proper timing of intercourse, the video is an in depth analysis of the history, physical exam, semen analysis, endocrine testing, urinalysis and the various surgical options presently available to correct male factor problems.

Endometriosis is described as the presence of endometrial tissue in locations outside the endometrial (uterine) cavity. Endometriosis is commonly found in the cul-de-sac (behind the uterus), the rectovaginal septum (the tissue between the rectum and vagina), on the surface of the rectum, the fallopian tubes and ovaries, the uterosacral ligaments, the bladder, and the pelvic side wall. Generally endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum is more likely to deeply the underlying structures. IS ENDOMETRIOSIS A GENETIC DISEASE? Studies have shown that sisters have a six times increased risk compared to their husband's sisters. Other studies show up to an eight times increased risk when compared to other women. Affected sisters are more likely to have severe disease than other. Although these studies suggest a genetic basis, presently, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The OXEGENE Study is enrolling family members with endometriosis to try and identify the genetic basis of this disease. WHAT ARE THE CAUSES? Commonly during the menstrual period, cells can be found in the fluid behind the uterus. The most widely held theory, retrograde menstruation, states that endometriosis occurs when endometrial fragments attach to nearby pelvic structures and grow. Other theories include tissue transplantation, induction of changes in peritoneal lining cells, spread through uterine veins, and direct extension through the lymphatic system. No one theory seems to explain all cases. As endometrial cells are frequently seen in peritoneal fluid in all women at the time of menses, one would expect endometriosis to develop in everyone. Obviously this is not appear the case. Unfortunately, we don't really know why. Is the immune system the cause? Immunological changes have been demonstrated in women with endometriosis, however, it is uncertain whether these immunologic findings are responsible for the endometriosis or are a result of the inflammation caused by endometriosis. HOW COMMON IS IT? At the time of tubal ligation 2-5% of women will have endometriosis, while between 25-50% of infertile women have been reported to have endometriosis. Endometriosis affects 5 million U.S. women, approximately 6-7% of all females, 30-40% of whom are infertile. STAGING SYSTEM The American Social of Reproductive Medicine has established a grading system to document the degree of severity of the disease. Unfortunately, this is not been particularly helpful in predicting response to therapy. SYMPTOMS The most common symptoms associated with endometriosis are pain and infertility, however, premenstrual spotting, urinary urgency, rectal bleeding, painful urination, bloody cough, and skin nodules may also be noted. Endometriosis may frequently mimic other disorders such as pelvic adhesions, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, and ulcer disease. Careful evaluation is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis. Diarrhea or rectal bleeding and tenesmus (sense of rectal fullness) at the time of menses are particularly telling symptoms. ENDOMETRIOSIS IS A PROGRESSIVE DISORDER Dr. Redwine described the progressive nature of endometriosis lesions. They are first seen as clear vesicles, then become red, and then progress to black lesions over a period of 7-10 years. Dr. Karnaky described water blister lesions becoming blue dome cysts over a period of 4-10 years. The clear lesions are seen are at an average age of 21.5 while black scarred lesions are seen at a mean age of 31.9. This progression from clear to red to black lesions with age confirms the progressive nature of this disease if left untreated. Disease will progress in 47-64% of women without therapy and approximately 20% of women with therapy. There is poor correlation between the degree of pain or infertility and the severity of disease. Early lesions which are clear or red are metabolically more active than older, dark, fibrotic lesions. This metabolic activity may be responsible for the associated infertility, immune abnormalities, urinary urgency, pelvic pain or diarrhea. DOES ENDOMETRIOSIS AFFECT FERTILITY? In cases where there is obvious disruption of the normal anatomy, endometriosis is a known cause of infertility. In fact 30-40% of patients with endometriosis are infertile. This is two to three times the rate of infertility in the general population. In patients with endometriosis, the monthly fecundity (chance of getting pregnant) decreases by 12-36%. However, the long term cumulative pregnancy rates are normal in patients with minimal endometriosis and normal anatomy. Studies provide contradicting information, but the bulk of research at this time indicates that pregnancy rates are not improved by treating minimal endometriosis. Let's evaluate the specific factors that may contribute to infertility in patients with endometriosis. Hormonal parameters: Compared to a normal cycle, the follicular phase may be shorter in patients with endometriosis, the estradiol may be lower, and a blunted LH surge may be seen. Progesterone levels and luteal phase endometrial biopsies, however, are normal. There is a tendency towards greater number of follicles which are smaller at the time of the LH surge in patients with endometriosis. However, this data does not prove that endometriosis is the cause of infertility. Women with subtle ovulatory dysfunction are more likely to have infertility and it may be that infertility or an abnormal hormone profile increases the likelihood of endometriosis. LUTEINIZED UNRUPTURED FOLLICLE In women with severe pelvic adhesions where the ovary is encased, luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) may be noted. This is believed to occur when, despite normal hormonal parameters (LH surge), the egg is not released from the ovary. Endometriosis is found in 63% of those patients reported to have LUF. LUF is seen in 35% of patients with endometriosis versus 11% of patients without endometriosis. However, the detection of follicular rupture by ultrasound and laparoscopy is very subjective and the diagnosis of this condition is complicated. Therefore, studies that look at endometriosis and LUF must be held suspect. IVF and Experimental models: Studies in rabbits have shown that surgical induction of endometriosis leads to a decrease in fertility from 75% to 25%. This may be due to anovulation associated with endometrial implants. Studies have evaluated immune modification in the rabbit model to attempt to restore fertility. We know that during in vitro fertilization endometriosis patients have normal hormonal profiles. There is a tendency towards fewer oocytes and it appears that oocytes derived from ovaries with endometriomas may have a lower fertilization rate and implantation rate. In order to understand whether this effect is due to the embryo or the uterine environment we can look at donor embryo studies. Dr. Simon found decreased donor oocyte implantation rates when the oocytes were from women with endometriosis. In his study, endometriosis in the recipient had no effect on implantation while other studies have found conflicting results. On the other hand, Dr. Lessey performed endometrial biopsy surface at the time of implantation and found lower levels of vitronectin (an adhesion molecule on the endometrial surface) in women with unexplained and endometriosis related infertility. Treatment with Lupron and ovulation induction appeared to restore this implantation marker and fertility. Peritoneal Effects: The effect of endometriosis on the peritoneal environment may adversely affect fertility. There is an increased volume of peritoneal fluid, and peritoneal macrophages (scavenger white blood cells), are increased both in number and activity. Cytokines (white blood cell chemical messengers) such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Interferon, C3, C4 are all increased. These may adversely affect sperm oocyte interaction, sperm mobility and survival, and oocye pick up. In addition, serum samples obtained from women with endometriosis were found to be embryotoxic in mouse embryo cultures 78% of the time versus 20% in women without endometriosis. Immune System: The immune system is affected by endometriosis and may adversely affect fertility. Patients with endometriosis may show decreased nature killer cell function, and decreased reactivity to transplanted endometrial tissue. In addition, complement, an immune component that breaks apart abnormal cells, is elevated in patients with endometriosis. TREATMENT OF ENDOMETRIOSIS RELATED INFERTILITY Danazol, birth control pills, Lupron, Synarel, Zoladex, depot-Provera and Norplant have not been proven effective as either primary or adjunctive therapy (combined with surgery) for endometriosis related infertility. While the use of medical treatment may decrease inflammatory reactions making surgical correction easier and reduce endometriosis-related pain, use of these medications in patients with minimal disease is of no proven benefit in treating infertility. Multiple studies have reported a 4-5 times improvement in fecundity (monthly chance of conception) with empirical treatment, super-ovulation with either clomiphene or injectable gonadotropins (Humegon, Metrodin, Pergonal) combined with intrauterine insemination. While complete excision of all disease and restoration of normal anatomy should be the goal of any surgical treatment, aggressive surgery may result post-operative adhesion formation. The endoscopic surgeon may need to strike a balance between excising all visible disease and limiting the risk of adhesion formation. If surgical excision is incomplete or attempts at pregnancy are to be delayed, it is advisable to plan continuous hormonal suppression following surgery. In women with distorted tubal-ovarian anatomy due to endometriosis, the first surgery is the most effective. Repeat surgical interventions are less effective at restoring fertility, than the initial attempt, which is best performed by a skilled endoscopist. Although most studies have found no proven benefit of surgical treatment for minimal endometriosis, more recent studies by Dr. Olive, Dr. Nowroozi, and Dr. Sulewski have shown increased pregnancy rates with treatment of this disease. Therefore, as endometriosis is generally considered a progressive disorder, aggressive management at the time of its discovery is appropriate. Surgical treatment of endometriosis consists of cautery, coagulation, excision or vaporization. As most cul-de-sac endometriosis is generally deeper than it may at first appear, excision should be the treatment of choice. Vaporization of adhesions on the ovarian surface, bladder flap, and uterine peritoneum may be beneficial. Treatment of ovarian endometriomas has included removal of the ovary, simple drainage, destruction of the cyst-lining with laser, bipolar electrosurgery, monopolar electrosurgery, and excision of the ovarian cyst. Although in many cases the cyst-lining can be stripped from inside the ovary during laparoscopy, in approximately 30% of the cases, this cannot be performed. In these cases, unless destruction of the lining is carried out, the endometrioma will likely recur. Use of an Argon beam coagulator, C02 laser or bipolar electrocautery are the methods of choice in this situation. Monopolar cautery must be used with caution as deeper penetration with this method may destroy normal ovarian tissue and cause premature ovarian failure. Pregnancy rates following surgery generally range between 35-40% for severe endometriosis to 55-65% with milder disease. There appears to be no difference in pregnancy rates with laparoscopy or laparotomy with laser or electrosurgical techniques. While long term pregnancy rates may approach 65%, surgical studies that look at fecundity show monthly pregnancy rates as low as 3-6% per month following surgical treatment of this disease. Usually normal fecundity can be achieved with ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination. Dr. Martin found that post-operative pregnancy rates appeared best for those with infertility of short duration of one to two years of 68%. Those who had been trying between three and seven years had a 43% pregnancy rate, while those with eight or more years of infertility showed a pregnancy rate of less than 10%. In patients with normal anatomy, a reasonable trial of injectable gonadotropins and intrauterine insemination is three to four cycles. If normal anatomy cannot be restored or the patient has not been successful with ovulation and intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization should be considered. In women with large endometriomas, removal of the ovarian cyst may be necessary prior to proceeding with in vitro fertilization. Many physicians are now recommending immune screening prior to proceeding with in vitro fertilization for patients with endometriosis. While initial data look promising, further studies will ascertain the appropriateness of this approach. DEVELOPING A PLAN When determining appropriate course of treatment for this disease, it is necessary to challenge fertility concerns with correction of pain and other symptoms. Surgical treatment is best performed by skilled endoscopists who can balance your desired fertility with the need to aggressively excise abnormal endometrial tissue, restore normal anatomy, and treat pain and other symptoms. As endometriosis is a progressive, ongoing, long term disorder, patients should plan to establish an ongoing relationship with a physician who is a skilled endoscopic surgeon, is comfortable with all medical aspects of treatment, is experienced in managing infertility and most important, one who is available and willing to listen when you have a concern.

Leukocyte concentrations in peritoneal fluid are significantly elevated in early disease. As the disease progresses to more severe stages, the levels of macrophages and T-helper WBCs responsible for mounting an immune response are depressed. Natural killer cell (NK cells, CD56+ cells) cytotoxicity is an important component of the body's natural immunosurveillance system. Higher levels of estrogen and more advanced stages of disease have been associated with a decreased NK cell function. The use of a GnRH agonist such as Lupron or Zoladex may work to augment the NK cell activity as well as improving macrophage cytoxicity. For more info: Hill JA, Faris HMP Schiff I, et al.

Mastro Endometriosis is a disease primarily of the female reproductivesystem that is often misdiagnosed, and the result of a misdiagnosiscan have devastating consequences to the sufferer. "Endometriosisis defined as the abnormal growth of endometrial cells - the samecells that make up the lining of the uterus and are shed monthlyin the menstrual process - outside the uterus" (Schrotenboerand Subak-Sharpe, 74). These wayward cells can position themselvesin the lower abdomen on areas such as the female organs and thestomach, and occasionally they can be found in such remote placesas the lungs. On these locations the cells act as though theyare uterine cells, adjusting to the changing hormone levels ofthe menstrual cycle. But, unlike uterine cells, they have nopassage-way out of the body so they stay where they are and continuetheir cycle, causing scarring and adhesions as the body attemptsto protect itself from the harm. (Schrotenboer and Subak-Sharpe,et al., 74-76). It is estimated that 5.5 million women have endometriosisin the United States and Canada. (Nezhat, xi) Endometriosis is categorized and diagnosed in four stagesbased on location(s) affected: Stage I, or minimal, disease (superficialendometriosis, filmy adhesions); Stage II, or mild, disease (superficialand deep endometriosis, filmy adhesions); Stage III, or moderate,disease (superficial and deep endometriosis, filmy and dense adhesions)and Stage IV, or severe, disease (superficial and deep endometriosis,dense adhesions). Even though the stages may seem similar, thesizes and number of areas diseased indicate diagnosis. (Breitkopfand Bakoulis, 59) Since misdiagnosis often occurs with endometriosis, a womanshould be concerned if she exhibits the symptoms associated withthe disease. Symptoms can include pelvic pain, painful intercourse,inability to get pregnant, atypical periods, nausea, vomiting,exhaustion, bladder problems, frequent infections, dizziness,painful defecation, lower backaches, irritable bowels, other stomachproblems, and low-grade fever. These disturbances are usually,but not always, cyclic in conjunction with menstruation. It wouldseem that these symptoms should help to ensure a proper diagnosis,but there could be different reasons for the discomforts otherthan endometriosis. It is also important to note, at this point,that not all women with the disease suffer from symptoms, evenin Stage IV. (Ballweg, et al., 16) For example, some women don'tdiscover that they have the disease until they try to get pregnantand cannot, or their doctor discovers the disease's presence duringan unrelated type of abdominal surgery such as tubal ligation(a voluntary procedure that prevents women from getting pregnant). Even though some women with endometriosis are asymptomatic,pain plays a large role in a significant percentage of women withthe disease. Therefore, it is important to give special recognitionto this, at times, crippling pain. Kay Ellen Hurlbutt, R.N.-C,M.S.N., F.N.P., states: Pain was reported to interfere in some way with all aspectsof activities of daily living. Most frequently reported, 78 percent,was interference with sleep. Woman frequently reported difficultyfalling asleep because of the pain or being awakened from sleepby the pain. This finding is significant because fatigue tendsto potentiate the severity of pain. (Hurlbutt, 269) She writes more on the pain caused by endometriosis: A questionnairedistributed to 100 randomly selected members of the EndometriosisAssociation, and participated in by 68 of the 100, showed thefollowing results: pain reported by 100%; 1-2 days prior to cycle71%; mid-cycle 47%; other times 40%; pain throughout 20%; andintermittent pain with no pattern around 7%. Since the onsetof pain, 81% reported pain was progressive. The pain was mostly,but not exclusively, abdominal. (Hurlbutt, 268) Not only canthis pain be tormenting, it manifests itself in other ways: Respondents were asked to describe their moods and feelingswhen experiencing pain. Eighty-four percent reported feelingdepressed, 75 percent irritable, 63 percent experienced mood swings,54 percent reported feeling anxious, 53 percent angry, 51 percentnegative, 43 percent helpless, 35 percent fearful and powerless,32 percent worried, 31 percent insecure, and 19 percent hopeless. (Hurlbutt, 270) This is one woman's experience: I have always had problems with my periods. Till I was diagnosed,I never knew when I would get my period. I would always knowhow it would be. It always lasted seven days, severe cramps,back aches, headaches, leg cramps, bloating. Incredibly heavyflow, with a lot of clotting. My gyn would only pat me on theback and tell me I was just one of the unfortunate ones. Endometriosis has been called husbanditis. Bedriddensufferers of the disease were thought to be refusing their husband'saffections. These women were often treated with medications forrelaxation and to relieve their discomfort. In more extreme cases,they were given hysterectomies. Today small improvement has beenmade. Despite the fact that diagnosis is more prevalent today,it is usually found in the late stages when damage has alreadybeen done. Many women are still being told that their symptomsare all in their head, and when the disease is properly diagnosedit is usually after other physicians have missed the diagnosisover a long period of time as told in this woman's story (Maleskeyand Inlander, 116-117): I can tell you, I went to 10 doctors and had 10 differentdiagnosis until one came up with endo. You can't believe howrelieved I was! I had everything from a pulled muscle, to "youneed to have a baby or a hysterectomy," to bladder infections,to kidney stones, to "it's just cramps," to ovariancysts... the list goes on. Barbara Eck Menning, Founder of RESOLVE, The Infertility SupportGroup, writes, "Even though endometriosis is a disease seenin older women, it may have been present for years, causing painfulperiods. Doctors used to pat women on the head and tell themthat menstrual discomfort was normal and a small price to payfor eventual motherhood" (Menning, 54). One woman writes: Around [the age] 21 or 22, I was referred to a psychiatristthat dealt in psychosomatic pain as my S.O. [significant other](at the time) and my doctor didn't see a "real" basisfor these new pains. A week or so after the first psychiatristappointment, I had a laparoscopy [diagnostic surgery discussedlater] "just to check" and they found the endometriosis. I refused to go back to the psychiatrist now that my pain wasacknowledged as real. There can also be financial repercussions associated witha diagnosis of endometriosis as told by another woman: At some point a couple of years ago I toyed with the ideaof filing a malpractice suit against that first doctor. I'm nota litigious money grubber. But I have been financially hurt toa great degree (I only had insurance off and on during those earlyyears: I was a college student with no insurance). Danazol [treatmentmedication] is expensive! Biopsies are expensive! Not to mentionthat had this been caught sooner (when I knew there was somethingworse wrong with me more than hemorrhoids), things might havebeen different. Looking at the presence of pain, pain with intercourse, symptomsof pelvic inflammatory disease and/or infertility, may help gainsome insight into why endometriosis is difficult to diagnose. Menstrual cramps are a common complaint for many women, butit is difficult for a physician to decide just how bad the crampsare, and what could be causing them. Even severe pain does notdenote the presence of endometriosis. Because of this, diagnosticsurgery to investigate cause for pain may be delayed. (Breitkopfand Bakoulis, 68). Pain with intercourse is also difficult to diagnose, becauseit is relative, can be emotional, can be physical, or it can beall of the above. The doctor must decide if the patient is experiencinga change in her life such as a new partner after years in thesame relationship or some other personal anomaly. (Breitkopfand Bakoulis, 68-69) Endometriosis can be mistaken for pelvic inflammatory disease. Dr. Kathryn Schrotenboer writes: In some instances, the signs of endometriosis may be similarto those of pelvic inflammatory disease, a serious infection involvingthe pelvic organs. It is not unusual for a woman to undergo antibiotictreatment for pelvic inflammatory disease and later discover thatthe problem is really endometriosis. Therefore, if a woman istreated for pelvic inflammatory disease without improvement, sheshould be examined for endometriosis. (Schrotenboer and Subak-Sharpe,77-78) The only problem with this train of thought is that if a womanhas symptoms of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) and is treated,she may feel better leading her and her doctor to believe sheis better. But endometriosis, as we've learned, is cyclic. Thesymptoms may pass anyway, and the patient still has not been properlydiagnosed. Testimony from a woman with endometriosis reveals: During the years before my diagnosis of severe and aggressiveendometriosis, I was treated numerous times for pelvic inflammatorydisease. My follow-up examinations always indicated that thetenderness in my abdomen had improved and that the medicationsprescribed must have worked. However, results from my laparoscopyrevealed that I did not show any evidence of infection, past orpresent. Endometriosis can be suspected if a woman has trouble gettingpregnant, but infertility itself is a perplexing condition. Apatient may have no physical findings, yet cannot become pregnant. Endometriosis is among various problems that can cause infertility. (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 69) This is how one woman describedher experience with her doctor: He kept telling me I had "irritable bowel" syndrome. Then I got a positive pregnancy test - followed by 6 weeks ofbleeding. It turned out to be a luteal cyst causing a fake hormone/positivepregnancy test. However, I didn't know this until a year or solater and at the time my GP kept saying, "Well at least youknow you can conceive." I tried for another 6 months andthen went to my doctor, thumped the table and said, "Whycan't I get pregnant?" Only then would he refer me on toa gynecologist. Within 6 weeks I had a laparoscopy and confirmedendometriosis, adhesions and blocked tubes. So how do doctors diagnose endometriosis? This question isimportant because, as with any disease, early diagnosis can helpto prevent or delay its damaging affects. There are several waysdoctors establish the presence of the disease. Doctors may suspect endometriosis if a woman's pelvic examand biography indicate a possible problem. During the exam a doctormay discover small lumps on the uterus and near the lower areaof the large bowel, and the patient may experience discomfortwhen these areas are touched. However, these symptoms can alsobe signs of other non-cancerous uterine growths. (Stewart, etal., 649-650). Timing of pelvic exams is also important: Since the symptoms of endometriosis vary considerably fromwoman to woman, as do the physical manifestations, definite diagnosisgenerally requires a more extensive procedure than the usual pelvicexamination. Even so, a pelvic examination - especially at somepoint during the menstrual period, when the condition is its mostexaggerated - may find typical signs pointing to endometriosis. (Schrotenboer and Subak-Sharpe, 77) Betty Jennings, R.N., C.N.M., M.S.N., contends, "Pelvicfindings may be typical of endometriosis. On the other hand,minimal disease can result in a perfectly normal exam" (Jennings,123). However, this is not always the case. A doctor does notalways feel abnormalities characteristic of Stage IV endometriosis,even when informed by the patient of symptoms being present. Here is one woman's story: Turns out that I had a chocolate [blood filled] cyst insidemy left ovary and it had ruptured, tearing my ovary open in theprocess. Oddly, I had had a pelvic exam just two weeks earlierand was pronounced just fine. It is also important for a woman to find a doctor that shefeels comfortable talking with and who will listen to her concernsand symptoms. However, this does not always ensure an accuratediagnosis if the doctor does not understand the disease. For thisreason it is important that women educate themselves on theirsymptoms and seek a second opinion if necessary. The medicalcommunity plays an important role as well: Whenever a woman complains of abnormal cycles, several possibilitiesmust be considered: pregnancy with first trimester bleeding, cervicalpathology, endometrial pathology, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatorydisease, coagulopathy, and hormonal imbalance resulting in dysfunctionaluterine bleeding. After all pathology has been excluded and awoman's overall health status ascertained, women may be reassuredas to the wide range of normal that characterizes the menstrualcycle. (Betty Jennings, 107) (Pathology is defined in Webster's New World Dictionaryas the branch of medicine that deals with the nature of disease...any abnormal variation from a sound condition.) An ultrasound device, used vaginally by a skilled physicianor technician, can be indispensable in diagnosing large cystsand other characteristics of progressing endometriosis. The ultrasonicsound waves can be projected through the pelvic area in searchof possible abnormalities. The device can locate masses compassing2 cm. to 18 cm. Even though severe cases of endometriosis maynot be clear using the ultrasound due to congestion, abnormalitieswill still be present. Because implants of endometriosis canbe smaller than 2 cm., ultrasounds can miss some instances ofthe disease. (McDonough, 258-262) But as an inexpensive andpain-free procedure the ultrasound, performed by a competent medicalperson, is well worth the time as told here: (Around this time [right before her diagnosis], I joined theEndometriosis Association and was reading all I could find aboutendo.) The specialist's next appointment was in a month. Meanwhile,I had an ultrasound, which showed a 13 cm cyst (about 5 inchesin diameter). The ultrasound technician must have been surprisedat how happy I was to see such a bona-fide abnormality in my body. It's undeniable now, I thought. Researchers are looking into a blood test to assist in examiningwomen with symptoms of endometriosis. CA-125 is a cell surfaceprotein found in pelvic organs that appears to be elevated incases of moderate or severe endometriosis. Some studies disclaimthese findings, but as Sue Deutsch writes, work done at the BowmanGray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, foundan increased level of the protein in 73% of women with moderatedisease and 100% of women with severe endometriosis. It was alsofound that there was less CA-125 in treated cases of the disorder. (Deutsch, 232) It should, however, be noted that anyovarian cyst can have high levels of CA125. Dr. Mark Perloe atthe Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre believes CA125 testingshows the most promise in cases of severe disease and in instanceswhere there reoccurrence of endometriosis is supected after treatment. The laparoscope is a surgical tool that can be used for definitediagnosis of endometriosis. It is a slender, unbending fiber-optictube approximately one foot long with a lens that allows doctorsto view the pelvic cavity and surrounding areas. Laparoscopy,when used correctly, is usually 100% accurate in diagnosing endometriosis. The procedure does, however, require anesthesia, some incision(s)and a period of recuperation. (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 70-71) When discussing surgery, there is also a question as to whichmethod of removing the disease is more effective, excising orlazoring, once endometriosis is found. The patient then needsto decide whether or not to begin hormonal therapy following apositive diagnosis, which does have some side affects. As seen so far, endometriosis is not an easy disease to diagnose,and the only definite diagnosis is made though surgery. Despitethe fact that surgery is intimidating for most people, diagnosticlaparoscopy can detect actual disease, and in the cases whereabnormalities are present, surgical correction can be done atthe same time as the procedure. The discomfort of surgery isusually accepted for physical evidence of symptoms: For most women with endometriosis, simply having their casediagnosed brings immense relief, emotionally as well as physically. After suffering for years from a condition with vague symptomsand no name, patients are relieved to gain at least some understandingof what the mysterious disorder is and to know that treatmentwill alleviate some of the painful symptoms. (Breitkopf and Bakoulis,85-85) A woman writes, "Previous to surgery I was never diagnosedas having endo. It was a word unlike the many other diagnosticwords that had been hurled at me over the years (Ileitis, Crohn'sDisease, Multiple Sclerosis and more, many more)." The cause of endometriosis is an enigma. It is not knownwhy some woman suffer with endometriosis while other woman appearto be perfectly healthy: One of the most baffling things about endometriosis is thatno one knows how it starts - how or why substance resembling thelining of the uterus and having a specific function within thatorgan grows in other parts of the body where it clearly is notneeded. This is one of the first questions most patients askme, and I can respond only by telling them the theories of whatmay cause endometriosis. If doctors could tell their patientswhy it occurs, we would certainly be a lot closer to understandinghow to prevent and treat the condition. (Breitkopf and Bakoulis,39) Following are theories as to why some woman are more susceptiblethan others: There is the retrograde bleeding theory. This theory impliesthat retrograde (backward) bleeding through the fallopian tubesduring menstruation causes endometriosis. "Studies todayshow that women who have obstructions of the lower genital tractthat might cause menstrual "back up," such as vaginaland uterine infections, have higher rates of endometriosis thanthe general population of woman" (Breitkopf and Bakoulis,42). But since a majority of women experience some degree ofretrograde bleeding and don't get endometriosis, this theory couldnot be proven. (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 42-43) There is the change in cells theory whereby a change in cellscauses endometriosis. Like retrograde bleeding, these changescould be a result of chronic infections. This theory is alsosupported in the cases of men with endometriosis who were takinglarge amounts of estrogen, and estrogen can cause cell changes. There is also more incidence of endometriosis in females whosemothers were treated with the DES (diethylstilbestrol) hormoneduring pregnancy and in women who have pain with menstruation. It is the elevated amount of estrogen typical in these two circumstancesthat may cause endometriosis. Research is currently being doneon other conditions that could cause cell changes. (Breitkopfand Bakoulis, 45-46) Some researchers theorize that cell changes caused by externalchemicals can induce endometriosis. Research has been done onwomen who have had surgery, such as Cesarean, but studies wereinconclusive as to whether this exposure could cause the disease. (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 46-47) Some researchers suggest that women with susceptible immunesystems from birth may be more vulnerable to endometriosis. Thistheory is further supported by hereditary factors that seem consistentwith the disease. Lyle J. Breitkopf, M.D., and Marion GordonBakoulis write: If this theory ever proves true, the fact would form the "missinglink" in completing Sampson's retrograde bleeding theory. As we have suggested, if retrograde bleeding occurs in most women,then most of them must also have a built-in mechanism that rejectsendometrial fluid outside the uterus - otherwise most women woulddevelop endometriosis. (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 48) Because of the emotional and physical damage caused by endometriosis,improvements on the doctor/patient level need to be made. Followingis one example of the complications that can result from endometriosis: I was under [surgery] for 5 hours because I had Stage IV endo*everywhere*. Paul [her husband] was so worried in the waitingroom because we thought I'd only be under for an hour. Sorryfor the graphical nature of this, but my intestines were kinkedand grown to my chest wall and all my organs were *glued* togetherand covered with scar tissue. My ovaries were grown to my uterusand completely obscured, my uterus was grown to the back wall,my intestines were grown to my sides. Another story resounds the importance of doctor/patient discipline: It's clear from the damage to my reproductive organs thatthe endo had been going its route for some time. Why couldn'tmy caretakers have suspected this from the symptoms that I presented? Why wasn't I better informed so I would have suspected myselfthat something bad could potentially be happening with my body? It just isn't a fair disease. Like most diseases, endometriosis is not fair. As we haveseen, it can rob a woman of her ability to have children, it cancause pain that severely interrupts everyday existence, and theseheartaches are further frustrated by the numerous misdiagnosesthat appear to be almost acceptable in the medical community. For this reason, woman need to become more aware of their bodiesand doctors need to listen better to the symptoms of endometriosis. It is also vital that women take an active role in the medicaltreatment they are receiving and force doctors to heed concerns. The more women speak out, the more powerful they become. Forthe fight against rampant misdiagnosis of endometriosis, womenmust be armed with knowledge or the continued injustice servedits victims will keep the apathy alive and well.

Titled "Endometriosis 2000," the meeting was cosponsoredby the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(NICHD), NlH's Office of Research on Women's Health, the NationalInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the National Instituteon Aging, in cooperation with the Endometriosis Association. Endometriosis results when tissue resembling the endometrium--thelining of the uterus--begins growing on the outside of the uterusand perhaps in other parts of the abdominal cavity. The disorder affects as many as 10 percent of women of reproductiveage, with 30 to 40 percent of the women diagnosed with endometriosisexperiencing notable pain. In addition, a diagnosis of endometriosishas been found to be a significant factor in female infertility. In his opening talk, NICHD Director Duane Alexander, MD, set thetone for the meeting, describing endometriosis as mystifying,both in its causes and treatments. "Although it is generally agreed to be a common disorder,we really have no good data on its impact as a public health problem,"Dr. Alexander said. "We don't even have good informationon its prevalence, in part because it is often misdiagnosed orunder diagnosed, and because it varies widely according to thepopulation that's under study." Dr. Alexander noted that although treatments for endometriosishave existed for many years, they often have not been based onrigorous scientific testing. He added, however, that basic science efforts by the NICHD andNlH's Office of Research on Women's Health have begun laying thegroundwork for rigorous study of the disease. The Director of the Office of Research on Women's Health, VivianPinn, MD, explained that endometriosis has been a priority withthat office since its research agenda was devised in 1991. Sheadded that endometriosis is one of the two leading indicatorsfor hysterectomy for women under age 54 and is the most frequentlydiagnosed uterine dysfunction in women. "We need more knowledge about the origins of endometriosisand the development of more effective, non-surgical interventions,"Dr. Pinn said. Dr. Pinn noted that the bulk of that Office's original fundingwas earmarked for collaborative efforts with NICHD for researchon endometriosis and another uterine condition, leiomyoma. "I can assure you that endometriosis has been, and will continueto be, among our highest priorities for research, until we havesome of the answers which are now being sought," she said. Mary Lou Ballweg, the President and Executive Director of theEndometriosis Association, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, describedthe disease from the patient's perspective. "If endometriosis is baffling to the doctors who treat itand the researchers who study it, imagine what it must be liketo have it," she said. Ms. Ballweg noted that endometriosis is often diagnosed long afterthe first time its symptoms appear. She cited three studies whichfound that although endometriosis may first appear in the teenyears, it may not be diagnosed until 10 or 15 years later. Shespeculated that this delay in diagnosis might result in some womenhaving hysterectomies when they might otherwise have avoided them. Because research has provided few insights, the myth persiststhat endometriosis is a disease of over educated career womenwho have postponed childbearing. "In short, endometriosis can be, from the patient's pointof view, a nightmare of misinformation, myths, taboos, delayeddiagnoses, and problematic, hit-and-miss treatments overlaid ona painful, chronic, stubborn disease," she said. Brenda Eskenazi, an epidemiologist at the University of Californiain Berkeley, explained why endometriosis has been so difficultto study. First, she said, the disease is difficult to classify, becauseit takes a number of forms, from tiny reddish growths to largebrown lesions. Some women experience significant pain, while othersmay not even realize they have the disease. Furthermore, the actual number of people who have endometriosisis also difficult to determine. Severe cases of the disease, shesaid, would probably be seen by physicians. But endometriosiscases involving few or no symptoms may never receive medical attention. One of the most common methods for studying risks for the diseaseis the case control study. In this method, women who are diagnosedwith the disease, the cases, are compared to controls,women with similar characteristics who do not have the disease. The major problem with this method, Dr. Eskenazi said, becomesapparent when researchers question the women about factors thatmay have influenced the development of their endometriosis. Toillustrate her point, she gave a hypothetical example involvingexercise. When questioned about whether they exercise or not,the control group might say that they always exercise, whereasthe case group might say they never do. What the questioning mayfail to reveal, however, is that the case group did exercise,but gave up the practice when their symptoms began. To accurately gauge the extent of endometriosis in the populationas a whole, Dr. Eskenazi said that scientists need some way toscreen large numbers of women for the disease. But the only definitiveway to diagnose endometriosis is through laparoscopy. Performing this procedure on a large number of women to learnif a few of them have undetected endometriosis would be inexcusable,Dr. Eskenazi explained, as medical ethics forbids subjecting otherwisehealthy people to the risks of surgery when there is no medicalneed for it. She added that mass screening for endometriosis will only be possiblewith the discovery of some sort of biochemical marker--perhapsa chemical found exclusively in blood samples of women who haveendometriosis. In a later presentation, NICHD grantee Kathy Sharpe-Timms, PhD.,HCLD, briefly discussed the possibility of devising such a test.Sharpe-Timms, a researcher at the University of Missouri in Columbia,noted that because endometriosis seems to vary so greatly, anyblood test for the condition would probably seek to detect a largenumber of chemical compounds, not just one. Overall, she said, studies on the biochemistry of endometriosishave been inconclusive. She listed a variety of substances producedby endometriosis lesions, but added that it is unknown whetherthese compounds produce the disease or are merely results of it. In particular, she said, biochemical studies have made it clearthat one type of endometrial growth, petechiae, needs closer attentionthan it has received. These small, reddish growths are typicallyoverlooked by physicians. However, petechiae produce greater amountsof chemicals known as prostaglandins than other types of endometrialgrowths. "I caution you, please don't ignore this particular implantwhen you're looking at patients," she told the largely physicianaudience attending the meeting. NICHD grantee Bruce Lessey, PhD, MD, reported that a protein hisgroup is investigating may play a key role in explaining why certainpatients with minimal endometriosis fail to get pregnant. Dr.Lessey is a researcher at the University of North Carolina inChapel Hill. The protein, called the Beta-3 subunit of the vitronectin receptor--Beta-3,for short-appears on the lining of the uterus on the 19th or 20thday of the menstrual cycle. A group of endometriosis patientsDr. Lessey and his coworkers studied lacked appropriate expressionof Beta-3 during the receptive time of their monthly cycles. Fromanimal studies, it appears that Beta-3 is important for allowingthe embryo to implant on the wall of the uterus. The researchers observed these women for four years. Few of thosewho did not receive any treatment for their endometriosis havebecome pregnant. Otherso were treated for a time with the drugLupron which interferes with the production of estrogen. Mostof the women became pregnant shortly after ending their courseof therapy with the drug. NICHD grantee James H. Liu, MD, a researcher at the Universityof Cincinnati College of Medicine, reviewed current treatmentsfor endometriosis. He said that recently diagnosed patients havethree options: no therapy, surgical therapy, and drug therapy. Dr. Liu warned against treating women who have evidence of endometriosisbut do not have symptoms. "Do not treat asymptomatic patients," he advised theconference participants. "If you treat, you may generatesymptoms within one month of treatment." Surgery is an option for severe cases. For some patients who experienceextreme pain and are not concerned with fertility, removal ofthe ovaries and uterus may be the best option. In other cases,laparoscopy accompanied by laser surgery to selectively removeendometrial growths may be advisable. Dr. Liu cautioned, however,that endometrial growths removed surgically may later return,requiring additional treatment. Physicians may also offer their patients the choice of a varietyof hormonal treatments designed to temporarily stop the ovariesfrom functioning. Again, however, once therapy stops, symptomsmay return. At times, patients may be given hormonal therapy before surgery,to decrease the size of their endometrial growths. Dr. Liu warnedthat this approach may backfire, however, as the therapy may shrinka growth so much that the surgeon may miss it. After therapy,the growth may reappear and symptoms may resume. The most widespread hormonal treatment is with oral contraceptives,which combine estrogen and progestin. Side effects of this treatmentare weight gain, water retention, nausea, vaginal bleeding, anda slightly increased risk of stroke. Progestins alone may also relieve the symptoms of endometriosis.These may be given orally, or injected in a slow-release formwhich gradually releases small amounts of the hormone. Injectionsof Depo Provera generally last 1 to 3 months. Among the side effectsof this therapy are weight gain, vaginal dryness, water retention,and mood changes. Another hormonal therapy is treatment with Danazol, a testosterone-likecompound. Dr. Liu noted that the side effects of this treatmentare highly undesirable. These are weight gain, reduction in breastsize, oily skin, acne, increase in facial hair, and muscle cramps.Moreover, women who take Danazol for more than six months mayexperience a permanent deepening of the voice. The remaining therapy is treatment with one of a variety of GnRHanalogs, compounds that halt estrogen release by preventing releaseof Gonadotropin releasing hormone, the master hormone which ultimatelysignals estrogen production. The scientific c evidence suggeststhe GnRH analogs are more effective at relieving the pain of endometriosisthan are any of the other hormonal therapies. However, as estrogen production ceases with GnRH analogs, suchmenopausal symptoms as vaginal dryness, hot flushes, mood changes,and decrease in sex drive may result. Because the therapy interfereswith calcium absorption, it must be halted after six months, orirreparable bone loss will result. Dr. Liu said that several clinical trials were under way to extendthe therapy by preventing or slowing the bone loss. One strategyis to give study volunteers very small doses of estrogen and progestinin addition to GnRH analogs. Other researchers are reducing thedose of GnRH analog so that only a slight amount of estrogen isreleased. A final discussion at the conference involved a summary of futureresearch needs. A consensus emerged that the current classificationsystem for grading endometriotic lesions was less than satisfactoryand required rigorous redefinition. This was deemed essentialto establishing clear baselines for pathophysiology studies ofendometriosis morbidities.

Endometriosis is a puzzling disease affecting women in their reproductive years. The name comes from the word "endometrium," which is the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus and builds up and sheds each month in the menstrual cycle. In endometriosis, tissue I like the endometrium is found outside the uterus, in other areas of the body. In these locations outside the uterus, the endometrial tissue develops into what are called "nodules," "tumors," "lesions," "implants," or "growths." These growths can cause pain, infertility, and other problems. The most common locations of endometrial growths are in the abdomen_involving the ligaments supporting the uterus, the area between the vagina and the rectum, the outer surface of the uterus, and the lining of the pelvic cavity. Sometimes the growths are also found in abdominal surgery scars, on the intestines or in the rectum, on the bladder, vagina, cervix, and vulva (external genitals). Endometrial growths have also been found outside the abdomen, in the lung, arm, thigh, and other locations, but these are uncommon. Endometrial growths are generally not malignant or cancerous_they are a normal type of tissue outside the normal location. (However, in recent decades there has been an increased frequency of malignancy occurring or being recognized in conjunction with endometriosis.) Like the lining of the uterus, endometrial growths usually respond to the hormones of the menstrual cycle. They build up tissue each month, break down, and cause bleeding. However, unlike the lining of the uterus, endometrial tissue outside the uterus has no way of leaving the body. The result is internal bleeding, degeneration of the blood and tissue shed from the growths, inflammation of the surrounding areas, and formation of scar tissue. Other complications, depending on the location of the growths, can be rupture of growths (which can spread endometriosis to new areas), the formation of adhesions, intestinal bleeding or obstruction (if the growths are in or near the intestines), interference with bladder function (if the growths are on or in the bladder), and other problems. Symptoms seem to worsen with time, though cycles of remission and reoccurrence are the pattern in some cases. SYMPTOMS: The most common symptoms of endometriosis are pain before and during periods (usually worse than "normal" menstrual cramps), during or after sexual activity, infertility, and heavy or irregular bleeding. Other symptoms may include fatigue; painful bowel movements with periods; lower back pain with periods; diarrhea and/or constipation and other intestinal upset with periods Some women with endometriosis have no symptoms. Infertility affects about 30-40% of women with endometriosis and is a common result with progression of the disease. The amount of pain is not necessarily related to the extent or size of growths. Tiny growths(called"petechial")have been found to be more active in producing prostaglandins, which may explain the significant symptoms that often seem to occur with small implants. Prostaglandins are substances produced throughout the body, involved in numerous functions, and thought to cause many of the symptoms of endometriosis. THEORIES ABOUT THE CAUSE OF ENDOMETRIOSIS The cause of endometriosis is not known. A number of theories have been advanced but no one of them seems to account for all cases. One theory is the retrograde menstruation or transtubal migration theory_that during menstruation some of the menstrual tissue backs up through the fallopian tubes, implants in the abdomen, and grows. Some experts on endometriosis believe all women experience some menstrual tissue backup and that an immune system problem and/or hormonal problem allows this tissue to take root and grow in women who develop endometriosis. Another theory suggests that the endometrial tissue is distributed from the uterus to other parts of the body through the Iymph system or the blood system. A genetic theory suggests that it may be carried in the genes of certain families or that certain families may have predisposing factors to endometriosis. Another theory suggests that remnants of tissue from when the woman was an embryo may later develop into endometriosis or that some adult tissues retain the ability they had in the embryo stage to transform into reproductive tissue under certain circumstances. Surgical transplantation has also been cited as a cause in cases where endometriosis is found in abdominal surgery scars, although it has also been found in such scars when direct accidental implantation seems unlikely. Other theories are being developed by the Association and others researching endometriosis. DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis of endometriosis is generally considered uncertain until proven by laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is a minor surgical procedure done under anesthesia in which the patient's abdomen is distended with carbon dioxide gas to make the organs easier to see and a laparoscope (a tube with a light in it) is inserted into a tiny incision in the abdomen. By moving the laparoscope around the abdomen, the surgeon can check the condition of the abdominal organs and see the endometrial implants, if care and thoroughness are used. A doctor can often feel the endometrial implants upon palpation (pelvic examination by the doctor's hands), and symptoms will often indicate endometriosis, but medical textbooks indicate it is not good practice to treat this disease without confirmation of the diagnosis. Ovarian cancer sometimes has the same symptoms as endometriosis, and hormonal treatment (particularly estrogen), which is common in treating endometriosis, could cause a cancer to grow even faster. A laparoscopy also indicates the locations, extent, and size of the growths and may help the doctor and patient make better informed, long-range decisions about treatment and pregnancy. TREATMENT Treatment for endometriosis has varied over the years but no sure cure has yet been found. Hysterectomy and removal of the ovaries has been considered a "definitive" cure, but Association research has found such a high rate of continuation/recurrence that women need to be aware of steps they can take to protect themselves. (Space does not allow us to detail these steps here - please see additional Association literature.) Painkillers are usually prescribed for the pain of endometriosis. Treatment with hormones aims to stop ovulation for as long as possible and can sometimes force endometriosis into remission during the time of treatment and sometimes for months or years afterwards. Hormonal treatments include estrogen and progesterone, progesterone alone, a testosterone derivative (danazol), and a new drug, GnRH, gonadotropin releasing hormone. Side effects are a problem for some women with all hormonal treatments. Because pregnancy often causes a temporary remission of symptoms and because it is believed that infertility is more likely the longer the disease is present, women with endometriosis are often advised not to postpone pregnancy. However, there are numerous problems with the "Prescription" of pregnancy to treat endometriosis. The woman might not yet have made a decision about childbearing, certainly one of the most important decisions in life. she might not have critical elements in place to allow for childbearing and child bearing (partner, financial means, etc.). she may already be infertile. Other factors may also make the pregnancy decision and experience harder. Women with endometriosis have higher rates of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage and one study has found they have more difficult pregnancies and labors. Research also shows there are family links in endometriosis, increasing the risk of endometriosis and related health problems in the children of women with the disease. Conservative surgery, either major or through the laparoscope, involving removal or destruction of the growths, is also done and can relieve symptoms and allow pregnancy to occur in some cases. As with other treatments, however, recurrences are common. Surgery through the laparoscope (called operative laparoscopy) is rapidly replacing major abdominal surgery in the U.S. and will probably also do so in other countries. In operative laparoscopy, surgery is carried out through the Iaparoscope using laser, cautery, or small surgical instruments. Radical surgery, involving hysterectomy and removal of all growths and the ovaries (to prevent further hormonal stimulation) becomes necessary in cases of long-standing, troublesome endometriosis. Menopause also generally ends the activity of mild or moderate endometriosis. Even after radical surgery or menopause, however, a severe case of endometriosis can be reactivated by estrogen replacement therapy or continued hormone production after menopause. Some authorities suggest no replacement hormone be given for a short period (3-9 months) after hysterectomy and removal of the ovaries for endometriosis. LEARNING ABOUT ENDOMETRIOSIS Endometriosis is without question one of the most puzzling conditions that affect women. More is being learned about it as time goes on and this knowledge is dispelling some of the assumptions of the past which now have been disproven or are suspect. One of these past assumptions was that nonwhite women did not generally get endometriosis. This has now been shown to be untrue_often nonwhite women in the past were not getting the kind of medical care to have endometriosis. Another "myth" about endometriosis was that very young women did not get it_an idea that probably arose because formerly teenagers and younger women endured menstrual pain (often one of the early symptoms) in silence and did not get pelvic exams until the disease progressed to unbearable proportions. It was also believed in the past that endometriosis more often affected well-educated women. Now we know that this notion developed because well-educated women were those getting the best medical care and were more often persistent enough to obtain explanations for their symptoms. Another assumption that has at times been made about ndometriosis is that it is not a serious disease because it is not a killer like cancer, for instance. However, anyone who has talked with many women with endometriosis about their actual experiences with the condition soon learns that while some women's lives are relatively unaffected by it, especially in the early stages, too many others have suffered severe pain, emotional stress, have been unable to work or carry on normal activities at times, and have experienced financial and relationship problems because of the disease. Perhaps someday soon we will understand this perplexing disease and be able to end all the myths, pain, and frustrations that sometimes go with it! HOW THE ENDOMETRIOSIS ASSOCIATION CAN HELP The Endometriosis Association is a self-help organization of women with endometriosis and others interested in exchanging information about endometriosis, offering mutual support and help to those affected by endometriosis, educating the public and medical community about the disease, and promoting research related to endometriosis. Ending the feeling of being alone, sharing with others who understand what one is going through, counteracting the lack of information and misinformation about endometriosis, and learning from each other are ways those affected by the disease help each other. The Association is an international organization with headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (USA)- members in numerous countries, and chapters and activities concentrated in North America though developing on other continents also. Elected officers guide the Association, with help and suggestions from an advisory board of medical professionals and others. The Association was founded in Milwaukee in 1980 by Mary Lou Ballweg and Carolyn Ketch and was the first group in the world dedicated to helping women with endometriosis. Meetings are held according to the wishes of the local chapter. Usually some are planned to allow informal information-sharing about endometriosis and support and help with problems arising from it. Other meetings offer speakers and presentations on endometriosis,self-helpcare, infertility, medical research, and so on. Literature on endometriosis and related concerns is published regularly. A small library of materials on endometriosis is maintained. And a data registry of individuals' experiences with endometriosis is maintained for research. The data registry is compiled of the detailed answers to a questionnaire about an individual's endometriosis history, treatments and results, and experiences with the disease. Members and subscribers receive a newsletter six times a year, and formal and informal Crisis CalI listening/counseling services are available_members who are willing to listen and offer suggestions and help during times of pain, difficult decisions, or other crises due to endometriosis. The Association also conducts research on endometriosis and serves as a clearinghouse for information on endometriosis. Researchers interested in working with the Association data registry (housed at the Medical College of Wisconsin) should write the Research Review Panel, Endometriosis Association, at the headquarters office. Donations to help continue work of the Endometriosis Association are very much needed and appreciated.

I had been experiencing moderate pain (Lower Lumbar and pelvic with some radiation down my right leg). In addition to the bouts of cyclical loose stools I was having feelings of considerable rectal pressure. There was also some bladder symptoms. - in particular pain on emptying a full bladder. Unrelated to the endometriosis, (I believe), I have had heavy bleeding during my periods. A diagnostic laparoscopy was done as part of my infertility workup in February. It revealed a large cyst 4.5 x 5 x 3.5cm on the left ovary. The cyst, thought to be an endometrioma, had also caught the tube under the ovary. The lap also revealed stage 3 endometriosis, some of which was lasered at that time. The cyst ruptured when the ovary was pulled up. The contents were not typical of endometrioma. It was thinner consistency, port-wine colored. It was not removed at that time. In the following two months I had an upper and lower GI which were negative for bowel implants, a CA 125 test result of 47(elevated), and an ultrasound that confirmed that the cyst was not changing in size. On May 19, I had my second lap. At the beginning of the surgery my doctor found bi-lateral endometriomas. The second is the left ovary opened after dissection of the cyst. The fourth shows a chocolate cyst found on the back of the right ovary. The left ovarian cyst was attached to the bladder,-tube and rested on a portion of bowel (sigmoid colon). This may have been the cause of my diarrhea. The right cyst was attached to the pelvic wall and had tube involvement. Both cysts were removed at the time of surgery. My OB recommends a course of Lupron. After that I will try and conceive. She suggested we might consider using Humegon or Pergonal and insemination to improve our odds before the endometrioisis recurs. But we feel my biologic clock is clicking and want to consider IVF. Before getting starting, she wants to recheck my husbands sperm count and make sure my day 3 FSH is ok after completing the Lupron. Because of my age and ovarian surgery, the ovarian reserve may be diminished and we might want to consider using donor eggs. Wish us luck!

Ten years after a hysterectomy and removal of the left ovary for fibroid tumors, this woman developed bloating and constipation. This barium enema xray shows (in the lower right corner) the bowel wall compressed by endometriosis. She was treated with a laparoscopic bowel resection, was hospitalized for three days and has done well since then. This patient demonstrates endometriosis in the "cul-de-sac" (the area behind the uterus and in front of the rectum). She presented with painful intercourse diarrhea associated with the menstrual periods. A "chocolate cyst" (endometrioma) is formed when endometriosis invades the ovary. A dark, thick fluid fills these ovarian cysts. They are best treated by removal of the cyst and may recur if simply drained or when the inner wall cannot be removed and is burned with a laser. The most common site for endometriosis is on the uterosacral ligaments behind the uterine cervix. This patient who presented with pelvic pain had involvement extending deep into the space between the vagina and the rectum. In this patient, endometriosis is seen on the posterior surface of the uterine fundus (just to the right of the metal probe), at the base of the right uterosacral ligament and in the cul-de-sac between the uterine ligaments. Endometriosis may have many appearances. This photo includes white endometriosis, clear endometriosis, red endometriosis and powder burn lesions. Powder burns on the right uterosacral ligament causing painful intercourse. Dissection of the space between the rectum and vagina allows removal of deep endometriosis in patients with severe pain. If preoperative testing reveals narrowing of the bowel, then a laparoscopic bowel resection can be performed. It is important that a thorough cleansing of the bowel be carried out before any surgery for pelvic pain where endometriosis is suspected. Failing to prepare the bowel preoperatively may result in increased risk and limit the surgeons ability to perform a satisfactory resection. Resection of the uterosacral ligaments and peritoneal surface endometriosis resulted in relief of pain for this patient. But, endometriosis frequently recurs. Therefore, I recommend hormonal suppression for those patients not trying to get pregnant immediately. Patients with severe menstrual cramps who do not have endometriosis may also benefit from cutting the nerve fibers that run in the uterosacral ligaments behind the uterus. About 60-80% receive some degree of pain relief with this procedure. Video Caution, video files are quite large. Your download times may be excessive if you do not have ISDN or T1 access. As endometriosis can grow below the surface of the peritoneum, I believe that excision of endometriosis leads to better results than laser vaporization. endo.mov5.6 meg quicktime video Return to Dr. Perloe's Homepage This page, and all contents, are Copyright (C) 1996 by Mark PerloeM.D., P.C.

First, I want to give you some background. I wasdiagnosed with endometriosis about 10 years ago. Over the years Ihave kept informed about the disease and heard many stories ofwomen who have the disease. I became interested in how women copedwith this chronic and typically progressive condition. We developed a questionnaire to study the social supportexperiences of women coping with endometriosis. I then asked forvolunteers from WITSENDO, which is an Internet Listserv thatserves as a support network for coping with endometriosis. Fifty-nine women with endometriosis volunteered and were sent aquestionnaire. Forty-six women or 81% completed and returned thesurvey. In general, the research participants were from the UnitedStates, white, in their thirties, well educated and affluent. Ihope to convey some flavor of the struggles these women live withand their experiences with social support. Endometriosis is a disease in which the endometrial cells,which normally line the uterus, grow outside the uterus. Amongother things, these endometrial growths often cause pain and/orinfertility. The women in my study shared their struggles with thedisease as a backdrop to their experiences of social support. Thisis a typical comment: "A woman with endometriosis often feels herlife is a battleground: she must fight with pain simply to meet herobligations each day, fight to maintain her dignity in the workplace despite numerous absences and sick leaves, constantly fightwith physicians who are uninformed, etc." This disease can only bediagnosed through a surgical procedure and often goes undiagnosed.As this woman relates, "My biggest problem was getting it diagnosedin the first place." I asked women how many years they have experienced symptoms ofthe disease and how many years it had been since it was firstdiagnosed. The results are telling. These women on average had 7years between when the symptoms first appeared and a formaldiagnosis was made. One woman wanted her support network to knowthat, "Endo is an UNSOLVED problem and that women today are stillbeing misdiagnosed and suffering from horrible and ineffectivetreatments." Most of these women experienced pain and/or either infertilityor the threat of infertility. One women related that: "Eventhough I'm not trying to get pregnant, I feel a great fear andsadness that I will never be able to conceive." Anotherparticipant advised others to: "Try to keep in mind that endo isa chronic disease that we deal with every day, not just a one timepain." This is the backdrop of endometriosis that these women livewith. The survey asked about 4 categories of relationships. Ratedas most supportive was other women with endometriosis, next wasspouse or partner, next friends or extended family, and rated asthe least supportive was health care providers. Others with Endometriosis The participants shared what they wanted from other women withendometriosis. They wanted to network, commiserate, be informed,not focus on misery and be recognized as an individual. Iillustrate some of these themes with the participants' own words. The participants wanted to network and commiserate with otherwomen with endometriosis, as illustrated with the followingcomments: "The fact knowing that there are other people with thesame problems as you is really one of the best supports availablebecause you don't feel alone"; "In what they said, I heard my'past' and was able to see my 'future' because they had alreadybeen through it before me. It validated what I believed my problemwas and was a relief because I could see some hope down at the endof the tunnel." Another theme was the support provided by sharing information.Examples of this them include: "The best support I feel I've gotfrom others with endometriosis is information"; "I've been moreeducated by other women with the disorder, than by any medicalperson ; the help from being able to compare notes with others inthe same medical boat has been invaluable"; and "The fact that weall share with each other our experiences of what happened when wewent through this test or that test, what we had to do etc.Someone will sometimes share some trick or hint that helps themcope with the pain, or someone will share a book that offers goodadvice on diet and exercise. The study participants wanted other women with endometriosisto recognize that they are individuals. One participant comments:"It MUST be remembered that the disease produces erratic symptoms-- one woman will be incapacitated while another feels nothing. Itproduces a wide variety of symptoms and concerns, none of whichduplicate in any two women. ANY woman with ANY amount of endo isgoing to be suffering somehow, whether it's occasional bouts of IBS[Irritable Bowel Syndrome], repeated miscarriage, or debilitatingpain. We might all be in different parts of the boat, but *it'sthe same boat nonetheless*." Spouse/Partner Next, the relationship category of spouse or partner isexamined. The participants shared what they want in the way ofsupport from spouses or partners. They want to be listened to, tobe believed, to be understood, they want the partner to beknowledgeable about the disease, they want the partner to becommitted, patient, caring, to express feelings, to not try to fixthe problem, to not judge or blame and to recognize the impact onthe sexual relationship. Again I use the participants own words to illustrate thesethemes with typical comments. This woman represents some of thosethemes, "He (my husband) reassured me that he loves me and that myhaving endo doesn't change his feelings for me. He stayed with mein the hospital, feeding me ice chips and holding my hand after avery difficult surgery. He runs interference for me, and is my'second self' when dealing with doctors, family etc. He knows theinformation and asks the questions right along with me. He has beenimmensely understanding and patient with my limitations, and triesto be gentle with sex, which is painful for me." The participants want their spouses or partners to listen,believe and understand, as illustrated by the following comments:"He listens and accepts. While it's difficult for him tounderstand sometimes, he makes the attempt and does his best. Healways goes to appointments with me if I ask him to. He's my rockof support"; and "The best thing to do is listen and then ask whatyou can do to make life easier or more comfortable." The participants find it supportive when the spouse or partneris knowledgeable. Examples of this include: "I guess I wouldencourage partners to learn all they can about endo, so they canreally understand what it is we are dealing with"; and "Understandthat the pain is real, that it is tough to live with, and anydecision on dealing with the disease helps to be talked out withthe significant other." Commitment is a source of support for the participants.Representative comments include: "BE THERE FOR THEM!!! There isnothing worse than feeling like hell and then having no support atall from the one you love"; and "My spouse helps me by reminding methat he married 'a packaged deal.' Problems and all, and that 'insickness and in health' is just as real to him now as it was ...when we married." Participants do not expect spouses or partners to solve theproblems of endometriosis. As this participants relates, "It's OKnot to fix things! Men (in my experience and in what I've read)love to fix things and sometimes get frustrated when they can't beMr. Fix-It. Even though they can't fix it, don't give up - justbeing there, listening and being supportive is a big help." Participants want spouses or partners to recognize the impacton the sexual relationship. Pain with intercourse is a possiblesymptom of endometriosis, as this women relates: "I find the wholeconcept of sex when I'm having symptoms really alien. Very privateparts of me hurt in odd and very personal ways... and he wants totouch them???? Sex is nice when it doesn't hurt, but it's almostunimaginable when it hurts... and my mental attitude about notwanting to be touched lingers after the real pain has gone.Partners have to understand and be VERY careful." Friends/Extended Family The third relationship category is friends and extendedfamily. The participants related their experiences of receivingsupport from friends and extended family. From friends andextended family they want to be listened to and believed, they wantothers to be knowledgeable about endometriosis, they in generalwant some sympathy and empathy, they want support with theirdisease struggles and they want to not be blamed, their experiencesminimized or they do not want to be worried over. The participants want friends and extended family to listen.As one participant noted, "Listening! That is the best gift myfriends have given me. (Who must be so sick of hearing about this,but you wouldn't know it by their responses)." Having friends or extended family who are knowledgeable andunderstanding is supportive for the participants. A representativecomment is: "Being more informed about the disease helps to be moreunderstanding towards the people suffering from the pain (physicaland/or emotional) of endometriosis." The participants want support with disease struggles. Onewoman gives this advice to friends and extended family: "Remind herthat a chronic disease is draining, and that she should giveherself credit for having so many good days." The participants advise friends and extended family members tonot blame or minimize. The following comments representparticipants' advice to friends and extended family: "Accept thatthis is a chronic condition and that I have very little controlover its progress. Don't place the burden of curing myself on me.Ask how I am- but when I respond that things are worse do not say'but I thought that last (drug, treatment, surgery, test) wouldhelp'"; and "Listen without diminishing the experience of the woman(e.g. with "gee, so-and-so had it worse because ..."). Understandthat each woman's experience is real and valid, that you need to becareful to listen without being judgmental." Health Care Providers Finally, the relationship category of health care providerswas studied. The participants wanted health care providers tolisten to them, believe them, be knowledgeable about endometriosis,provide information, not have a condescending attitude, and torecognize that each woman is an individual. These themes arereflected in the following comment about support from a physician:"My GYN [gynecologist] has been very sympathetic and has neverquestioned whether my pain really exists or not. He has given mearticles from med. journals and has answered all my questions. Hehas treated me like an intelligent person and has told me what hecan do, and what he CAN'T do. Being kept informed about mycondition has given me a feeling of some control over thisproblem." The themes are also reflected in this advice to healthcare professionals: Listen Believe Educate themselvesabout endo. I was especially struck by the poignant stories these womentold about their health care providers, physicians in particular.With a chronic and incurable condition like endometriosis, thephysician-patient relationship is particularly important. Insteadof organizing this section by themes, I have organized it by whatparticipants found supportive, what participants did not findsupportive and what advice they give to health care providers to bemore supportive. The following comments reflect supportive behavior: "All mydoctors recognize that endometriosis is a real disorder, and thatI am not merely a hypochondriac. That in and of itself isreassuring"; and "My RE [reproductive endocrinologist] takes mydisease and my symptoms very seriously - which in itself can betremendously supportive when so many health care professionalsdon't acknowledge the disease's impact." Participants also outlined what is not supportive from healthcare providers. The power behind these non-supportive comments isquite striking. The following comments reflect what was notsupportive from health care providers: "I feel victimized by thephysicians -- which is not helpful given all that the disease hasput me through. I don't feel it should be my job to convince themthat endo is never cured, to justify my pain in order to 'earn'their assistance!"; "The urologist asserted that only 'career galswho put off having their babies' get endo -- I was insulted, angryand hurt"; "He [physician] also made some astoundingly inaccuratemedical statements about the disease which made me furious that Ihad read more medical journals than he had. I felt as though I hadto 'educate' him and yet he has the 'power' to help me or not." The participants have the following advice for health careproviders: "Take their symptoms seriously. This is not a diseasethat is in their heads"; "Don't minimize their problem and/orfeelings"; "When a woman comes to you complaining of severemenstrual pain, don't tell her it's stress. Most women aren't goingto complain unless it's really bad because we've all grown upbelieving that pain during menstruation is 'normal'"; "I want themto do their reading, keep up with journals, go to conferences, andstop blaming patients for diseases which as yet are idiopathic"; "Ithink information is the key. Doctors need to explain WHY they arerecommending or not recommending treatments of various kinds. Ithink many health care professionals feel that the patient does nothave the necessary background to understand all the issues and erron the part of not giving the patient credit for understanding andhaving input into decisions made which directly (and intimately)concern her health"; "I think it is crucial that physicians letwomen have a say in the care they are given. Give them theoptions, tell them the pros and cons (and for crying out loud beHONEST about it!) and let them decide which option is best forthem." These 46 participants shared many compelling and poignantstories with me and I have tried to give you a sense of theirexperiences. I want to let a participant's words summarize myfindings: Good help can be: 'I know a doctor who specializes in that, maybe you should call her.' or, 'I have a friend who has that, would you like me to introduce you?' or, 'If you need someone to talk to, I'll listen. You aren't upsetting me by talking about it, and it isn't too gross for me.', or, 'Let's go for a walk and get some hot cocoa.' or, 'I'm going to the store, would you like me to bring you something?' Bad help is: 'I think my cousin had that, she's been perfectly healthy ever since she had the twins.' or, 'My boss had that surgery - she almost died and she was in the hospital for 8 weeks because the doctor screwed up!' or, 'What you need is wheat grass juice enemas!' or, 'You should talk to my psychiatrist to try to find out what it is about you that makes you cling to pain.' (Yes, I've really heard people say these things! Can you believe it?!?)

Although Ihad a history of endo of the bowel, it had never really bothered me.A little diarrhea....that was about it. The endo had been noted in bothmy 1970 surgery and in my 1990 surgery, but not really dealt with.During my surgery in Feb, the endo on my bowel looked so badthat I had a colonscopy immediately following surgery to see if theendo was invading the intestine. Luckily, mine was not but it wascreating a severe constriction. In fact, the GI Dr. said he wasn'tcertain how I had even been going to the bathroom (and I had nosymptoms of this). The danger was, I could have had a bowelblockage which would have entailed emergency surgery, and probablynot allowed me to choose the specialist that I saw last week. I had 8 inches of large intestine removed last week via thelaparascope and am ready to return to work next week. I also had aspot on my rectum that was quite deep and could not be lasered. Thedr. took a "wedge" out of this area (think of cutting a spot out andthen taking a tuck or dart in that area). I feel terrific, andafter viewing my video, am VERY thankful that that piece ofintestine is no longer with me. I don't think that it is normal to have rectal bleeding with ourperiod. Please get it checked out by a good GI physician. One word ofcaution......most GIs don't seem to know much about endo so you needto work with a GI and someone who knows endo. Also, it wasimportant to me to find a surgeon who would do this operationthrough the laparascope. Good luck and let us know what's happening. SC Hi, all. Lisa G. and I have talked about Bowel endo before, but I think it may be worth pointing out to the whole group my own experience with invasive endo in the sigmoid colon. I have always (since I was 15 or so) had nasty diarrhea with my period - the cramping and bloating and hot/cold sweats and nausea that many of you describe. This can probably be attributed to prostaglandins, and taking a NSAID along with either Benadryl (an antihistamine) or Immodium (an anti-diarrheal) or both really helps. (Dr. Perloe: Somewhere the myth started that endometriosis only effects middleaged women. NOT SO! Endometrioisis can strike during the teens. It's symptoms are progressive and difficult to deal with as many physicians do not suspect endometrioisis in this age group.) About 2 years ago I started having that pressure inside feeling, like there was something blocking my colon and I couldn't get anything out past it. What finally would come out was mostly liquid. I usually had to camp out in the bathroom for an hour or so before I could stagger back to the comfort of my heating pad. The pain was intense to the point that I got tunnel vision and came close to blacking out. I also started passing large clots of blood and mucous in my BMs. My doc refused to believe I was passing what appeared to be menstrual blood from my intestines until they did an "emergency" sigmoidoscopy. (Because of the pathology in my colon, this was very painful. If you are scheduled for one of these, have someone go with you to drive you home afterwards.) They found that my sigmoid colon was severely narrowed and had bleeding lesions on the inside, on the side closest to the uterus. A biopsy was inconclusive for endometrial tissue. (Dr. Perloe: Biopsy at the time of sigmoidoscopy is indicated but rarely confirms the diagnosis.) During my lap they found that the endometriosis had indeed penetrated the full thickness of the bowel wall. My gynecological surgeon called in a bowel surgeon to consult. He resected (removed) about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of diseased bowel through the laparoscopic incision. This made the recovery from surgery a bit more difficult than if they had not had to do major bowel surgery - I was in the hospital for 10 days instead of going home right away. (Dr. Perloe: Frequently patients can be discharged home 2-3 days after laparoscopic bowel resection. Recovery is significantly quicker than abdominal surgery.) I still have diarrhea and severe pain with my periods, but the most distressing bowel symptoms of not being able to get anything out and intestinal bleeding have gone away! It is an incredible relief to know that that piece of misery is out of my body and burned to ash in the hospital incinerator. My IBS symptoms in general are much improved since the surgery - 2-3 "attacks" a month (non-menstrually) vs. 2-3 times a week pre-surgery. My surgeon said my case was unusually severe, and full thickness resection is not usually needed for bowel endo. Endo on the bowel does not usually go all the way through the muscularis of the bowel wall, and often they can remove any lesions on the bowel without penetrating it, or just making a tiny hole in it and then sewing up the hole. Adhesions on the outside of the colon were also contributing to my misery, narrowing the colon and adding to the obstruction caused by the engorged endo lesions. My doc described it as rubber bands wrapped around the intestine and uterus. I don't mean to alarm anyone with this. I have found significant relief from the surgery, and even though the endo is back, the really bad bowel stuff is improved. I hope this helps someone.

Yes, But Taken For Granted The "VULVA" refers to the external female genital organs...that very special area of a woman's body so vital to healthy female identity and sexual function. Yet...how often do most women correctly examine the vulva? Would you know the right way to check the vulva...what to look for? Could you find the early signs of important changes which mean the start of serious infection or even cancer of the vulva? If you're not in the habit of doing vulvas self exams...or if you're not sure of the importance or the right way to do self exams...Find out how a simple self exam of the vulva can alert you to a Problem before serious infection develops...before cancer develops. Unfortunately, physicians are seeing an increasing number of women with cancer (and precancerous conditions) of the vulva in all age groups, but especially in younger women. Infectious diseases of the vulva (especially viral infections such as genital warts and herpes) are also increasing. Genital warts (sometimes called "condyloma accuminata") will cause an estimated 1 million women to seek medical attention this year. Most women who discover genital warts DO NOT have cancer. However, the same virus that causes genital warts (human papilloma virus) has been linked to cancer of the female genitals. Why Vulvar Self Exams? The Importance of Early Detection Women may have early infections or precancerous growths, but may not be aware of changes in the vulva until the disease becomes more advanced. As you would expect, more serious cases require more extensive treatment...which could even mean a major loss of vulvar tissue to survive. Yet, if caught early, your physician can better treat as well as prevent the spread of infection or growths on the vulva. The key is early detection. A simple self exam of the vulva is the most important habit you can start now to help you notice important changes in the vulva... changes which need to be reported and discussed with your physician. Who Should Perform VSE? All women who are sexually active...and even women who are not sexually active but are over 18 years old. How Often Should VSE Be Performed? Once a month, just as recommended for breast self exams; or any time you have symptoms related to the vulva. Women with any history of vulvar disease are encouraged to perform vulvar self exams more often. (Vulvar self exams are best performed between menstrual periods.) IMPORTANT NOTE: MOST CHANGES OR NEW GROWTHS ON THE VULVA WILL NOT BE CANCEROUS...and will need only minor checking ant treatment. But, you should report all changes to your physician to determine the best care at the first sign of a problem. How to Perform VSE... Where To Look POSITION. Find a comfortable, well-lighted place to sit such as a bed or a carpet. Hold a mirror in one hand. Then, use the other hand to separate and expose the parts of the vulva surrounding the opening of the vagina. Once you have a good viewing position, examine the main parts of the vulva as follows: Check the "mons pubis" (the area above the vagina around the pubic bone where the pubic hair is located). Look carefully for any bumps, warts, ulcers, or changes in skin color (pigmentation, especially newly developed white, red, or dark areas). Then, use the finger tips to check any visible change and to sense any bump just below the surface you might feel but not see. Next, check the "clitoris" and surrounding area (directly above the vagina) by looking and by touch. Next, examine the Labia minora: (the smaller folds of skin just to the right and left of the vaginal opening). Look and touch by holding the skin between thumb and ringers. Then look closely at the "labia majora" (the larger folds of skin just next to the labia minora). Examine both right and left just as you did the labia minora. Move down to the "perineum" (the area between the vagina and the anus). Check thoroughly. Finally, examine the area surrounding the anal opening...as before by looking and by touch. REMEMBER THE BASIC RULE: Vulvar diseases are most easily, safely, and successfully treated when discovered early. Now you know...and now you have yet another good way to help protect your own health...the monthly vulvar self examination...a good habit to start today. What To Look For If you find any new growths or changes,report them to your physician as soon aspossible. Some examples include: A new mole, wart, or growth of any kind. New areas of Pigmentation" (skin color) especially newly developed white, red, or dark skin areas. Ulcers or sores, except for any minor injury with a known cause. Areas of continuing pain, inflammation, or itching. From Women Who Know... "I only wish someone had told me about vulvar self examination years ago." Female patient who required major surgery for advanced cancer of the vulva. 'I believe vulvar self examination saved life." Female patient who discovered early vulvar cancer and was successfully treated with minor surgery. From A Concerned Physician... "Early detection and treatment of vulvar diseases can save lives as well as female identity and sexual function. Vulvar Self Examination (VSE) is the key to early detection...if only women will discover it and practice it." For additional copies or further information: Call (404) 265-3614 or write: R.

The International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease(ISSVD) defines vulvodynia as chronic vulvar discomfort or pain,especially that characterized by complaints of burning, stinging,irritation or rawness of the female genitalia. Burning sensationsare the most common, but vulvodynia pain is highly individualized.The condition varies in persistence and location. Pain may beconstant or intermittent, localized or diffuse. In many casesof vulvodynia, pain occurs spontaneously. Vulvar vestibulitis,a type of vulvodynia refers to pain experienced only when pressureis applied to the vestibule, the area surrounding the entranceto the vagina. Vulvodynia has also occasionally been referredto as pudendal neuralgia. Vulvodynia, as with most chronic painconditions, has a profound impact on quality of life. It oftenaffects one's ability to engage in sexual activity and can interferewith daily functioning. It can impair one's ability to work, engagein physical activity, and participate in a social life. Theselimitations can negatively affect self-image and may sometimeslead to depression. What Causes Vulvodynia? The cause of vulvodynia is unknown. It may be the result of multiplefactors. Doctors speculate that it may be caused by: an injury to, or irritation of, the nerves that innervate the vulva; a localized hypersensitivity to candida; an allergic response to environmental irritants; high levels of oxalate crystals in the urine; or spasms of the muscles that support the pelvic organs. There is no evidence that vulvodynia is caused by infection or that itis a sexually transmitted disease. Diagnosis and Treatment Vulvodynia is diagnosed when other causes of vulvar pain, suchas active yeast infection, herpes, skin disorders, and other bacterialinfections are ruled out. Upon examination, the vulvar tissuemay appear inflamed and swollen or it may look perfectly normal.It is common for a woman to consult several doctors before obtainingan accurate diagnosis. Currently there is no cure for vulvodynia.Treatments directed toward symptom relief include drug therapiessuch as tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants, nerve blocks,interferon, biofeedback, and diet modification. Surgical interventionis an option for some women when more conservative treatmentsdo not produce acceptable relief. How Can the NVA Help?

Concern has arisen regarding the effect of physical training on the physiology of the menstrual cycle. As morewomen participate and training programs become more strenuous, physicians have seen more complaints ofmenstrual cycle disturbances. Clinical effects of exercise training These patients may present with absence of menses (amenorrhea), thinning of the bones (osteoporosis),irregular menses or intermenstrual bleeding, abnormal growth of the uterine lining or infertility. The nature and severity of the symptoms seen are dependent on a number of variables such as the specifictype of training, the intensity and duration of training, weekly mileage, and rate of progression of trainingprogram. Normal menstrual cycle During the first half of the normal menstrual cycle the pituitary gland at the base of the brain stimulatesdevelopment of an egg (follicular development) and estrogen production by the ovarian. After release of theegg (ovulation), the ovary produces progesterone to ready the uterine lining for implantation of the earlyfertilized egg. The portion of the menstrual cycle after ovulation is called the luteal phase and normally laststwo weeks. Normal pituitary function is controlled by another part of the brain, the hypothalamus. We call thisinterdependent relationship between the brain and the ovaries the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPO forshort)The hypothalmus is affected by variables such as associated nutrition and dietary factors (caloric, fat, or weightrestrictions), menstrual pattern prior to onset of training, age when training began. These factors determineability of the HPO-axis to withstand the further stress brought on by exercise. Progressive nature of menstrual disturbances. Regular cycles with shortened luteal phase-progesterone production stops early Regular cycles with Inadequate progesterone production Regular cycles with failure to develop and release an egg (anovulation) Irregular cycles but still ovulating Irregular cycles and anovulation Absence of menses and ovulation Usually stages 1-3 are asymptomatic but may present as infertility. Research study results: Low to moderate exercise (15-20 miles/week) begun in sedentary women with regular cycles and > one year buildup will not result in problems. Moderate to intense training (30-50 miles/week) building upover two months in young women will more than likely result in significant menstrual abnormalities. Even recreational joggers at 12-18 miles /week demonstrated poor follicular development, decreasedestrogen and progesterone secretion and absent ovulation. One out of four moderate and long distance runners demonstrated one or more episode of anovulationwhen observed for one year. Prevalence: Studies reveal exercise induced amenorrhea in 1 to 44% of athletes. Most frequently seen in ballet dancersand long distance runners. Up to 44% of ballet dancers have been found to be amenorrheic. Theories: Pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for exercise induced amenorrhea are not well understood. critical fat hypothesis: During puberty menses first occurs when body fat content rises beyond 17% andmenses will cease if it subsequently falls below 22%. However, menses will resume in amenorrheic balletdancers after injury in the absence of any significant change in weight or body fat. Amenorrhea returns whentheir training resumes. energy drain: Low caloric input and high caloric expenditure results in endocrine abnormalities manifest asmenstrual disturbances. Studies have found decreased caloric intake and a lower metabolic rate inamenorrheic athletes compared to those with normal menses. However, some have postulate that the lowerresting metabolic rate is just the body's adaptive response in attempt to maintain weight and conserve energythereby restoring a more normal energy balance. eating disorders: Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia have been seen in athletes. These conditionshave been associated with amenorrhea. In these patients nutritional and psychological factors must beconsidered. physical & psychological stress: associated changes seen in several neurohormones such as dopamine andopioids (the body's own "morphine-like" painkillers, may relate to exercise addiction or joggers high) have beenshown to interfere with normal hypothalamic function. b-endorphin, one of the opioids, is known to be elevatedin the circulation immediately after exercise. It has also been noted to be chronically elevated at rest incompetitive swimmers who have trained for two or more years. Psychological stress as seen with strenuousexercise training is associated with an increase in cortisol (an adrenal stress hormone). In the amenorrheicathlete, the adrenal gland may be secreting cortisol at near maximum levels even at rest! The cause ofexcessive cortisol secretion or how it affects hypothalamic function are as yet unknown. Clinical implications of exercise-induced menstrual abnormalities: As menstrual abnormalities may be caused by medical conditions not related to exercise, it is important that anappropriate medical evaluation be made. Infertility: Patients with infertility may demonstrate decreased estrogen & progesterone production, poor folliculardevelopment and anovulation. Menstrual cycles and hormone production may frequently return to normal uponassuming a less strenuous training schedule and insuring adequate caloric intake. Frequently ovulationinducing medications are necessary to achieve pregnancy. These include clomiphene (the fertility pill),pergonal (a daily injection) or a new device called the GnRH Pump (lutrepulse system) which appears to offermany advantages to the athlete with amenorrhea. By closely mimicking the normal hypothalamic hormoneproduction, the pump can safely & effectively restore normal fertility. As infertility may be related to factors otherthan ovulation and normal menstrual function, a thorough evaluation should be completed. this includes lookingat the semen analysis in the male and evaluating the female for cervical mucus problems or blocked fallopiantubes. Osteoporosis: The hormone changes seen with exercise, diminished levels of estrogen and progesterone and the increasedlevels of circulating cortisol result in decreased bone mineral density. This may even be seen in patients withnormal menstrual cycles. As calcium is lost, the bones become more brittle and spinal compression fracturescan occur. Peak bone mass is achieved by age 35. Bone mass gradually decreases from that time onward and morerapidly decreases after the menopause. This loss of bone is referred to as osteoporosis. It is a devastatingcondition that can result in hip fracture, spinal fractures, debility and death in elderly women. Estrogen replacement and calcium supplementation during the menopause are effective at slowing bone loss. One great concern is that the decreased estrogen levels and avoidance of dairy products frequently seen inwomen with moderate or strenuous training, a normal peak bone mass may never be reached. This is ofparticular concern in the patient with absent menses. These patients are at much greater risk for osteoporosisand bone fractures while young. This can usually be prevented by hormone replacement to restore normalestrogen levels.

Each month an egg develops inside the ovary in a fluid filled pocket called a follicle. This follicle is one inch in size and is about ready to ovulate. After ovulation the follicle changes from producing mostly estrogen to producing mostly progesterone to support the early pregnancy. In this photo, you can see the ovarian stigma (spot where the egg escaped from the ovary). Ovarian drilling can be performed at the time of laparoscopy. Either a fiber laser or an electrosurgical needle is used to puncture any visible ovarian follicle. Many women will ovulate for a few months after the treatment and a small number will conceive. Unfortunately by six months, usually the abnormal menstrual cycle and elevated male hormone pattern has returned. There is also a small risk of forming adhesions to the surface of the ovary after this surgery. ARHC Homepage.

This picture demonstrates adhesions from the omentum to the uterine fundus (top). The yellow portion is the omentum, a fatty apron that is suspended from the colon. This patients left tube and ovary can also be seen. The large dilated fallopian tube can be seen on the left side of this picture. Pregnancy rates after surgery for this condition are very low. Most patients have a better chance of conception with IVF. Pregnancy rates run between 10-30% with up to 25% of those pregnancies implanting in the fallopian tube rather than in the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). An ultrasound picture demonstrating compression of the uterine lining in a patient with multiple miscarriages. This myoma was removed with outpatient hysteroscopy. Recurrent pregnancy loss can also be caused by a uterine septum. Patients with polycystic ovarian disease may benefit from ovarian drilling with an electrocautery needle or a laser fibre. Many of these patients will have normal cycles for the next four to six months and up to 30% can conceive. However, within a short while, the abnormal pattern of menstrual cycles resumes. This procedure may result in adhesions forming around the tube and ovaries. After three spontaneous pregnancy losses (miscarriages), this patient was reviewed for evaluation. A saline contrast transvaginal ultrasound was performed. First, a tiny balloon catheter is inserted through the cervix. The balloon is inflated and saline is slowly injected into the uterine cavity. A large myoma is clearly seen bulging into the uterine cavity. The patient received a dose of GnRH agonist (depot Lupron) and underwent hysteroscopic resection 6 weeks later. The photographs document the findings at the time of hysteroscopy. A leiomyoma (fibroid) is seen on the back wall of the uterus. A fibroid this size (~1 inch) and in this location usually causes no symptoms. Surgical removal may result in formation of scar tissue (adhesions) which could jepoardize fertility. ARHC Homepage.

The Cost to Your Health Searching for answers to a devastating global health concern Osteoporosis affects tens of millions of people worldwide and is responsible for as many as 75% of all fractures in people over the age of 45. Costly and disabling fractures of the spine, hip, wrist, and other bones can be preceded by years of undetected bone loss. What's more, as many as 20% of those who suffer osteoporosis-related hip fractures die within 6 months. Complications of osteoporosis are the 12th leading cause of death in America and are responsible for more deaths in women than cancers of the breast and cervix combined. Over $18 billion is spent by the US healthcare system each year. Women are at four times greater risk of developing osteoporosis than men, with postmenopausal women particularly vulnerable. Finding accurate, convenient methods of monitoring the bone loss that can lead to osteoporosis is critical in combating this crippling disease. The physiology behind the technology Bone is an active living tissue made of a protein framework to which various minerals attach. Throughout life, bone is constantly dissolved in a process called bone resorption and reformed in a dynamic process called bone remodeling.This is a function of two types of cells, osteoclasts (bone resorption) and osteoblasts (bone formation). As bone is resorbed by osteoclasts, bone collagen degradation fragments are released into the bloodstream and excreted in the urine. In childhood and adolescence, bone remodeling is associated primarily with bone growth. After age 30 to 35, resorption by osteoclasts progressively outweighs formation of new bone, resulting in an increase in bone loss that can Iead to osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women, this process is accelerated by declining estrogen levels. How can I Find Out Before Its Too Late? At present, the standard clinical method for detecting bone loss involves radiologic techniques to measure bone mineral density. These technologies, however, provide a static picture of bone mass and density at a particular point in time. Sequential measurements (usually 12 months apart or longer) are necessary to identify significant interim bone loss. Furthermore, imaging of this kind is expensive. Various biochemical markers of bone turnover, such as urinary hydroxyproline, have been investigated as tools in managing osteoporosis. Many of these early markers however, are found in tissues other than bone and are also influenced by diet. Hydroxyproline, for example, is not specific to bone, can be affected by diet, and is metabolized extensively in the liver. Therefore, its urinary levels may not accurately reflect the degree of bone resorption. Research has recently focused on the urinary excretion of the molecular cross-links of bone collagen, including pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline. These pyridinoline crosslinks, however, are also found in cartilage and other connective tissues, such as ligaments tendons, fascia, and blood vessels. Moreover, the techniques used to quantify pyridinoline markers can involve a labor-intensive process. More recently, a new marker has shown exceptional promise in its ability to specifically measure the rate of bone resorption. The marker, cross-linked N-telopeptides (NTx), is readily quantifiable and highly specific to the type I collagen found in bone. This specificity is due in large measure to the unique cross-linked amino acid sequences of the N-telopeptide chains. NTx is a direct degradation product of the bone resorption process conducted by osteoclasts. It is released into the urine in a form that cannot be broken down further and at levels that directly reflect the amount of bone collagen resorbed. Advances in bone marker technology, exemplified by the impressive specificity of crosslinked N-telopeptides (NTx), will soon be providing clinicians with specific, convenient and noninvasive ways to assess the bone resorption rates of patients at risk for osteoporosis. With access to these important new tools, physicians will be able to monitor treatments, such as hormone replacement therapy, aimed at preventing or arresting this common debilitating disease. Bone Loss Can Be Reversed If your urine test indicate you may be rapidly losing bone, your doctor can identify various diseases that may cause this problem. A well balanced program of exercise, diet, hormone replacement as well as newer presecription medications may reverse this trend. Who Should Be Tested Men and women over age 50 All women who have had hysterectomies Heavily exercising women of all ages Women with a family history of osteoporosis Women recently pregnant or nursing Women with thin, petit or small frames People who use anti-ulcer medication All people with a sedentary lifestyle Those who consume excessive caffeine, smokers and alcohol Men and women with lactose intolerance All people using steroid Women on prolonged GnRH-a therapy This page, and all contents, are Copyright (C) 1995 by Mark PerloeM.D., P.C.

Stress is the "wear and tear" our bodies experience as we adjust to our continually changing environment; it has physical and emotionaleffects on us and can create positive or negative feelings. As a positive influence, stress can help compel us to action; it can result in a new awareness and an exciting new perspective. As a negative influence, it can result in feelings of distrust, rejection, anger, and depression, which in turn can lead to health problems such as headaches, upset stomach, rashes, insomnia, ulcers, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. With the death of a loved one, the birth of a child, a job promotion, or a new relationship, we experience stress as we readjust our lives. In so adjusting to different circumstances, stress will help or hinder us depending on how we react to it. How Can I Eliminate Stress from My Life? As we have seen, positive stress adds anticipation and excitement to life, and we all thrive under a certain amount of stress. Deadlines, competitions, confrontations, and even our frustrations and sorrows add depth and enrichment to our lives. Our goal is not to eliminate stressbut to learn how to manage it and how to use it to help us. Insufficient stress acts as a depressant and may leave us feeling bored or dejected; on the other hand, excessive stressmay leave us feeling "tied up in knots." What we need to do is find the optimal level of stress which will individually motivate but not overwhelm each of us. How Can I Tell What is Optimal Stress for Me? There is no single level of stress that is optimal for all people. We are all individual creatures with unique requirements. As such, what isdistressing to one may be a joy to another. And even when we agree that a particular event is distressing, we are likely to differ in our physiological and psychological responses to it. The person who loves to arbitrate disputes and moves from job site to job site would be stressed in a job which was stable and routine, whereas the person who thrives under stable conditions would very likely be stressed on a job wher duties were highly varied. Also, our personal stress requirements and the amount which we can tolerate before we become distressed changes with our ages. It has been found that most illness is related to unrelieved stress. If you are experiencing stress symptoms, you have gone beyond youroptimal stress level; you need to reduce the stress in your life and/or improve your ability to manage it. How Can I Manage Stress Better? Identifying unrelieved stress and being aware of its effect on our lives is not sufficient for reducing its harmful effects. Just as there are many sources of stress, there are many possibilities for its management.However, all require work toward change: changing the source of stress and/or changing your reaction to it. How do you proceed? Become aware of your stressors and your emotional and physical reactions. Notice your distress. Don't ignore it. Don't gloss over your problems. Determine what events distress you. What are you telling yourself about meaning of these events? Determine how your body responds to the stress. Do you become nervous or physically upset? If so, in what specific ways? Recognize what you can change. Can you change your stressors by avoiding or eliminating them completely? Can you reduce their intensity (manage them over a period of time instead of on a daily or weekly basis)? Can you shorten your exposure to stress (take a break, leave the physical premises)? Can you devote the time and energy necessary to making a change (goal setting, time management techniques, and delayed gratification strategies may be helpful here)? Reduce the intensity of your emotional reactions to stress. The stress reaction is triggered by your perception of danger...physical danger and/or emotional danger. Are you viewing your stressors in exaggerated terms and/or taking a difficult situation and making it a disaster? Are you expecting to please everyone? Are you overreacting and viewing things as absolutely critecal and urgent? Do you feel you must always prevail in every situation? Work at adopting more moderate views; try to see the stress as something you can cope with rather than something that overpowers you. Try to temper your excess emotions. Put the situation in perspective. Do not labor on the negative aspects and the " what if's." Learn to moderate your physical reacitons to stress. Slow, deep breathing will bring your heart rate and respiration back to normal. Relaxation techniques can reduce muscle tension. Electronic biofeedback can help you gain voluntary control over such things as muscle tension, heart reate, and blood pressure. Medications, when prescribed by a physician, can help in the short term in moderating your physical reactions. However, they alone are not the answer. Learning to moderate these reactions on your own is a preferable long-term solution. Build your physical reserves. Exercise for cardiovascular fitness three to four times a week (moderate, prolonger rythmic exercise is best, such as walking, swimming, cycling, or jogging). Eat well-balanced, nutritious meals. Maintain your ideal weight. Avoid nicotine, excessive caffeine, and other stimulants. Mix leisure with work. Take breaks and get away when you can. Get enough sleep. Be as consistent with your sleep schedule as possible. Maintain your emotional reserves. Develop some mutaully supportive friendships/relationships. Pursue realistic goals which are meaningful to you, rather than goals others have for you that you do not share. Expect some frustrations, failures, and sorrows. Always be kind and gentle with yourself -- be a friend to yourself. ARHC Homepage.

WHO TOLD US THAT WAS COPING? Who made the rules that said don't cry "too" much, don't show your feelings "too" much, don't let your feelings affect your work and relationships at all? The next important question is, why have we bought it? What is wrong with having our feelings? Grief is a natural process and infertility is an experience we have to grieve on a chronic basis. It is an on-going crisis which provides us with tremendous stress. In short, it's a terrible experience we wouldn't wish on our worst enemies (most of the time, that is). So who says we should look like the cast of Dallas or Dynasty as we suffer? People can't go through infertility without being affected emotionally unless their feelings are being so well protected that they're not in touch with them. Men and women deal with their feelings differently. If we, women, try to repress our feelings, they get bigger and bigger, more and more ominous, until we feel we are out of control and our emotions have become a monstrous ogre about to eat us up. Men might actually feel more threatened expressing themselves since they've usually been trained to repress their emotions. There's no right or wrong and there are ways men and women can help each other learn to balance thinking and feeling as they struggle side by side on their journey toward parenthood. Learn now you're normal. So don't put yourself down for how you've chosen to cope. Find the positives about your style. Focus on how well you're doing and give yourself lots of strokes for how well you've succeeded. For instance, many women put themselves down for feeling the need to talk to people a lot. Well, using support systems is one of the top ways recommended to folks going through stress full life experiences. Aren't you clever! If people don't want to be there for you they will find a way to create distance, and if they don't have a clue about how to help you, it doesn't mean you're a hopeless case. Most people don't know how to deal with such intense pain. So give yourself positive self talk about how good you are at reaching out for help. If you can't find the positives in what you are doing ask a friend, your partner. There's always a way! Infertility often creates or exacerbates marital conflict. Find time to talk about it and decide if it's old problems or created by your infertility experience. Talk about the ways you've solved problems before and see if any of these work. If not, ask friends what they've done or seek out counseling. It is normal for marriages to have problems during this time. Friends and family members often seem insensitive and say or do things out of their ignorance, discomfort, or feelings of helplessness. Educate them when you are strong enough. Tell them how you feel. Don't wait until you are in crisis or you'll tend to talk yourself out of dealing with them and they'll never learn what you need from them. Medical caregivers have feelings about your infertility too and may react in a number of ways which may or may not feel good to you. Give them feedback about what feels good and what doesn't so they learn, and so your anger and resentment don't build. You'll be helping yourself right now and contributing to other infertile couples in the future. Co-workers and employers may react also in hurtful ways or not understand your need for time off, your emotional ups and downs. Educate them where you can. Find supports in your workplace. Imagine you have some other illness that doesn't have the social stigma of infertility and give yourself as much permission as you would in that situation to use your time as medically recommended, and expect others to honor this as well. Remember what you've done in the past to make it through difficult times and see if it can work for you now as well: find time to have fun, read books, do nice things for yourself, buy things, meet new people, take exciting classes, learn to do something you've always been afraid to try, develop a sense of humor about the infertility experience (this actually can be done on your better days), use this time to develop deeper and more intimate relationships with your partner and others you care for, go for counseling, join a support group at RESOLVE, or do anything else your heart desires. You deserve it! ARHC Homepage This HTML code is Copyright (C) 1995 by Mark Perloe, M.D., P.C. Atlanta, GA, USA.

April 1981 When I ask you to listen to me and you start by giving advice, you have not done what I asked. When I ask you to listen to me and you begin to tell me why I shouldn't feel that way, you are trampling on my feelings. When I ask you to listen to me and you feel you have to do something to solve my problem, you have failed me, strange as it rna seem. Listen! All I ask is that you listen, not talk or do... just hear me. When you do something for me that I can and need to do for myself, you contribute to my fear and inadequacy And I can do for myself. I'm not helpless Maybe discouraged and faltering, but not helpless. But when you accept as simple fact that I do feel what I feel, no matter how irrational, then I can quit trying to convince you and get about the business of understanding what's behind this irrational feeling. And when that's clear, the answers are obvious and I don't need advice. Irrational feelings make sense when we understand what's behind them. Perhaps that's why prayer works, sometimes, for some people... because God is mute, and He or She doesn't give advice or try to fix things. God just listens and lets you work it out for yourself. So, please listen and just hear me. And it you want to talk, wait a minute for your turn, and I'll listen to you.

Dear Dr. Perloe: I am very impressed by your site: keep up the good work. As mentioned my fiance and I just lost our first baby 10 weeks into the pregnancy. I am from a family of doctors and know that it is probably best, but I, rather we, still go through our emotional roller coaster. Loss sucks. It would just be nice to know how to support my partner best. I don't her or anyone and am honestly afraid my grieving will only cause her to have feelings of guilt, which I don't want her to have. At the same time, I do feel a sense of loss that I want to share the most logical person�my partner. any ideas are welcome, thank you: Jim Jim: While there are support groups at Resolve meetings and a group that deals specifically with loss, I would not think you would have access to them in Tokyo. A group setting, may be helpful for some to meet with others who feel the same type of loss. I think the most important thing you can do for her is to hear her feelings. AND, not try to problem-solve them. Comments such as these might be helpful: I don't really know what you must be feeling. Please share it with me. It must be very painful for you. I feel a terrible sense of loss for both of us. I want to discuss how you feel...Loss sucks. You are so iimportant to me that I need to hear how you feel. If we can get through this, we can get through anything. I am honestly afraid my grieving will only cause you more pain and cause you to have feelings of guilt. I don't believe this is your fault. But, I can understand if you feel guilty. My sharing this with you only helps me better understand why I chose you to share life with. etc. Don't say: I understand how you feel. You shouldn't feel that way. Maybe you shouldn't/should have.... If you have other ideas or suggestions for Jim, things to say and those one should avoid saying, please let me know and I will add them to this list.

Modification has improved its effectiveness. Its advantages include ease of performance, small incision size, and minimal dissection. This technique requires the use of a special clamp that is a modified version of the no-scalpel vasectomy clamp. Although similar in appearance to the no-scalpel vasectomy clamp, the modified clamp has different dimensions thereby minimizing the risk of tearing the implant. Download Norplant Video 2.5meg avi STEPS: Both ends of each implant are marked with a pen and the implant is drawn on the arm to facilitate its removal. The arm is prepped with Betadine solution. A site approximately one-third from the base of the fan between the third and fourth implants is injected with Xylocaine 1% with bicarb 1cc/10cc. The injection is then carried laterally underneath the implant with a total of 4-6 cc of local anesthetic injected under the three implants on each side. A 4mm incision is made with a #11 blade. The Norplant removal clamp is inserted so as to grasp each implant approximately one-third of the way from the bottom end. This is made easier by stabilizing each implant with a finger from the opposite hand. Using gentle traction, each implant is brought to the incision where using gauze sponge, #22 needless or knife blade, the capsule is gently incised. If a knife is used the capsule is scraped gentle in a direction parallel to the implant and not in a cutting motion across the implant as this may transect the implant and make removal more difficult. The implants are removed. After removing all implants, the implants are displayed for the patient to see and then dressing is placed over the incision site. Postoperative wound care is similar to other Norplant removal techniques. As levonorgestrel is cleared within 96 hours, alternative contraception should be provided prior to discharging the patient.

INCIID also conducts a comprehensive, ongoing media campaign to educate the general public and garner a greater understanding about the emotional, financial and informational struggle facing sufferers of infertility. ADVISORY BOARD INCIID has brought together a group of internationally renowned infertility experts to serve on its Advisory Board and take an active role in conferences, cyberspace events, educational video development and media events. To date, advisory board members include Dr. Alan Beer, director of reproductive medicine at the Robert R. McCormick Clinics at the University of Health Sciences Chicago Medical School, Dr. Carolyn Coulam, director of reproductive immunology at Genetics and IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va.; Dr. Marc Goldstein, director of the Male Reproduction and Microsurgery Unit at the New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center and co-author of "The Couple's Guide to Infertility"; Dr. Niels H. Lauersen, medical director of The New York Medical Service for Reproductive Medicine and author of "Getting Pregnant: What Couples Need to Know Right Now" and six other books on women's health; Dr. Mark Perloe, director of reproductive endocrinology, infertility and in-vitro fertilization at Georgia Baptist Medical Center, and Peggy Robin, author of "How to be a Successful Fertility Patient: Your Guide to Getting the Best Possible Medical Help to Have a Baby. " NATIONAL CONFERENCE INCIID is hosting an annual conference featuring workshops and seminars with nationally acknowledged fertility experts and panel participants. The first conference is tentatively set for Spring, 1996. Workshop topics include "On the Horizon---New Treatments," "Demystifying High Tech Treatments (IVF, GIFT, ZIFT), " "ICSI and other Male Factor Treatments," "Examining the Legal Aspects of Donor Procedures and Adoption," and "Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune Problems." A "Conference Summary and Report" will be published following the conference and will be available to the general public. EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS INCIID is developing a series of informational videos about a range of infertility diagnoses and specific treatment options. The INCIID video series will be available at a reasonable price for the general consumer. NATIONAL INFERTILITY SURVEY During 1995, INCIID will conduct the first-ever, on-line infertility survey designed to measure the degree of infertility and pregnancy loss among the general population. Using Prodigy's on-line survey capabilities and the expertise of professional pollsters, the INCIID-Prodigy Infertility Survey will reach nearly 2 million Prodigy users. The results of the survey will be released in 1996. CYBERSPACE In addition to being an international presence in a variety of on-line networks such as Prodigy, America Online and the INCIID is also developing its own "Homepage" for the Internet's "World Wide Web." This easily accessed Internet site will be a permanent location for information and updates on the latest infertility research and treatment programs. INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, LOCAL MEDIA Experts believe that as many as one in six couples experience some degree of infertility, yet there continues to be a shroud of mystery around the medical problems which prevent couples from having children. Those uneducated about the causes of infertility and pregnancy loss may never learn that there are often simple and inexpensive steps which can help them attain their dreams of having families. Frustrated with medical practitioners who are unfamiliar with new treatments and technologies, the infertile often don't know where to begin seeking a diagnosis and solution. The founders of INCIID have extensive public relations backgrounds and will enlist the media in ending the silence and misinformation about infertility and pregnancy loss. Using the expertise of its Advisory Board and statistics and research from professional organizations such as the American Fertility Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, INCIID will involve international, national and local news media in its education efforts. NEWSLETTER INCIID members receive a quarterly newsletter which provides resource referrals, a "Question and Answer" column written by a panel of experts, articles about new technologies and treatment modalities and information about upcoming INCIID events. MEMBERSHIP INCIID offers three levels of annual Membership: General Members: $25 includes quarterly newsletter subscription and 10 percent conference registration discount.

Larisa Kochorva and Anne Atkinson had a dream that Russian women would have access to the same quality of women�s healthcare as American women. They shared that vision with Dr.Perloe, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Georgia Baptist Medical Center, during a Norplant conference in July of 1992 in St. Petersburg, Russia. Perloe met with Russians specialists in gynecology, urology and general surgery in an effort to assess their needs, desires and capabilities. Dr. Michael Herndon, director of comparative medicineat Georgia Baptist Medical Center, joined the team to help plan a multiyear strategy. Initially, our efforts would focus on the introduction of the latest endoscopic surgical techniques. To meet our goals required an assessment of their healthcare infrastructure and resources, as well as a comprehensive medical education program and supply effort. The American and Russian partners jointly developed a program that included lectures, laboratory sessions as well as surgical training. One of our goals was to introduce these new surgical concepts to the largest possible audience. Intensive training would be reserved for a smaller group. By limiting the endoscopic training to a smaller group, we were able to insure that the Russian physicians could safely continue developing their skills after the two week program was completed. The first symposium involved eleven American participants and 250 Russian participants. $200,000 of equipment and supplies were provided. During the two week exchange, separate lecture programs were held in gynecology, urology and general surgery. Laboratory training sessions covered equipment operation, endoscopic suturing, hysteroscopy, cholecystectomy, hernia repair and pelvic lymph node dissection. Russian physicians performed twenty-two operations with their American partners. Meetings were held late into St. Petersburg�s �White Nights� to plan the June 94 symposium which would provide greater focus on women�s healthcare. Expanded sessions were planned to address menopause, hysterosocpy, endoscopy, endometriosis, ultrasonography, contraception, highrisk obstetrics and perioperative nursing issues. The Second International Women�s Health and Endoscopy Symposium took over a year to coordinate. This was greatly facilitated by the signing of the A.I.H.A. partnership agreement between Georgia Baptist Medical Center and First Medical Institute-Pavlov as well as the personal support of David Harrell, CEO of Georgia Baptist Medical Center. Our partnership enabled Russian specialists to actively participate in the planning and implementation of our project. Our second symposium involved 17 American participants, hundreds of Russian participants, and over $250,000 of donated supplies, time and shipping costs. Although the general format for this years� symposium was similar to last year, lectures, laboratories and surgical procedures, there were some notable differences. This years� symposium included case presentations by Russian physicians as well as lectures highlighting specific areas of expertise. These presentations pointed out many differing beliefs and resulted in a lively exchange of views. In America, the current therapy for endometriosis relies on surgery and hormonal manipulation. American gynecologists are just now beginning to explore the immunologic basis for this disease. Our Russian colleagues have vast experience using immunotherapy for endometriosis and frequently rely on immunotherapy as first line treatment. Management of the menopause is another area where differences were noted. Many Russian physicians expressed the belief that the debility associated with estrogen deprivation, menopause, is natural and should be endured, not treated. When a woman�s symptoms are severe enough, galvanic treatments and antipsychotic drugs may be employed. Other Russian physicians share the view of their American counterparts that while estrogen deprivation is part of the natural aging process, its sequalae are not. These women should be treated with estrogen replacement therapy. A major goal of this years� effort was to provide slides and handouts in Russian. Our contraceptive slide presentations were entirely in Russian and an extensive Russian handout was made available. On the topic of contraceptive beliefs, our views also differed widely. Despite the fact that birth control pills are held to be safe and effective by American physicians, Russian physicians are leery of hormonal contraception. It is noteworthy that while one Russian physician presented exciting research that has led to improved hormonal contraceptive options, many Russian physicians and the population at large ignore this contraceptive option. In order to better understand the status of women�s healthcare in Russia, we held focus groups and discussed issues in family planning and menopause. A session was held with Russian women physicians to assess their views. The nursing program was especially well received. Issues of patient care, sterilization, centralization of OR facilities and resources was addressed. The Russian nurses were enthusiastic about the potential development of an expanded role and looked forward to future efforts to revise and expand the Russian nursing curricula. Throughout the symposium, discussions were held with the university president, Nikolai Yaitsky and Larisa Kochorova, director of Delor, on how to improve efficiency and thereby achieve the maximum utilization of resources. As a direct result of these discussions, a new position has been created at the university to coordinate endoscopy equipment, training and supplies. The university has committed to develop a centralized endosurgery facility thereby enabling all physicians access to this technology. Over the past few years, we have worked closely developing relationships with our colleagues. We stayed with their families, communicated openly and immersed ourselves in the Russian culture. We strongly believe that our successes would not have been possible without the level of trust which has developed over the past three years. Our personal goals are: to hold a third symposium on endoscopy and women�s health; to provide further assistance in the centralization of endoscopy services; to foster an ongoing exchange of physicians, nurses and information; and to establish an economically sustainable women�s health clinic. We look forward to sharing our experience and resources with other A.I.H.A. programs with similar interests.

This course ran from May 10-17, 1993, during the early part of the "White Nights" when the sun rises at 3 a.m. and sets at 11:30 p.m. It was the first in what is planned to be an on going affiliation with the ST. Petersburg Medical Institute. The preparation began many months ago as Drs. Perloe, Herndon and Anne Atkinson began to work out the logistics of having an endoscopy course in a country which did not speak English, has an 8 hour time differential and was located over 5,000 miles away. No detail could be taken for granted. All the equipment, supplies and lecture materials needed for the course had to be anticipated and shipped to Russia. None of the course directors had initially realized the amount of work it would require to take this idea of an truly international endoscopic training symposium from conception through reality. But, to their credit, they stuck with it and the course was a complete success. According to Dr. Herndon without the help of such people as Dr. Perloe's office staff, the staff of medical education, Alton Westberry and his department the work would not have been completed on time. In addition the Vendor support was wonderful! Ralf Sander of CIRCON/ACMI provided video and Laparoscopic equipment as well as technical support. Christian Erbe of ERBE Electronics provided a wealth of information and the electrosurgical generators. Between these two companies 6 huge wooden crates measuring 4x4x6 FEET were shipped to Russia. Ralf and Christian brought with them not only equipment but technical expertise that was indispensable. The enthusiasm and sheer hard work Ralf Sander of Germany, Christian Erbe of Belgium and Patrick Laughlin of Atlanta exhibited was an inspiration to all. Drs. Perloe and Herndon were heard to say on many occasions, "without these individuals, this course could not have succeeded as well as it did". In addition, United States Surgical Company donated disposable surgical instrumentation and Baxter much needed supplies. To all of these vendors, and many more, (Valley Lab, Organon, Carl Storz and Apple Medical to name a few)...our heart felt THANK YOU! The group from Georgia Baptist Medical Center was as listed by specialty - Gynecology: Drs. Mark Perloe, Steve Saltzman and Rhonda Latif. General Surgery: Drs. Titus Duncan and Steve Eubanks. Urology: Dr. Thomas Schoborg. Comparative Medicine: Dr. Michael Herndon. Nursing: Nadra Cohran, and Research: Dr. Carole Ehleben. Translation, the key to success or failure, fell to Anne Atkinson whose fluent Russian made communication a joy. This distinguished group was assembled not only for their expertise, which is considerable, but also because of their belief in the value of an International Endoscopy Symposium. So dedicated was this group that many of its members had to pay their own way and use vacation time for the opportunity to teach. Each of the members of the group lived with a sponsoring Russian family while in St. Petersburg. These families were warm and caring. The group from Georgia Baptist has many wonderful stories to tell and I encourage the interested reader to corner one of the participants and simply ask them about their experience. Then stand back as they talk your ear off about all the unique and varied cultural and personal impressions each brought home. The Symposium was divided into three sections: lectures, laboratory and operative. Over 300 physicians participated in at least one of these sections. The main lecture hall at the Institute reminded one of pictures of 150 doctors and students standing around an auditorium listening to one of the senior professors demonstrating the latest in medical theory and technique. It was here that the course began. After being made completely welcome by the faculty, Dr. Perloe gave his introductory remarks. The lectures that morning by Drs. Perloe, Eubanks and Herndon showed once again the importance and difficulties of a language barrier. But through the efforts of all involved the day went smoothly. At the outset the course directors were concerned as to whether the interest in lectures would remain. We all realize how interest can fade on a beautiful spring afternoon. This was not to be the case, however, all the lectures were standing room only. Faculty and students alike could be found in the hall waiting to take an empty chair. Specialty lectures which were intended to be limited to 18 hand picked leading Russian physicians had to be increased to 50 due to repeated requests. Their "experimental lab" was a picturesque building with a semicircular stone entrance. Once inside the building you could not escape the feeling of time standing still. These rooms had seen thousands of wide eyed youths (in Russia students begin a six year medical school curriculum directly out of high school) learn the fundamentals of anatomy, pathology and general surgery as they moved through their training. It was here that 6 working stations were assembled allowing the plan for 18 participants to learn the details of the surgeries they hoped to perform. Once again the instructors had to rise to the occasion of literally hundreds of medical students parading through in an effort to actually witness a technology that none of them had ever seen and few knew about in any detail. An unexpectedly large turnout of Surgeons from the St. Petersburg Medical Institute, as well as several from surrounding hospitals, caused the huge lab facility to swell with activity. During this section the details of Endometrial Ablation, Hysteroscopy, resection of Leiomyomas and general Laparoscopy were taught by Drs. Perloe, Saltzman and Latif. Drs. Duncan and Eubanks gave detailed instructions on principals and practices of general laparoscopy as well as how to avoid potential complications. For Dr. Schoborg the challenges were just beginning. After spending considerable time with a team of highly qualified and extremely motivated Urologists on the details of Laparoscopy and Pelvic Lymphadenectomy he then accompanied them to their facility. Upon arrival he discovered a very modern Lithotriptor for breaking up kidney and ureteral stones using the latest in shock wave technology. He was also about to discover they had saved for him a huge, rock hard stone lodged tightly in a patients ureter. Another area in which actively persued was nursing education. Under the experienced hand of Nadra Cochran R.N., a team of Russian nurses who had expressed an interest in Laparoscopy were taught how to prepare for and manage all the varied equipment and instrumentation necessary for safe Endoscopic surgery. Carole Ehleben was able to successfully initiate efforts to bring controlled clinical trials to Pavlov so that the Institute might benefit from the revenues and advanced technology which accompany such studies. Imagine moving all the equipment needed for an operating room across a campus over roads which have so many potholes that a cart cannot roll. Imagine having to move each piece of equipment by hand. Now multiply that by 6 operating rooms and you have some idea of the work that had to be done. In the space of one evening all the necessary equipment required to safely perform multiple laparoscopic techniques had to be mobilized and moved into the operating theater. No amount of thanks can repay Dr. Herndon, Ralf Sander, Christian Erbe and Patrick Laughlin for their efforts. But move they did and all was ready for some of the first Laparoscopic Surgeries and the FIRST Laparoscopic Herniorrhaphy in St. Petersburg's history (Drs Duncan and Eubanks). As is the medical standard in the United States, the physicians first watched Drs. Perloe, Duncan, Saltzman, Eubanks, Schoborg and Latif operate. Next they assisted under the watchful eye of our surgeons. Surgeries included: Laparoscopically Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy, Endoscopic Evaluation of the Uterus, Laparoscopic evaluation of causes of infertility, Laparoscopic removal of a Gall Bladder, Laparoscopic repair of an Inguinal Hernia and the Endoscopic examination of Ureteral obstruction due to a ureteral stone. Finally, they performed one of the first Laparoscopic Cholecystectomies completely on their own. All the patients recovered quickly and without complication. The symposium received much media attention in St. Petersburg. A description of the course was included in 3 newspaper articles, several radio news reports, a live radio program and 2 television reports. Looking back at the experiences of the group, it is not possible to evaluate all that was learned on both sides. The Russians treated us like family. They were gracious to a fault. We found them to be extremely knowledgeable, merely lacking the access to the technologies we take for granted. We had hoped to find colleagues, what we found were friends. To all of those who participated in the first International Endoscopic Training Symposium the Georgia Baptist Medical Centers welcomes you back and ...CONGRATULATIONS ON A JOB WELL DONE!!!

Ward, Ph.D.; Caroline Dott, M.s.W., MA;. Marina Egorova, Ph.D. Russian Psychologist Family Planning Focus Group There were 10 Russian women participants and two Russian facilitators and two American leaders. The participants average age was 23. There were two women who had one child each, and the others had no children. The forty questions were basically concerned with availability of knowledge and resources for family planning. The women who had not had children wanted at least two children each, but this was in direct contrast to the women with one child, who were very reluctant to consider having another. The realities of work and family life had taken its toll. There was no systematic, reliable information source for family planning. This phenomena was across the board the continual, central crisis for the fertile Russian female. The rhythm method remains the method of "choice" (a euphemism since they feel there is so little choice). The pill has a negative history with heavy doses bringing many side effects, and relayed messages of negative perceptions being widespread. IUD's are being used now only by the women who have had one child. They are not too expensive and readily available in the drugstores; this usage helps to explain the "one child" syndrome that is now the norm (current Russian statistics show a negative birth rate). The women feel that the medical profession is also lacking in the information and lacking access to family planning resources. The District Medical Centers are particularly noninformative and even hostile to women's questions about gynocological care and contraception. The women report that the women doctors are actually the worst with their responsiveness to the female questions. (This probably is a defensive response because the doctors themselves are uninformed or uneducated in these matters). They prefer male doctors who seem to have more empathy and helpful caringness. These women find there is little knowledge about STDS's and AIDS. Another critical, central issue is that these women report they only visit a doctor when there is a problem. Prevention is not a known concept. The women actually hate going to a doctor. The wait is long and the attitude usually intolerable. Only recently with the avrailability of private doctors do the women feel that their health is receiving proper attention and they can trust the doctor. The sense of choice, which is entirely new in this country, is allowing them some freedom to ask more questions and pursue more avenues of alternative care. But the major obstacles of education and resources in this area as well as the overriding taboo (seen as weird or weak) against Russian women going to a doctor for their female problems loom continuously in the face of women's health care. Menopause/Midlife This group had 7 Russian participants. The average age was 36 and only two of the women did not have children. The focus of the group was to discuss their knowledge of menopause: its effects and treatrnent. The women reported that their knowledge was all second hand from their mothers experiences. Most of them reported that their mothers had had a difficult time. But they did not seek help until in extreme dire strates. There is no knowledge available nor is this problem discussed with the Russian doctors. They were unaware of any treatment for menopause; and they feel this is something one has to sove for herself. They prefer not to think about it until it happens. Then if problems develop, possibly see a doctor or psychologist. But once again, the doctors at the district medical centers are uncomfortable and not helpful with these issues. This is not considered a serious problem and the female is looked at strangely if she asks for family planning care. This is even worse in the smaller cities and towns. Now some help of this kind might be available to the women who have money who can go to private doctors. Only a few said they would discuss it with their husbands, because most men do not want to hear about female problems. Also, employers are agitated if women complain about feminine problems, so they only talk with other women co-workers about the problems. One should not miss work or do less on the job if having side effects. There was a general feeling that women can overcome on their own. They have not trusted the system. Many report the incompetence of their doctors, who are not held personally responsible. They told stories of wrong diagnosis across the board. The issue of money is paramount, because the medical centers are free and the specialist and private centers are expensive. But they all welcome the revamping of the medical system wherein they can now change doctors (part of the new capitalistic influence nationwide). These women are eager to know more about help and are in midlife and are anxious for all publications to be printed in Russian. Physicians Attitudes and Knowledge: Family Planning and Menopause/Midlife There were six Russian participants, all were working as doctors at the medical institute. The average age was 29, and three of the doctors also had Ph.D.'s. There was an opening question of why we were there training and collaborating. We discussed what the problems were in women's healthcare today. Definitely, these female doctors were cognizant of the lack of knowledge and care for female issues in the medical arena. The education of the whole population is very poor or nonexistent in sexual matters, in family planning and in female gynecological issues. Women seem afraid of negative consequences for help in health or family planning. Their mothers have been skeptical and they don't have time to think about their health. The life of the Russian woman is tedious and complicated with difficulties economically and time crunches. The Russian women are more tired than the American women. Now you have 5 years to stay at home with a child and your job is reserved, but most women cannot afford to do this. There is a small, but growing group of housewives of businessmen who are electing to stay at home now. The problem of time and energy is overwhelming, and the women are crying for more flex time. Waiting in line for over an hour is an oppressive obstacle when one goes to the doctor because they do not have specific appointment times. Because of these time elements as well as societal taboos, illnesses are ignored in the first stages, so when the patients appear for help, they are usually in the more advanced stages. The doctors that are educated appreciate an informed, inquiring patient. But those not well educated, they are irritated with the patient and give misleading information about treatments. The problem with contraception is that the women will not return for pill evaluations, the condoms are not good and the IUD's are given only to the women with a child. Abortion is the last resort, but most Russian women resort to this method. The Russian women need personal doctors where they are followed for all of her life stages. Also, the doctors need to spend more time with their patients, educating them as well as providing treatment. Doctors need more autonomy so they can be in charge of their schedule and how they spend time with their patients. There are some doctors in the workplace but they are not gynecologists. They asked for more information, because they lack current medical journals. The need for hard currency reigns supreme. (The cost of an IUD is $10 for the first consultation and $15 to put it in. The cost of an abortion is $30 with an average starting salary of $25 a month.) They complained of primitive equipment and lack of pictures and pamphlets to educate themselves much less their patients. They asked for training in communication, in family relationship and sexuality and sexual pathology. They would welcome any psychology courses in women's issues.

He has over 15 years of pharmaceutical researchexperience in the United States with leading companies such asPfizer, Inc., Carter-Wallace, and Paco Research. Dr. Majeed has abroad knowledge of the pharmacological properties of herbalmedicines used in Ayurveda, the traditional system of botanicalmedicine of India. He pioneered the introduction of such herbalremedies as Gugulipid®, Boswellin®, Picroliv®,Citrin®, Tylophora®, Centellin®, etc., for theAmerican and European markets. Anthony Conte, M.D. A leading physician in the field ofobesity, Dr. Conte has extensive experience as both a bariatricclinician and a principal investigator in research studies onappetite suppressants. In private practice in Hilton Head, SouthCarolina, Dr. Conte is an active member and a diplomate of theAmerican Society of Bariatric Physicians. Introduction Muhammed Majeed, Ph.D. Citrin® is the trade name given to a calcium salt of(-)-hydroxycitric acid [(-)HCA], a complex of the activeprinciple derived from Garcinia cambogia and Garcinia indicawhich are native to India. This product is standardized herbalextract derived from the pericarp of the Indian Berry (the rindof the fruit of Garcinia cambogia and Garcinia Indica). The storyof Citrin® revolves around the interlocking discoveries ofherbalists, botanists, and pharmaceutical scientists workingtogether to bring forth a revolutionary solution to an age-oldhuman dilemma -- the problem of how to achieve effective weightmanagement and reduce excess body fat. Through its novel and safemechanisms of action, Citrin® offers consumers and healthcare practitioners alike an effective dietary supplement foraccelerating fat-burning, inhibiting the formation of new fat,and promoting cardiovascular health. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 (-)HCA and Weight Control During the 1970s, researchers at Brandeis University and atHoffman La Roche Laboratories discovered that fat synthesis couldbe blocked if citrate lyase were inhibited. In both test tubestudies and animal experiments, they demonstrated that(-)-hydroxycitrate impeded the biosynthesis of fats. Theinhibition of fat synthesis by (-)-hydroxycitrate occurred inliver cell cultures and in the livers of living rats which hadreceived this compound orally or by injection. Intrigued by thesefindings, the researchers speculated that (-)-hydroxycitratemight be advantageous for weight control. Further studies conducted by these researchers showed that theinclusion of (-)-hydroxycitrate into the diet of test animalsmarkedly suppressed weight gain in young, growing rats. Thissuppression of added weight resulted directly from the blockageof fat accumulation. It had no impact on the build-up of leanmass. Also, the effect was dose-dependent. The most impressivefindings were observed when (-)-hydroxycitrate accounted for onepercent or more of the diet. The (-)-hydroxycitrate used in theseexperiments was synthesized as a trisodium salt and administeredto the experimental animals in this form. When given an optimal intake of (-)-hydroxycitrate, the test ratstended to eat less, and their food consumption was suppressed by10 percent or more. This pattern of appetite suppression also wasseen in rats whose appetite-regulating centers in the brain hadbeen surgically destroyed. Furthermore, very little(-)-hydroxycitrate reached the brain. These findings stronglysuggest that the appetite-suppressive effect of this substance isnot centered in the brain (as is the case for manyappetite-curbing drugs). Rather, it is located in the liver. One of the chief functions of the liver is to ensure that theblood continually has adequate concentrations of glucose (sugar)to fuel the brain with energy. The brain cannot burn fat orprotein, only glucose. The first step in this process isgluconeogenesis, the complex reaction described earlier in whichglucose is formed from pyruvic acid. During gluconeogenesis,pyruvate also can be synthesized from non-carbohydrate molecules(such as lactate, glycerol, and amino acids -- the same buildingblocks that make up protein). The newly-manufactured glucose canthen either be released into the bloodstream or stored as energyreserve in the form of glycogen for future use. Acting as a barometer of liver glucose levels, the vagus nervelocated in the brain is linked to the liver. Specialized nervecells involved in this connection monitor the level of glucoseand glycogen in the liver. These nerve cells provide a mechanismfor appetite regulation. Thus, when liver glycogen stores arelow, such as after a fast or during famine, an animal iscompelled to eat a larger amount of food in order to feelsatiated, or full. The decision to eat more is under thephysiological control of nerve cell connections between the liverand the brain. Not surprisingly, the Hoffman La Roche scientists found that therate of gluconeogenesis nearly doubled in rats treated with(-)-hydroxycitrate. In other words, the rate at which the livercould manufacture glucose (in this case from lactate or the aminoacid, alanine) in the presence of (-)-hydroxycitrate was fasterthan occurred in control animals which did not receive thesupplement. This meant that the (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated ratsbecame satiated by consuming less food than did their untreatedcounterparts -- the control animals. The increased rate ofgluconeogenesis offered a solid explanation for the appetitesuppression observed in (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated animals. Yet,subsequent studies, though encouraging for weight control, failedto clarify the precise physiological mechanisms that couldaccount for weight loss. As noted previously, (-)-hydroxycitrate reduced appetiteconsiderably more than did many appetite-suppressive agents. In one study, at the end of 80 days, there was a four percent netreduction in food consumed by rats treated with(-)-hydroxycitrate. At the same time, however, these animals hadgained 78 percent less weight than the control animals which didnot receive any (-)-hydroxycitrate during this period. Thisobservation - the most dramatic one reported - along with otherfindings indicated that the relatively lower amount of weightgain was considerably less than expected, given the minimalchange that occurred in the animals’ food intake. In essence, the reduction in weight gain (78 percent) wasdisproportionately large when compared to the very small decreaseof four percent in food consumption. Similar findings emergedfrom a pair feeding study. When (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated ratsand control rats ingested identical quantities of food each day,the (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated rats gained substantially lessweight than did the controls. Hydoxycitrate had no obvious effecton the animals’ physical activity. It appears, therefore,that (-)-hydroxycitrate probably boosted the rats’ metabolicrate. Unfortunately, this hypothesis was never proven because thescientists failed to make any direct measurements of theanimals’ metabolic rate. The notion does, however, provide areasonable hypothesis for the mechanism through whichCitrin® --an herbal product containing the stable calciumsalt of (--hydroxycitrate -- inhibits the formation of new bodyfat. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 (-)HCA and Fat Burning: Possible Biochemical Mechanisms of Action The studies just described suggest that (-)HCA blocks fatty acid(as well as cholesterol) biosynthesis by indirectly lowering thepool of acetyl Coenzyme A. (-)HCA competes with citrate as asubstrate upon which the enzyme, citrate lyase, can act. In thepresence of (-)HCA, citrate cannot be easily converted intoacetyl Coenzyme A and oxaloacetate. The reduced availability ofthese two compounds subsequently alters other steps in theKreb’s Cycle that accelerate fat-burning in the liver. (-)HCA and Lipid Levels In an in vitro (test tube) study, the biosynthesis ofcholesterol dropped 27 percent in liver cells that had beenincubated with (-)-hydroxycitrate when compared to controlvalues. In a pre-clinical evaluation, serum triglyceride levelswere reduced in fructose-fed non-Zucker rats. The decrease inserum triglyceride levels were attributed to the ability of(-)-hydroxycitrate to increase the rate of fatty acid synthesisin the liver. The findings from these studies indicate thatCitrin® may be an efficacious dietary supplement for helpingto normalize elevated lipid levels. (-)HCA and Protein-Sparing In a negative calorie balance -- that is, when more caloriesare burned than ingested -- stored fat and protein are oxidizedto meet the body’s metabolic demands. It is preferable thatfat rather than protein be burned during this state. But, duringdieting (or restricted caloric intake), up to 30 percent of theweight reduction can result from the loss of lean protein-richtissues, especially skeletal muscle. As scientific studies haveshown, (-)HCA stimulates fat burning while at the same timeslowing the rate at which protein is oxidized. Consequently, theloss of lean tissue is minimized when (-)HCA is taken as adietary supplement during weight reduction programs. It is always important for the body to preserve lean tissue.Aside from its cosmetic or aesthetic appeal, lean mass iscritical for health because the basal metabolic rate is roughlyproportional to the amount of lean mass. During successfuldieting, lean mass is conserved. This enables the dieter tomaintain a steady rate of fat loss without having to drasticallyreduce the amount of food consumed. For those who do find it appropriate to diet, (-)HCA acceleratesthe loss of body fat without sacrificing excessive loss of leanmass. The probable protein-sparing benefits of Citrin® areamplified by an adequate but lower caloric intake of both proteinand complex carbohydrates. Most importantly, a dietary supplementof Citrin® can help to control appetite, stimulate metabolicrate, and spare the loss of protein in lean tissues. All of theseeffects in concert foster a rapid loss of fat, leading ultimatelyto a reduction in the percentage of body fat, and a slimmer,healthier, and leaner physique.

Theserisk factors are exacerbated by the increased levels of fats(free fatty acids) in the bloodstream of obese people. Thefat-burning action of (-)HCA seems to reduce the free fatty acidlevels in the blood. In so doing, it may lessen these riskfactors, even before the obesity is corrected. Future studies areneeded to evaluate the clinical effects of (-)HCA on minimizingcardiovascular risk factors, including reductions in bloodtriglyceride levels and in cholesterol synthesis. Otherhealth-promoting measures can only enhance the potential benefitsof Citrin® on cardiovascular health. Among these are eatinglow-fat foods rich in soluble fiber, taking nutritionalsupplements such as Chromium Picolinate, and following an aerobicexercise regimen. Strategies for managing weight must be realistic and sensible."Quick fix" diet gimmicks rarely, if ever, providelasting benefits. Obesity can no more be "cured" bytemporary measures than can high blood pressure or diabetes bemiraculously eliminated by "magic bullets" Strategiesfor achieving and most importantly, for maintaining a leanphysique must be safe, healthful, and practical for a lifetimeuse. Obviously, stimulant drugs touted for weight loss, includingsome of those classified as health food supplements, generallyfail to meet this standard. Because products such as Citrin®which contain a standardized (-)HCA salt favorably influencethese risk factors, thereby promoting cardiovascular health, theymay well be appropriate for long-term and continuous usage. CLINICAL EVALUATIONS OF (-)-HYDROXYCITRATE Anthony Conte, M.D. Bariatrics: The Medical Profession’s Approach ToObesity What is Bariatrician? A bariatrician is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis,prevention and medical treatment of obesity and diseases commonlyassociated with this condition such as diabetes, hypertension,arthritis, hypoglycemia, thyroid disorders and coronary disease.This subdivision of medical practice follows professionalstandards set forth by the American Society of BariatricPhysicians. Through research, continuing education, andinformation exchange, the members of this organization seek toencourage excellence in the practice of bariatrics. As abariatric physician in private practice for 30 years, I am alsoan active member and a diplomate of the American Society ofBariatric Physicians. In addition to my clinical practice oftreating individual patients, I have conducted over 20 clinicalstudies on appetite suppressants and meal replacement programs.Several of these studies, all of them performed in compliancewith FDA regulations, have been published in the medicalliterature. Obesity: The Orphan Disease "I find that the world is populated by fat peopletrying to get thin and by thin people trying to getthinner." This curious quote, still apropos for ourera, offered by an anonymous source appeared in a magazinearticle written in 1927. Despite the relevance of this statementfor today’s world, many people in the industrialized anddeveloping world alike apparently do not consider obesity aserious medical condition. But the importance of this condition cannot be overstated. TheJournal of the American Medical Association recently issued acall for American medicine to adopt obesity, an "orphandisease" (or a disease which the pharmaceutical industrytends to ignore) rather than leave it to benign neglect. Obesityaffects as many as 80 million people in the United States alone.Health statistics indicate that this disease causes a tremendousamount of psychological and familial suffering, as well as socialand economic turmoil. All of these factors directly andindirectly help to escalate the already accelerating health-carecosts in the United States. In fact, the overall impact of thiscondition ranks high on the list of national public healthproblems as well as personal health priorities. On any given day, 50 percent of American women and 25 percent ofAmerican men are dieting in one form or another. Their excessweight clearly exposes many of them to increased risk ofdeveloping clinical diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascularcomplications, including heart attacks and strokes, and otherdiseases that cost billions of dollars a year in medicalexpenses, lost work hours, and disability compensation. Despitethe magnitude of this problem, only recently has medical sciencebegan to take this issue seriously. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 Weight-Loss Drugs (Anorexics) versus All-Natural Weight-Loss Enhancers As specialists concerned with the health risks and socialstigma associated with obesity, bariatricians are constantlystriving to find more effective and safer treatments for ourpatients. Fortunately, advances in basic medical science,including biochemistry, nutrition, and metabolism, have helped usto better understand the nature of obesity. A more detailedclarification of the body processes that control the distributionof fat and nutrients throughout various organs of the body mayfoster the development of novel approaches to this chronicproblem. In some patients, a medically approved appetite suppressant drugmay be the best solution. Just as encouraging a dependency ondiet pills is absurd, so too is it ludicrous to assume that everycase of obesity can and must be treated without medication.Bariatric physicians, therefore, are in continual search forgovernment approved, safe, and efficacious medications forobesity that can be used judiciously to treat those patients whocould benefit from such therapy. Drug development designed to combat obesity will entail afull-scale effort of basic and applied research by universityresearch scientists, pharmaceutical scientists in privateindustry, clinical physicians, nutritionists, allied healthprofessionals, and the developers of all-natural herbal extracts.The importance of the latter group, herbal researchers andmanufacturers, has been ignored and overshadowed for far too longin the field of weight management. In addition, the United States Government can assist in thedevelopment of safer and more efficacious treatments for obesityby assigning it a higher priority for government-sponsoredresearch funding. National public health education campaigns canelevate the consciousness of lay consumers about propernutrition, sensible eating habits, and other measures that mayhave a favorable impact on preventing many cases of obesity. Asbariatricians, those of us who have dedicated our lives to thisfield feel obligated to encourage other biomedical specialistsand researchers to become actively involved in this neglectedfield. I have participated in several clinical studies evaluating theefficacy and side-effects of anorexics: amphetamines,phendimetrazine, phentermine, mazindol, diethylproprion andphenylpropanolamine. Most consumers have heard of these drugsunder their various trade names. It is my experience that theseappetite suppressants can be safe and effective in a weightcontrol program when they are used selectively and monitoredcarefully by a knowledgeable physician. These medications shouldbe used only as a component of a well-planned,individually-designed or custom-tailored program that includes abalanced and sensible diet accompanied by appropriate physicalexercise. Yet, even medical professionals disagree over theoptimal length of time for which appetite suppressants should beused in a weight loss program. In my judgment, medication shouldnot be restricted to only 12 weeks out of a year if the patientrequires active treatment with pharmaceuticals for a longerperiod of time. Lengthy use of appetite-inhibiting or fat-burningdrugs can be appropriate if the therapy is free of adverse sidereactions and if it fosters healthier changes in lifestylehabits. In 1992, Dr. Michael Weintraub and his colleagues at theUniversity of Rochester School of Medicine concluded thatprescription appetite suppressants can help obese people to loseweight and keep weight off. Their four-year study demonstratedthat obesity should be treated as a chronic disease, comparableto high blood pressure and arthritis. The medical professionrecommends that in chronic diseases (often called the"diseases of civilization"), drugs can be takenindefinitely, if necessary, in order to minimize the symptoms.Yet, in spite of the medical justification for usingpharmaceuticals to treat certain cases of obesity, this does notmean that effective, alternative, or non-pharmaceutical methodsof treating this condition do not exist. They do, in fact, and Ihave spent many years of my professional career conductingresearch on the pros and cons of non-drug, all-natural appetitesuppressants. CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES Background During the last five years, I have conducted three studies onnatural weight-loss aids. All of these diet aids contained twoactive ingredients, (-)-hydroxycitrate (the active ingredient inCitrin®), and chromium (GTF). The results of all of thesestudies were impressive. (-)-Hydroxycitrate is the activeprinciple extracted from the rind of the fruit known as Garciniacambogia and Garcinia indica. In several pre-clinicalassessments, it has been shown to be an appetite suppressant aswell as a lipid lowering agent through its inhibition of fatsynthesis (or fatty acid production.) When (-)-hydroxycitrate is given as a supplement with meals,dietary carbohydrate seems more easily converted into glycogenwhich is then stored in the muscles and in the liver. The resultof these increased glycogen stores is enhanced stamina andendurance without any increase in body weight, especially bodystores of fat. On a biochemical level, the overall effect of(-)-hydroxycitrate is a reduction of acetyl Coenzyme A, the majorsource of carbon atoms available for the synthesis of lipids.(-)-Hydroxycitrate, therefore, lowers blood levels oftriglycerides and cholesterol, and it decreases body fat storeswithout causing a decline in energy output. Chromium (GTF) is a key mineral that "keeps insulin levelsin check" by making the hormone more efficient at regulatingblood sugar levels. In two clinical studies, patients wereadministered a combination of Citrin® (standardized tocontain 250 mg of the calcium salt of (-)-hydroxycitrate) and 100mcg of chromium. This supplement, which was taken three times aday, one half-hour before meals, is ideal because of thesynergistic actions that take place between (-)-hydroxycitrateand chromium. This combination represents a workable alternative to drugs usedfor weight loss. Beneficial to both the patients and thephysician, the Citrin®-Chromium Picolinate combination iscapable of enhancing any dietary and exercise program byfacilitating easier and more substantial weight loss. Of equalimportance, it does not interfere with the chemical actions ofother medications. Affordable in price and commercially availablethrough herbal manufacturers, it can be used by a widecross-section of individuals from different socio-economiclevels. Finally, my research consistently showed that compliancewith this treatment and the recommended diets was high in themajority of individuals who participated in my clinicalevaluations of this product. In all three of the following studies described below, thiscombination of weight loss enhancers, an herbal extractcontaining the calcium salt of (-)HCA and chromium, was used inconjunction with the Smart Choice Diet. I designed this diet as aspecial nutritional regimen to accompany theCitrin®-chromium supplement. The Smart Choice Diet consistsof low-fat, low-sugar, low-sodium foods eaten in three ordinarymeals. The overall program which I advocate combines the diet andweight loss enhancers with sensible daily exercise such aswalking. In most cases, it successfully led to gradual, safeweight loss that stayed off, decreased body fat, increased leanbody mass and, as a favorable side-effect, made for a healthier,happier lifestyle. The Hilton Head Study: Lipodex-2 In this eight-week, double-blind study conducted in 1991 inHilton Head Island, South Carolina, 54 subjects who participatedin the study were each seen weekly by me in my office. Over thecourse of the study period, Lipodex-2 (a supplement containing 50mg Garcinia cambogia extract and an amino acid chelate ofchromium and niacin) was taken by all 30 participants in the testgroup before each meal. The remaining 24 subjects took a placebo(an inert "sugar" pill) before they ate each meal. The 22 subjects in the test group who took Lipodex-2 lost anaverage of 11.1 pound per person, while the 17 subjects who tooka placebo dropped 4.2 pounds per person. All volunteers in thestudy were encouraged to adhere to the Smart Choice Diet,consisting of low-fat renditions of their usual meals, and drink64 ounces of water daily. The foods and the ways in which theywere prepared emphasized variety, moderation, and balance. All ofthe participants were encouraged to follow a daily regimen ofsensible and appropriate exercise. The Lipodex-2 group consistently showed better compliance withthe instructions for the program. They also had a higher level ofenergy, a greater level of appetite suppression, and reducedcravings for sweets than did the placebo group. Decreases in thelevels of serum cholesterol and triglyceride were also observed. The Allendale Study: Lipotrol/Actotherm This 8-week study, conducted in 1993, initially enrolled 128volunteers who were to take three different medications: 30participants were scheduled to receive Actotherm (a supplementwhich does not contain (-)-hydroxycitrate; 45 participants wereadministered a combination therapy of Lipotrol and Actotherm; and44 received Lipotrol. Out of 95 subjects who actually completedthe study, 88 subjects lost 849 pounds or an average of 9.65pounds per person. The specific weight loss average for eachstudy group is listed as follows: Lipotrol*: 11.48 lbs. per person (29 subjects) Lipotrol and Actotherm: 9.52 lbs. per person (35 subjects) Actotherm: 6.65 lbs. per person (29 subjects) *Lipotrol contains Citrin®. The procedures and instructions for this study were identicalto those used in the previously described Lipodex-2 study, withthe exception that placebos were not used in the Allendale study.Also, in contrast to the Hilton Head Study, individuals takingroutine medications were not excluded from the Allendale Study.Hunger levels were markedly depressed, energy levels increased,sugar cravings were reduced, and lipid levels were lowered inparticipants who took Lipotrol or a combination of Lipotrol andActotherm. In some cases, the changes in these variables weredramatic. Furthermore, no negative interactions were observedbetween the test supplements and other medications which some ofthe study volunteers were taking for other conditions. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 Hilton Head Study: Citrin® 75 In 1994, we conducted an eight-week study on 75 volunteerstaking Citrin®75 (a supplement consisting of 250 mg(-)-hydroxycitrate and 100Êmcg chromium from ChromiumPicolinate). The study group included 60 women and 15 men whoranged in age from 21 to 65 years, and in weight from 135.5 to253 pounds. All subjects were in reasonably good health when the projectbegan. However, 74 percent had abnormal blood chemistry (mainlyin the form of elevated lipid levels) and 53 percent were takingone or more prescription drugs for medical conditions primarilyassociated with elevated lipid levels and body overweight. Beforethe study started, only two volunteers showed detectable chromiumin their blood. Despite the "normal" diet mostparticipants claimed to be following before our study began,their plasma levels indicated a virtual absence of this importanttrace mineral. As many people are now well aware of, chromium,which is required by the body to regulate blood sugar, helpsprevent hyperglycemia that can lead to diabetes mellitus. The identical protocol (described for the previous studies)consisting of sensible eating habits as specified in the SmartChoice Diet, adequate dietary water intake, and laboratory workand monitoring was used, along with a dietary supplement ofCitrin® which was taken before each meal. Patient profilestaken during this study involved compliance monitoring and bloodchemistry panels, including an analysis of plasma chromiumlevels. Summary of Results a) Forty-two (42) subjects who completed the study and for whothe laboratory data were available lost an average of 10.80pounds per person. b) Only two (2) out of the 42 subjects had any detectable plasmachromium levels. At the end of the eight week period, all 42subjects had significant and measurable levels of chromium intheir plasma. c) Ten (10) subjects whose laboratory data are still beingevaluated lost an average of 10.60 pounds per person. d) Another six (6) subjects who stayed on the program for onlysix weeks lost only 5.8 pounds per person for that period. e) The study had a total attrition of 17 subjects who dropped outfor various personal reasons. f) Of the 42 subjects who completed the study, 11 showedstatistically significant reductions in their cholesterol levels.Cholesterol levels increased moderately in nine cases andremained unaltered in 22 cases. g) Triglyceride levels dropped in 11 cases (statisticallysignificant) and were elevated moderately in six cases. In theremaining cases, the changes observed were not significant. h) Glucose levels were reduced significantly in eight cases,slightly elevated in two cases, and virtually unchanged in 30cases. i) It is reasonable to conclude that Citrin® plus ChromiumPicolinate in the doses used in this study and in combinationwith an appropriate diet and exercise plan can facilitate weightloss. SAFETY OF CITRIN® Muhammed Majeed, Ph.D. Citrin® has been tested and approved by manufacturers inthe United States and Europe as a safe and efficacious product.It is the only herbal supplement derived from Garcinia cambogiato have undergone human clinical trials in the U.S.A. Its potencyis guaranteed through state-of-the-art HPLC. The LD50 Value of (-)HCA is > 2000 mg/kg for intraperitonialadministration and > 4000 mg/kg for oral administration.Tolerance to anorexic, or appetite suppressant drugs, usuallydevelops over time. This is a common feature in Central NervousSystem (CNS)-stimulant drugs such as amphetamines and otherphenylethylamine derivatives. In contrast, tolerance toCitrin® in pre-clinical studies was minimal. In oneinvestigation, (-)-hydroxycitrate continued to lower the amountof food consumed through the 80-day duration of the trial. Otheranorexic agents such as Fenfluramine were effective for appetiteonly after the first few days, but not beyond that period oftime. (-)-Hydroxycitrate does not affect respiration, phosphorylation,or the citrate synthesis of the reconstituted mitochondria. Thiscompound lowers the rate of lipogenesis (or the rate at which thebody forms new fat) in a dose-dependent manner in the liver,adipose (fat) tissue, and the small intestine. However,(-)-hydroxycitrate neither penetrates the mitochondria noraffects normal energy production. As an herbal product containing standardized (-)HCA, Citrin®offers a safe alternative to appetite-suppressant substances thatoveractivate the sympathetic nervous system, produce only shortterm anorexia, and carry the risk of being addictive. Unlikepharmaceutical agents and most other nutrient and herbal productson the market, Citrin® decreases food intake, diminishesappetite, and accelerates the burning of fatty acids withoutadverse side effects. These features make Citrin® a viablechoice for efficaciously treating obesity and overweightness. WEIGHT CONTROL: A BARIATRICIAN’S POINT OF VIEW Anthony Conte, M.D. Why Do Some People Get Fat While Others Don’t? There is an increasing number of theories Ñ most ofthem speculative Ñ about weight gain and the manner inwhich calories are ingested and burned. We are all aware of themany non-obese people who overeat, especially consuming hugequantities of carbohydrates, for extended periods of time withoutgaining any weight. However, even in individuals who maintainstable weight, this pattern ultimately is costly to normalhealth. Given a long enough period of time, excessive intake ofcarbohydrates will lead to excess storage of body fat. Thisoccurs because over consumption of glucose-containing foodsincreases the body’s production of lipogenic, orfat-storing, enzymes such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Once thischemical action can be safely blocked without disrupting any ofthe body’s other normal processes, then most weight problemscan be brought under control. Simple refined sugars, including fructose which is often toutedas a natural sugar since it is found in fruit, are always aproblem for weight management. Indeed, there is growing evidencethat fructose stimulates lipogenesis, or fat storage, even morethan does glucose. White sugar is composed of two glucosemolecules joined together. Fructose is converted even morerapidly into glucose than is white, or refined sugar. Fructose,present in fruit juices, corn syrups, and many so-called"health food products," causes an unhealthy rise in thelevels of liver enzymes, insulin, and blood triglycerides. Physical activity is of course critical to proper weightmanagement. Metabolic rate, the ratio of lean to fatty body mass,and genetic factors (or individual heredity) in combination withphysical activity have bearing on how successful -- orunsuccessful body fat reduction will be. Equally important toweight management are the degree, duration, and timing ofovereating. When physical exercise is closely coupled with thetiming of excessive eating, then the negative consequences ofpotential weight gain are minimized. People who diet withoutexercising tend to lose mainly water and in some cases, muscletissue; but, individuals who exercise and eat a sensible andbalanced diet low in simple sugars are able to effectively shedexcess weight, and, most importantly, keep it off for sustainedperiods of time. I have used various Citrin®-based products to treat numerouscases of overweightness in my medical practice. I have foundunequivocally from the case studies I have followed and theclinical studies I have conducted that Citrin® is a safe andeffective natural alternative to allopathic drugs for promotingweight loss. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 Myths Versus Facts in Obesity: A Reality Check In my practice as a bariatrician, I often have to dispel mythsthat seem to persist in the face of growing scientific evidence.Frequently, I am asked recurrent questions relating to weightloss. These myths and questions come up so often from patientsthat I thought it worthwhile to present them here with what Ithink are realistic responses or counter-proposals. It is hopedthat the factual rebuttals to common myths, or misconceptions,about dieting and weight loss and the answers to common queriesabout this subject will assist the reader in choosing a weightmanagement program that is optimal for him or her. Common Myths About Losing Weight Myth: Prescription "diet pills"are bad for you. Fact: As is the case for all drugs, diet pillscan be beneficial if used with proper judgment and if monitoredby a trained medical professional. The selection of anappropriate medication, the dosage, and the duration of its useshould be monitored by a qualified physician who evaluates itsappropriateness on the basis of the patient’s degree ofexcess weight, overall health needs, eating patterns, andlifestyle. Myth: A diet pill makes you lose weight. Fact: Diet medication does not make a personlose weight. However, because it suppresses appetite, it may helpa person avoid cravings and eat less. A sensible eating strategythat is easy to "stick to" must consist of variety,moderation and balance. A diet is essentially a lifestylemodification -- a gradual change in eating habits thatincorporates the proper mix of proteins, fruits, vegetables,grains, and dairy products for optimal nutrition, lean body mass,and preventive medicine. Radical departures from normal eatinghabits, such as following a very low calorie diet or ingesting a"milkshake" diet as a replacement for every meal arenot sensible courses of action to follow. These practicesrepresent unnatural ways of eating, quickly leaving dietersbored, frustrated, and ready to sacrifice their will power. Myth: Fasting is the best way to loseweight. Fact: Fasting for more than four days withoutmedical supervision can damage kidney and liver functions andchange the chemical balance in the blood. Weight loss throughfasting is more apt to be retained because it results from a"crash diet" effect rather than from developingsensible eating habits. Myth: Calories do not count. Fact: Yes, Calories do count. Excess weightresults from eating, or taking in, more calories than a personexpends as energy in exercise and other daily physicalactivities. If a person uses up more calories than he takes in,he loses weight. However, not all calories are created equal, as shown in thefollowing table: Calorie Source Calories per Gram Carbohydrate .................. 4 Protein ............................ 4 Alcohol .......................... 7 Fat .................................. 9 Whenever possible, it is advisable to eat carbohydrates andproteins instead of fats. A full 98 percent of the caloriecontent of fat goes into storage as body fat, and only twopercent is used in digestion. In contrast, complex carbohydratesand proteins burn up 23 percent of their total calorie content inthe process of digestion. Myth: Everyone who loses weight gains it allback sooner or later. Fact: Long-term weight loss is possible, but itrequires that a person learn new ways of eating and living. Itmeans making a lifetime commitment to a safe and clinicallyeffective program (which, in some people, will involve carefulmonitoring by clinical staff). There is no "quick fix"to improving one’s health and appearance. In order to besuccessful, an individual must have perseverance and unstintingdetermination to reach and maintain his or her desired weight andshape. Only the dieter can make it happen. Ask a Bariatrician. The Questions I Hear Most Often Question #1: Are there any"secrets" to weight-loss and maintenance? Response #1: The answers are all too obvious -eat right, eat light, and exercise. Too often people adopt afrantic, "Lose It Now" mentality to weight loss as theyunrealistically seek instant results. But slimming down for goodis a gradual process. Slow weight loss occurs over months as aperson learns to adapt to the changes of a new and improvedlifestyle. Question #2: Only one in 12 people can loseweight and keep it off. Why do so many people fail? Response #2: The most common cause of failurestems from the daily ritual of stepping onto the scale, notseeing "instant" results, and becoming discouraged atthe lack of an immediate drop of that little pointer.Unfortunately, many people give up entirely because they miss themost important goals of weight loss. The true goal should be tolose excess fat while not sacrificing lean body mass. Healthyweight loss should improve all bodily functions and be free ofdehydration, or loss of body fluids. About 73 percent of people who design their own diets instead ofusing a formal program lose weight and keep it off. I believethis occurs because people on self-designed diets include many oftheir favorite foods (though perhaps in smaller amounts).Including foods they enjoy makes it easier for them to complywith their own self-regulated weight management programs. Inaddition, when individuals develop their own diet plans, theytend to set more modest, realistic goals for themselves that makeit easier to adhere to changes in eating habits. Question #3: Why do so many diets includeeight glasses of water a day? Response #3: A vital component of a weight lossdiet is an adequate intake of water. When the body burns 16ounces of fat, it generates about 22 ounces of water which mustbe flushed. The ideal way to do this is to drink more water. If aperson drinks less than 64 ounces of water, his body reacts tothis as a threat to survival, and therefore holds on to everydrop. Some of the unfortunate consequences of this are swellingin the feet, ankles, legs, and hands, as well as a slowing downin the rate at which weight drops. Question #4: Does exercise increaseappetite? Response #4: No. Studies have shown that thelevel of appetite is greatest in a sedentary person or when aperson exercises strenuously; but, the appetite fallsdramatically to a very low level when a person exercisesmoderately. As in designing one’s own diet, one’schoice of exercise ideally should be something enjoyable, fun,and realistic. A person is more likely to engage in an exerciseroutine on an ongoing basis if he likes it. The goal of exerciseshould not be strenuous, but rather regular, graded, vigorousphysical activity. By improving circulation, exercise stimulatesthe body while reducing both bodily and psychological stress.Exercise burns up excess calories, builds lean body tissue,lowers fat in the blood, and helps to stabilize blood sugar. Question #5: What about medically supervisedliquid diet programs (VLCD) that we hear about celebrities using? Response #5: These sorts of diets originallywere intended for people who are at least 40 pounds overweight(or more than 30 percent above their recommended weight). Suchdiets are potentially dangerous, however. They should beundertaken only with medical supervision and should not continuebeyond 12 weeks. The cost of these programs can be very high, averaging as much as$180 for every pound of weight loss. When one adds to this costthe fact that nearly all patients following these types of dietregained most of their weight, it suggests that they are notoptimal weight management plans. This finding again shows that aweight loss program must involve fundamental changes in eatinghabits with which an individual can live comfortably for the restof his or her life. Question #6: Are new drugs being developedfor the treatment of obesity? Response #6: Yes. As the medical professionamasses more knowledge of the body mechanisms involved inobesity, we gain insights into new approaches that may help toremedy this condition. The use of complementary drugs -- such asdigestive aids, lipolytic agents, metabolic correctors,thermogenic substances, and nutritional supplements -- inconjunction with medical care offer new and potentially rewardingtherapeutic regimens for obesity. Question #7: What is Orlistat? Why was itcalled a "dream drug?" Response #7: Orlistat (its chemical name istetrahydrolipstatin), developed by Hoffman-LaRoche Laboratoriesappears to have the same properties as an appetite suppressantand a lipid lowering agent as does (-)-hydroxycitrate, the activeingredient in Citrin®. This is not surprising in light ofthe fact that the early experimental work conducted on animalsgiven (-)-hydroxycitrate was done at Hoffman LaRoche Laboratoriesin the 1970s. However, because (-)-hydroxycitrate, as an extractof a natural product, could not be patented at that time,research on this molecule may have been halted. It is noteworthythat researchers at this major pharmaceutical company are nowresuming their studies on (-)-hydroxycitrate as a model for apatentable, "synthetic" pharmaceutical agent. In a recent study, 100 Americans who took Orlistat and followed alight diet lost an average of 11 pounds over a three monthperiod. This weight loss was nearly twice as much as the weightloss that occurred in the control group. Our own results with Citrin®, a commercial productcontaining (-)-hydroxycitrate, and chromium in clinicalevaluations have shown a similar weight loss in eight weeks. Sideeffects were not observed in subjects taking Citrin®,regardless of the medications they may have been taking at thesame time. An ambitious two-year study on Orlistat involving4,000 subjects in Europe and the United States is currentlyunderway. Since clinical trials must be conducted over a longperiod of time, it may be several years before Orlistat isapproved for sale in the United States. Moreover, if and when itdoes, it will be available by prescription only. In the interim,a safe and efficacious, all-natural product, Citrin®, whichmay be at least as effective as Orlistat for body fat reductionand weight loss, is currently on the market. Question #8: There seems to be manydifferent all-natural weight loss enhancers. How do I know whichcompanies offer genuine products? Response #8: Assessing the legitimacy andauthenticity of claims made about various products is an ongoingprocess. I suggest that the consumer carefully read labels,scrutinize the level of scientific assertions made by the companyand its researchers, and consult with a medically trainedphysician or health professional. An interested individual shouldnot be afraid to call or write to the manufacturer with hisquestions. An honest firm will be glad to answer questions andadmit any limitations or inconclusive findings about theirproducts. In addition, it is appropriate to request from amanufacturer copies of research studies evaluating the qualityand effects of the weight-loss product. References Lewis, Y.S. and Neelakantan, S., 1965.

Absorbit-ALL PLUS™ Konjac Glucomannan (Amorphophallus konjac) Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 Effect of Glucomannan in Obese Patients (A Clinical Study) David E. Walsh, Ph.D. Vazgen Yaghoubian, Ph.D. Research Department General Nutrition Corporation Fargo, North Dakota ABSTRACT Health problems common in the United States such as obesity,diverticular disease and heart attacks are practically unknown inparts of the world where more food fiber is eaten. It is wellknown that proper amounts of dietary fiber can aid in bowelregularity. Since dietary fiber is not assimilated by the body,it contributes no calories and can help a person lose weight andkeep it off once the desired weight is reached. Control ofobesity is extremely important since it has been linked to adultonset diabetes, high blood pressure, and other health problems.Also, certain dietary fibers have been shown to help reduce andalleviate high cholesterol in the blood. A double blind study compared glucomannan fiber supplementagainst a method placebo in obese patients. Patients were giveninstructions to use the supplement or placebo for weightreduction. Over a 4-week period a highly significant weight lossof 5.3 pounds occurred in 10 obese patients who supplementedtheir diet with glucomannan. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides,and LDL were lowered over an 8-week period when 3 gm/day ofglucomannan were taken. INTRODUCTION Glucomannan is a component of the Konjac root, a food used inJapan. For over 1000 years Konjac (Amorphophallus konjac) hasbeen cultivated and eaten in Japan and parts of China. Commonfoods such as sukiyaki use Konjac in the form of noodles. Otheruses for Konjac are as a food thickener and jelly. The main constituent of Konjac jelly is glucomannan whichaccounts for 10% of the total dry material. Purified glucomannanis prepared by washing. Starch, protein, and water-solublematerials are removed to yield 60-90% pure glucomannanpreparation. Glucomannan is a high molecular weight carbohydratethat chemically resembles cellulose. However, while celluloseconsists almost entirely of glucose molecules linked by beta b1-4 saccharide bonds, glucomannan consists of glucose and mannosemolecules linked by beta b 1-4 bonds. These small chemicaldifferences account for the unique physical properties ofglucomannan. Cellulose is insoluble and absorbs only 5 to 10times its weight in water, while glucomannan is soluble andabsorbs as much as 200 times its weight in water. Glucomannan when mixed with water forms a viscous solution. In a1-2% solution, glucomannan will have a viscosity of over 100,000centipoise. The viscosity of glucomannan increases slowly for amaximum viscosity at 5 hours. Consequently when used as a dietarysupplement, people are advised to take glucomannan from 1/2 hourup to 2 hours before meals with 8 ounces of water. This allowstime for water absorption, gel formation, and proper dispersion. Glucomannan acts as a dietary fiber to increase viscosity andmoisture content of the food bolis during digestion. The foodmixes with the viscous glucomannan to form a smooth, soft masswhich easily moves through the gastrointestinal tract. Sinceglucomannan forms a nondigestible coating around food particles,food is digested at a slower rate. The gel slows the action ofdigestive enzymes to release sugars and fats at an even rate.This effect is desirable in treating obesity and diabetesmellitus. The bulk-forming property of glucomannan helps fill the stomachto satisfy the appetite. Because digestion is slowed, large highsin blood glucose are avoided and normal blood sugar levels aremaintained after a meal. This aids in controlling overeating andhelps fight the "snack attacks" which occur when bloodglucose drops 2 hours after a meal. With glucomannan (and someother food fibers) gradual digestion "times release" ofsugar helps maintain sugar at normal levels without wide swings in blood levels. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 Japanese workers have had good results in treating diabetes withglucomannan. Sugar absorption was slowed and blood sugar levelswere reported stabilized when glucomannan was used in the dietsof noninsulin dependent diabetics. It is well known that certain dietary fibers absorb cholesterol,bile acid, and lipids. Glucomannan's gel-forming propertiespromote absorption of fats and reduce serum cholesterol andtriglycerides. Japanese researchers reported glucomannan hadhypocholesterolemic properties in rat feeding trials. In elderlyhumans significant decreases in serum cholesterol, triglycerides,and free fatty acids were reported when glucomannan was added tothe diet. Two-thirds of these elderly patients also reported thatglucomannan had anticonstipation properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the present study 20 patients (10 obese and 10 not obese)were given a glucomannan supplement and 20 (10 obese and 10 notobese) given a placebo. Strict adherence was given to doubleblind procedures. Neither patients nor dietitians who interviewedpatients were informed as to what the capsule contained. Eachpatient was given the same brand of Glucomannan capsules or aplacebo and was instructed to take 2 capsules 3 times per daywith 8 ounces of water 2 hours before meals. Each capsulecontained 500 mg of purified Glucomannan from Konjac root. The 10obese patients were informed that they were testing a weightreduction supplement. All patients were to eat their regularmeals. The supplement was intended to help curb appetite andenable them to eat less for weight loss. No special diet wasgiven. Blood samples were drawn at the beginning, at 4 weeks, and at theend of the 8 week test period. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides,high density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, and uricacid levels were determined. Patients were given physical examsto establish general health. Once a week each patient wasinterviewed by a dietitian, weighed, and blood pressuredetermined. WEIGHT LOSS Table 1, below, shows weight change data for 20 obesepatients: 10 who took glucomannan and 10 who were given a placebofor 4 weeks. All 10 glucomannan patients lost weight. The largestweight loss with glucomannan was patient E, a 180 pound femalewho lost 12 pounds. The least weight loss with glucomannan wasfor patient J, a 158 pound female who lost only 1.75 pounds in 4weeks. An average weight loss of 5.33 pounds in 4 weeks wasshown. Most of the glucomannan patients observed that they had afeeling of fullness and less than usual hunger. No reports ofdiarrhea, constipation, or other adverse effects were reported bythe glucomannan supplemented group. Weight changes for the placebo group were also reported in Table1. This group showed fluctuations in weight from a gain of 6.25pounds to a loss of 5 pounds in 4 weeks. An average insignificantweight loss of 0.35 pounds is shown for the placebo group. Withthe placebo most patients reported no feeling of fullness orother effect. In fact it was difficult to keep patients fromdropping out of the placebo group because they had seen little orno effect. By contrast, the glucomannan group were quiteenthusiastic and many asked if they could continue using thesupplement after the clinical trial was completed. CHOLESTEROL DATA Serum cholesterol analyses were done on a group of 18 patientsover an 8-week period. The group was selected to cover a range ofnormal to high (150-300 mg/dl). Figure 1 shows the average of 18patients who had taken glucomannan. This data showed decline incholesterol over an 8-week period from 210 to 200 mg/dl. Sincethe average patient had a low or normal cholesterol, littledecrease was expected. However, when 14 patients with moderate cholesterol of 200 mg/dlor more were studied, the average cholesterol showed asignificant decrease from 220 mg/dl to 190 mg/dl in 18 weeks(Figure 2). Even more dramatic was the decrease in cholesterolfor the 2 patients who had high cholesterol levels greater than250 mg/dl (Figure 3). These patients decreased from an average of270 mg/dl to 215 mg/dl after taking glucomannan for 8 weeks. The20 patients on the placebo increased slightly in cholesterol 2mg/dl for the same 4 and 8 week periods. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) DATA Low density lipoproteins (LDL) are associated with cholesterolin arteriosclerosis and are a risk factor in heart attacks. A lowlevel of serum LDL is desirable and is a measure of good health.Of 18 patients who used glucomannan, the average LDL decreasedsteadily over 8 weeks from 145 mg/dl to 130 mg/dl (Figure 4).Because the average LDL was within the normal range change wasexpected. However for the 4 patients with high LDL, a highlysignificant decrease in LDL was observed during an 8-week periodwhen glucomannan was used as a diet supplement (Figure 5). Theaverage LDL decreased from 190 mg/dl to 145 mg/dl by the end ofthe 8 week clinical test for the high LDL group. The 20 patientsusing the placebo showed no significant change in LDL over 8weeks. They dropped 4 mg the first week and gained 1 mg LDL ateight weeks. High density lipoproteins (HDL) did not change withglucomannans supplementation compared with the patients. However,the nature of HDL to LDL was significantly improved because LDLdecreased when the glucomannan was used. TRIGLYCERIDES DATA Serum triglycerides were determined for 18 patients over an8-week period. The presence of triglycerides in the blood is ameasure of the amount of calories provided by fats in the diet.High fat diets tend to elevate serum triglycerides. Certainweight loss diets also have shown high serum triglyceridesbecause body fat is being used as a predominant source ofcalories. In my experience serum triglycerides change very littlewith high proteins or fructose diets that I have tested in thepast. However, a significant change with glucomannan was notedover an 8-week period. The average for 18 patients showed a smalldecrease from 110 mg/dl in 8 weeks (Figure 6). However, 7patients who had elevated triglycerides showed a highlysignificant decrease in serum triglycerides from 170 mg/dl to 145mg/dl over an 8-week period (Figure 7). The placebo group had nosignificant change in triglyceride in 4-week (-1 mg at 4 weeks,+0.1 mg at 8 weeks). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A double blind clinical trial of glucomannan food fiber wasconducted. Two groups of 10 obese patients were given glucomannanor a placebo over a 4-week period. The results showed that theglucomannan supplemented group lost an average of 5.3 lbs/4weeks, while the placebo group showed no significant weight loss.No diet plan was given to either group. Patients were instructedto take 2 capsules 3 times per day with 8 ounces of water 2 hoursbefore meals. In other tests serum cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, andtriglycerides showed highly significant decreases when patientstook glucomannan over an 8-week period. In addition, constipationwas relieved, and no adverse reactions to glucomannan wereobserved. For the results of this double-blind clinical trial, it wasconcluded that glucomannan (3 gm/day) was beneficial as a foodfiber supplement. Glucomannan functions as an aid to weight lossin obese patients. Cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL serumlevels are significantly lowered in patients with elevated serumlipid levels. Moreover, glucomannan appeared to be a safe andhighly effective food fiber supplement. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 REFERENCES 1.

HYPOCHOLESTEROLEMIC ACTIVITY AND MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF KONJAC MANNAN Shuhachi Kiriyama, Akiko Enishi and Akira Yoshida ABSTRACT Effect of species, cultivation district and preparation on thehypocholesterolemic activity of crude konjac mannan (CKM) wasstudied when CKM was added at the 3% level to ahypercholesterolemic diet. Activity was correlated with themolecular weight and molecular shape or size of KM. The mostactive variety was CKM obtained from Shina-shu (Chinese species)harvested in Gumma Prefecture, followed by Zairai-shu (Domesticspecies) harvested in Saitama Prefecture and Zairai-shu harvestedin Fukushima Prefecture. Bitchu-shu, a variation of the domesticspecies, harvested in Gumma Prefecture exhibited no activity. Themolecular weight of Shina-shu was about 2 X 106 and that ofBitchu-shu, 7 X 105; the radii of gyration (RG) of these two KMmolecules which showed two extremes in activity were about 2300 Aand 1000 A, respectively. Other CKM samples tested ranged between9 - 12 X 105 in molecular weight and 1000 - 1300 A in RG. Theseresults suggest that molecular weight and shape or size of KM inaqueous solution are closely related to its hypocholesterolemicactivity. Tentatively, we have concluded that activity may berealized if molecular weight and RG of KM molecules are above 8 -9 X 105 and 1000 A, regardless of species, cultivation districtand preparation methods. INTRODUCTION The original habitat of Amorphophallus plants is thought to beSoutheast Asia. At the present, these plants grow in thetropical, sub-tropical and temperate zones of Asia includingJapan. However, a few species are cultivated only in Japanbecause edible "Konnyaky" is needed as a habitualfoodstuff of Japanese people. In other areas of Asia (China,Indonesia, Burma, Thailand and Indo-China) the plants grow wild.The tubers of Amorphophallus konjac contain a large amount of mannan (konjac mannan), which can be separated gravitationallyafter crushing the dried tuber slices from other components.Ohtsuki1 has shown that the tubers of Amorphophallus konjaccontain 20% of dry matter which yields about 64% of mannan and10.6% of starch. The total production of CKM in Japan isestimated at about 10,000 - 12,000 tons per year. CKM obtained bytraditional separation methods sometimes results in low molecularweight samples because enzymatic depolymerization may occurduring drying of tuber slices in the sun. KM with high molecularweight is obtained by homogenizing the tubers with an equal partof ethanol and by separating it gravitationally. CKM did not lose its original activity even after extensivepurification. CKM, partially purified (PPKM) and highly purified(HPKM) konjac mannan completely lost their plasma cholesteroldepressing activity when treated with cellulase. Moreover, thebeneficial effect of CKM, PPKM or HPKM supplemented to ahypercholesterolemic diet was also completely canceled by thedietary addition of cellulase. Therefore, various low molecularcontaminants in CKM do not appear to contribute to the activityof CKM. It became increasingly apparent that an active principlein CKM is KM itself, and that KM must be water soluble andmacromolecular in order to exhibit its hypocholesterolemiceffect. The hypocholesterolemic activity of CKM was completely eliminatedwhen it was irreversibly coagulated to a water insoluble form bymixing it with small amounts of milk of lime and when it washydrolyzed in 0.2 N HCl at 100ºC for 12 hours, neutralizedand then lyophilized.2 Therefore, we have suggested that theactive substance should be a main constituent, KM, retaining boththe water soluble and macromolecular property. A series of facts concerning the hypocholesterolemic activity ofKM suggests that there may be a close correlation betweenphysiological activity and molecular weight of KM. On the otherhand, the quality of edible "Konnyaku" has been knownto depend upon the species of Amorphophallus konjac, cultivationdistrict and preparation method of CKM from the tubers. Physicalproperties of the rigid gel produced from KM by mixing a weakalkaline solution are widely different depending on thesefactors. These facts also suggest that there are considerabledifferences in molecular weight and/or the shape of KM molecules. We compared the hypocholesterolemic activity of various CKMdiffering in origin and preparation method and attempted tocorrelate the physiological activity with molecular weight and/ormolecular shape of KM. MATERIALS AND METHODS Male rats of the Wistar strain weighing about 100 g were usedthroughout the experiment. After the animals were maintained on astock diet for 3 to 5 days, they were divided into groups of 5rats each and then fed test diets for 7 days. At the end of theexperimental period, blood was drawn by heart puncture withheparinized syringes under Nembutal anaesthesia. The liver wasrapidly excised and plasma and liver total cholesterol weredetermined by the method of Pearson and associates.3 The basal (normal) diet used was of the following composition:casein, 20%; corn oil 5%; salt mixture, 4%; vitamin mixturetriturated in lactose, 1%; choline chloride, 0.2%; and themixture of 1:1 pregelatinized corn starch and sucrose, 70.8%. Thehypocholesterolemic diet (control) was the basal dietsupplemented with 1% cholesterol and 0.25% sodium cholate. Testdiets were those in which each test CKM was added at the 3% levelto the control diet. The experiment was divided into threesimilar trials. The animals used in experiments 1 and 2 werepurchased on the same date, the latter experiment being startedwith a one-day delay after experiment 1. Experiment 3 wasinitiated 10 days after the end of experiment 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results obtained in the three experiments are summarizedin Table 1. In experiment 1, only Shina-shu (Gumma) significantlydecreased plasma cholesterol levels as compared with the controlgroup (127 mg/100 ml vs. 198 mg/100 ml). This 36% decrease inplasma cholesterol could not be attributed to the decrease infood intake because the animals fed Shina-shu consumedapproximately the same amount of diet (19.6 g/day) as the controlgroup (17.0 g/day). A clear parallelism between plasma and livercholesterol levels was also observed. In experiment 2, all samples showed significant plasmacholesterol depressing activity except Zairai-shu (Gumma).Zairai-shu harvested in Hiroshima Prefecture appeared most activeof all samples and resulted in a 32% decrease in plasmacholesterol from the controls. There was no significantdifference in food intake or body weight gain between rats fedthe control and Zairai-shu (Hiroshima) diets. Here again,parallelism between plasma and liver cholesterol levels is seen.Although there was no statistically different change between ratsfed Zairai-shu (Gumma) and the control diet in plasma cholesterollevels, this appears to be due to the large deviation in thevalues of the former. For example, the average plasma cholesterolvalue of the rats fed Zairai-shu (Nagano) was about the same (140mg/100 ml) as that of the animals eating Zairai-shu (Gumma) whichwas 139 mg/100 ml; and this was significantly lower than that ofthe control group. In experiment 3, only Zairai-shu (Fukushima) significantlydepressed plasma cholesterol level (143 mg/100 ml as compared tothe control value of 198 mg/100 ml). This decrease amounts to28%. Since the three experimental conditions differed slightlyfrom each other, the plasma cholesterol values obtained cannot bedirectly compared, and per cent decrease as compared with eachcontrol value would be a reasonable measure for relativecomparison. Accordingly, the order of activity is as follows:Shina-Shu (Gumma) > Zairai-shu (Hiroshima) > Zairai-shu(Fukushima). Konjac mannans in several samples tested were purified and theirmolecular weights and radii of gyration in aqueous solution weredetermined according to the procedure of Sugiyama and co-workers4using the light scattering method.5 As shown in Figure 1, themolecular weight of Shina-shu which was most hypocholesterolemicwas about 2 X 105 and its RG about 2000 A. In contrast, themolecular weight of Bitchu-shu (Gumma), which had no activity,was about 7 X 105, approximately 1/3 that of Shina-shu. It appears that molecular weight and/or spreading shape in theaqueous solution plays a significant role in physiologicalactivity of KM. Almost all other samples used ranged betweenthese 2 extremes: molecular weight, 9 - 12 X 105 and RG, about1000 - 14000 A. These delicate differences among ordinary KMsamples could not be distinguished by the present animalexperiments. Therefore, plasma cholesterol values of rats fedthese intermediate KM samples varied from each other depending onthe experiment regardless of their order of molecular weight andradius of gyration. As previously reported (2), it may bereasonable to assume from the fluidity of the cellulasehydrolysate of KM that its molecular weight is much smaller thanthat of intact KM and inactive as an hypocholesterolemic agent. From the present and previous results, it would appear that theactive principle in CKM is KM itself, hypocholesterolemicactivity of KM occurs when its molecular weight and RG are above8 - 8 X 105 and above 1000 A respectively, and when the watersoluble property is retained intact in KM.

EFFECT OF GLUCOMANNAN (KONJAC FIBER) ON GLUCOSE AND LIPID METABOLISM IN NORMAL AND DIABETIC SUBJECTS Kunihiro Doi, Masaaki Matsuura, Akira Kawara, RinzoUenoyama, and Shigeaki Baba RESULTS AS STATED IN THE CONCLUSION Recently, dietary fibers have been used successfully to allowthe use of lower dosages of insulin or hypoglycemic agents in thetreatment of diabetics. These fibers considered to increase theviscosity of the gastrointestinal contents, thus slowing gastricemptying and forming around the food a barrier that delays itsabsorption by the intestinal wall (Jenkins et al., 1978). Theirviscosity appears to be a major factor in eventually suppressing,through this mechanism, the postprandial rise of the bloodglucose level. Guar gum (galactomannan), since it was thought to be the mostviscous of the dietary fibers, was regarded as the most effectivein reducing hyperglycemia. However, our data show that theviscosity of glucomannan is far higher than that of any otherfibers. The suppression by glucomannan of the postprandial riseof glucose and insulin levels was more pronounced than that byguar gum when added to the glucose solution or test meal, andmost pronounced when glucomannan was mixed into the test meal. Although the amount of glucomannan used in thisexperiment was rather small, the results were good. Some of thereasons for this have yet to be clarified, but one factor is itsvery high viscosity. Moreover, its ability to absorbcarbohydrates, lipids and other high-calorie substances in thestomach and the small intestine is the greatest among all thedietary fibers. The serum levels of cholesterol and bile acids decreased whenglucomannan was used, but after 1 or 2 months, the serumcholesterol levels increased for a short time. One possibleexplanation of this phenomenon is that the enterohepaticcirculation of the bile acids and cholesterol was interrupted bythe absorption of these substances in the intestine byglucomannan, which was followed by a decrease in their serumlevels. As a homeostatic response, then, the production ofcholesterol in the liver may have increased for a short period. We did not observe the serum bile acid levels over a long period,but it is presumed that, as with cholesterol, they also increasedfor a while 2 or 3 months after glucomannan was taken, and thenfell again. Serum Cu++, Fe++, Na+, K+ and Cl- levels of 6 diabetics werefollowed, but no significant increase or decrease was observed. The postprandial blood glucose concentrations were lower when thesubjects were fed fiber-supplemented diets, and in some of them,also the body weight decreased. There were some complaints ofshort-lived side effects such as nausea and discomfort whenlarger doses of glucomannan were given. The effects of dietary fibers on glucose metabolism may be usefulin the control of the diet and of the drug dosage of diabetics,especially for non-insulin-dependent diabetics or obese subjects.Further study is necessary in order to discover the metabolic andphysiological effects of these viscous forms of dietary fiber.

Baba The Second Department of Internal Medicine Kobe University School of Medicine Kobe 650 Japan ABSTRACT Epidemiological observations suggested that diabetics,hyperlipidermia and coronary heart disease might be related todeficient fiber. Therefore much interest has been shown in thepossibility of treating diabetics with fiber-rich diets. We have been studying to treat diabetics with soluble fiber,Konjac mannan (glucomannan) which is prepared from tubers of theAmorphophallus plant. Konjac is a normal Japanese foodstuff whichis made of crude glucomannan and water. Glucomannan (3.9 g) wasadministered to normal or diabetic subjects with 50 g of glucoseor test meal to observe the changes of the post-prandial rise inblood glucose, plasma insulin and plasma bile acids. Thedecreased effect of glucomannan on the post-prandial rise ofblood glucose and insulin levels was more pronounced when it wasadded to the test meal than when added to the glucose solution.When diabetic patients supplemented ward diets with 7.8 g or 11.7g glucomannan daily, their mean of cholesterol and fasting bloodglucose fell significantly and insulin dosage were reduced insome patients. The endogenous bile acid load test by egg yolkshowed that gelled glucomannan absorbed bile acids in the smallintestine, and subsequently reduced in the elevation of serumbile acids after the load. Whether carbohydrate was likely tohave been malabsorbed, 25 g xylose load test was conducted.Addition of fiber to the test glucose solution reduced the 2-hoururinary excretion of xylose in all cases, however when collectionof the 2-hour urinary aliquots was continued over a 6-hourperiod, total amount of xylose excretion in urine was the samefor both glucomannan and control. Effect of Dietary Fiber (Guar Gum and Konnyaku Powder) on Diabetic Control K. Shima, M. Tabata, A. Tanaka and Y. Shimomura The Department of Geriatrics and Medicine Osaka University School of Medicine Osaka, 553 Japan ABSTRACT The study was undertaken to investigate whether dietary fiberis also effective in our diabetics whose dietary habits appear tobe different from those of Westerners. The effects of guar gumand konnyaku powder consisting mainly of galactomannan andglucomannan, respectively, on plasma glucose, IRI, glucagonimmunoreactivity (GI) and glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI)were investigated in normals and diabetics. Konnyaku powdertended to flatten the glucose tolerance curve more remarkablycompared to guar gum in diabetics. Changes in plasma IRI levelswere parallel to those in plasma glucose. There was no differencein patterns of plasma GI and GLI response between OGTT and OGTTwith dietary fiber. Five diabetics, 4 obese MOD and one IDDM,were given 18 g guar gum over a 4-week period while taking theirhome diet. All patients but one IDDM showed a body weight loss of1 to 3 kg during the period and their mean urinary glucoseexcretion fell by 80%. The long term effectiveness and adverse effects of the agentswere followed for more than one year in these and four newlyselected patients. The agent was similarily effective over thelong term period in all but two whose disease became refractoryto the regimen after several months but well controlled again byits readministration following discontinuation for a few weeks. One of them experienced the same episode twice. No remarkableadverse effects were seen during the long term period. Allpatients experienced alleviation of exaggerated postprandialhunger sensation while taking the agent. The dietary fiber isconsidered to represent a useful adjunct in the dietary therapyof diabetics, particularly in obese maturity-onset diabetics alsoin our country.

This compound acts by blocking fat absorptionfrom the stomach and intestines. In a study comparing weight loss with the biopolymer versusloss without, those ingesting L-112 lost nearly three times asmuch weight after 4 weeks. The weight reduction was alsoassociated with a decrease in blood pressure. The excellentresults of L-112 promise the L-112 Biopolymer to be an effectiveaide in weight loss for obese patients, with lower blood pressureresulting as an added benefit. INTRODUCTION Obesity, along with increased levels of blood lipids, has longbeen a problem for many. There is no doubt that obesity, alongwith smoking, lack of exercise, and poor dietary habits stronglycontributes to the increasing amount of cardiovascular diseaseand likewise to the amount of deaths related to cardiovasculardisease. Any safe substance with the capacity of lowering theserum lipids and additionally resulting in dramatic weight losswould, logically, be worthwhile to test clinically. The L-112 Biopolymer has been refined in laboratories from thefiber of crustaceans. The L-112 Biopolymer-Fat Blocker is a formof this indigestible fiber. It has been proven to have strong fatbinding properties. Previous clinical trials showed excellentresults in reducing the level of cholesterol and triglycerides inblood, while the HDL fraction of cholesterol increased. The focus of the study of the L-112 Biopolymer was to measurethe weight reducing effect of L-112 Biopolymer. Overweightpatients were asked to participate in a study where L-112Biopolymer - Fatblocker was compared to a placebo. The patientswere placed on a diet for 14 days. This diet was comprised of950-1000 Kcal per day and consisted of 40% fat, with a maximalcontent of saturated fatty acids, 40% carbohydrates and 20%protein. Fibers, however, were not included by the dietist. Thestudy was initially for 14 days, but was prolonged for those whowanted to continue. Weekly evaluations were made. During eachvisit, the patients were questioned as to whether they had stuckto their diet program, had taken the capsules as prescribed, andas to whether their had been any unexpected events since theirlast examination. Weight and blood pressure were also measured.During the study itself, patients ingested the L-112 capsulesshortly before the start of lunch and dinner (four 240mgcapsules). Those who tested the L-112 Biopolymer were all at least 15%overweight for their height. They were both male and female andranged in age from 25ÊtoÊ70. This Biopolyer was notadvised for women who were pregnant or nursing, nor for anyonewith a history of liver and/or renal insufficiency,gastrointestinal disturbances, those who abuse alcohol or and/ordrugs, those suffering a stroke within the previous 3 months orwho have had clinical symptoms suggesting impending stroke, andanyone with a history of allergy to sea food. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 RESULTS All patients were monitored for weight, blood pressure andadverse effects at each visit. While both groups reduced theirbody weight, the L-112 group lost measurably more weight (Figure1). Also, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreasedsignificantly for the L-112 users. The values for the L-112 groupwere much lower after both 2 and 4 weeks (see Figures 2a and 2b). ADVERSE EFFECTS At each visit patients were asked about events occurring sincetheir last visit. Twelve (12) patients complained of constipationover the first 2-3 days. However, seven of these patients werenot using L-112, but were merely following the diet. Two patientscomplained of slight nausea, one of these also complainedinitially of coldness. Two patients in the L-112 group complainedof headaches, but one of these two had been suffering headachesfor many years prior to undergoing the study. Constipation for 2-3 days was thought to be related to thediet itself. Most of the adverse effects disappeared within a fewdays. Some of the L-112 users reported a change of consistency ofthe feces, and of softer and smoother feces than usual,facilitating defecation. DIET There were only a few admitted deviations from the prescribeddiet based upon interviews with those ingesting the L-112. Someparticipants of the study found it difficult to adhere to thediet when dining out or when invited to dinner. Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 WHAT THE RESULTS SHOW This study was undertaken because the L-112 Biopolymer ÐFatblocker showed remarkable ability to bind fat in the stomachand intestines and to lower the serum lipids cholesterol,triglycerides while increasing the HDL cholesterol fraction. Theresearchers took additional measures to document the weight lossassociated with the consumption of L-112. The study showed that after just 2 weeks of treatment, almost100% better with L-112 than without. After 4 weeks L-112 is evenmore effective. The results are quite noteworthy. It is possiblethat with slightly higher doses of L-112, better results yetwould have been obtained. Naturally, with the minimal side effects of L-112 Biopolymer,the question also arises whether weight reduction can also beachieved with a minimum of diet and effort. For example, onlyavoiding excesses like alcohol, butter, cream, and heavy meals.Research suggests that L-112 could still be of help. Weight reduction over a short periods of time is usually notdifficult. The problem is maintaining this weight loss over time.Few people are able to change their eating and exercise habitspermanently. Another important finding was that excellent blood pressuredecreases occurred in the obese patients with hypertension, withthe decrease in diastolic BP especially notable. Those who hadnormal blood pressure maintained their blood pressure while usingL-112, while hypertensives reduced their pressure to normallevels. It is also interesting to note that more negative effects wereexperienced by dieters who did not use L-112. Users of the L-112preferred it to other methods of weight loss they had previouslytried, such as powder mixes. CONCLUSION Studies show the L-112 Biopolymer to be an effective aid inweight loss for those suffering from obesity. An additionalbeneficial effect was blood pressure reduction in obesehypertensives with the absence of notable side effects.

Alginic acid[9005-32-7], agar [9002-18-0], cellulose[9004-34-6], carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) [9004-32-4], chitin [1398-61-4], andlignin [9005-53-2] supplemented to a basic diet were fed adlibitum to Sprague Dawley rats for 4 wk. The inhibitory effect onobesity, evaluated by the Lee index, was in the order Na alginate> lignin > CMC > chitin > cellulose. Inhibition oflipid content in liver by dietary fiber was in the order: agar> CMC > cellulose > Naalginate > chitin > lignin.Glucose content in serum was significantly decreased by CMC,lignin, and Na alginate. Cholesterol [57-88-5] content in serumwas decreased for all dietary fiber sources except cellulose.Increased lipase [9001-62-1] activity in plasma was found inresponse to Na alginate and chitin, while cellulose, CMC, andlignin decreased lipase activity.

Super Formula Program TM How To Order Guaranteed Risk Free Or Call Us To Order At: 1-800-724-7546 “SLIM-Again™” Weight Loss Weapon #3 Called “SLIM-Again™” HCA (Hydroxycitrate), don’t try to pronounce it...just listen! HCA dramatically increases your body’s ability to convert the food you eat into glycogen (Glycogen is your body’s fuel for high energy activities.) And when you have lots of glycogen in your body it triggers a little signal to the brain telling it to suppress your appetite! The result? You won’t crave fattening foods. But, even if your “urges” get the better of HCA (Which may happen occasionally)...the amazing Absorbit-ALL™ and Absorbit-ALL PLUS™ act as a back-up and instantly thwarts fat from latching on to your body! And listen to this! Clinical studies show that HCA also reduces the amount of fat your body will absorb. While it controls your appetite, at the same time, it safely stimulates your metabolic rate and prevents lean muscle loss while the fat just melts away!

Western (allopathic) medicine has been the mainstream form of health care in this country for over 100 years. The passage of time has diluted the history of its ascendancy to its position of social, political and economic power. It was not until a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, within the past 3 years, that people (and especially the medical establishment) realized that allopathic medicine does not have a mortgage on health care in this country. This report stated that the American people are spending more money on so-called alternative medicines, mostly out of pocket, than they are on conventional medicines. Is it a wonder that the political/economic machine of the pharmaceutical/allopathic world has stepped into the Washington arena to stall health care reform? Complementary health care (I use the term "health care" instead of medicine, because medicine has come to imply the giving, or intrusion of, another substance or act) is a very broad spectrum of interventions, aids, counselling and approaches. These are forms of assistance that truly "compliment" the skills, advantages and undeniable brilliance of the emergent, radical interventions of allopathic medicine. Nobody should give up the right to the amazing skills of the micro-surgeon, the emergency room physician or the unsurpassed ability of an MRI or Cat-scan to discover, for instance, the source of bleeding in the brain. However, allopathic medicine generally does a poor job of assisting people with the every day needs of managing their physical, emotional and spiritual expression. Complementary health care providers tend to connect to their patient/clients on different levels. To be effective, they need to have an emotional and spiritual connection or understanding to truly comprehend the underlying needs of the person seeking assistance. Because complementary care providers often do not have the skills or knowledge to intervene in the emergency care of an individual, they tend to behave in a "preventative" way when dealing with health issues. If a person is already in a crisis of some form, complementary health care providers try to get to the original cause or source of the problem, rather than dealing with the signs and symptoms of the condition. There are some advantages to not having access to radical procedures to remedy problems that have been previously unattended. Vigilance and attention become the major tools of work, instead of reaction and suppression. What is a complementary health care provider? A good complementary practitioner is capable of making sound health care decisions based on understanding and knowledge of all of the components of a person's make-up. There should be consideration of not only the physical, but also the intellectual, emotional and spiritual aspects. Practitioners should have knowledge of a wide range of health care opportunities that may be appropriate for an individual, as well as have access and communication with others in the health care arena. Complementary health care practitioners should still have accountability for their actions and advice to ensure you that the practitioner is up to date with their education and has some type of peer review mechanism to ensure the safety of the public and the consumer. The definition listed here is not an exclusive one, but rather is advice concerning the criteria suggested if you plan to see a complementary health care practitioner. The list of possible people that you may consult is almost endless in an effort to achieve personal wholeness and satisfaction of all facets of your entire self. Your ethnic, cultural, and spiritual belief background must be accommodated if you are to gain truly satisfactory health care. The popular "arrival" of complementary health care is an interesting phenomenon and signals a huge change in the psyche of the population. The ongoing survival of complementary health care systems will be dependent on the will of the individual to take responsibility for his/her own health and a continuing demand for preventive rather than reactive health care measures. Merri Harris, D.C. is a holistic chiropractor and director of Healing Arts, a multi-disciplinary and multi-practitioner health care center located in Sebastopol. The center provides chiropractic, acupuncture, medical family practice, classical homeopathy, psychological counseling including EMDR, biofeedback, massage therapy and exercise and rehab. facilities. > Electromagnetic Fields and Your Immune System by Michael R. Neuert, MA, BSME As compared to conventional medicine, with its expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of symptoms, the value of a more holistic approach may be the recognition and treatment of the underlying conditions that allow "dis-ease" to exist. This article deals with one of the most controversial, yet perhaps most prevalent dis-ease conditions today: the bio-effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs). EMFs are a type of low-frequency radiation emitted from everything electrical around us: power lines, transformers, electrical wiring, computers, TVs, lights, clocks, appliances, etc. Recent studies have linked EMFs to increased leukemia, lymphoma, brain cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, miscarriage, birth defects, suicide, and most recently, Alzheimer's disease. This wide range of health problems may be due to EMFs' effects on the pineal gland, which is the master gland of the body, secreting hormones which control our circadian rhythms, and regulate important functions of the brain and all the other glands. Researchers have discovered that EMFs can suppress the pineal glands' secretion of melatonin, a hormone which controls our wake/sleep cycle, moods and task performance. Depressed melatonin levels are associated with mood changes, depression and psychiatric disorders. Melatonin also plays a critical cancer role, by increasing the phytotoxicity of the body's natural killer lymphocytes. Suppression of pineal gland function has been implicated in the etiology of breast, ovarian, prostate and melanoma cancers. Other studies have linked EMFs to decreased production of enzymes called "protein kinases" in human lymphocyte cells. This also indicates that EMFs can suppress the immune system. Now, if EMFs can suppress the immune system to the point where cancer rates double or triple, what other effects might a suppressed immune system have on our day-to-day health and well being? Do we experience more colds, more allergies, and more susceptibility to other seemingly unrelated medical problems? Are we less capable of handling chemical pollution from the environment? And today, considering the prevalence of immune related disorders---from allergies to AIDS---wouldn't it be wise to support (rather than suppress) the immune system? A natural, holistic approach to health would suggest reducing EMFs as much as reasonably possible. Researchers have raised important concerns about both the electric and the magnetic components of EMF emissions. However, the greater concern is focused on the magnetic part, because repeated studies have linked magnetic field levels to increased childhood cancer deaths. Most magnetic field exposures come from power lines and electrical wiring. Other common sources are waterbeds, electric blankets, computers, fluorescent lights, TVs, telephones, appliances and automobiles. To detect magnetic fields, you can buy or rent a gaussmeter, or have a professional perform an inspection. Reductions can be as simple as avoiding high exposure locations. Electrical wiring can be repaired to installed according to low-EMF methods. Specific sources can be shielded. Low emission computers, telephones and appliances are becoming available. Anecdotal evidence indicated that AC (alternating current) electric fields are often involved when people are knowingly "sensitive" to electricity. Often referred to as "wired and tired," they may experience conditions ranging from a rather vague discomfort or irritation. to headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. In my observation, almost everyone today experiences an underlying level of "wired and tired" due to electric fields. Some individuals handle it better, perhaps having a stronger resistance to life's stresses. Others are more sensitive, and in extreme cases may experience allergies, depression, environmental illness, or chronic fatigue syndrome. If you are the type of person who feels better when the electricity suddenly goes off during a power failure, or when walking out in the woods away from any electricity, you may be sensitive to electric fields. Most electric field exposures come from building wiring. The remainder come from cords, appliances and nearby power lines. Electric fields are easy to reduce. Walls and ceilings can be painted with special shielded paint. New electrical wiring can be installed using shielded materials. In many homes, certain electrical circuits can be switched off at night, reducing the fields during sleep. Michael R. Neuert has over 10 years experience with the EMF issue. He is the owner of Safe Home & Office Company, providing complete EMF reduction services and products for Northern California. Alternatives for Breast Cancer Treatment by Tara Treasurfield In February of 1994, I had a mammogram. I was surprised when the radiology department of my HMO flew into a panic. Hysterical hospital personnel left "URGENT!" messages for me at work. The calls terrified me, and I knew that if I did have cancer, fear could only make matters worse. The calls also enraged me, as they violated my privacy, so I fired my HMO. Under a new HMO, I selected a holistically-oriented physician. When the lump on my breast had grown alarmingly two months after the mammogram, he recommended a lump biopsy. It disturbed me that he offered no alternative. But he had all the right credentials and said that the procedure was simple and virtually painless, so I decided to trust his judgment. We selected a surgeon and I made an appointment. Things did not go well. Six hours after the surgery, I was in tremendous pain. The incision had filled with blood, causing a hematoma. A few days after the biopsy, the surgeon told me over the telephone that the biopsy revealed the presence of cancer. He recommended more surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. He also told me that there was no way to relieve the pain from the hematoma, and guessed correctly that it would last for several months. He was actually surprised that all this bad news upset me, so I fired him. My physician tentatively recommended more surgery, combined with radiation. This time, I decided not to follow his advice. I felt as though my nightmares, of which there were many, had overflowed into waking life. My holistic physician, two surgeons, an acupuncturist and herbalist, my friends, casual acquaintances, and my family were unanimous in the opinion that surgery, radiation and chemotherapy were my only options. At one point, I seriously considered a mastectomy. Then in a dream, I saw the dark figure of a human form with little bits and pieces of its flesh lopped away. Awakening from this dream, I realized that if cutting, burning or poisoning my body were the only ways to deal with my predicament, then life just may not be worth living. I was shocked to discover that death was beginning to look appealing, and this discovery woke me up. Convinced that there must me another way, I arranged to visit a friend of 30 years who now lives in Ukiah, California. After a few hours with her, I felt like ME again, instead of a cancerous breast. She inspired me to hope, laugh, and choose to live. She reminded me that there really are alternative to conventional western medicine. Soon after that, I told a new friend about my condition and she invited me to a meeting of the Gerson network. There are people follow the Gerson therapy that were diagnosed as "terminal" as much as 30 years ago. Other approaches work, too. One of my business contacts in Napa, California was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 6 months to live. He quit his job, and spent what he thought were to be the last 6 months of his life helping his wife open an antique store. A year later, he was still alive, got a job, and became deeply involved in his work. That was 14 years ago! After hearing the stories of these wonderful people and realizing that my life may not be over after all, I shared my excitement with my physician. He responded that none of the options I was so excited about really works, so I fired him. Two months later, I dropped my insurance, both because I could no longer afford it, and because it was of no further use to me. Currently, I am treating my condition with a modified Gerson therapy, combined with herbal supplements and mental training. 1) Deal with the Basics Don't take the chance of adding more chemicals and toxins to your body. Eat only organic foods. If you eat flesh and/or dairy products, make sure they are free of antibiotics and growth hormones. Drink only filtered or distilled water. Store food and water in glass, not plastic. Use only non-toxic household cleansers and pest control products, and cosmetics that are free of chemicals. You can do this, with the help of your local natural foods market. 2) Be Honest, Be Selfish For every relationship, encounter, TV or radio program, piece of music, situation, thought, and feeling, pose the question, "Is this contributing to my healing?" If the answer is no, let it go. 3) Transform Fear and Think Positive Max Gerson wrote, "More people die of fear than of cancer." Dr. Bernie Siegel also speaks often and eloquently of the devastating effects of fear. When fears assail you, use whatever method you can to move quickly to a place of peace and confidence. Turn to friends or family for comfort. Trust that God, or Goddess, or the Higher Power, has everything under control. Read, read, read, and listen to inspirational audiotapes. Anything by Louise Hay, Dr. Bernie Siegel and Norman Vincent Peale, and Teach Only Love, by Gerald Jampolsky and Wellness Workbook by Travis and Ryan. Be aware of your dreams as well. Dream imagery reflects our deepest beliefs, and we tend to get what we deeply believe. If you have negative dream imagery, take the time to change it through writing, artwork or visualization. 4) Establish a Support System Comparing notes with those who face similar challenges can help you avoid their mistakes and reassure you when your "alarming symptoms" are actually a healing response. The more honest and open you are with friends and family members, the more they will be able to help you. I knew that I had good friends, but until I shared this challenge with them, I had no idea how good they really were. Someone wrote, "We are all dying. It's just that some of us are dying faster than others." I don't know if the treatment program I am following will allow me to live longer or cause me to die sooner. Of course I want to live, but for me, that is not the most important point. That's hard for many of the people who care about me to understand. But more than anything else, I want to deepen my trust in process---the kind of trust that's reflected in a line from Desiderata: �"�and whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should." I am only one cell in the body of Gaia, and I don't know how I figure in the overall plan. I do know that the dis-ease in my body has volumes to teach me about believing in myself, claiming my power and authority, looking terror squarely in the face, and relating fully to other people. That doesn't mean that I want to keep this dis-ease around. I intend to get rid of it, by listening closely to what it's telling me about my life--and changing. If I can pull that off, whether I live to be only 51, or reach 85 or 90, won't matter so much. At least I will have lived.

The ongoing survival of complementary health care systems will be dependent on the will of the individual to take responsibility for his/her own health and a continuing demand for preventive rather than reactive health care measures.

Neuert, MA, BSME As compared to conventional medicine, with its expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of symptoms, the value of a more holistic approach may be the recognition and treatment of the underlying conditions that allow "dis-ease" to exist. This article deals with one of the most controversial, yet perhaps most prevalent dis-ease conditions today: the bio-effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs). EMFs are a type of low-frequency radiation emitted from everything electrical around us: power lines, transformers, electrical wiring, computers, TVs, lights, clocks, appliances, etc. Recent studies have linked EMFs to increased leukemia, lymphoma, brain cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, miscarriage, birth defects, suicide, and most recently, Alzheimer's disease. This wide range of health problems may be due to EMFs' effects on the pineal gland, which is the master gland of the body, secreting hormones which control our circadian rhythms, and regulate important functions of the brain and all the other glands. Researchers have discovered that EMFs can suppress the pineal glands' secretion of melatonin, a hormone which controls our wake/sleep cycle, moods and task performance. Depressed melatonin levels are associated with mood changes, depression and psychiatric disorders. Melatonin also plays a critical cancer role, by increasing the phytotoxicity of the body's natural killer lymphocytes. Suppression of pineal gland function has been implicated in the etiology of breast, ovarian, prostate and melanoma cancers. Other studies have linked EMFs to decreased production of enzymes called "protein kinases" in human lymphocyte cells. This also indicates that EMFs can suppress the immune system. Now, if EMFs can suppress the immune system to the point where cancer rates double or triple, what other effects might a suppressed immune system have on our day-to-day health and well being? Do we experience more colds, more allergies, and more susceptibility to other seemingly unrelated medical problems? Are we less capable of handling chemical pollution from the environment? And today, considering the prevalence of immune related disorders---from allergies to AIDS---wouldn't it be wise to support (rather than suppress) the immune system? A natural, holistic approach to health would suggest reducing EMFs as much as reasonably possible. Researchers have raised important concerns about both the electric and the magnetic components of EMF emissions. However, the greater concern is focused on the magnetic part, because repeated studies have linked magnetic field levels to increased childhood cancer deaths. Most magnetic field exposures come from power lines and electrical wiring. Other common sources are waterbeds, electric blankets, computers, fluorescent lights, TVs, telephones, appliances and automobiles. To detect magnetic fields, you can buy or rent a gaussmeter, or have a professional perform an inspection. Reductions can be as simple as avoiding high exposure locations. Electrical wiring can be repaired to installed according to low-EMF methods. Specific sources can be shielded. Low emission computers, telephones and appliances are becoming available. Anecdotal evidence indicated that AC (alternating current) electric fields are often involved when people are knowingly "sensitive" to electricity. Often referred to as "wired and tired," they may experience conditions ranging from a rather vague discomfort or irritation. to headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. In my observation, almost everyone today experiences an underlying level of "wired and tired" due to electric fields. Some individuals handle it better, perhaps having a stronger resistance to life's stresses. Others are more sensitive, and in extreme cases may experience allergies, depression, environmental illness, or chronic fatigue syndrome. If you are the type of person who feels better when the electricity suddenly goes off during a power failure, or when walking out in the woods away from any electricity, you may be sensitive to electric fields. Most electric field exposures come from building wiring. The remainder come from cords, appliances and nearby power lines. Electric fields are easy to reduce. Walls and ceilings can be painted with special shielded paint. New electrical wiring can be installed using shielded materials. In many homes, certain electrical circuits can be switched off at night, reducing the fields during sleep. Michael R. Neuert has over 10 years experience with the EMF issue. He is the owner of Safe Home & Office Company, providing complete EMF reduction services and products for Northern California. Alternatives for Breast Cancer Treatment by Tara Treasurfield In February of 1994, I had a mammogram. I was surprised when the radiology department of my HMO flew into a panic. Hysterical hospital personnel left "URGENT!" messages for me at work. The calls terrified me, and I knew that if I did have cancer, fear could only make matters worse. The calls also enraged me, as they violated my privacy, so I fired my HMO. Under a new HMO, I selected a holistically-oriented physician. When the lump on my breast had grown alarmingly two months after the mammogram, he recommended a lump biopsy. It disturbed me that he offered no alternative. But he had all the right credentials and said that the procedure was simple and virtually painless, so I decided to trust his judgment. We selected a surgeon and I made an appointment. Things did not go well. Six hours after the surgery, I was in tremendous pain. The incision had filled with blood, causing a hematoma. A few days after the biopsy, the surgeon told me over the telephone that the biopsy revealed the presence of cancer. He recommended more surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. He also told me that there was no way to relieve the pain from the hematoma, and guessed correctly that it would last for several months. He was actually surprised that all this bad news upset me, so I fired him. My physician tentatively recommended more surgery, combined with radiation. This time, I decided not to follow his advice. I felt as though my nightmares, of which there were many, had overflowed into waking life. My holistic physician, two surgeons, an acupuncturist and herbalist, my friends, casual acquaintances, and my family were unanimous in the opinion that surgery, radiation and chemotherapy were my only options. At one point, I seriously considered a mastectomy. Then in a dream, I saw the dark figure of a human form with little bits and pieces of its flesh lopped away. Awakening from this dream, I realized that if cutting, burning or poisoning my body were the only ways to deal with my predicament, then life just may not be worth living. I was shocked to discover that death was beginning to look appealing, and this discovery woke me up. Convinced that there must me another way, I arranged to visit a friend of 30 years who now lives in Ukiah, California. After a few hours with her, I felt like ME again, instead of a cancerous breast. She inspired me to hope, laugh, and choose to live. She reminded me that there really are alternative to conventional western medicine. Soon after that, I told a new friend about my condition and she invited me to a meeting of the Gerson network. There are people follow the Gerson therapy that were diagnosed as "terminal" as much as 30 years ago. Other approaches work, too. One of my business contacts in Napa, California was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 6 months to live. He quit his job, and spent what he thought were to be the last 6 months of his life helping his wife open an antique store. A year later, he was still alive, got a job, and became deeply involved in his work. That was 14 years ago! After hearing the stories of these wonderful people and realizing that my life may not be over after all, I shared my excitement with my physician. He responded that none of the options I was so excited about really works, so I fired him. Two months later, I dropped my insurance, both because I could no longer afford it, and because it was of no further use to me. Currently, I am treating my condition with a modified Gerson therapy, combined with herbal supplements and mental training. 1) Deal with the Basics Don't take the chance of adding more chemicals and toxins to your body. Eat only organic foods. If you eat flesh and/or dairy products, make sure they are free of antibiotics and growth hormones. Drink only filtered or distilled water. Store food and water in glass, not plastic. Use only non-toxic household cleansers and pest control products, and cosmetics that are free of chemicals. You can do this, with the help of your local natural foods market. 2) Be Honest, Be Selfish For every relationship, encounter, TV or radio program, piece of music, situation, thought, and feeling, pose the question, "Is this contributing to my healing?" If the answer is no, let it go. 3) Transform Fear and Think Positive Max Gerson wrote, "More people die of fear than of cancer." Dr. Bernie Siegel also speaks often and eloquently of the devastating effects of fear. When fears assail you, use whatever method you can to move quickly to a place of peace and confidence. Turn to friends or family for comfort. Trust that God, or Goddess, or the Higher Power, has everything under control. Read, read, read, and listen to inspirational audiotapes. Anything by Louise Hay, Dr. Bernie Siegel and Norman Vincent Peale, and Teach Only Love, by Gerald Jampolsky and Wellness Workbook by Travis and Ryan. Be aware of your dreams as well. Dream imagery reflects our deepest beliefs, and we tend to get what we deeply believe. If you have negative dream imagery, take the time to change it through writing, artwork or visualization. 4) Establish a Support System Comparing notes with those who face similar challenges can help you avoid their mistakes and reassure you when your "alarming symptoms" are actually a healing response. The more honest and open you are with friends and family members, the more they will be able to help you. I knew that I had good friends, but until I shared this challenge with them, I had no idea how good they really were. Someone wrote, "We are all dying. It's just that some of us are dying faster than others." I don't know if the treatment program I am following will allow me to live longer or cause me to die sooner. Of course I want to live, but for me, that is not the most important point. That's hard for many of the people who care about me to understand. But more than anything else, I want to deepen my trust in process---the kind of trust that's reflected in a line from Desiderata: �"�and whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should." I am only one cell in the body of Gaia, and I don't know how I figure in the overall plan. I do know that the dis-ease in my body has volumes to teach me about believing in myself, claiming my power and authority, looking terror squarely in the face, and relating fully to other people. That doesn't mean that I want to keep this dis-ease around. I intend to get rid of it, by listening closely to what it's telling me about my life--and changing. If I can pull that off, whether I live to be only 51, or reach 85 or 90, won't matter so much. At least I will have lived.

A New Understanding of Alternative Medicine Compiled by the Burton Goldberg Group Excerpted with permission from Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide "The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease." ---Thomas Edison In the face of an increasingly inadequate system of conventional medicine, a growing number of people are turning to alternative medicine to address their needs. The general public is starting to recognize the effectiveness of alternative medicine's approach to health, which blends body and mind, science and experience, and traditional and cross-cultural avenues of diagnosis and treatment. In fact, a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that over one-third of those surveyed chose alternative medicine over conventional methods, because of the medical establishment's emphasis on diagnostic testing and treatment with drugs without focusing on the patient as a whole. It is obvious that what was once considered a "fringe" interest is now on its way to becoming the primary medical approach of the next millennium. The Crisis in Modern Medicine It is no secret that our contemporary United States medical system is in a state of terrible disarray. Though conventional medicine excels in the management of medical emergencies, certain bacterial infections, trauma care, and many, often heroically complex surgical techniques, it seems to have failed miserably in the areas of disease prevention and the management of the myriad new and chronic illnesses presently filling our hospitals and physicians' offices. In addition, as a nation we pay more for our medical care and accomplish less than most other nations of comparable living standards, while health care costs continue to spiral out of control. Treatment of chronic disease currently accounts for 85% of the national health care bill. This state of affairs is due to the fact that we spend almost nothing to treat the causes of chronic disease before major illness develops, according to a report from the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. "We wait for it [illness] to develop and then spend huge sums on heroic measures, even then ignoring the underlying lifestyle-related causes. This is the equivalent of waiting for a leaky roof to destroy the infrastructure of a house and then repairing the damage without fixing the leak. This is naturally expensive and ineffective." Perhaps the greatest evidence of the depth of the crisis is that we have come to accept such levels of chronic disease as normal, despite evidence that much of it is preventable. [Former] Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, in his 1988 Report on Nutrition and Health, points out that "dietary imbalances" are the leading preventable contributors of premature death in the U.S. and recommends the expansion of nutrition and lifestyle modification education for all health care professionals. This is borne out by the Centers for Disease Control, which state that 54% of heart disease, 37% of cancer, 50% of cerebrovascular disease, and 49% of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is preventable through lifestyle modification. The changes that are necessary, however, will not be implemented as long as physicians earn their living and win renown primarily by delivering rescue medicine (interventions that simply treat symptoms), since it is in this area and not prevention that they benefit most. If the U.S. is to be saved from catastrophic health care costs, it is time to take a good look at the wisdom and cost-effectiveness of alternative medicine. Doctors are confronted daily with patients suffering from illnesses for which conventional medicine offers only superficial treatment of symptoms. The magic of antibiotics is vanishing as a host of resistant infections emerge; diseases such as AIDS and chronic fatigue syndrome have shown us clearly that our present treatments are simply not effective and hint at new health problems which may lie ahead. Roots of the Crisis The underlying concepts of alternative medicine are not new. They represent a return to the principles that have been part of human understanding of health and disease for thousands of years. Over the centuries, medical wisdom evolved within a framework which linked health to a state of harmony or balance, and disease to a state of disharmony or imbalance, and took into account the factors that contributed to both. "The genius of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, was not in the drugs he used or his diagnostic skills," points out Dr. John R. Lee, M.D. of Sebastopol, California, "but in his insight that the elements which were needed to produce and maintain health were natural, and that they included hygiene, a calm balanced mental state, proper diet, a sound work and home environment, and physical conditioning. In addition, he recognized the life forces that pervade all of nature, and which have multiple expressions---some known, some theorized, and many unknown. He taught that health depended upon living in harmony with these forces." Recognition of these life forces is also vital to Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine from India. A Dangerous Detour In the mid-nineteenth century, following the discovery of disease-causing microbes, a departure from this philosophy of health occurred due to rival theories concerning the cause of disease. One theory was that infecting microbes called germs (viruses, bacteria and fungi) were the cause of illness. The opposing theory maintained that these microbes only became infectious if conditions inside the body were right for them. According to this theory, by keeping the internal environment of the body healthy, these potential agents of infection will remain dormant. When the germ theory of disease became dominant, the birth of contemporary medicine, with its emphasis on infectious causes of diseases rather than physiologic balance or harmony, occurred. This provided medical science with the opportunity to greatly expand its role in the treatment of illness. This was followed by the rapid development of microscopy, bacterial cultures, vaccines, x-ray, and in the 1930s the discovery of antibacterial drugs such as penicillin and sulfa drugs. However, the more that medical science embraced the germ theory of disease, the more it also superseded the individual's role in his or her own health. The Purpose of Medicine: War or Repair? The thrust of 20th century medicine can be described by the metaphor of war. Disease is considered an invasion by an enemy and treatment is aimed at developing "magic bullets" in the form of drugs and vaccines to eliminate that enemy. We have seen, for example, a failed "war on cancer," a proliferation of antibiotics, and a growing number of surgical procedures, cell-killing radiation treatments, and chemical medications (such as chemotherapy), all of which do harm to the body, in one form or another, in their attempts to restore health. Lost in this approach is the concept of repairing the imbalances which allow the illnesses to occur in the first place. Medical science has become one-sided in its focus, increasingly losing sight of the whole person in its attempt to treat the body's individual parts. Because the emphasis of conventional medicine remains upon war and not repair, it has led to the organization of medical schools with their various departments, such as cardiology, neurology, dermatology, orthopedics, psychiatry. This forces students to focus their study on one organ system at a time, as if each bodily organ functioned independently of all the others. This diverts attention away from the intrinsic interrelatedness of all parts of our body and the complex dynamism of life forces. It's no wonder that our "modern" doctors understand so little of holistic concepts of health. Why Are We Ill? Health is far more than the absence of disease. When we are healthy all our bodily systems and functions are harmoniously balanced and integrated with each other, and we are also in balance with our environment. In this state of equilibrium our defense mechanisms and our immune system can efficiently handle most of the hazards that life presents, whether these are pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms, toxic substances, or stress factors of various kinds. Foundations of Health According to Dr. Leon Chaitow, N.D., D.O. of London, England, positive health depends upon three factors, which are interconnected. The first of these is the body's structural system, including all of the muscles, bones, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels and organs and their functions. The second factor is the body's biochemical process, which involve the absorption and utilization of nutrients, and the elimination of wastes, along with the complicated biochemical relationships which are the key to cellular function and health. The third factor comprises the mind and emotions, as well as the spiritual dimension of each person. "When there is a balanced, energetic interplay between these three components we have health," Dr. Chaitow says. "But when imbalances exist within any of these factors, or in their relationships with each other, ill-health occurs. Homeostasis In a state of health, if we cut ourselves, we heal. If we are bruised, strained, or suffer a broken bone, healing starts immediately. If we are exposed to infection our immune system deals with it. These examples are illustrations of the body's natural tendency towards repairing itself. This tendency is known as homeostasis, the maintenance of the body's internal organs and defenses to compensate for external health hazards. When homeostasis is called into play to handle a "crisis," its activity is usually experienced as "symptoms." For example, when you exposed to an infection your body will mount an aggressive defensive response which might result in fever. Or, should you injure yourself, the healing process which starts immediately might involve inflammation and swelling of the traumatized area. In other words, under normal conditions, the body will attempt to heal itself without help, and the symptoms produced will indicate what sort of healing process is going on. Unfortunately, many people, including all to many physicians, rather than respecting these homeostatic processes and simply waiting for them to finish their tasks, will actively try to suppress the symptoms of self-repair, whether this be a raised temperature or inflammation in an injured area. When this occurs, we are in effect saying that we know more than our body's innate intelligence about what is good for it. In order to maintain good health, therefore, it is important to recognize that many symptoms are actually evidence that healing is underway, and that, unless they are actually unbearable or dangerous, the symptoms should be left alone so that the repair processes can be completed. The Return to Health The vast majority of illnesses are self-limiting, meaning that they get better all on their own. Alternative medicine recognizes this fact, realizing that health will usually arise spontaneously when the conditions for health exist. Therefore, once you are ill, getting healthy again requires the very same inputs that were needed to keep you healthy in the first place. This may seem obvious but it's a message worth restating. As Dr. Chaitow says, "To regain health once it has been lost we need to begin to reverse some, and ideally all, of those processes which may be negatively impacting us, and over which we have some degree of control. This includes taking responsibility for stopping those lifestyle choices which we know are harmful, whether this be smoking, excessive alcohol intake, or using drugs. In addition, we need to start to positively address the real needs that such behavior masks." Depending on the nature of our health problems, this might involve starting to eat more nutritiously, sleeping and exercising in a more regular and balanced way, and making sure of receiving reasonable exposure to fresh air and sunlight. It may also include hygienic considerations, detoxifying and cleansing our bodies, addressing any structural or mechanical imbalances, as well as learning how to properly cope with stress, and deal with our mental and emotional needs. "That sounds like a vast prescription," Dr. Chaitow says. "However, even if only some of it can be addressed, such as diet and relaxation, a remarkable phenomenon occurs as homeostasis begins to function more efficiently and health begins to return." Our bodies are not designed to become ill, they are designed to heal and become healthy. The return to health is a road which each person must walk according to his or her own unique individuality. It is also a road that needs to address one's entire being, taking into account one's mental, emotional and physical aspects, as well as the structural, biochemical and energetic components that shape each of us. It is precisely because alternative medicine honors and understands these concepts that it is now positioned to become a valuable and necessary pathway for meeting the medical crisis we, as a planet, are currently facing. Burton Goldberg is a nationally-known advocate of alternative medicine. His introduction to the field began through an attempt to help resolve the health crisis of a close friend. This incident sparked an 18 year quest which took him to clinics and conferences around the world; an endeavor which has culminated with the publication of Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide, a 4-year, two million dollar project that assembes the knowledge and experience of nearly 400 hundred leading physicians and scientists in the alternative medical community. This book is available at bookstores and health food stores everywhere. Living Well: A Guide to Anti-Aging by Dr. Earl Mindell Excerpted with permission from Earl Mindell's Anti-Aging Bible Of all the spectacular advances in medicine, science, and technology that have occurred during the past century, the ones that have had the most profound impact on our lives are those that have increased human life span. In 1900, the average life expectancy for an American citizen was 47 years of age. Today, as we approach the dawn of a new century, the average life span has increased by more than 50% to 76 years. The fastest growing segment of the U.S. population consists of men and women aged 65 and older, a group referred to by gerontologists as the "old old." The number of octogenarians among us continues to grow, and some scientists say that humans may routinely achieve a life span of about 115 years; still others contend that biological engineering will extend our life span to 150 years. A few scientists insist that humans could live to be as old as 400 years! The increase in life span that we have experienced during this century is primarily due to improved sanitation, the elimination of many lethal childhood diseases through vaccinations, and other medical advances such as the development of antibiotics. Rare today, death from infection during childbirth was a leading cause of mortality among women at the turn of the century. Thanks to penicillin and its "wonder drug" offspring, bacterial infections such as pneumonia and strep are no longer life threatening. Members of the medical establishment readily acknowledge that although we have managed to extend the length of life, in many cases we have done little to improve the quality of life. A recent editorial in a medical magazine lamented the fact that "the ratio of active life to disabled or functionally compromised life has not increased and may actually have diminished during the last quarter of a century" (Patient Care, February, 1994). In other words, people may be living longer, but they're not living better. Despite the increase in life span, the perception of aging as a depressing downward spiral of growing wrinkled, growing senile, growing ill, and growing old persists. Indeed, for many of today's elderly, growing older is synonymous with illness. About half of all people over 65 are taking multiple medications for a wide variety of ailments. The average older person takes 12 doses of medication daily! For many older people, life is punctuated by visits to the doctor and the hospital. This does not have to be the case. Sadly, and ironically, too many people suffer from ailments that are easily prevented or controlled through diet and lifestyle. According to the National Cancer Institute, as many as 35% of all cancers may be due to poor diet. Experts estimate that as many as 50% of all cases of heart disease might be averted by changes in diet and lifestyle, which themselves would greatly enhance both the quantity and quality of life. Until recently, there was a fatalistic attitude about aging that was shared by both experts and lay people alike. They believed that there was little they could do to prevent the ravages of aging. Today we know better. There is strong evidence that the downward spiral is not inevitable. For one thing, although they are still in the minority, there is a growing population of "old old" people who are aging well, and who have managed to stay active and healthy. We see them on tennis courts, in adult education classes, in the gym, and sometimes still on the job. There is a growing body of research that suggest that with appropriate and timely intervention the downward spiral associated with aging need not happen. Researchers throughout the world are finding new and exciting ways to maintain health and vitality well into old age and innovative ways to prevent some of the common ailments associated with aging. Scientists all over the U.S. are engaged in research that has generated important information on why and how we age. Here are some of their fascinating findings: *Vitamins and supplements (antioxidants) may help to protect the body against compounds that may speed up the aging process. *A handful of foods and supplements may substantially reduce the risk of developing cataracts and macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness among the elderly. *An ancient herb and other supplements may help to prevent memory loss and keep us smart and sharp. *Vitamins and supplements may help to rejuvenate a "tired" immune system. *Contrary to the popular belief that our muscles grow weaker as we age, it's actually possible, with the right kind of exercise, to build muscle and maintain strength well into our nineties and beyond. *A supplement widely used in Japan as a treatment for heart disease (and available at natural food stores in the U.S.) may help to keep an aging heart pumping as strong as a younger one. *Prostate problems (common among men over 50) may be prevented or reversed by a combination of diet and supplements. *The right combination of herbs and supplements can relieve the discomfort of menopause for many women. Here is more good news: these tools are readily available to anyone who wants to use them. With few exceptions, the vitamins, supplements, herbs and foodstuffs in the anti-aging arsenal are available in pharmacies and grocery and health food stores everywhere. I want to stress that the techniques I have described are not a fountain of youth, although they can help us retain our youthfulness. An 80 year old who follows my suggestions is not going to look or feel the same as a 20 year old. But an 80 year old can be vigorous, strong, attractive and full of life. My goal is not turn back the clock, but to help you be the best 60, 70, 80, and even 100 year old you can be. For the first time, we have the power and the knowledge to change our fate and make a real difference in both the quality and quantity of our lives. Although the sooner we start the better, positive changes can produce positive results at any stage of life.

It can increase levels ofenergy, relieve fatigue, unwind body stress, relax muscular tension, balance the nervous system,release emotional holding patterns, increase body awareness, and provide an improved sense ofwell-being. Polarity was founded by Dr. Randolph Stone, an Austrian born in 1890. In the early1900's, Dr. Stone emigrated to Chicago, where he studied Chiropractic, Osteopathy, andNaturopathy. Dr. Stone had a unique interest in healing systems from all over the world. Heobserved many cultures and paid particular attention to three Eastern modes: the Chineseacupuncture system, the Indian Ayurvedic system and the ancient Egyptian or Hermetic WisdomTeachings. Polarity as we know it today was Dr. Stone's synthesis of his knowledge andexperience of Eastern and Western healing systems. Polarity teaches that we are fields of pulsating energy made up of specific frequencies oflife energy known as the five elements. These elements are ether, air, fire, water and earth.Each element relates and flows in a balance of positive, negative and neutral attractions. Whenour thoughts and emotions are out of alignment with the energy requirements of a life event, animbalance of life energy results. Energy imbalances may lead to confusion, pain, emotionaldiscomfort and other physical symptoms. Over a long period of time, energy imbalances mayappear as clinical dis-ease. Polarity teaches that the pain and discomforts of life are signals for usto learn, and present an opportunity to change and realign our lives. By learning to tune into energy patterns and flows, we can create an opportunity for aclearing of energy imbalances in our lives. To accomplish this, Polarity utilizes bodywork,exercise, nutrition and verbal guidance. Polarity bodywork involves learning gentle rocking,stretching and pressure-sensitive touches based on energy flows. Polarity exercise utilizes easystretching postures combining sound, breath and self-massage. Polarity nutrition views food asenergy and develops an ongoing, ever-changing, creative nutritional awareness rather than a rigidset of rules. Polarity verbal guidance is based on Dr. Stone's teaching that right thinking is thecornerstone of health. Verbal processes involve understanding and feeling our emotions, takingself-responsibility, and creating life enhancing thoughts. Polarity teaches that a dynamic, challenging, ongoing balance of life energy is thefoundation of good health. We focus on developing the flexibility, spontaneity and creativitynecessary to meet the challenges of our everyday life. When our physical, emotional and mentalenergies are in harmony, we naturally and spontaneously rise to higher levels of well-being. Beingwell is a life-long process involving increasing depths of understanding, awareness and sensitivityin a continuing intimacy with each moment of our life.

Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy (VHMT) is a form of massage. It is in the line of newhealing modalities called bodywork. Bodywork can include rub downs, but more accuratelyworks with joints, structure and emotional release of pent-up tensions and stresses. VibrationalHealing Massage Therapy builds on theories similar to other modalities, and yet is unique amongbodywork techniques. A VHMT session can be clothes on. There is no need for oil, unless the practitionerand the client want to combine it with other types of massage that require oil. This therapy doescombine wonderfully with others, adding new dimensions to other forms of bodywork such asSwedish Massage, Trager, Cranial-Sacral, Foot Reflexology, etc. There are no time limits. VHMTcan be done as first aid or stress relief in 10 minutes, or it can be done as a full session on thewhole body in 60 to 90 minutes. This healing therapy can be done with the recipient in a chair, onthe floor, or any make-shift place with complete effectiveness (even outdoors) and make a lastingdifference. This bodywork offers quick and simple restoration to the circulatory, lymphatic andcomplete nervous systems of the body, and can be done anywhere at any time. Children can evenfeel and use these techniques, and families benefit from everyone having the skills. Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy also brings forth new awareness�new ways ofliving, standing, walking and moving in the body, which we call The Fluid Body Model. Peoplebecome like a fluid (rather than a solid), that is alive and flowing from moment to moment.Students report that they stay awake in their classes, become more alert while driving and canmaintain higher energy at their computers. We call new ways to speak in the fluid way the Language of Healing. This is how to speakin a fluid, current process so that healing occurs now as one speaks, instead of as a concept in thefuture. Out of this comes new ways to think fluidly and self-responsibly which we call Disease asa Strategy to Survive. People become themselves, free of the stories and interpretations to let goof past tensions, limiting beliefs, emotional traumas and vibrations that are not authentic. Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy was founded in 1981 by Patricia A. Cramer, afterher four years of private study with Pierre Pannetier in Polarity Therapy. She also brought her richbackground in massage, athletics, dance, tai chi, aikido and meditation to the synthesis of thismost surprising bodywork therapy. Her work has been likened to playing the body as if it is afinely tuned musical instrument. Patricia considers herself a global and galactic citizen interested in human evolution intolight. She has been a light worker bringing conscious light into bodies for 15 years. Her work isvery simple and grounding, giving ease to the body from hour to hour, and yet providing a verystrategic awareness into light evolution. Patricia is also the founder of the World School of Massage and Advanced Healing Arts inSan Francisco. The World School has been a California Postsecondary School providing trainingsin Holistic Massage Therapy, Advanced Massage Therapy, Holistic Health Counseling and MasterBodyworker/Holistic Health Educator programs to the bay area and internationally since 1982. Instruction of Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy Level I is offered on an ongoing basisat the World School of Massage and Advanced Healing Arts in San Francisco, and elsewherethroughout the country by Certified Instructors. The basic training includes: The Fluid BodyModel; The Language of Healing; Disease as a Strategy; and the 30 or so practical techniques andfeeling skills for the release of trauma. Levels II and III of VHMT are also being offeredthroughout the year for graduates of the Level I that want to further their development.

The pain relief technique Ortho-Bionomy has been taught throughout Europe andthe U.S. for over 20 years, yet people still donOt know what the name really means!henever I am traveling and teaching around the country and someone asks me the name of what Ido, I pause, knowing that when I announce the title of this body therapy, I will usually get someform of response like the above statements. So after teaching Ortho-Bionomy for over 14 years, Ijust smile inside and prepare for the inquisition that follows. Instead of the impish response that Iwould like to give (such as It's make a living by touching people all over, or I put people invery comfortable positions that they would normally go into, and then they pay me), I usuallyrespond with a more professional statement. Ortho means the correct use of; Bio is life; and Onomy means the principles orlaws governing. Put it all together and you have Ortho-Bionomy, the correct use of the principles of life. Ortho-Bionomy was developed by a British doctor, Arthur Lincoln Pauls, in his earlyyears as an Osteopath. Before practicing Osteopathy Dr. Pauls was a Judo instructor. Every dayin Judo he practiced the principle of following someone's movement and energy in the directionthey were going, and if possible exaggerating that direction. Yet when Arthur went to Osteopathyschool and learned all the medical and manipulative techniques at that time, he was disturbed tofind that his teachers did not understand this principle. Dr. Pauls then read a paper by an American Osteopath, Dr. Lawrence Jones, calledSpontaneous Release Through Positioning. This paper said that a person can release ratherquickly, by simply positioning the person in the posture that the contracting muscles were drawinginto. When Dr. Pauls read this, he realized that this was the closest application of the Judoprinciples he knew, and he wanted to learn more. He took what he had learned from Dr. Jonesand went back to England to practice and expand these concepts even further. When I was first introduced to Ortho-Bionomy, I had been doing massage therapy for afew years and was close to being burned out. I had studied (and was quite good at) a wide varietyof therapies from deep-tissue to subtle energy work. But there was a part of me that was frustrated with the chronic reoccurrence of the same problems.Clients would come in with certain muscle contractions; I would stretch them out and then they would come back a week or two later with the same patterns. I was worn out by the struggle of fighting their body: trying to move it from where it was to where I thought it should be. Inside of me somewhere, I believed there must be an easier way to help people out of their pain. One day when my shoulders and neck were really hurting from a full day of doingmassage, I found a colleague, James Wahler, working at the Lotus Sutra in Cotati. (If youremember this place you've been in the area quite a while.) I asked him for the professionalcourtesy of sticking his thumbs in my aching shoulders. (This was the fastest relief I knew at thetime, even though I knew it would not totally relieve the discomfort.) He told me to lie down onthe massage table and asked if he could first try a technique he had just learned. He gently turnedby head into a very comfortable position and just held me there. I thought to myself, When areyou going to be done with this fooling around and get down to the thumbs? He straightened myhead and said I was done. I said, No way, I need as I reached up to the spot that had beenkilling me. The pain was gone! I found some additional smaller spots and he repeated the procedure and relieved them also. I was impressed to say the least. This was totally different that anything I had experiencedor read about. I wanted to learn more. I asked him, What was that? He said it was calledOrtho-Bionomy. I responded with (of course) Ortho-what? He then proceeded to tell meabout Ortho-Bionomy and the principles behind it. He said that the human body has an incredible wisdom within itself to protect and nurture.When an infection occurs, it automatically knows what to do. We don't need to tell the whitecorpuscles what to do or where to go; they know. When you bump into something and bruise amuscle, the body automatically curves around it to protect and give it time to heal itself. When weare feeling scared we often place our body in a position that feel safe in, that gives us thetemporary security and time we need before we step back out into the world. Ortho-Bionomysimply exaggerates the position that the body is taking to take care of itself. This is one of theprinciples of martial arts such as Judo, Tai Chi and Aikido. I was really attracted to the idea of following the wisdom of the body, as well as notforcing the body to change. It made a lot of sense. When my body is forced to change when it isnot ready, it usually goes back close the original contraction anyway. My friend James explainedthat when the body is shown through gentle exaggeration what it is doing, it often responds andopens up itself from within. The clincher of what James said was that this type of bodywork was totally painless forthe client and was easy on the body of the practitioner as well. Finally a technique that waspainless, easy on my body and effective. Ortho-Bionomy got the client's body to respond fromwithin to release its own tension, rather than depend on me to do all the work.

What is Watsu? by Melinda Elliott Since its discovery 15 years ago, the form of aquatic bodywork created by Harold Dull known as WatsuTM , water Shiatsu, has been adopted and practiced widely, not only in this country but worldwide. The technique's growing popularity is largely due to the fact that each Watsu session is not only a massage, but also a profound experience that causes many healing "shifts" on the physical, emotional and spiritual levels. Healing can occur not only for the receiver of Watsu, but also for the giver. Each Watsu session takes place in chest-high warm water, and involves both massage an a series of flowing, dance-like movements. While beginning Watsu givers usually rely on a learned sequence of moves, more advanced practitioners often use the "free flow" method. This spontaneous approach allows the giver to become increasingly open and free to intuit whatever movements emerge in response to the client's needs at the moment. Today's teachers and practitioners of Watsu, certified by the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association, can be found in many cities, both in this country and in Europe, Latin American and Japan. Although there is a growing number of certified Watsu teachers, perhaps the technique's best known instructor is Harold Dull, the poet and linguist who created Watsu in 1980. Dull coined the name of his invention from "water" and "Shiatsu," its two major components. Harold Dull's inspiration for inventing Watsu began when he traveled to Japan in the late 1970s to study Zen Shiatsu, a form of massage than emphasizes stretches and point work to help release blockages along the body's meridians. When he returned home to Harbin Hot Springs, California, he began perfecting his Shiatsu technique while floating his clients in the hot spring's warm water. Gradually a completely new kind of bodywork emerged. Dull included his invention, under the name WatsuTM in the curriculum of workshops at his School of Shiatsu and Massage at Harbin. Soon he had several hundred Watsu students each year. He found that in aquatic massage the receiver's body would glide easily and naturally into many relaxing positions impossible on land. Floating horizontally, supported by the therapist's arms and the soft water, the spine was freed from its gravitational prison. This freeing of the spine is essential to each Watsu session, for it allows deeply healing energy movement that can lead to release of long-held physical and emotional tensions. Although Harold Dull is a tall, strong person, he found that when he began teaching Watsu to others that the natural buoyancy of the human body in water makes it possible for even a smaller person to give a much larger one a Watsu session. He encouraged his students to develop their own creative Watsu styles, according to their individual body types and personal preferences. Watsu is currently popular not only at Harbin Hot Springs, but in many other settings in this country and abroad. It is offered by massage therapists at several spas, including Ten Thousand Waves in Santa Fe and Two Bunch Palms near Palm Springs. Watsu is also used by many physical therapists, such as those at the internationally known rehabilitation institute, Timpany Center in San Jose. In fact, Watsu seems to blend well with almost any other healing modality. It is a healing technique whose time has come. Watsu classes are available at the School of Shiatsu & Massage at Harbin Hot Springs. The World Wide Aquatic Bodywork Association offers certification at the 100 hour, 500 hour and 1,000 hour levels to Watsu practitioners.

Recent studies document the increasing use of complementary therapies as alternatives to the limitations of biomedicine, highlightling the need for significant reforms in both the scientific and delivery aspects of health care and health professional training. Increasingly, health professionals and policy makers are seeing the benefits of working with health care consumers in a partnership to promote wellness and healthy lifestyles. Educating consumers about these complementary options for achieving and maintaining health, either through individual counseling or public health campaigns, is a key element in the movement toward promoting health and preventing disease. The Integral Health Studies Program at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) offers an M.A. in Integral Health Education, which prepares students to pass the national certifying examination for health educators. A community-based approach is at the heart of health education's focus on health promotion and disease prevention. Graduates will be prepared to serve as health educators in a variety of settings, including hospitals, educational facilities, government health agencies and the corporate world. Program Director La Vera Draisin describes the role of health educators as agents of transformative change in the health care system: "Health educators can play a crucial role in addressing rising consumer discontent with the existing health care system. The concept and practice of integral health expands our Western scientific model of health and healing by considering cross-cultural approaches to health and illness, acknowledging the mental, emotional and spiritual realms which lie within and beyond our physical bodies. Integral health affirms the well-being of an individual as interconnected within the web of all living, self-organizing systems." Linda Bark, graduate of the Institute's Integral Health Certificate program and a Ph.D. student at CIIS, has been working in Guangzhou, China to create training seminars for people who are interested in learning about Chinese traditional medicine. In the U.S. she specializes in working with new and existing holistic healing centers. The Integral Health Studies Program has just expanded to include an exciting new curriculum in Herbal Studies. David Hoffmann, internationally known medical herbalist and author of The Holistic Herbal, teaches in the Herbal Program. The Herbal Studies curriculum includes courses in Green Science, Cross-Cultural Aspects of Herbalism, Practical Herbal Medicine and Herbalism, Culture and Society. An integral approach to health care is consonant with the shifting paradigm in medical science and provides a common language for exploring personal, collective and global health and healing for the 21st century. As a means fo improving individual, community and global health, the mission of the Integral Health Studies Program is to further define and contribute to the current paradigm shift in health care towards an integral model. We also wish to promote a vision of holism, pluralism and ecological systems thinking among health care providers, policy makers and delivery systems. CIIS is a unique, independent institute of higher learning dedicated to integrating theoretical knowledge, personal experience and spiritual wisdom.

Schiavo, from the book Great Speakers, Anthology Series Vol. 2 Shortly after high school graduation, I was drafted into the Army. During the induction process, the Army put us through a series of tests to decide what our assignments would be. One was an I.Q. test. While I anxiously awaited the final results, many thoughts ran through my mind. Thoughts like, "I'll probably get the lowest score in the whole company." When the results were in, an officer came out of his office and called us to attention. He called my name and two others and asked that we follow him to his office. "Gentlemen, I'd like to talk to you about your I.Q. tests," the officer said. My heart began to pound as he continued, "you three men scored the highest of any other men in the company." That test changed my life. For the first time in my life, a person of authority wasn't telling me I was stupid; instead what I heard was that I was really smart and in addition to that I was smarter than most. This new discovery encouraged me to go to the library and seek out every book I could find on positive thinking and self-help. One day I came across a book dealing with self-hypnosis. After reading that book, one thing immediately became apparent to me: I didn't have to accept programs from other people; I had within me the capacity to program myself for success. Years later while working as a teacher and practitioner of hypnotherapy, I began to develop new hypnotic techniques. The first technique I developed I called the P.E.P. Technique. P.E.P. is an acronym that stands for Positive Effective Programming. The P.E.P. Technique is used to program the subconscious mind. The subconscious works very much like a computer. In computer technology, whatever you program into the computer is what comes out. There is an old saying in computer technology, "Garbage in, garbage out." If you program garbage (negative information) into the computer, expect to get garbage (negative results). The subconscious mind accepts whatever you give it as being true. It doesn't have the capacity to question. As you work with positive affirmations, you will notice positive changes taking place in your life. You will be aware that others will be drawn to your joyous, happy and loving spirit. There are many negative words and statements that can easily be changed to positive ones. Is the word TRY a negative one? Webster says that try means "to make an effort," but I say that making an effort is not "doing it!" Consider changing the words "I'll Try" to "I Will"; change "I Hope" to "I Can"; and "I Can't" to "I Can." About 20 years ago every time someone would ask, "How are you?" I would answer with "FANTASTIC!" Finally a friend said "Fred, you can't be fantastic every day." I said, "You're right, some days I'm FANTASTIC!" and I bellowed that one out, "and other days I'm fantastic," saying this in a softer tone. "In conclusion," I said, "I'm fantastic every day." If you act as if you have a quality, you will get it. If you think, talk and act FANTASTIC, you will be FANTASTIC. In other words, fake it 'til you make it! In my office, for all to see, sits a can. I call it the "eye can." It has eyes all around it and these eyes keep staring at me all day reminding me that I CAN. Whatever I choose to achieve in life, I CAN! The P.E.P. Technique mentioned earlier must be used with the C.A.L.M. Method, which is a form of relaxation also tied to an acronym. This approach is used to relax the "critical faculty" of the conscious mind so that we can effectively program the subconscious. The meaning of the letters in the C.A.L.M. Method are as follows: C - stands for COMMITMENT. Starting at once, make an agreement with yourself. You are now committed in your resolve to change. A - stands for ATTITUDE. Positive attracts positive and negative attracts negative. By thinking positive, acting positive and being positive, we attract positive. L - stands for LOGIC. Intellectually, we know what is right, but we refuse to look at the truth. We get into denial. Denial means to declare what is not true that which is really true. M - stands for MOTIVATION. What is your motivation to make a change in your life? Whenever I work with people privately to overcome bad habits, I ask that question. Their success is dependent on their answer. When the reasons for change are specific (e.g. "I want to quit smoking for health reasons.") people are usually more motivated, and the likelihood for success is more prominent. You need to get past the feeling that it may be too late. The most important decision you can make is that there is still time to change your life. The decision is yours. Start today to program yourself in a positive, effective way. Fantastic Fred Schiavo has been a professional speaker, hypnotist and seminar leader for more than 25 years. His informative and motivational programs conducted at corporate and association conferences across the U.S. have earned him recognition as a "Key Motivator."

In our natural state, we are what Thomas Hanna, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field of somatic education, termed healthy "somas." As somas, we are self-aware, self-sensing, self-moving, self-changing organisms. We are in our bodies. We can contract and relax our muscles at will. We move with grace and ease. People in chronic pain, however, do not function this way. Instead, they exhibit areas of tightness and rigidity in their bodies. The tightness is due to contracted muscles, caused by injury or stress. In these people, the contraction has been going on so long they are no longer aware of it. No matter how hard they try, they can't relax these tight muscles. They've lost touch with the normal sensation and feeling in them. Dr. Hanna, in his book, Somatics, called this phenomenon sensory-motor amnesia (SMA). He estimated that as many as 50% of musculoskeletal problems were due to SMA. The effects are as follows: STIFFNESS - Caused by the hardening of the fascia and other connective tissues that require regular movement to remain soft and supple. SORENESS AND PAIN - Due to the accumulation of lactic acid. Lactic acid and the other metabolics of muscle contraction are normally drained away via the lymph system as the muscle goes through its phases of lengthening and shortening. When the muscle is chronically tight, this does not happen. REDUCED RANGE OF MOTION - Caused by the tight muscles affecting the movements of the joints and limbs. SPINAL MISALIGNMENT - Chronic contraction of the muscles on either side of the spine is a major cause of persisting patterns of subluxation, or spinal misalignment. To be effective, chiropractic also needs to address the neuromuscular elements. FATIGUE AND ENERGY LOSS - Muscles that are tight are constantly working, and are therefore using a significant amount of available energy. SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INJURY - A body that is tight lacks resilience, the ability to yield when meeting resistance of some kind (as in a slip or fall, or when lifting or bending). If the opposing force is too great, something has to "give," and it is usually the tight individual's back, neck or one of the extremity joints. PREMATURE AGING - What most people take for "old age" is in fact the stiffness, poor posture, low energy and impaired circulation that results from the chronically tight muscles associated with sensory-motor amnesia. As a chiropractor, I observed that no matter how often my patients with chronically tight muscles were adjusted, stretched or massaged, their muscles tended to tighten up again. Why was this? The somatic perspective explained it: the feedback loop between the sensory-motor cortex (the seat of voluntary control) and the muscle had been broken. Involuntary, lower brain reflexes, triggered by the original injury or stress, have taken over and are telling the muscle "contract," "stiffen." This is where Somatic Technique comes in. In 1989 I spent a brief period of time with Dr. Thomas Hanna and learned the basics of his method for releasing chronic muscle contraction and integrating mind/body awareness. Over the course of several years, I adapted what I learned from him into my own system that I use in my office and teach to other chiropractors, massage therapists and bodyworkers. The technique works by restoring the feedback loop. It actually teaches the client how to regain control over his/her own muscles. The principle of sensory-motor feedback says that if you increase sensory awareness, you automatically get more motor control. By having the patient contract the already tight muscle even further against a resistive force applied by the doctor, new and powerful sensory input is being created. The muscle is then gradually lengthened while still under resistance. Using this technique reawakens normal sensation and feeling, and results in an immediate softening and lengthening of the muscle, reduced pain, improved range of motion and an increased feeling of energy and well-being. This is cutting-edge work, and the results can be quite remarkable. Special somatic exercises given to the client help maintain the improvement. Somatics should be explored by anyone suffering from chronic pain and stiffnes that may be muscular in origin. Dr. Jim Dreaver is in private practice in Sonoma County, California. He teaches somatic seminars nationwide and writes on body/mind healing. His book, "The Ultimate Cure" will be released by Llewellyn in January 1996.

Our mission has been to provide state licensed health education training and integrate this approach into mainstream health care. Education in movement, breathing, eating and communication provides a grounded foundation for on-going personal growth and recovery from illness. IET offers comprehensive Nutrition, Hypnotherapy and Addiction Therapist Training Programs. I came to California from Western Massachusetts in 1976 to teach whole foods nutrition at the Berkeley Holistic Health Center. It was evident to me that diet and nutrition was a major piece of the conventional health care pie that was largely missing in action. While the health food movement of the 1970s and 1980s raised public demand for unprocessed natural food, training for health professionals in nutrition remained limited, out-dated and largely anti-natural. In 1982, I wrote the first Nutritional Consultant curriculum approved by the State Board of Education. My early mentors in the field, Drs. Bernard Jensen, Paavo Airola, Ann Wigmore and Michio Kusi, based their teaching on the healing properties of natural foods, juices, teas, broths and food condiments taken with an attitude of gratitude and love. This remains at the core of IET's nutritional healing programs. But is this sufficient? For persons with complex, persistent problems, further information is helpful. Individualized assessment of biochemical needs and environmental sensitivities offer valuable insight into slow-to-resolve complaints or iatrogenic (medically mismanaged) illness. I am indebted to Jeff Bland, Ph.D. and the HealthComm group for introducing the tools of functional metabolic testing, worldwide nutritional research, and protocols for periodic detoxification and adjunctive nutrient support, which I sue with clients and teach to clinical nutrition students. Health is learning to successfully adapt to change. Experience, intuition and critical intelligence must be cultivated to help us filter the toxins of commercial culture. IET students are presented with principles of health, not dogma. Classes are dynamic, practical and hands-on, with references to case histories as well as text. Un-learning bad habits precedes incorporating better ones. We teach individuals to consider health options, conduct research, make informed choices, and observe the consequences of behavior. A refreshing spirit of cooperation, trust and affirmation characterize the IET learning process. We strive to cultivate knowledge from information, and wisdom from knowledge. Improving health outcome is a learning process for all involved, not a prescription or procedure. Failure to learn about self-managed health contributes to aggravated injury and illness, depression and exhaustion. Variety is the spice of health education. Health education is important to persons in all walks of life, at all ages, in all circumstances. Too often, individuals hold onto out-dated, incorrect information, or they become one dimensional in their approach. Community classes in a wide variety of areas can provide a health consumer or practitioner with current validated information and resources. IET presents seminars at our campuses in Cotati, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Palo Alto which include Organic Gardening, Gourmet Vegetarian Cooking, Herbal Preparations, Women's Health, Homeopathy, Oriental Medicine, Ayurveda, Iridology, Reflexology, Mental Health, Aging and Addiction Counseling with Hypnotic Techniques. An innovative, self-paced home study program is available for those at a distance, or unable to attend classes regularly. A six-day Vitality Fasting Retreat will be held in Mendocino, California this Summer to practice rejuvenation in the Shenoa garden of edible delights. Edward Bauman, Ph.D. is a respected nutrition consultant at Partners in Health in Cotati, CA with research interest in cancer and immune dysfunction. He is the author of Nutrition Research Reports, and director/instructor at the Institute for Educational Therapy. Ed can be heard on KSRO radio (1350 AM) in Northern California from 1:00-2:00 pm the first Tuesday of each month.

Land of romance and adventure . . . Land of luxurious beaches and tropical breezes . . . of wonderfully warm people and rich traditions. Oh, but wait! Maybe Mexico makes you think of malaria and Monteczuma's revenge, or revolutions and bandidos, and of phones that never work. Well, you might be partly right, but let me share with you some of the Mexico that I love. If you know Mexico, you might know some of these places, and if you have never been, well, let me encourage you. PUERTO VALLARTA "Vallarta" is probably the easiest gateway to the tropical Pacific Coast of Mexico, and one of the best destinations for a first trip. You can fly direct from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta in 3 1/2 hours. When you step out of the plane, juicy tropical air embraces you like you wish your lover did. Exquisite. Mariachi music drifts to you from somewhere. Palm trees sway in the breeze. You are in a different world. Puerto Vallarta still has its cobblestone Mexican charm and small town warmth (along with its big American hotels and parasailing on the beach if you must), and English is spoken in most places. Stay in the old part of town (El Centro) and avoid the hotel strip. Hotel Posada Roger is clean and comfortable and costs under $20 a night. In addition to its beaches, there are lots of shops with beautiful silver jewelry and endless possibilities for shopping at reasonable prices, and a wonderful malecon (Mexican boardwalk) for strolling in the evening. For do-ers, Vallarta offers activities like horseback rides to waterfalls, snorkeling, jeep tours, boat trips to secluded coves and to nearby Yelapa, the roadless, phoneless hideout of many an American. The food in Vallarta is great. You'll find everything from street vendor mystery meat tacos to nice restaurants serving some of the finest seafood you may ever eat. CHACALA & MAR DE JADE If you are a seasoned traveler that speaks some Spanish, or a willing adventurer, grab a bus going north from Puerto Vallarta and get off after about 1.5 hours in Las Varas. Take a cheap taxi for an amazing half hour ride to Chacala and Mar de Jade. Chacala is a small fishing village on the sweetest little cove and beach you ever saw. Mar de Jade (Sea of Jade) is a modest American/Mexican project, part hotel and part social project. You can stay as a tourist, as Spanish student, do work exchange, hold your workshop there, be a doctor volunteer in their free medical clinic in Las Varas, or any combination thereof. Tourist prices are about $45 per day, including 3 great meals served on a patio overlooking the beach, and also including all the beautiful beach and tanning sun you could possibly want. It's a place to get very involved, or a place to go and be, to just hide out. SANTA CRUZ For the more adventurous, in Las Varas change buses for the rattling chicken-on-board ride up the beautiful jungle coast road to Santa Cruz, Nayarit (about 90 minutes, depending). The small village of Santa Cruz is set comfortably behind it's rocky beach, surrounded by tropical mountains covered with rambling jungle and banana plants. It is pure Mexico: cobblestone and adobe, and some of the friendliest people I have ever known. Except for the very comfortable motel Brisas Marina, which sprang up recently like a mushroom, accommodations are limited to rustic thatched palapas, or simple bare rooms. Restaurants are vague, mostly limited to tacos or ceviche on a card table, curbside (depending on the season). There's always fresh fruit, good beans and tortillas, and fresh fish and shrimp. (Note: there is no parasailing available in Santa Cruz!) BARRA DE NAVIDAD One more possibility worth suggesting for your perfect beach holiday is Barra de Navidad. I would recommend Barra for beginners or for seasoned travelers. (I've been sworn to secrecy about Barra by the aficionados that already love it, so keep this to yourself!) You fly direct to Manzanillo (south of Puerto Vallarta) and take the Volkswagen shuttle bus north to Barra. Another quiet cobblestone village, this one is big enough to have several pleasant, low-key hotels and some very good restaurants. Some English is spoken. There is a nice beach for swimming and sunning, and a huge lagoon with little restaurants standing on stilts over the water. Romantic, warm and luscious! ABOUT WEATHER, MONEY, ETC. There are two seasons in coastal Mexico: wonderfully warm and very hot. Winter in the U.S. is a perfect time there (late October to early April). Summer in the U.S. is really summer there: very hot plus rain and mosquitoes. Consider visiting higher elevations in the summer, such as Guadalajara and its circle of colonial cities, or Oaxaca. Mexico's reputation for being a cheap vacation place is still true, although it is no longer nearly free, like it once was. With the devaluation of the peso, the value of the tourist dollar went up considerably. Hurry, go before prices go up again. It's simple and hassle-free to travel to and in Mexico. Of course, a little Spanish helps, but take a phrase book and an open heart, and you'll find that your needs will be met, and then some.

There is, however, a quantum difference between taking a trip and being on a journey. We've all done some traveling, perhaps at times alone and at other times with others. Be it a commute to work, a weekend getaway, or a vacation in Hawaii, it's a common tradition in many countries to take trips. To go abroad and play at being a tourist is a familiar way to travel for many of us. Yet being on a journey is quite different from traveling or being on a trip. It's as different as taking a picture of the ocean is from jumping in and experiencing it! For starters, traveling can be exhausting because there is so much to figure out: where to stay; how to find the cathedral or whatever you came to visit; fussing about the clothes you did or did not bring. Journeying probes deeper than these thoughts that consume us. Being on a journey is going beyond what is on our mind and connecting with what is in it. Imagine the difference: You are on a tour of the Acropolis in Athens, overwhelmed with the magnificence of history and art and natural beauty, while also being concerned about time and your schedule for the rest of the day. Now imagine being at the Acropolis and following your inclination to stop on Mars hill where Socrates sat with his students, and taking the time to engage in a deep and meaningful dialogue with like-spirited companions. There's a difference between keeping busy with seeing sights and taking pictures, and actually being present with what you are experiencing. Although each requires form and purpose, travel gives a focus to the doing-ness, while journey is balanced with actual being-ness. Journey goes beyond the restraints of physical time and space. Journey feeds the soul. The word "travel" comes from "travail," which originally meant an instrument of torture, while "journey" is rooted in the name of the Goddess Diana and is related to both "deity" and "Day." One might loosely translate this as meaning "a cycle of holy time." In other words, to journey is to make a pilgrimage. People used to make pilgrimages to foreign and holy places, which were symbolic for reconnecting with the hidden and holy places within themselves. But physical travel is not a prerequisite for journeying. We journey every night in our dreams, for example, during which a rich symbolism helps us to remember and even heal aspects of ourselves that have been buried below waking consciousness. We journey during guided meditations; even daydreaming is a form of journey. When we travel, we literally carry baggage. Typically, we also carry the symbolic baggage of expectations and belief systems, of judgments and assumptions. In fact, we set ourselves up for disappointment and frustration by closing ourselves off from the adventure of discovery. It's impossible to be present in the unfoldment of each new moment when we've locked ourselves into the future by having a fixed agenda. Embarking on a journey, be it in the dream world or the physical world, is like stepping out of the grid lines that limit our concept of reality. Patterns in daily life vanish as we step into the spaces between the dots, into the "places" where possibility and probability live. When we open ourselves to experiences that are not dictated by logic and reason, and that are not structured by belief and judgment, we become aligned with what was always before us and what was always within us. This is a journey or pilgrimage. It is a movement toward wholeness or holiness, a cycle of time for entering the sacred. Connecting with more of who we really are (that is, experiencing more of our innate wholeness) is also an opening for connecting more fully with others and with the Earth. When we journey, we waken to the knowing of our interconnectedness. True journey, then, cannot happen in isolation. It is a contradiction in terms to set ourselves apart (whether out of fear or arrogance or unconscious beliefs) when the essence of journey is inter-relatedness. By remaining connected to ourselves, others and the Earth, our daily travels, our trips to foreign places, our dreams and flights of imagination are transformed into wondrous cycles of sacred time. Although journey can be experienced in as many forms as there are personalities on this planet, we are all on the same journey. This is the new paradigm struggling to be birthed: a collective realization of our inter-relatedness in sacred time, and a remembering of our connection to things we do not yet know. Jan and Marystella are co-founders of New Moon Sacred Sight Journeys, based in San Francisco. They lead groups of kindred spirits on journeys to various places in the U.S. and abroad.

Sandy Bar Ranch,On The Wild Klamath River by Mark Dupont Each Fall anglers and hikers along the Klamath River and its tributaries can witness one of nature's most exhilarating events--the return of the salmon from the ocean. The salmon and steelhead migration is a natural phenomenon on a par with the buffalo of the great plains--a massive movement of a species that once provided sustenance, fueled myth and inspired awe. Each year the great fish are called from the expanse of the Pacific to an arduous journey of hundreds of miles to the high mountain streams of their origin. Sandy Bar Ranch is located on the Klamath River, the sixth largest watershed in the Pacific Northwest. The river carries water originating high in the snow-capped Cascades past our cabins, and brings schools of migrating salmon and steelhead up from the Pacific to spawn in its tributaries. On any given day one can see osprey, river otters, bald eagles, deer, fox, great blue heron or even bear along its banks. As our familiarity with the river has expanded beyond the short stretch of it that we call home, we have learned that our lives are intimately connected with its entire length. Located in the Karuk Homelands, our small rural community of Orleans, CA encompasses a diverse community of Native Americans, organic farmers, Forest Service personnel, artisans and local business people. Sandy Bar Ranch serves as a gateway to the trails and rivers of the surrounding Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains, and as an educational facility offering workshops on a variety of topics. On the Ranch you'll find an organic garden, a fruit tree nursery and home crafts. We are a collective enterprise dedicated to stewardship of the land and the sustainable management of natural resources held in trust for future generations. Salmon and steelhead have always played a primary role in life along the Klamath River. For centuries Native Americans have relied on the salmon for sustenance, and still fish along the banks of the Klamath with traditional dip nets. Old-timers on the river tell of times when the salmon runs were so dense, a person could walk across the river on the backs of the great fish. Because the Klamath River is sparsely populated and has no major industries along its banks, it has long been recognized for its importance as an adromous fish habitat. Encompassing over 10 million acres, the Klamath River watershed is the largest between the Columbia and the Sacramento Rivers. It is home to four Native American tribes, and supports more than one third of the commercial ocean fish catch between Fort Bragg, California and Coos Bay, Oregon. Salmon and steelhead are indicator species. Because their life cycle encompasses so much of the watershed, from small tributaries all the way to the ocean, their presence and the stability of their numbers are a barometer which tells us about the health of our forests and rivers. The story being told now is an alarming one. We are on the brink of losing these fish due to a number of factors, including habitat destruction and low river flows. But despite the pressures and challenges, the Klamath remains one of the wildest rivers in the Pacific Northwest. In the fall of 1995 we witnessed the salmon return in record numbers. The sight of the mighty fish leaping through white water is truly awe-inspiring. Yet we are reminded by the Karuk Elders that the fish are but a fraction of their former numbers. Pat Higgins, a Fisheries Scientist who worked on the Long Range Restoration Plan for the Klamath River and has led tours at Sandy Bar Ranch, states that the Klamath holds the most promise of any of the Pacific Northwest rivers for preservation and restoration of the salmon and steelhead. We encourage you to visit this spectacular region. It is important to experience the salmon, the forests and wild rivers for yourself. The wilderness provides peace, adventure and inspiration for stewardship. We at Sandy Bar Ranch can connect you with conservation groups working to protect the Klamath region. We can also point you in the direction of wilderness trails, arrange whitewater rafting trips, and organize EcoTours (for groups of ten or more). Those of us concerned about our rivers and forests must make our voices heard. The salmon will continue to be called back from the oceans to spawn in the streams of their birth; it is up to us to make sure that the waters run clean for them. If we participate in shaping the future of our public lands and waters, then we can preserve the natural beauty that we now enjoy for generations to come. And maybe some day our grandchildren will walk across the river on the backs of salmon.

Now over 50,000 people have experienced this unique heat treatment, and many more have heard about it. What is it about the enzyme bath that draws so many people to use it? Most people say they feel transformed by the enzyme bath. After just one treatment bathers feel significantly renewed, their skin softened, smoothed and glowing with warmth. They report a sensation of profound relaxation and rejuvenation. It is especially soothing for the digestive and nervous system, excellent for detoxification, and highly beneficial for aches and pains, stress and fatigue. Why is this? The enzyme bath works on the metabolic system by affecting enzyme activity throughout the body. The action of the enzyme bath imitates much of the work that is constantly being performed by the internal organs to produce both heat and enzyme activity inside the body. When the body is immersed in this bio-active medium, circulation and metabolism are stimulated from outside, giving a boost to the internal organs which usually perform these functions on their own. This is part of the reason the bath is both relaxing and energizing at the same time! The heat in the enzyme bath is produced biologically by fermentation, nature's purification process, which requires the presence of over 600 active enzymes. The largest organ of the body, the skin, comes in direct contact with intense enzyme activity in the enzyme bath. The bath, in addition to heat, produces its own electro-chemical environment. There are over 3,000 different enzymes in every cell of living tissue. This combination of heat and energy influences the enzymes in your body in many ways. The enzyme bath works to break down body wastes in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. The surface of your skin, your pores, and even the cells themselves are thoroughly cleansed. By enhancing enzyme function in your body, the bath improves digestion and cleansing organ function, increases the exchange of oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream, and balances the energy in the nervous system. This treatment is not recommended for individuals with high blood pressure, women during pregnancy or following the consumption of alcoholic beverages. It is suggested for people seeking a powerful energetic shift in one session, and especially advisable for detoxification (a great way to end a fast), nervousness or stress, aches, pains and low back discomfort, or if you simply want to feel fantastic. Osmosis Enzyme Bath and Massage in Freestone, California is the first and only enzyme bath in the USA. Ideally situated for the ultimate getaway, Osmosis is located in one of the most scenic valleys in Northern California. The facility has been optimized to create a complete healing sanctuary. In addition to the bath, guests are served an enzyme tea in an exquisite Japanese garden upon their arrival. They are treated to personalized service and privacy throughout their visit, and have the option of receiving a 75-minute massage following their bath from one of many exceptionally gifted bodyworkers. Massage is available either indoors or in the new pavilions in the outdoor garden sanctuary. Michael Stusser came upon the Enzyme Bath while living in Japan over 10 years ago. The bath helped his sciatica and provided a personal transformation. He was so impressed with the overall effect of the enzyme treatment that he made it his mission to bring it back to America. He started the Osmosis Enzyme Bath in 1985. For more information, please see their listing under Travel & Retreats in our online Directory.

You need not be famous, write a book, or go into a trance. You can access/connect with all the energy and information you need with conscious channeling. What is Channeling? To channel is to be a conduit to receive and express energy as it moves from one dimension to another�and that expression takes many forms. A bodyworker is being a channel for healing energy to express/pass through the hands. An artist is being a channel for a vision to express on canvas, clay, etc. A poet is being a channel for thoughts to express in word rhythms and forms. A musician is being a channel for sound to express through instruments. You are being a channel every moment of every day�in one form or another. You are an instrument: through your hands; through your eyes; through your thoughts; through your voice; through your heart--however you choose to communicate the energy you have received. The question is: Are you conscious of the energy that you have connected with and you are expressing in every deed, word and thought? Are you consciously aware of the energy that is flowing to you and through you and expressing to All That Is around you? Channel with Voice Expression The most common reference to "channeling" is with voice expression. It means verbally expressing the forms of telepathic communication that you receive while in a state of Love and Peace. Conscious Channeling means describing verbally the symbols and pictures that you may be seeing, and sharing verbally the thoughts that come to you as you connect with Divine Energies. You may want to refer to them as Cosmic, God, Source, Universal or Higher Energies. The "high" aspect refers to a frequency or vibration, a vastness of consciousness, and a level of responsibility rather than a judgment of worthiness. The messages you receive while in a state of Love may come in a purposeful channeling session, or you may already be aware of receiving guidance/messages all through your day--as long as you remain in a state of Love. When we move into fear we jam our circuits; our clarity seems to vanish. The clarity and the help from other realms is always there, if we keep our channels open. You as a Conscious Channel You, as a conscious channel, are aware in the moment of what is being transmitted/coming through/being spoken. There is no trance involved. You are conscious of what is happening and are in a relaxed, meditative, attuned state that enables connection. You don't have to do anything except get out of the way with your conscious mind. Getting out of the way is a continuing spiritual practice. My experience is that the Divine Energies are totally compassionate, non-judgmental, patient and loving. If there is a judgment/attitude then you are getting in the way. As a conscious channel you speak with your own voice, although you may sound a bit different than usual because of the resonance of the Energy in your voice (usually very calm and filled with Love). As a conscious channel you speak in your own words, and receive and express thoughts that are in alignment with your deepest beliefs--because the energies you channel in a state of Love are aligned with your Full Multi-dimensional/Soul/Higher/External Self. And, yes, you may channel your Higher Self. Hopefully, you do that every day! We All Channel I believe that we all receive guidance (channel) all the time. The question is whether we are open to receive it, trust it and act on it in our everyday lives, in order to live in alignment with Spirit. Channeling is very empowering because you are consistently encouraged to trust your Self in the process--to trust your feelings, your vision, your thoughts, your discernment, and to trust the flow of the Universe even if you don't understand it in the moment. Channeling is a way of opening your Heart. Most of us have never felt so much Love. As you expand and ascend to higher frequencies of connection, your consciousness will transform so that you have the eyes to See and the ears to Hear the energetic dimensions of your Self and the Universe. Mary Lynn teaches Conscious Channeling and publishes Divine Connections, a channeled publication. She has worked closely with the Pleiadians and the Masters and has created a rural Light Center.

Dreams and Meditation: Your Freeway to Enlightenment by Betty Bethards Dreams are your greatest free tools for insight and self-understanding. Throughout mankind's history, dreams have been an important source of guidance, inspiration, prophecy, prediction and problem solving. In every culture, we find some version of "sleeping on a problem" before making a decision. What is this wonderful dimension that is so near and yet so far from our reach? First we need to realize that we are spending 10 days out of every month in the dream state. That's a third of your life that you're missing if you're not working with your dreams. We all leave the body every night of our life to go out and be taught and trained. We are given valuable lessons and insights into our daily life by our higher self and team of teachers, whose sole purpose is to help guide us in our self-growth here on the earth plane. Our dreams give us positive messages about our life direction and show us what needs to be changed in order to create rich and fulfilling lives. Besides receiving important information about our daily activities, dreams can also be a tremendous source of inspiration for art, music, writing and other creative endeavors. You can learn to program yourself to have a dream about a specific problem or project by sitting on the side of the bed before going to sleep and saying: 1) I will have a dream about (the problem) tonight. 2) I will remember the dream. 3) I will wake up and write the dream down. The mind is a very powerful tool like a computer. Whatever you program into it, is what you receive. Be sure and keep a pad of paper and a pen by your bedside. Write the dream down immediately after you have it or talk it into a tape recorder. If you wait until morning, you are more likely to forget the dream. Your best dreams (or what I call "teaching" dreams) occur between 3:00 and 5:00 am, or happen just before awakening. The dreams that occur when you first go to bed are usually Just clearing out the day's mental clutter and can be affected by what you ate, read or just watched on television. Common Types of Dreams Nothing is off limits in the dream state. We are open to experiencing all levels of self: all fears, frustrations, suppressed images, visionary insights and unknown territory. We will become more comfortable with all dream images when we learn to welcome them (whatever they are) as symbolic messengers of self. Nightmares Often times you will be given a nightmare to call your attention to a problem. Where pleasant dreams may be forgotten easily, a nightmare can scare you into remembering the dream. Nightmares show us our fears that have been blown way out of proportion, or something that is affecting us negatively. Disaster Dreams Whether an earthquake, flood, fire or tidal wave, a disaster indicates a sudden change in some area of your life. A flood means an emotional upheaval and an earthquake means a big rearrangement in your affairs. Disaster dreams usually indicate turning points or opportunities to take advantage of a new direction. Sexual Dreams When making lobe in a dream, this represents a merger of your own masculine and feminine energies. We are all working to balance the male and female polarities within our being. The feminine energy is our sensitive, intuitive, creative side while the masculine is our strong, assertive side. Sex in a dream can also mean that you are integrating the qualities you associate with that person within your being. Flying Dreams Flying dreams are great fun and usually mean you are consciously out of the body. You are free to explore anywhere you like. If you are flying around and start to lose altitude, it simply suggests that you have a fear of exploring higher dimensions and breaking out of limits. Direction Dreams The direction in which you are traveling indicates whether you are on the right track in your life situation now. If you are going up in a dream (up a mountain, up a road, ladder, staircase, elevator, etc.) you are going in the right direction. If you are going up and down, such as on a roller-coaster, it means your energy is scattered and needs to get centered. Dream Symbols Our dreams are all in symbols and once you understand the positive meaning behind the symbols, you will find that they are easy to work with and interpret. A good place to begin is to realize that everyone and everything in the dream represents a part of you. You are the producer, writer, actor and director of your life story. Male and female figures represent your own masculine and feminine energies. A child represents your child part; an aged person an old part of self (either one that is wise or a part that is dying because you have outgrown it). The colors, numbers, animals, scenery, clothes and letters are also significant. After a routine of regular practice interpreting the symbols, your new skill becomes a natural, flowing easy part of your life. I tested the symbols in The Dream Book: Symbols for Self-Understanding with audiences for 15 years, and they have been hitting right on with people throughout the world. Meditation and Self-Growth Meditation is the key tool I teach in helping people to center their energy and to get a recall on their dreams. Meditation helps us to develop a growing sense of serenity and self-awareness. By sitting in the silence for 20 minutes a day, you achieve a deep relaxation of body, mind and spirit. You begin to see how you set up your life experiences and the lessons of each situation. All forms of meditation are good, but in our high speed society, it's important to protect our energy by closing down at the end. I have given out this mediation technique throughout the world for the last 25 years. The easiest and most enjoyable way to meditate is to listen to your favorite songs and music for the full 20 minutes. While sitting with your spine erect, you�re aligning your energy to the God force. This 20 minute period, however, is not our only meditation practice. We endeavor to practice the meditation attitude in watching our thoughts and behavior throughout the day, and working with our dreams at night. You will begin to see how your thoughts, words and actions set up your reality and life experiences. You will also discover the many gifts, talents and abilities within you as you explore the inner self. You can learn to create a reality that works for you! For over 25 years, Betty and her Inner Light Foundation have helped millions of people through her TV, radio and monthly lecture appearances, weekly classes and personal readings--with great insight and humor. Betty is the author of The Dream Book: Symbols for Self-Understanding. What a Psychic Can Do for Your Health by Rev. Kerry Echo Kiefer Putting a psychic first on your list of yearly check-ups can save time, money, undue fears and frustration. Human beings tend innately toward wellness and balance. At the same time, we are always growing and changing--structurally reorganizing, making energetic shifts, and reestablishing--on all levels of our existence, seen and unseen. What we call "illness" is really only a side effect of such larger, holistic processes. Yet we feel poorly all the same, and worse when the "illness" resists treatment. In cases of this kind, the "illness" itself is a symptom, so the cause must be sought elsewhere, in another, other-than-physical dimension of oneself. Otherwise, that of which we are unconscious and what our health practitioners cannot see can cost us a lot of time, money, worry and frustration. No, it is not time to change acupunturists, but it may be time to see a psychic. Few people are as skilled as psychics at seeing the entire person--from past incarnations to parallel lives and everything in between. In psychic jargon, a person is a "book," and good books are multidimensional: growing, changing and developing on many levels. Health problems for these sensitive, interesting people are a sign of growth, and to gain some perspective on their "illness" comes as quite a relief and speeds recovery. Diane thought she had a run-of-the-mill yeast infection. She treated herself with a home remedy she had used successfully for years. When to her surprise it failed to work, she visited her homeopathic physician, whose remedy she used until it was clear that it was not working either. She proceeded to the herbalist and the acupuncturist. Diane still have the yeast infection when she turned to a psychic 4 months later. Looking clairvoyantly at the problem, the psychic could see that though Diane was troubled by the infection and afraid of something more serious, she was experiencing another agitation just beneath her conscious awareness. A closer look revealed that memories of her ex-husband and their marriage, which had been held in her lower abdomen for many years, were being released and leaving her body. Diane had placed great store in this marriage. Her prospective husband was bright, sensitive, and had a solid career ahead of him. She anticipated a marriage as intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying as their courtship had been. Once married, however, her spouse became stubbornly absorbed in his work. The marriage became an after-thought, generally an outright annoyance when he was faced with shared responsibilities. In vain, Diane nursed the marriage along, absorbing her husband's irritation and suppressing her own pain and disappointment. She held these energies in the most vulnerable part of her body, the womb, where women protect and nurture hopes, dreams and physical children. From a psychic point of view, Diane was in great spiritual health. Despite her long discomfort, she had actually been in the midst of healing herself. She had begun that process with the decision to remarry, and the yeast infection appeared soon after. She was clearing her body, preparing herself for a new partner. In the grander design, she was re-integrating her past experience in order to create the harmonious life and relationship she envisioned. Diane's greatest fear was allayed: there was nothing wrong with her general physical health. The yeast infection would clear up, and all the sooner, now that she had help in bringing an old problem into full consciousness. Within a week of her psychic consultation, the yeast infection disappeared. Still, Diane's case does not mean that psychic consultations can (or should) replace other alternative healing methods and practitioners. Far from it. James' situation is a case in point. James fell backward off a roof ladder 17 years ago. He was rushed to an emergency room and remained hospitalized for months while medical doctors worked to relieve severe pain and restore mobility. James the hospital confined indefinitely to a wheelchair, and with little hope of ever walking again, or of having much range of motion in any part of his body. James had always been a religious man. Now, in a state of enforced inactivity, he took a deeply spiritual turn. Along with a variety of medicines and physical therapy, prayer and meditation became part of his daily regimen. Indeed, before long James decided to make a gradual attempt to dispense with all medication. He was convinced that his answers lay with his growing faith. In addition, at quite some expense he began seeing a well-known spiritual healer. James had been seeing the spiritual healer for several years when he made an appointment with a local psychic. There was something wrong with his faith, he claimed. He could no longer afford the spiritual healing; and, worse, once he left the healer's office, he could not replicate the miracle of having walked several paces. Seldom does a psychic have the pleasure of sitting before someone with no spiritual problems, but that was basically the case with James. His difficulty was not spiritual at all. There was no breach of faith of any kind on his part. Rather, he suffered from a delusion that all physical disease could be corrected by spiritual means. Of course, the well-known healer could cause him to walk, and there was no guile in this. But, not being clairvoyant, the healer missed the mark with James altogether. He could not see that James' healing would come by a different approach; one which acknowledged the spiritual sanctity of the body. Interestingly, a psychic scan of James' physical body revealed no organic damage or blockage. It was a body that seemed merely to have lacked the benefit of flowing energy for many years. Though this was serious enough, it bode well for the prospect of James eventually learning to walk again. Curious about what the medical diagnosis had been 17 years ago, the psychic asked the nurse attending James, who replied, "Compression." "You mean to say, from a medical point of view, James did not sustain any major damage to his spinal cord? That is all they said it was, Compression?" The diagnosis validated the psychic's reading, but it was surprising all the same, because no one had questioned it at the time. The course of James' life might have been different had alternative treatments been more widely accepted. Nevertheless, James' reality conformed to his beliefs and conspired with them to create a long, difficult lesson. The psychic's prediction was that James would walk again, but it would take at least two years of intense, structural bodywork and a lot of patience on James' part. The miracle of walking again would not occur overnight, but it was no less a miracle for that. James was referred immediately to a Rolfer, who restored 80% of his range of motion in 6 months. James is now seeing a highly-skilled chiropractor who is working to strengthen his ambulatory spine. Though only a year has passed, James's progress is good. The prognosis for his recovery remains consistent with that of the psychic. Like Diane and James, there are many people who find themselves in need of the kind of clarity and validation that only a psychic can give. We are fortunate that alternatives to allopathic medicine have survived, and are available to us today. We are also fortunate o have a new model of cooperation among health practitioners, including medical doctors, which ensures that client care comes first. It is now possible to use the help of a psychic in conjunction with other healing practitioners. Better yet, put one at the top of your list of yearly check-ups, and see your psychic first. Since there is a wide variety of psychics in the marketplace, be sure to ask for one who specializes in health readings and who is willing to make referrals to other alternative practitioners. Also, inquire about the psychic's professional background, training and credentials, just as you would of anyone else who is offering a service. Rev. Kerry Echo Kiefer is a Christian minister in the western mystical tradition. She has a private psychic consulting practice and teaches spiritual development in Santa Rosa, California.

Californians, in fact, are the largest consumers of bottled water in the country. But if you talk to people and ask them about this issue, most can only give a vague explanation of the problem. They know that the water is not "safe," but they don't know exactly what toxins are in it, or where they come from. The fact is that water contamination may be America's number one health problem. Over 70% of our body is water, and we need clean water every day to rejuvenate our system and flush out toxins. Water is the foundation of our health, and if the foundation is poor, the entire structure is jeopardized. There are thousands upon thousands of chemicals used in our society, with approximately 1,000 new ones introduced each year. The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act regulates only 100 contaminants. How effective can that be? And congress is seeking right now to relax the regulations on water, not strengthen them. A shocking statistic is that in 1992 and 1993 alone there were over 230,000 violations of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act by public water systems. That's just for the few contaminants that are currently being regulated. The system has broken down, unable to cope with the byproducts of our industrialized society. The scary thing is that the bottled water many of us have turned to as a supposed "safe alternative" may not be clean either. While bottled water may taste better, there are no assurances that it is free of contaminants, because what most people don't realize is this: bottled water is largely unregulated! Many bottled waters with names that include words such as "mountain," "spring" and "crystal clear" are actually tap water that has been filtered through a very simple (and inadequate) filtration system to remove enough chlorine so that it tastes better. (Since you can't taste, see or smell most contaminants, they know you can't tell the difference.) And we won�t even discuss the exorbitant prices we pay for bottled water, a billion dollar industry. The sources of water contamination are myriad. The list includes industrial waste, the underground disposal of extremely hazardous toxins through injection wells, and leaking underground fuel tanks. Then there's the agricultural runoff of pesticides, the toxic runoff from streets and rooftops of chemicals used in paving and building materials, and the radioactive contamination of radium, a byproduct of the decay of uranium, used in nuclear power plants. One of the most talked about contaminants in our drinking water is chlorine, a necessary disinfectant used to kill harmful, disease-causing bacteria. Unfortunately, chlorine combines easily with other chemicals and naturally occurring organic material to form many carcinogenic substances. An example of this is trihalomethanes (THMs), which are associated with rectal, bladder and pancreatic cancers, and may cause damage to the nervous system. Chlorine has also been linked to heart attacks, strokes, premature senility and sexual impotency. When you think about it, the purpose of chlorine is to kill living organisms; as far as I know we are all living organisms! Even in small amounts, taken daily this poison builds up in our systems and causes harm. There is a simple test kit you can buy from any pool or spa store to check the amount of chlorine in your water. You squirt a few drops of a substance called orthotolidene (OTO)into the water, and it turns the water yellow to indicate the level of chlorine. You compare the tested water to the color bar, and if the water is too yellow, it's considered unsafe to swim in. Yet many times, if you use this test on your tap water, you'll find it at the top of the chart--in other words, not safe to swim in, let alone drink! Now, we wouldn't go to our swimming pool and dip out some water to drink or cook our food in, would we? But many people are doing the equivalent of that without realizing it. Lead is another major contaminant. Today one in nine children under the age of six is said to have unacceptably high blood levels. I don't know about you, but none of the children I know sit around eating paint chips off walls--the lead is in the drinking water, and foods and beverages prepared with water. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, lead is the number one environmental threat to children. The EPA has actually concluded that there is no "safe" exposure to lead. It causes learning disabilities in children, delays normal physical and mental development in babies and toddlers, is linked to hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults, and can cause damage to the nervous system, kidneys and reproductive system. Lead is implicated in causing leukemia as well. Unfortunately, I must alarm you further and mention that in addition to chemical toxins in our water such as chlorine, lead, pesticides, etc., we also need to be concerned about microbiological threats. Traditional water purification measures are ineffective against many waterborne diseases, especially some virulent newcomers. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has actually issued several warnings in recent years to people who are aged or suffering from immune deficiency disorders not to drink tap water, because their bodies are not strong enough to fight off waterborne infections. In 1993 in Milwaukee there was an outbreak of cryptosporidium that made thousands ill. Giardia is another common threat; although it won't kill you, it can make you quite uncomfortable, causing nausea, diarrhea and other digestive disorders. In 1991 and 1992, 17 states reported outbreaks of disease associated with drinking water, affecting over 17,000 people. But the CDC believes that outbreaks of waterborne disease are probably under-recognized and under-reported, in part because reporting outbreaks is voluntary in the United States. One last thing to mention, which is very important, is that even if you are drinking clean water (bottled from some pristine spring in the mountains or filtered with a state-of-the-art filtration system), if you are showering in chlorinated water you still face health risks. When water is heated up and becomes steam in the shower, the chemicals evaporate out and are inhaled. The amount of chlorine absorbed by your body in just a 10 minute shower is the equivalent to your drinking two gallons of tap water! According to the American Journal of Public Health, "Skin absorption of contaminants has been underestimated and ingestion may not constitute the sole or even primary route of exposure." Since I began researching this issue, I have been completely shocked and horrified to discover all that I just detailed. (And, of course, there's much more.) The first step is in raising awareness on the issue. I would recommend that everyone explore this subject and re-evaluate what they are putting into their bodies and the bodies of their children. Luckily, there are products on the market that offer solutions, and in some areas the government is actually requiring all new homes to be built with a water filtration system from the start. The Hazards of Household Cleaning Products by Janice Hughes What cleaning products do you use in your home? Are they safe for the environment? Do they pose health risks? What happens if a child accidentally drinks some? The answers to these and other questions may surprise you. Many of us use toxic chemicals in everyday life. Sometimes we are aware of it, sometimes not. Many actions which appear to be harmless actually involve the use of harmful chemicals. Household cleaners, garden pesticides, paints, batteries, detergents, even flea powders can be hazardous to our health and the environment. Detergents, degreasers, stain removers and pesticides have made our homes miniature chemical factories. Hazardous chemicals endanger the environment by contaminating our groundwater, lakes and oceans. If these hazardous products in the home are ingested, absorbed through the skin or inhaled they can cause illness that may only appear years later. One of the biggest culprits in ocean pollution is phosphates, common in laundry detergents and some cleaning products. The average consumer nationwide uses about 30 pounds of laundry detergent a year; all together, Americans use about 8.3 billion pounds of dry detergent and a billion gallons of liquid detergent each year! High phosphate levels can kill life in rivers, streams and oceans by causing "algae blooms." Algae slimes dense enough to suffocate marine life have been swelling around the world, especially in coastal bays. They are largely caused by fertilizing pollutants called "nutrients" in human sewage and farm runoff. Some marine experts call this type of ocean pollution a silent, global epidemic that if unabated could destroy American's most scenic and commercially valuable waters. From Long Island Sound to the Santa Monica Bay, nutrients have devastated many popular fishing spots and shellfish beds. Many coastal bays have turned the hue of pea soup, and some have regressed to "dead zones"--water so depleted of oxygen that only primitive creatures such as bacteria and algae can survive. Some progress has been made in tackling this problem. Phosphates have been banned in many areas. But some supermarket varieties still contain them. In addition, many other household cleaning products contain harmful solvents and harsh chemicals that destroy the natural processes involved in wastewater treatment. In addition, hazardous waste products should not be disposed of in a septic system. These materials kill valuable bacteria in the system. This includes even small amounts of latex paint rinsed off of rollers and brushes. Many of us tend to think anything sold in a supermarket must be safe, but often labels do not contain complete and accurate information. Many common household cleaning products are actually classified as hazardous waste! You should not dispose of them in the trash; please take them to your county's hazardous waste collection center. There is another side to this issue besides the pollution of our environment--our health, and the safety of our children. Chemical levels can be up to 70 times higher inside the home that out. Over 100 chemicals commonly found in homes have been linked to allergies, birth defects, cancer, psychological abnormalities, skin reactions, headaches, depression, joint pain, chronic fatigue, chest pains, dizziness, loss of sleep, asthma. . .the list goes on. Housewives have a 55% higher risk of getting cancer than do women working outside the home. This most likely has to do with the products they use on a daily basis. Nervous disorders and respiratory problems have also been linked to hazardous substances in the home. Every year thousands of household poisonings are reported. Many are fatal. Approximately 70% of all poisoning accidents occur in children between the ages of one and five. Almost all childhood poisonings are caused by unsafe storage and handling of household cleaning products and medicines. According to Poison Control, dishwashing detergent accounts for more accidental poisonings than any other household substance. Dandruff shampoo, if swallowed, causes vital organs to degenerate. Household ammonia, when mixed with bleach is a deadly substance. Bug spray can remain active and airborne in your home for up to 30 years. Seniors are also at risk. With increasing age, people become more vulnerable to the harmful effects of environmental chemicals due to the deterioration of physiological and biochemical processes, which include certain age-related biochemical, morphological and functional changes associated with the nervous system. For example, the elderly are likely to suffer more than younger people from exposure to carbon disulfide and to certain pesticides and chemicals. The most common ingredients in household cleaning products include alkalies, acids, detergents, other toxic chemicals. Alkalies are soluble salts that are effective in removing dirt without excessive rubbing. Alkalies vary in strength; the stronger one cause burns, and if swallowed can cause internal injuries and even death. Acids are beneficial in removing hard-water deposits, discoloration and rust stains. Acids can irritate and injure the skin and eyes. Oxalic acid, used in some toilet bowl cleaners, is extremely poisonous. Caustic household cleaners can cause severe burning if swallowed or put on the skin, Symptoms of poisoning include redness around the mouth, drooling and difficulty in swallowing. Never make someone who has swallowed a caustic substance vomit or give a "neutralizing" agent, as the chemical reaction can cause further burning.) It is best to give water (about a cupful) and seek emergency advice from poison control. Many of the chemicals found in our homes are used to make our lives easier. But we don't realize the consequences of using many of these substances. Think before you pour waste down the sink. Only natural substances should be disposed in our sewer systems. Be wary and read labels. And whenever possible, use alternative non-toxic products that will curtail the destruction of the environment. National Arbor Day Foundation'sRain Forest Rescue Campaign Join in saving the earth's most precious wildlands before it's too late! The Arbor Foundation is the world's oldest and largest tree-planting organization. It began more than 120 years ago in Nebraska City, Nebraska, and by now its million members plant millions of trees annually. The extent of destruction wrought by the burning and bulldozing of rain forest has reached such proportions that it now threatens worldwide consequences.When you accept the invitation to support The National Arbor Day Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue Campaign, you'll be doing more for our planet, and humanity, than you likely realize. The Dangers to Our Climate Rain forests exert a powerful control over world climate with their influence on temperature, wind and humidity. In fact, they significantly impact our own rainfall. Yet over 4,000 acres of this irreplaceable forest is being burned off each hour. That creeping inferno not only threatens everything from agriculture to drinking water, it's poisoning our environment as well. That's because all this uncontrolled burning is pouring forth carbon dioxide faster than surrounding forests can cleanse it from the air. As a result, burning rain forest is a major contributor to the "greenhouse effect" now predicted by so many scientists. The Loss of Tomorrow's "Miracle Drugs" While occupying only 2% of the earth's surface, rain forests support well over half of its wild plants, trees, animal and insect life, including vegetation that provides a quarter of today's drugs and medicines�treatments for everything from heart disease to leukemia. However, 99% of rain forest vegetation has yet to be evaluated for its medical value! Take possible cancer cures alone: it's already been found that some 2,100 varieties of rain forest plants possess cancer fighting properties. And no one knows how many others may do the same. Yet for all its promise as the world's greatest pharmaceutical storehouse, a section of this fragile resource the size of 10 city blocks is being burned off each and every minute! A Threat to Over Half the World's Wildlife Rain forests are home to at least 50% of our planet's wild species. And hardly any can survive elsewhere. Hence, the loss among these species (from the howler monkey and toucan to the gorilla and red eyed frog) is skyrocketing as they are squeezed into ever less space. Since over 685 species of birds, mammals and other wildlife already occupy just four square miles of typical rain forest, many will clearly die off as ever more of this habitat is mowed down. Burning the Answers to World Hunger It's ironic that much of the rain forest demolished is burned off for farming---ironic because without trees and plants this delicate land quickly turns barren. It is even more ironic because, if left to science undisturbed, these life-nurturing places could help produce bumper yields worldwide. How? Our own main food crops are as productive as they are because we're learning to interbreed them with their robust, disease-resistant rain forest relatives. By supporting National Arbor Day Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue Campaign, you'll be helping to end: *96,000 acres of rain forest burned off every day *17,000 species of plants and animals wiped out each year *70% of tomorrow's anticancer drug sources endangered *Fully one-quarter of all today's medicines imperiled *30% of man-made carbon dioxide fouling the world's air *Today's surest source of hardy new food crops imperiled To help, mail your name, address and phone number to The National Arbor Day Foundation with your contribution. They will preserve a 2,500 square foot tract of rain forest in your name for each $10 you contribute. National Arbor Day Foundation, 100 Arbor Ave. Nebraska City, NE 68410.

Sri Aurobindo Sri Aurobindo was christened Arabinda Ghosh in Calcutta in 1872. He was the author of 30 volumes of philosophy, poetry, political essays and spiritual discourse. Mirra Alfassa, his spiritual collaborator (known in India as the Mother), left a 13 volume Agenda on her experiences in the body consciousness, as well as 12 volumes of collected conversations and writings. Sri Aurobindo became a leader in Indian politics and was a primary spokesman for independence from British occupation. He wrote numerous articles in an attempt to awaken the masses who had been subjugated for some 200 years. The British imprisoned him in 1908 for sedition, but he was acquitted after one year. While in prison he had profound spiritual experiences, and shortly after his release an inner command told him to leave political life and go to South India. In 1926, Sri Aurobindo had a decisive experience which he called Descent of the Overmind, and he went into seclusion in order to manifest the supermind or supramental consciousness which he said was the next stage in the evolution of consciousness. This truth consciousness is a direct manifestation of the transcendent and is devoid of any duality. The advent of the supermind will bring about in humanity as radical a leap as the evolution of animal to man. Sri Aurobindo wrote extensively on this subject and what its effect will be on the physical body. The Sri Aurobindo Ashram developed an extensive educational program in the 1940s with a strong emphasis on integrality. After Sri Aurobindo's passing in 1950, the Mother carried on both the inner work of transformation and the outer work of the Ashram. A primary premise of the teaching is that nothing can be taught; the knowledge can only be evoked from within. A great deal of freedom of choice is also promoted for the student in his/her studies. Integral yoga places emphasis on the outer being as well as the inner-mental, emotional and physical. The integral educational system does likewise. Each individual is comprised of a mass of conflicting thoughts, emotions, desires, feelings, impulses, etc. The individual must first become conscious of these happenings within and learn to distinguish their source. One of the goals of integral yoga is to achieve a quiet mind and peaceful emotional or vital being, and to maintain a strong, healthy and flexible body so that it may be able to receive and contain the descending spiritual forces. Everyone has an inner divine presence called the soul or psychic being, which in integral yoga must come forward from behind the veil and have a direct influence on one's mental, vital and physical being. This is in effect a reorganization of the individual from a mass of conflicts to an integrated being that is reborn to a life of the spirit. The mental, vital and physical transformation cannot occur without this foundation of a receptive being. This dynamic in turn provides for further progress in cosmic and supramental consciousness. Auroville, an international experimental township, was inspired by the evolutionary vision of Sri Aurobindo and founded by the Mother in 1968. Auroville was created for people from all parts of the world to live together and explore cultural, educational, scientific, spiritual and other pursuits. Representatives from 124 nations and all the states of India attended the inaugural ceremony. Located on the southeast coast of India in the state of Tamil Nadu, Auroville consists of about 50 different settlements spread out over 2,600 acres within a 20 square mile circle. The population currently numbers more than 700 people from 25 different nations. Unlike most other educational systems, integral yoga places a strong emphasis on the body--for it too is to play a vital part in spiritual transformation. Experiencing Intrinsic Freedom by Peter & Penny Fenner According to the wisdom of Asian spirituality, our suffering and confusion is caused by becoming fixated on our experience. When we are fixated, we invest mental, emotional and physical energy in changing or maintaining our experience. All forms of fixation can be traced to a core assessment that something is missing in our lives. What is missing can be anything from a nice cup of tea, all the way through to enlightenment. We feel that "This isn't it," where IT represents our particular version of how things should be. We are sure that something is happening that shouldn't be happening, or that something that should be happening isn't. Either view is a fixation, which throws us into emotional confusion as we struggle to gain whatever IT is. We fear not getting IT, and having got it, we fear losing it. And by all accounts IT will probably be derived from our concept of a state of enlightenment--that is, a state of limitless possibilities and unending happiness. From time to time the experience that "something is missing" is displaced by the feeling that "This is it." For a time it seems that things are turning out as we wish. We figure that we are getting it, or have got it--this is how things should be. We might even convince ourselves that we have arrived at the long sought after goal of our spiritual endeavors. However, the belief that have got it sets up the possibility of losing it, as we reconstruct that we don't have enough of it, and that we could use more of it. We also question if this really is IT, and even if it is, whether we now want it. In one way or another, the core beliefs "this is it" and "this isn't it" underpin all our experiences of pain and pleasure. They throw us between the extremes of elation and depression, excitement and resignation. These fixations emerge as we attempt to produce a fixed and solid view about ourselves and the world. As the Chinese yin-yang symbol shows, two opposite beliefs emerge in dependence on each other--coexisting, separating and finally dis-connecting. When they have dis-connected, the two beliefs appear to be independent of each other. Our attachment to one as valid and the other as invalid produces a fixation. When the energy that fuels the separation and dis-connection of our conflicting beliefs is deactivated, we experience the natural clarity and ease of being present to life in a relaxed and non-judgmental way. By letting go of the energy that fractures our thinking, balance and harmony can be introduced into all areas of our lives. In place of struggle and tension, we experience freedom and openness. We learn to appreciate our thoughts, feelings and perceptions without needing to indulge or reject them. So how can we release and blend the energy of conflicting beliefs and thought patterns? The first step is to open ourselves to the dualistic nature of beliefs. We can begin to appreciate how all sorts of beliefs and attitudes are represented in our personalities. When we reject other people's beliefs and values, we can appreciate how those beliefs and values must be present in our own psyche. Otherwise we wouldn't reject them. For example, if we dislike ungracious people, it shows we haven't fully acknowledge and accommodated our own propensity to be withholding. Similarly, we only try to convince others of the truth of our beliefs if at some level we doubt them ourselves. In this way the world becomes a mirror reflecting our own imbalances and biases. We can also observe how we are inclined to react to our thoughts, feelings and perceptions in an extreme way. For example, we can begin to observe our tendencies to: make tasks easy or difficult; exaggerate or trivialize our own and other's experiences; dominate or acquiesce; resist or give in to our desires. If we honestly observe our tendencies to think and behave in an extreme manner, we are much less likely to manifest those behaviors. By filtering out excessive and intense responses, our lives become smoother and less complicated. As our lives become simpler and more peaceful, we can begin to feel the seed of harmony that lies at the heart of every conflict. We arrive at a "still point" in which stress, conflict and tension are automatically released the very instant they might otherwise have formed. At this point we are not using a method. We are naturally releasing the beliefs that limit, distort and invalidate the open, unimpeded and self-refreshing nature of the present moment. In doing so we gain the ultimate freedom to be who we are, without any need for posturing, embarrassment or contrivance. Our lives become naturally joyful, spontaneously creative, powerfully discerning and complete. Dr. Peter Fenner is the Founder of the Center for Timeless Wisdom, which offers the Intrinsic Freedom program and other courses. His practical courses translate the essential wisdom of Asian spirituality into modern, accessible frameworks. Penny Fenner is a psychologist and Director of the Center.

New Thinking in Health Education by Lee Hitchcox, D.C. Excerpted from his new book, Long Life Now, Celestial Arts 1996 Most of us are resigned to lead ordinary lives. Secure in the daily routine of job, commute and the week's laundry, there's no reason to question the balance. There are those who dream of something more: wild secret fantasies of intigue and adventure in some faraway exotic paradise, indulging in the pleasures of life while riding off into the crimson-red sunset. And then there are the select few who live their dreams. Most of us are resigned to the predictable future of growing old with everyone else, with its attendant consequences of Alzheimer's, incontinence and nursing homes. There will be 1 million American centenarians by the year 2040. If your goal is to soar with the eagles--to reach for and grasp a full active life well beyond 100---then you must seek information and act on it before your time is up. And you must realize there is more to this game than diet alone, especially when vested financial interests do not share your goals. Since the Industrial Revolution beginning in 1848, Western society has fundamentally altered the biological basis of human existence (diet and environment) from which health arises. Chronic disease is now considered normal. Well people are disappearing. U.S. Health Care Despite its armamentarium of powerful drugs and aggressive treatment strategies, conventional medicine demonstrates scant progress against the growing specter of resistant infections, autoimmune disorders and environmental afflictions of unknown origin. Heart attack patients, after undergoing heroically complex surgical procedures, are served the same abysmal foods that brought them to the hospital in the first place. President Bush was served steak on the night of his heart scare. U.S. soldiers returning from the Persian Gulf War were welcomed back with first-class medical treatment, ice cream and hot dogs. America has the world's most expensive health-care system, yet we rank 16th in life expectancy. No intervention with drugs or surgery can erase a lifetime of self abuse. Each year, nearly 400,000 Americans undergo heart bypass surgery for blocked coronary arteries. Most patients believe surgery will correct their problem. However, it is an immutable law of biology that a disease cause dby a detrimental diet cannot be corrected by surgery. We ignore this principle at our peril. Following heart bypass surgery, 50% of bypassed arteries clog up within 5 years. Following balloon agioplasty, 33% of dilated arteries clog up within 4�6 months. Each heart bypass operation replaces only 6 inches of an arterial system, but leaves the other 60,000 miles of total length. In most cases, these procedures do not improve survival. By treating symptoms with drugs or surgery while ignoring the underlying cause (diet), treatment often becomes an expensive exercise in futility. During recent doctor strikes in Canada, England, Israel and America, the death rates actually fell. Dubious and mercenary procedures lie at the core of America's health-care crisis. In 1985, the National Research Council recommended that U.S. medical schools include more courses in nutrition. Since that time, the number of medical schools offering nutrition courses has dropped. U.S. medical schools receive large endowments and grants from pharmaceutical companies. The Practice of Medicine Most physicians practice early detection or treatment to the exclusion of prevention. Doctors know that a 10% fat diet can prevent or reverse degenerative disease, yet few make this recommendation. There are several possible reasons: Insurance coverage - there is no realistic reimbursement for nutritional counseling. Tradition - doctors are not comfortable requiring behavioral change. Compliance fear - doctors are afraid people won't do anything if the changes are too drastic. Peer review fear - doctors don't wish to practice differently from their colleagues. Expectations - patients expect doctors to perform procedures, but successful prevention means no procedures performed. Lack of nutrition education - most physicians receive less than 3 hours of nutrition training during medical school. High-tech training - MDs trained in high-tech procedures think nutrition is beneath them. Real doctors don't talk about food. Personal eating habits - fewer than 20% of doctors have improved their own diets. Economics - moderate fat reommendation (20-30% fat) insure the continuing supply of cancer and heart disease patients. Patients generate profit. Prevention The healthiest, longest-lived people on earth have no access to modern medicine. They practice prevention. Profound social changes will occur when it's no longer considered normal to die young. The medical profession, pesticide industry, cattle ranchers and general public all share the same philosophical aspirations for a better world. There is, however, disagreement over the best way to get there. During the 1950s, dentists became so successful in promoting prevention (dental hygiene) that their efforts resulted in fewer cavities, fewer patients and a tougher environment to make a living. Several dental schools have since closed. This economic lesson is not lost on the medical profession. Dietary Advice Despite their education and training, physicians, chiropractors, dietitians and government scientists have a track record of dying from the same degenerative diseases as everyone else, because they have the same diet as everyone else. You can do better. Expert nutritional advice carries an air of reasonableness that often masks deeper, more vexing issues. Everyone, it seems, has a different opinion. At a time when contradictory studies and dueling authorities on both sides are the norm, it's little wonder why controversy prevails. The airwaves are now awash in oat bran commercials, claims, counterclaims and hype--as are we. Wading through the muddled piles gets pretty slippery when droppings of nutritional nuggets lie thick on the ground. The best defense is to realize that dietary advice originating from government agencies and prestigious national institutions is, in fact, economically-driven. As always, the devil is in the details, not the headlines. Disinformation Powerful special interests often influence national organizations. Protect yourself by recognizing corporate tentacles, tactics and marketing practices. Do not gracefully surrender your youth by falling prey to deception. To beat the system, don;t play by the company rules. Major industries know quite well that contentious issues are often adjudicated in the court of public opinion. Corporate public relations firms manipulate public opinion using various deceptive practices. Corporations often hire "third party" scientists to argue their case before the media. They represent themselves as independent and objective institutions, yet their positions closely follow those of their sponsors: In 1990, the National Dairy Board hired a PR firm to promote growth hormones in milk. The California Department of Agriculture claims that counties with the highest exposure to pesticides have the lowest breast cancer rates. This position conflicts with current evidence. The Ad Council's Partnership for a Drug-Free America receives funding from the alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. Consequently their public-service ads ingore America's real drug problems, caused by legal prescription drugs. Monsanto Corporation, which ranks among the 10 worst polluters, recently joined Earth Day USA and Business for Social Responsibility. The American Council on Science and Health (funded by Burger King) promotes fast foods. Dietary Components The U.S. holds the dubious distinction of consuming more meat than any other nation, with 70% of its protein from animal sources. Less fortunate nations forego that luxury and their low chronic disease rates contrast sharply with ours. There's a parallel between our nation and the Roman Empire: the Romans ate themselves to death. Emperor Claudius I regularly served banquets of port-stuffed sea urchins, roast deer, jellyfish, flamingo and parrot. The Roman upper class suffered from lead poisoning because their aqueducts, water pipes, wine vessels and glazed cooking pots all contained lead. Meanwhile, the poorer folks enjoyed good health by doing without banquets and lead pipes. Lest one believe that such indiscretions are a quaint oddity of the less enlightened and distant past, consider the billions spent by industrialized nations in waging war on degenerative disease (cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis) afflictions rare in developing countries. Informed Choices Health does not spring from magic bullets or soundbites. Modern diseases of affluence arise primarily from dietary exess, not deficiency. The notion of excess doesn't sit well in corporate circles since it doesn't sell products. To focus on products while ignoring the underlying cause is a formula ripe with failure. Isolated nutrients are not substitutes for the thousands of undiscovered essential components which whole foods likely contain. And isolated nutrients are no substitute for changing the diet either. Studies report that increasing fruit and vegetable intake can cut cancer and heart disease risk by 35-50%. Therein lies the seeds of dangerous advice: that the way to counteract dietary intemperance is to eat more of something else. The underlying cause (excess fat and protein) is seldom addressed due to aggressive marketing by the meat and dairy industries. In America, health is a business and most businesses operate by giving the public what they want. National institutions advocate 30% fat diets, while assuming anything less is "unrealistic and culturally unacceptable." Such cosmetic advice is arrogant. Consumers have a right to the information they need to make informed choices. No one wants their life cut short. No one wants to waste away in a nursing home as a stagnant pond of body fluids, bedsores and clogged conduits tethered to an IV pole. Immunity from chronic illness requires building a fortress of knowledge, hardened against the vagaries of artful deception, ornamental government recommendations and deeply-instilled aberrations that corporations would have you believe.

Home Info Links Email The Ultimate Cure: The Healing Energy Within You by Jim Dreaver, D.C. All healing stems from the fundamental spiritual energy of life itself, the beauty and power that is the source of creation. This energy is a rich and vibrant reality that can be accessed in every moment. It is experienced in the body as aliveness and joy, in the heart as peace and love, and in the mind as clarity and wisdom. The more you open to it, the more it heals, renews, and transforms every aspect of your life. How to connect with this energy is the subject of my just-released book, The Ultimate Cure: The Healing Energy Within You. The theme of the book--and the goal, or "ultimate cure," of the healing journey--is to discover the happiness that is your true nature, that is the direct manifestation of the source energy within you. This happiness is completely independent of circumstances. Once you're in touch with it, everything takes on new meaning. Physical pain and illness either clear up completely, or become much more tolerable. Psychological and emotional conflict fall away. You no longer worry about anything, or struggle to make things happen. You're more in tune with the deeper creative rhythm of life. You begin to discover for yourself that when your intention is clear and you have no attachment to outcomes, things happen very quickly. Your relationships become richer and more satisfying. Life in general is more spontaneous, more effortless, and more truly rewarding on all levels. How do you get to this place, where you live each day in the "flow"? Here are the three elements that I have found to be most important: FIRST, and foremost, you must learn to be very present, grounded, and centered in your body. Tapping into the source of inner peace and happiness is so much easier when you're relaxed and comfortable in your body. Slow, deep, conscious breathing--all the way down into your belly--is an excellent technique for releasing physical stress and tension. Movement and exercise are very important too. I love to do yoga and run along the country roads near where I live. The secret is to learn how to move your own energy, so that it doesn't stay stuck or contracted. SECOND, your heart must be open. This means being sensitive to what you're feeling. It's allowing space for your emotions to be there. It's practicing self-acceptance, not judging yourself for the mistakes you've made. It's accepting, feeling, your own suffering, and being open to the lesson in it. (Once you get the lesson, you won't have to go through that particular form of suffering again). Then it's extending self-forgiveness out to others, especially those who have wounded you. When people do hurtful things, it's because, at a heart level, they're completely unconscious. They're out of touch with the source, with the underlying unity, beauty, and sacredness of life. Their souls are crying out. People who wound others are themselves very wounded. Only through compassion and forgiveness are these deep wounds healed. The THIRD component of this threefold approach to transformation has to do with quieting and clearing the mind--and, ultimately, getting free of the grip of ego, of the attachment to "I," "me," and "mine." Meditation teaches you to dispassionately witness, or observe, the thoughts, images, and sensations that arise in your awareness. This in itself is an incredibly liberating skill. It gets you unhooked from the ever-changing drama and chaos of worldly and mind/body phenomena, and brings you to ease, clarity, spaciousness. You start to tap into the deeper spiritual energy that is always here. Then you can begin to observe the "observer," this "self" you've taken yourself to be. Enlightenment is simply living without any self-image or self-concept. It's to live from the openness and spontaneity of your being. You still have an ego, but it becomes much more transparent. It doesn't get in the way. When you stop holding onto any image of your self (even as a "spiritual seeker") an enormous amount of energy is released. Your real beauty and magnificence start to shine through. Dr. Jim Dreaver's new book, The Ultimate Cure, is published by Llewellyn and is available at your local bookstore.

Home Info Links Email Future Tachyon Energy Brings Better Health Today by Coleen Rehm "Physicists John Wheeler and Richard Feynman calculated that there is enough energy in the vacuum of a single light bulb to boil all the seas."OMNI, February 1991 I first heard tachyon energy mentioned on Star Trek: The Next Generation, little realizing modern technology had advanced so much that this space-age energy is available today. For over a decade now, people have reaped benefits from TakionicR Original Tachyon Products--for everything from pain relief and improved athletic ability to enhanced mental acuity. The list of top athletes, leading healers and other professionals who use these products reads like a modern-day Who's Who: Sheri Howard (three-time Olympian), Barbara Brennan, Dr. Gary Null (health advocate and author) and Curtis Sliwa (founder of the Guardian Angels) among others. On a recent NBC television show, The Other Side, host Dr. Will Miller illustrated (to his amazement!) how wearing a Takionic� belt dramatically increased his weight-lifting ability in only minutes. Tachyon energy exists naturally in space and in the air we breathe. It's an environmentally sound resource that's virtually impossible to deplete. The biggest challenge has always been finding ways to harness it for ready use. Twenty years of research, development and testing resulted in the creation of a unique, highly complex, patented silica-ceramic composite (known as Optimum Resonant MaterialsTM) that can only be found in the Takionic line of products, such as Takionic belts, beads, wrist bands and insoles. This unique compound of Optimum Resonant MaterialsTM simultaneously attracts tachyon energy and focuses photon (light) energy from the particular wavelength of sunlight that's essential to good health. The most unique benefit of these products is their ability to restore order from chaos. Stress of any kind (pollution, poor diet, electromagnetic radiation, lack of sunlight) creates water clustering in the body, decreasing water's permeability through body cells, tissues and organs. This traps water in cells and tissues, resulting in poor micro-circulation that reduces the body's ability to absorb oxygen and vital nutrients, and remove toxins and waste products. According to research done by Professor Toyoda at the National University of Shiga in Japan, Optimum Resonant MaterialsTM increase permeability and molecular organization of water in the body, breaking up large water clusters, to maximize micro-circulation and improve delivery of oxygen and nutrients through blood and tissues. Scientific research shows this results in up to 90% faster recovery from muscle fatigue, increased physical and mental well-being, and improved focus and concentration (20-30% increase in test scores in double-blind studies). These products also balance energy flows, contributing to the harmony and integration of various energy fields (physical to spiritual). The benefits of this technology are individualized to those who wear them. For example, S. Priebe, a radiation therapist in Idaho Falls, suffered from a circulatory disorder (Raynaud's syndrome), a heart murmur and fibrosystis in both shoulders. Within an hour of wearing Takionic beads, she felt a warm flush and ". . .an incredibly relaxed, peaceful, light feeling. My heartbeat calmed and evened out. I'm able to exercise my arms and not suffer excruciating pain in my shoulders." Dr. Andrew Ptak, a chiropractor with lumbar scoliosis, used a Takionic bead patch and his anatomically shorter leg straightened our in 5 seconds, lengthening to perfectly match his right! X-rays later revealed the curvature in his lumbar reduced 7 millimeters in one hour, and computerized muscle testing (using the Digital Myograph) showed all-over muscle improvement, but "the greatest improvement was with my lower back and hip--strengthened 528%!" As Thomas Edison said, "The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but interest his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease." These stories can give you an idea of the benefits you might reap using these amazing products. But to fully appreciate this technological breakthrough, you've got to experience if for yourself.

Daring To Know What You Want by Lynne Whiteley Novy, MFCC A gorgeous woman in her mid-20s leaned toward me, the look on her face an invitation to conspiracy. "What I want," she said, as though the words themselves were dangerous, "is to know what I want." She proceeded to list all the things that she did not want, including living at home with her parents, her secretarial job and being 15 pounds "too chubby." When she wound down, I threw out the obvious: "So, then, what DO you want?" Startled, as though she hadn't expected the question outright, she drew back and gripped her hands in her lap. "I don't know," she said. I waited. After a while, she said, "Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all." Again, I waited. "It doesn't really matter," she said. More waiting. "It's not possible." Silence. "I probably can't, anyway." Still I said nothing. Finally, in exasperation, as though she thought me too slow-witted to comprehend anyway, she yelled: "I want to be a rock star!" "Sounds good to me," I shouted back. How come it's so dangerous to say what we want? After all, it's a natural act. Kids do it all the time. As adults, though, I think it's risky business to tell the truth about what we want for two reasons: 1) We're afraid we can't have it. 2) We're afraid we can. If we imagine we can't have it, we're left to deal with all the feelings of undeservability, disappointment and limitation with which we surround ourselves. If we decide we can have it, we're forced to face up to actually doing what it would take to make it happen. What a rotten double-bind deal. So, what do we do? Well, we do the wise thing, of course. We pretend not to know. Or, even better, we decide not to want anything at all. Sounds good. In fact, some of us make a case for this as a major step toward enlightenment. Pointing to Eastern philosophies, we note that since desire is the root of all suffering, we're wise not to want. We declare desirelessness is highly desirable state. Yes, this sounds good. As with all things that sound too good to be true, however, there's an obvious catch: Pretending not to want does not desirelessness make. To consider it another way, here's a question: Is Mother Hubbard's dog no longer hungry just because she finds the cupboard bare? Not at all. In fact, the dog with no bone will eventually begin to chew on Mother Hubbard! Like hungry dogs, we all want. And want. And want. If we pretend we don't, we either starve or end up unhappily chewing on wrong bones. True wanting, wishing and desiring are instruments of our inner guidance system. To ignore them is to deny access to our own hearts. "Yeah, but what's the point of admitting I want to be a rock star?" said the young woman in my office. "What are the odds of my actually making it?" "I don't know," I said. "But all bets are definitely off if you never declare yourself." Daring to say what we want gets us unstuck and sets things in motion. It's also an act of courage because it leads us to the next layer of questions: Do we want this for its own sake? Is it our heart's true desire? Or is it a means to some other end? Here's where things get dangerous again. Sometimes we uncover hidden motives. Things that we think we shouldn't want, maybe, or things we'd like to avoid. Does the budding rock star genuinely want to sing her heart out on a strobe-lit stage for throbbing crowds? Or is her wish an exciting and elaborate cover plot to escape a boring life that's too attached to overly protective parents? Either way, saying what she wants leads towards her heart's truth. Unless we're willing to say what we want, we go against ourselves. We deny our heart's desire. And if we don't follow our heart's desire, I think we relinquish joy. Risky business, all right.

Cognitive Therapy by Carol Hasenick, MFCC Cognitive Therapy began in the 1960s when Aron Beck tried to prove that depression was anger turned inward. A psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist, Beck listened to the free associations, dreams and conversations of depressed people. He was surprised to find that depressed people had many depressing or negative thoughts which objectively appeared to be false. His curiosity led him to develop ways to question these thoughts and change beliefs. People were less depressed when their thoughts were more accurate. Research has improved on the techniques and enlarged their applicability. Today Cognitive Therapy is useful for depression anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, phobias, personality disorders and relationship difficulties. Children, teens, adults, individuals and couples can all be helped using Cognitive Therapy. Life experiences require that we somehow make sense of them. The resulting beliefs affect our behavior and mood. A child growing up in a home where he is constantly criticized may grow up with the core belief "I'm not good enough." This core belief is the root of behaviors, thoughts and moods. This person may be unassertive, may be an under-achiever, may think he is not adequate in his career, relationships or sports, and his moods might include depression and anxiety. The same core belief could result in different behavior, thoughts and moods in another person. Cognitive Therapy is collaborative--client and therapist bring their expertise into the therapy. Clients are taught to notice their moods, then to become aware of the thoughts that accompany them. These skills are first taught in the session. The client then practices until the skill is able to be used in even the most difficult situations. Next the client is encouraged to approach his thoughts with curiosity, rather than from belief in a thought. There is a questioning: "What evidence supports my belief?" Clients also find that they may do a behavioral experiment outside of the session to collect more information. Sometimes the client discovers that he needs to learn more skills, such as how to be assertive, how to make small talk at a party, or how to arrange his time to be productive at school or work. Role play, reading, classes, and talks with friends may be ways of gaining skills. Together the client and therapist use their expertise and creativity to customize the correct tools for the client. When problems have been long-standing, other methods are used to change beliefs. These include a thorough review of the client's childhood in a much different way than most other therapies employ. Other techniques are used to change the prejudicial beliefs. Courage and tenacity are required to form more accurate beliefs. Cognitive Therapy can come to a close when the client no longer jumps to his old conclusions, but instead considers the evidence to find out what is true. He has learned tools to prevent or decrease the severity of relapse. Carol Hasenick is a licensed Marriage Family Child Counselor. She received training in Cognitive Therapy in 1986, and has recently completed the 9-month Intensive Training Workshop. She has a practice in Santa Rosa, California.

A treaty with Russia, as well as concerns about the safety of long-termstorage, has prompted plans to dispose of these chemical weapons withinthe next 10 years. Although new technologies such as biological degradation,plasma destruction, and supercritical water oxidation are under consideration,the preferred method of disposal is incineration, which can build on themost extensive industrial experience. Since 1991, I have been involved in a large interdisciplinary research effortdesigned to help the Army ensure that the incineration process is safe andcomplete. The two main thrusts of the program are improving our understandingof the combustion chemistry of the chemical warfare agents and developingreal-time monitoring techniques to determine whether proper combustion conditionsare maintained during incinerator operation. The other Cornell faculty membersinvolved in the project are Fred Gouldin (also in Mechanical and AerospaceEngineering), Terry Cool (Applied Physics), Paul Houston (Chemistry), andGeorge Wolga (Electrical Engineering); the work is sponsored by the ArmyResearch Office. Recently, a related travel grant from NATO has allowedus to begin a substantive collaboration with scientists at Sandia NationalLaboratories, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and theSiberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Most of the Cornellfaculty, including myself, will travel to Novosibirsk for brief researchconsultations during the next two years; several Russian scientists willwork in our laboratories for more extended periods. Cornell's incineration project involves cooperation among severalresearch groups. Pictured above with Professor Elizabeth Fisher, from leftto right, are Ann Chojnacki, Erik Torniainen, Mike Feng and Eric Zegers.Dr. Chojnacki is a Post-doctoral Research Associ-ate in Electrical Engineeringwhile the rest are graduate students in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,working with Professors Fisher and Gouldin. Daniel Sokol, an aerospace graduatestudent, works on the flat-flame burner experiment. He adjusts valves nearthe visible spectrometer and flow metering equipment. My research is mainly in the combustion chemistry part of the researchprogram. The simplest description of combustion - the reaction of fuel withoxygen to form water and carbon dioxide, while releasing heat - indicatesonly the gross endpoints of the process. To understand pollutant formationand to identify appropriate compounds for monitoring, it is necessary tolearn the details of the destruction mechanism. Combustion occurs througha combination of physical processes such as diffusion of heat and radicals,and chemical processes such as fuel pyrolysis, attack by highly reactiveradical species, and radical recombination reactions. Even simple hydrocarboncombustion involves a large set of sequential and competing reactions -for example, a complete combustion mechanism for even so simple a moleculeas methane involves tens of species and hundreds of reactions. Larger moleculessuch as the chemical warfare agents have more decomposition pathways opento them. Incineration of chemical warfare agents is further complicatedbecause phosphorus, fluorine, sulfur, and/or chlorine are present, and becausetemperature and the extent of fuel/air mixing vary significantly from onepart of the incinerator to another. In order to understand the combustion chemistry of the chemical warfareagents, my colleagues and I are performing a series of experiments in avariety of combustion environments. Although our interest is in the destructionof nerve agents such as sarin, we perform our experiments with a familyof much less toxic "simulant" organophosphorus compounds withsome chemical resemblance to the real chemical warfare agents. Each experimentis designed to highlight a particular class of combustion reactions. Forexample, in our flat-flame burner experiments we use a relatively stablesimulant molecule; this choice minimizes the importance of unimoleculardecomposition reactions and makes radical attack the dominant mode of destruction.The relative simplicity of a given experiment gives us some hope of understandingthe decomposition mechanism relevant to it. By combining data from severalexperiments, we will build a chemical kinetic mechanism that is valid overthe broad range of conditions present in an incinerator. The developmentof a detailed mechanism may also lead to advances in other areas; for example,phosphorus compounds have been proposed as additives for fire retardancyand for increasing the combustion efficiency for hypersonic aircraft propulsion. My research involves experiments in (1) a low-pressure premixed flat-flameburner (joint research with Fred Gouldin) and (2) a turbulent flow reactorfor pyrolysis studies. Graduate students Eric Zegers and Daniel Sokol, postdocScott Hurst, and I have applied a variety of techniques to study the decompositionof simulant molecules in the two experiments. Undergraduates play an importantrole in the research program. Last year Aaron Levine and Jim Sperry, M&AEseniors, designed, built, and tested an optical system for directing aninfrared beam through the gases above the flat-flame burner, to allow in-situmeasurements of combustion products' infrared absorption spectra. The followingsemester Aaron wrote a program to determine temperatures above the burnerfrom the infrared absorption spectrum of carbon monoxide. In all, sevenundergraduates have contributed to this project, two of them supported byCornell - NASA Space Grant summer fellowships. Daniel Sokol, an aerospace graduate student, works on the flat-flame burner experiment. He adjusts valves near the visible spectrometer and flow metering equipment. Sampling and analysis of the organophosphorus compounds pose huge challenges:the extremely low vapor pressure and high polarity of some of the decompositionproducts make it extraordinarily difficult to get the sample through ananalytical device without loss of important constituents. On many occasions,our main research question has been, "Where did the phosphorus go?!"Non-extractive measurements, such as the in-situ infrared absorption techniquedescribed above, may be our best way of avoiding the sampling difficulties. Having solved some of the organophosphorus analytical problems, we havebeen able to move on to more interesting questions, for example, "Doesthe presence of phosphorus inhibit the flame?", "What mechanismis responsible for the formation of certain observed products?", "Howquickly does decomposition occur?". No one measurement technique willprovide information about all the species present in a flame; thus it isvital to combine data from many types of measurements. We test hypotheticaldecomposition mechanisms for consistency with all the experimental resultsand for plausibility. Our work is reaching an interesting point, where resultsof many experiments and computations are beginning to fit together and providea general picture of the organophosphorus combustion process.

Taylor. Thechallenge is to design and fabricate a rigid sail for a mono-hull sailboatthat will optimize the efficiency with which the wind propels the boat,especially to windward. For a number of years rigid sails have been usedsuccessfully on catamarans, twin hulled boats with considerably more favorablestability characteristics than a conventional mono-hulled craft. It remainedto be proven that the Cornell team could achieve as much and outperformconventional sails, using a Vanguard 20 sailboat as their test bed. To overcome the tendency of the craft to heel, or tip in a strong wind,the needed flexibility in the sail was achieved by designing an airfoilout of two separate pieces, joined together by flexible straps. Advancedcomposite material, consisting of fiberglass and metallic film was usedin the construction. The culmination of the three year effort took place this spring, a few weeksbefore graduation, with the first test of the craft on Cayuga Lake. Resultswere most satisfactory. This year's student team leaders, Chris Adler, CraigDer Ananian and Michele Lea deserve congratulations along with the restof their colleagues. But next year's team already has its sights on makingimprovements.

It will providestudents more experience with physical devices, the design process, electronicproductivity, and team-based work environments. Much of the initial equipment for the Design Studio has been purchased withfunds provided by the Product REALIZATION Consortium, headed at Cornellby Professor Albert R. George, the J. F. Carr Professor of Engineering inthe Sibley School. The Product REALIZATION Consortium has been formed witha cooperative agreement for three years from the National Science Foundationas part of the Technology Reinvestment Program. Funding is at $3.75 millionfor three years. REALIZATION is made up of five universities (the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical StateUniversity, Tuskegee University, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, inaddition to Cornell) and the Society for Manufacturing Engineers EducationFoundation (SME). The mission of REALIZATION is to initiate a systematic reform of undergraduateengineering education by providing an opportunity for engineering studentsat all levels to actually design and manufacture products to meet a widevariety of customer needs (i.e., to participate in the product realizationprocess).

It has been an exciting and productiveyear, and I would like to share with you some impressions. Perhaps the moststriking statistic of the School is the continued growth in undergraduateenrollments and degrees awarded. The figure below shows the history of bachelorof science degrees in mechanical engineering awarded annually for each ofthe last twenty-one years - roughly my tenure at Cornell, having come asa visiting assistant professor in the fall of 1974. The growth is remarkable- a virtual doubling of ME graduates to a total of 173 this past year, duringa period when the total number of bachelors degrees awarded by the Collegeof Engineering at Cornell has remained almost constant. (The plot comparesthe number of mechanical engineering graduates each year with 1/8 of thetotal number of graduates in engineering, since the Sibley School facultyconstitutes approximately 1/8 of the total college faculty; thus the plotalso informs us that the 'productivity' of the Sibley School faculty - atleast in terms of undergraduate engineering degrees - has grown to morethan twice the average for the college.) What are the forces driving this continued interest in mechanicalengineering? I have no quantitative data on which to base an answer to thisquestion, but there are several, rather obvious, factors that may be responsible.First, the trend is consistent with those at other engineering collegesthroughout the country, so there must be national forces at work. I believethese include the 'durability' of a mechanical engineering degree based,at least in part, on the breadth of a mechanical engineering education andthe recognition of the importance of manufacturing to the health of thenational economy. And, of course, manufacturing is an inherently mechanicalengineering activity. Second, I believe the trend also is influenced byfactors local to Cornell. As can be seen from a number of items in this,and other, editions of Sibley School Newsletters, there is a great dealof project activity in the School. These projects provide students withhands-on experience in design and the construction of engineering prototypes,help to develop communication skills and encourage teamwork, and motivatethe students to further study in a variety of technical areas. In addition,the enthusiasm of the students for this project activity is an extremelyeffective advertisement for mechanical engineering as seen by freshmen andsophomores. The quality of the faculty and the curriculum also must be factors, butmy perception is that these are uniformly excellent across the engineeringfields at Cornell, so cannot be responsible for large differences in growthrates between the various undergraduate programs. We were pleased to seethat, in this spring's U. S. News and World Report rankings of graduateprograms in engineering, Cornell's ranking improved to sixth in the nationamong research-intensive universities. Also, we were very pleased with theresults of a review of the Sibley School by an External Review Committeethis past February. The review committee, consisting of distinguished academicsand engineers from industry, and chaired by Dr. Richard Aubrecht ('66, MS'68, Ph.D. '70), Chairman of the Board of Moog, Inc., found the School andits programs to be of substantially higher quality than had been perceivedby most of the committee members before their visit. They concluded theirreport to Dean John Hopcroft with the words, "This is a very good department.Don't mess with it too much!" But a more complete discussion of thatreview, including our plans for the future, will have to wait for the nextissue!

Composting Facility Opens in Dakota County 1st in TwinCities — Source Separated Organics Composting SKB Environmental hasopened the first Twin Cities facility for composting sourceseparated organics such as food processing waste and soiledpaper. The site began accepting yard wastes in October 1996, andwill begin processing other source separated organics fromcommercial, industrial, and institutional sources early in 1997. Source separated compostable materials,blended with yard waste, will be composted using aeratedcontainment technology. These systems function much likein-vessel composting systems, but in a much less costly andcomplex manner. Through a twelve to sixteen week activedecomposition period, forced aeration maintains aerobicconditions within the containers and controls odor generation.Containers remain undisturbed throughout this active compostingcycle. Control of feedstocks, moisture, and oxygen consistentlyproduces high quality Class I compost — a high demandproduct for agricultural use, landscapers, contractors, publicworks developments, and other users. The new facility for source separatedcompostable materials is located on 37 acres within DakotaCounty's Resource Recovery Center in Empire Township. It is anoutgrowth of a preliminary pilot demonstration which wasconducted at SKB Environmental's Malcolm Streetfacility in Minneapolis. That experience coupled with thecompany's investigations of containment technologies prompted thedecision to pursue a full-scale facility. The facility's maximumthroughput, as licensed by Dakota County, will be approximately78,000 tons/year (50% source separated compostable materials; 50%yard waste). Initially volumes processed will be lower, but areexpected to grow quickly as education and marketing of haulersand generators takes place. The types of waste to be processed aregenerally limited to the following: (if your browser doesn't support tables,select the textversion) MATERIALS ACCEPTABLE FOR COMPOSTING Type Specific Examples Food Processing Wastes Hulls, rejects, and by-products resulting from food processing activities Food Preparation/Service Wastes Plate scrapings, coffee grounds, egg shells, or other scrapings or peelings from food preparation or service Wet or Soiled Paper Soiled or wet fiber products, including cardboard, paper towels, paper food liners, coffee filters, fast-food wrappings, or other compostable but not readily recyclable materials Yard Waste Leaves, grass clippings, brush, or wood wastes from commercial or residential sources Unrecyclable Paper Fiber materials separated by the generator for recycling but subsequently rejected or determined by the recycler to be unrecyclable. Garden Wastes Plants, Floral waste, Trimmings, Overripe vegetables, and other compostable discards from gardening and horticultural activities, or from florists or garden markets Construction & Demolition Transfer Station and RecyclingFacility In the heart of the TwinCities—Minneapolis and St. Paul, SKB Environmentalis developing a transfer facility for construction/demolitionwaste at 620 Malcolm Street SE. The facility will process C&Dwastes and recover corrugated cardboard, brick, wood, ferrous andnon-ferrous metals, and other economically recoverable materials. Rick O'Gara, SKB Environmental'sPresident: "Development of this kind of facility has been apriority for us. For C&D contractors and haulers in the urbanarea, we will represent a cost-effective alternative to haulingmaterials to remote landfills. Our location near Highway 280means there will be significant savings in travel costs andturnaround time for haulers using our facility — animportant factor in this industry." John Domke, SKB Environmental'sVice President: "Our schedule is to have this facility inoperation by mid-1997. It will be able to handle up to 1,400cubic yards per day. We will recycle materials for which thereare economical markets and will transfer the balance of C&Dwastes to licensed disposal facilities.

A wholly owned subsidiary of CarlBolander & Sons Company, Minnesota's premier specialists insite preparation and demolition, SKB Environmental wasformed in 1983, as one of the first privately held demolitionwaste disposal companies to serve the construction industry inMinnesota. In those early years, the company functioned as acomplement to Bolander's demolition business, arrangingcost-effective disposal services for construction and demolition(C&D) debris. In 1989, we opened Minnesota's firststate-of-the-art landfill for disposal of C&D waste. Typicalof the company's commitment to responsible practices, the RichValley Landfill is the first clay lined C&D landfill withleachate collection in Minnesota. In fact, it is one of a handfulof C&D facilities in the nation that combine such rigorousdesign features with stringent operating practices andgroundwater monitoring — becoming a model facility for theC&D industry. Environmental data from the Rich Valleyfacility was relied upon heavily in EPA's recent development ofRCRA standards for disposal of C&D materials. Informationabout potential impacts from C&D facilities is available in awhite paper and background studies prepared for the NationalAssociation of Demolition Contractors. Our commitment to environmentalprotection is also reflected in SKB Environmental's focuson recycling economically recoverable concrete,brick, block,ferrous and non-ferrous metals, corrugated cardboard and woodwaste in its operations. The first large-scale state-of-the-artC&D processing facility/transfer station in Minnesota's TwinCities Area is being developed at our facility in centralMinneapolis. Expanding our services to include yardwaste management — composting of leaves and grass andproduction of landscape mulch from brush and wood wastes, we havebecome the largest yard waste processor in Minnesota, currentlyoperating four facilities, with total processed quantitiesexceeding 60,000 tons in 1995. At the company's Empire Township site,another Minnesota "first" has opened —Minnesota's first composting facility for source separatedcompostable materials. The facility will blend wastes like foodprocessing residues with yard waste and compost the materialsusing innovative containment technology. SKB Environmental has anexcellent reputation:     for doing the correct thing environmentally;     for customer satisfaction, service, and value;     for the rapport and high regard the company has earned with regulatory and permitting agencies;     and for its performance record of never receiving a citation or notice of violation for any of its operations.

Demolition Landfilling Minnesota's state-of-the-art landfill fordemolition and construction debris is SKB Environmental's RichValley Demolition Disposal Facility. Opened in 1989, the facilityis designed with a clay liner and leachate collection system toprotect the environment now and in the future, providingenvironmental safeguards that ensure peace-of-mind for wastegenerators. SKB Environmentalprocesses demolition and construction debris yearly from largeand small projects. Material deposited in the landfill isvisually inspected to ensure environmental integrity, and acomputerized data system tracks the origin of all debris. At ourlandfill facility, C & D waste is first sorted forrecyclables, and then the waste to be disposed of is placed andcompacted to proper density. The landfill is manned and equippedto provide acceptable turnaround times which translates to costsavings for the customer.   State-of-the-ArtConstruction:     Two-foot thick clay liner        Leachate collection system         Upgradient and Downgradient ground water monitoring network     The schematic belowillustrates the design for the liner and leachate collectionsystem installed at the Rich Valley Landfill. At the landfillbase, the compacted clay liner has a minimum thickness of twofeet and meets a permeability specification of 1 x 10-7 cm/sec. The leachate collection systemis constructed of six inch PVC collection pipes (Schedule 80).Above the liner and leachate collection pipes there is a threefoot thick protective cushion/drainge layer, whichconsists ofnative sandy soils with minimum permeability of 5 x 10-3 cm/sec. The clay liner interceptsleachate as it percolates from the base of the waste deposit anddrainage layer. The upper surface of the clay liner is sloped sothat leachate flows by gravity to the collection pipes and thento a lift station. The lift station is a central collection pointfrom which leachate is pumped to tanker trucks for discharge to alocal wastewater treatment facility. Because of the comparativelyuncontaminated nature of the leachate, SKB environmental is notassessed a strength charge for leachate disposal. There are sixmonitoring wells, screened in the unconsolidated glacial driftaquifer underlying the facility, which are used to monitorupgradient and downgradient ground water quality.                                            Transfer        Station & Recycling Center         The Rich        Valley Landfill Recycling Center accepts "white        goods" and demolition and construction debris from a        variety of sources, including businesses and homeowners        through a transfer station. The station transfers        construction waste to environmentally sound and cost        effective disposal at the Rich Valley Landfill. Wood        products, car tires, and white goods such as        refrigerators, stoves, hot water heaters and washing        machines are recycled.         An innovative program to recycle        shingle waste into asphalt roadbase is also conducted at        the Recycling Center. SKB Environmental        is working with a large-scale shingle manufacturer,        Dakota County, and the State of Minnesota to evaluate        optimal amounts of this waste material that can be used        in state-certified roadbase mixes.                         Copyright © 1996SKB Environmental This site last modified: December 11, 1996 Developed by JohnH at LBA, Inc.

Many states, including Minnesota where SKBEnvironmental's corporate offices are located, havebanned it from landfills and from solid waste processingfacilities such as incinerators. Even if allowed under statelegislation and local ordinances, disposing of yard waste withother household trash may not make economic sense. SKBEnvironmental can turn a disposal problem into anenvironmentally beneficial product for soil enhancement orlandscaping. At its own sites or on a contract basis, SKBEnvironmental will provide services tailored for the needs ofyour community. Services offered include: on-site staffing;mechanized debagging; aerated static pile composting; productscreening, bagging and marketing; and brush and wood chipping,with either mobile or on-site grinders. We are proud of ourrecord in providing cost-effective, reliable and problem-freeYard Waste Processing services. For further information about SKBEnvironmental's services please contact us.  Sites and Locations SKB Environmental isnow Minnesota's largest Yard Waste processing company. Annually,approximately 40,000 tons of leaves, grass clippings andbrush are composted and 20,000 tons of wood waste andbrush are processed into landscaping mulch. At each of our composting sites, leavesand grass are processed into compost using the aerated staticpile method. Finished compost is screened and marketed for salein bulk or in bags. Landscape mulch is produced from brush and/orwood wastes. EmpireTownship SKB Environmental hasopened a composting site on 37 acres within Dakota County'sresource recovery project site in Empire Township. This facilityaccommodates two types of composting, yard waste only andblending of yard waste with other source separated compostablematerials such as food or gardening wastes which are thencomposted using innovative containment technologies. Containmentsystems control odors and nuisance impacts while saving space. Auniform, high quality compost is produced for landscapers andother users. Using static aerated pile composting and SKBEnvironmental's unique yard waste de-bagging system, theyard waste compost produced is reliably of a quality that isbagged as potting soil, compost, topsoil, and other soilamendments sold for unrestricted retail distribution. Under thefacility's license from Dakota County, it has the capacity toprocess approximately 78,000 tons annually. Lakeville Site SKB Environmental operates theLakeville Yard Waste Compost Facility on 10 acres within a 21acre site located south of Co. Rd. 42 on Pilot Knob Road in AppleValley, MN. The facility is open to the public, serving theresidents of Lakeville, Apple Valley, Farmington, Rosemount, andsurrounding communities in this rapidly growing part of theMetropolitan Area. CottageGrove Site The City of Cottage Grove's CompostFacility at Highway 61 & Jamaica Avenue is operated on acontract basis.

SKBEnvironmental has developed a cross country network ofavailable information relating to approved disposal facilitiesand regulating criteria. We can manage industrial waste disposalneeds in an efficient and cost effective manner and accomplishthis with an assurance that environmental risk is minimized forour customers. Conditionally Exempt Small QuantityGenerators Rules finalized by EPA in 1996significantly limit the range of disposal facilities which canmanage construction wastes or waste from the manufacture ofconstruction materials if they contain small quantities ofhazardous material. SKB Environmental's RichValley Landfill meets new EPA standards for non-municipalnon-hazardous waste disposal. For conditionally exempt smallquantity generators (CESQG) from the construction industry, thefacility's state-of-the-art design, operating practices, and performancerecord mean peace of mind. Asbestos In Minnesota, SKB Environmentalhas capacity for disposal of asbestos wastes. For projects andgenerators located elsewhere in the nation, we can assist withregulatory compliance and record keeping and arrange for disposaland management of asbestos wastes.         Copyright © 1996SKB Environmental This site last modified: December 10, 1996 Developed by JohnH at LBA, Inc.

Current research includes identification of baselinesoil characteristics and testing of compost applications todetermine whether it is possible to obtain an NPK(nitrogen/phosphorous/potassium) benefit comparable toapplication of commercial fertilizers. Research entails analysisof release rates throughout the growing cycle and tracking cropyields, testing after crops are removed to check residualnutrients as well as their availability and mobility compared tocommercial fertilizers. Testing is conducted at different soildepths to also measure nutrient migration. Analysis also measureschanges in soil characteristics such as moisture holding capacityresulting from compost or yard waste applications. Rick O'Gara, President of SKBEnvironmental: "We are happy to share informationabout our program with persons who have an interest in compostingand agricultural end uses. Waste professionals, agriculturalresearchers, and the public are welcome to schedule a tour of thefacility. As research results become available, they'll be madeavailable in our What's New section."

Maintaining that record isour top priority because it directly translates to peaceof mind for our customers. Our commitment to environmentallyresponsible recycling, waste transfer and land disposal meets theneeds of the demolition, construction and remodeling industriesfor services and facilities compliant with today's andtomorrow's regulatory environment. For land disposal of C&D wastes, SKBEnvironmental's policies require state-of-the-artengineering, construction, monitoring, and operating practices.On-site supervisors at all SKB Environmentalsites are state certified C&D landfill operators. Our new Minneapolisfacility will enable us toincrease the C&D recycling opportunities available at ourRich Valley Landfill and Recycling Center.Each of these facilities exemplifies SKB Environmental'smanagement philosophy. If you're concerned about C&Dmanagement, recycling, or regulatory compliance, please contactus. Demolition Landfilling Minnesota's state-of-the-art landfill fordemolition and construction debris is SKB Environmental's RichValley Demolition Disposal Facility. Opened in 1989, the facilityis designed with a clay liner and leachate collection system toprotect the environment now and in the future, providingenvironmental safeguards that ensure peace-of-mind for wastegenerators. SKB Environmentalprocesses demolition and construction debris yearly from largeand small projects. Material deposited in the landfill isvisually inspected to ensure environmental integrity, and acomputerized data system tracks the origin of all debris. At ourlandfill facility, C & D waste is first sorted forrecyclables, and then the waste to be disposed of is placed andcompacted to proper density. The landfill is manned and equippedto provide acceptable turnaround times which translates to costsavings for the customer.   State-of-the-ArtConstruction:     Two-foot thick clay liner        Leachate collection system         Upgradient and Downgradient ground water monitoring network     The schematic belowillustrates the design for the liner and leachate collectionsystem installed at the Rich Valley Landfill. At the landfillbase, the compacted clay liner has a minimum thickness of twofeet and meets a permeability specification of 1 x 10-7 cm/sec. The leachate collection systemis constructed of six inch PVC collection pipes (Schedule 80).Above the liner and leachate collection pipes there is a threefoot thick protective cushion/drainge layer, whichconsists ofnative sandy soils with minimum permeability of 5 x 10-3 cm/sec. The clay liner interceptsleachate as it percolates from the base of the waste deposit anddrainage layer. The upper surface of the clay liner is sloped sothat leachate flows by gravity to the collection pipes and thento a lift station. The lift station is a central collection pointfrom which leachate is pumped to tanker trucks for discharge to alocal wastewater treatment facility. Because of the comparativelyuncontaminated nature of the leachate, SKB environmental is notassessed a strength charge for leachate disposal. There are sixmonitoring wells, screened in the unconsolidated glacial driftaquifer underlying the facility, which are used to monitorupgradient and downgradient ground water quality.                                            Transfer        Station & Recycling Center         The Rich        Valley Landfill Recycling Center accepts "white        goods" and demolition and construction debris from a        variety of sources, including businesses and homeowners        through a transfer station. The station transfers        construction waste to environmentally sound and cost        effective disposal at the Rich Valley Landfill. Wood        products, car tires, and white goods such as        refrigerators, stoves, hot water heaters and washing        machines are recycled.         An innovative program to recycle        shingle waste into asphalt roadbase is also conducted at        the Recycling Center. SKB Environmental        is working with a large-scale shingle manufacturer,        Dakota County, and the State of Minnesota to evaluate        optimal amounts of this waste material that can be used        in state-certified roadbase mixes.                         Copyright © 1996SKB Environmental This site last modified: December 11, 1996 Developed by JohnH at LBA, Inc.

Primecare provides full cover for out-patient consultations and tests whether or not they are linked to in-patient care. Provision for Alternative Medicine These days alternative medicine is widely acknowledged to be a proven, effective way of treating a range of conditions. Unlike some other private medical plans, Primecare includes specific benefits for acupuncture, chiropractic, osteopathy and homoeopathy fees up to £1000 per year. Guaranteed Acceptance Our aim is to smooth the way for you from the start. So we guarantee you will be accepted as a Prime Health customer if you are under the age of 75 and resident in the UK. And you won't even have to take a medical. Basically, we apply a straightforward initial exclusion to any pre-existing medical condition for which you have received treatment, had symptoms of, sought advice on or were aware existed during the 5 years before commencement of your Plan. Any such pre-existing medical condition may become eligible for cover. Provided that you remain free of any treatment, advice, medication or check-ups for that condition or any related condition for a continuous period of two years following the start of the policy. Is There Anything We Don't Cover? Like all other insurers, there are certain things Primecare will not cover. For example: chronic long-term illness, wilful self-inflicted injuries, AIDS, normal pregnancy, cosmetic treatment, regular renal dialysis, routine examinations and GP and dental visits. Full exclusion details appear in the policy document.
