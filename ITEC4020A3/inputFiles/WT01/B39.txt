Gilliard BJS Statisticians The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction ofFederal or State correctional authorities was 1,053,738 atyearend 1994. During the year the States and the District ofColumbia added 78,847 prisoners; the Federal system, 5,447.Although the 1994 growth rate (8.6%) nearly equaled the averageannual percent increase since 1980, the total increase of 83,294was the second largest yearly increase on record.

Seventeen States, eachholding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held 4% of allprisoners. * At yearend 1994, State prisons were operating at between17% and 29% above capacity, while the Federal system wasoperating at 25% over capacity. * Since 1980 the Nation's prison population more than doubledon a per capita basis. On December 31, 1994, the number ofsentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents was 387-up from139 in 1980. * States with the highest incarceration rates were Texas(636), Louisiana (530), and Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) hadthe lowest rate, followed by Minnesota (100), West Virginia(106), and Maine (118). * In 1993 (the latest available data), the incarceration rateof blacks was 7 times that of whites. At yearend there were 1,471black inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents compared to 207white inmates per 100,000 white residents. The percentage of State prisoners serving a drug sentence increased almost 3-fold from 1980 to 1993 (6% to 22%). The percentage of Federal prisoners serving a drug sentence more than doubled, from 25% in 1980 to 60% in 1993. In recent years, although the number of drug offenders in the Nation's prisons grew dramatically (55,500 from 1990 to 1993), the number of violent offenders grew the most (up 82,100). ------------------------------------- Table 1.

The 1994 growth rate of 8.6% was greater than the percentageincrease recorded during 1993 (7.4%). The 1994 increasetranslates into a nationwide need to confine an additional 1,602inmates each week. Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year (referred to as"sentenced prisoners") accounted for 96% of the totalprison population at the end of 1994, growing by 8.6 % during theyear. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less orwere unsentenced (for example, those awaiting trial in Stateswith combined prison-jail systems). The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased less thanthat of sentenced State prisoners during 1994 (7.3% versus 8.7%).The rate of increase slowed to about half the 1993 growth rate. During 1994 prison populations increased in 16 States by atleast 10%. Texas reported the largest increase (28.5%), followedby Georgia (20.3%), Nevada (16.0%), Virginia (14.6%), andWisconsin (14.1%). Three States and the District of Columbiaexperienced less than 2% growth. The District had the smallestpercentage growth (.9%), followed by Oklahoma (1.4%), SouthCarolina (1.6%), and Massachusetts (1.6%). Fifty-six percent of the increase during 1994 was accountedfor by Texas (26,182), California (5,654), Georgia (5,642), theFederal system (5,447), and Florida (4,091). These jurisdictionsincarcerate over 40% of the Nation's prison population. * At yearend 1980, 1 in every 453 U.S. residents wereincarcerated; by yearend 1993, that figure grew to 1 in every189. * From 1980 to 1993, the total number of persons held in thecustody of State, Federal, and local jail jurisdictions grew byabout 863,000 persons. Sixty-two percent of the growth can beattributed to the growth in number of State prisoners (533,000). Between 1980 and 1993, the Federal prison population grew at faster rate (an average of 9.9% per year) than the combined State populations (8.2%) and the Nation's local jail populations (7.3%). Despite the higher growth rate, only 5.9% of all inmates were held in Federal prisons in 1993, up from 4.7% in 1980. * On December 31, 1993, almost 4.9 million persons were under some form of correctional supervision, including 2.8 million adults on probation and 671,000 on parole. The percentage distribution of the total corrections population was-- Confinement 28.0% Federal prisons 1.7 State prisons 17.0 Local jails 9.3 Community supervision 72.0% Parole 13.7 Probation 58.3 * Between 1980 and 1993, the number of persons undercorrectional supervision increased by more than 3 million. About19% of this increase occurred because of the growth in the Stateand Federal prison populations. * * * Rates of incarceration increase On December 31, 1994, the number of sentenced prisoners per100,000 U.S. residents was 387. Of the 14 States with ratesgreater than the rate for the Nation, 11 were in the South, 2were in the West, and 1 was in the Midwest. Four States, NorthDakota (78), Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine(118) had rates that were less than a third of the national rate. The District of Columbia, a wholly urban jurisdiction, held1,583 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents at yearend 1994.Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residentshas risen from 139 to 387. During this period, per capitaincarceration rates rose the most in the South (from 188 to 451)and West (from 105 to 333). The rate in the Northeast rose from87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest from 109 to 297. Thenumber of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 residentsincreased from 9 to 30 over the same period. Prison populations in Southern States grew the fastest During 1994 the average growth in the number of sentencedState and Federal prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,542additional bed spaces per week, about 179 more than the averageweekly growth in 1993. Regionally, during 1994 the percentage increase in the numberof sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, a gainof 13.1%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 6.2% in theWest, 5.8% in the Midwest, and 4.1% in the Northeast. In 29States the percentage change in the number of sentenced prisonersduring 1994 was higher than that of 1993. Among these jurisdictions, 16 had increases of at least 10%.They were led by Texas (28.3%), Georgia (20.1%), Virginia(14.9%), New Hampshire (13.9%), and Idaho (13.7%). In five States(Delaware, Maine, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Massachusetts)and the District of Columbia the number of sentenced prisonersincreased by less than 2%. In two States--Alaska andConnecticut--the number of sentenced prisoners declined during1994. Since 1989 net gains in the number of sentenced prisonershave averaged about 1,162 prisoners per week--a gain of about1,036 State prisoners and 125 Federal prisoners per week over theperiod. The largest net gains occurred in the South (500 inmatesper week), followed by the West (213 inmates per week), theMidwest (180 inmates per week), and the Northeast (144 inmatesper week). Texas accounted for 34% of the total growth in the 16Southern States and the District of Columbia. Californiaaccounted for two-thirds of the growth in the 13 Western States. In 1994 the 10 States with the largest prison populationsheld 55% of the total prison population nationwide, withCalifornia, Texas, and New York accounting for nearly 30%. Texashad the highest incarceration rate, with 636 sentenced prisonersper 100,000 residents, followed by Louisiana (530) and Oklahoma(508). During 1994 the prison population in Texas grew the fastest,increasing 28.5%. Over the past 5 years the State prisonpopulation of New Hampshire grew the fastest, increasing 73.3%.At yearend 1994 North Dakota had the lowest rate of incarceration(78 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents), followed byMinnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine (118). Seventeen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates,together held 4% of all prisoners in 1994. The number of sentenced inmates has increased in every Statesince 1989. Alaska (up 1.4% since 1989) and Maine (up 2.2%) hadthe smallest percentage increases. Four other States hadincreases of less than 20% in the last 5 years. Kansas had a5-year rate of growth of 13.5%, followed by Nebraska (13.7%), NewMexico (17.9%), and Wyoming (18.6%). Female prisoner population grew at a faster pace The numberof female inmates (64,403) increased at a faster rate during 1994(10.6%) than the number of male inmates (989,335 at 8.5%). At the end of 1994 women accounted for 6.1% of all prisonersnationwide. Relative to the number of women in the residentpopulation in the States in 1994, Oklahoma (with 96 femaleinmates per 100,000 female residents) and Texas (with 94) led theNation. North Dakota (5 per 100,000) and Maine (9) had the lowestfemale incarceration rates. In 1994, 28 States, the District ofColumbia, and the Federal system had more than 500 femaleinmates. Among these jurisdictions, 14 had increases of at least10%, led by the Texas increase of 27.2% (from 6,949 in 1993 to8,839 in 1994). Six States held fewer than 100 female inmates at yearend1994. Women represented less than 4% of all prisoners in NorthDakota, Montana, and Vermont. In 1994, 7.5% of inmates in theFederal system were female--higher than all State systems exceptfor Oklahoma (9.7%), Hawaii (7.7%), and Texas (7.5%). Local jails held almost 49,000 prisoners because of Stateprison crowding At the end of 1994, 23 jurisdictions reported atotal of 48,949 State prisoners held in local jails orotherfacilities because of crowding in State facilities. Texasaccounted for 42% of the prisoners sentenced to prison butincarcerated locally. Eight States--Louisiana, Texas, Virginia,West Virginia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee, andIdaho--held more than 10% of their prison population in localjails. Overall, because of prison crowding, 4.6% of the Stateprisoners were confined in local jails, down from 5.2% in 1993. Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare The extentof crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult to determinebecause of the absence of uniform measures for defining capacity.The 52 reporting jurisdictions apply a wide variety of capacitymeasures to reflect both available space to house inmates and theability to staff and operate an institution. To estimate thecapacity of the Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked tosupply three measures for yearend 1994: rated, operational, anddesign capacities. These measures were defined as follows: Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by arating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can beaccommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, andservices. Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners orarchitects intended for the facility. Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied ratedcapacities, 43 provided operational capacities, and 37 submitteddesign capacity. As a result, estimates of total capacity andmeasures of the relationship to population are based on thehighest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-fivejurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figurefor each capacity measure they reported.) Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity Prisonsgenerally require reserve capacity to operate efficiently.Dormitories and cells need to be maintained and repairedperiodically, special housing is needed for protective custodyand disciplinary cases, and space may be needed to cope withemergencies. At the end of 1994, 13 States and the District ofColumbia reported that they were operating at or below 99% oftheir highest capacity. Forty-one States, the District ofColumbia and the Federal prison system reported operating at 100%or more of their lowest capacity. By yearend, the Federal systemwas estimated to be operating at 25% over capacity. State prisons were estimated to be operating at 117% of theirhighest capacity and 129% of their lowest capacity. Changing demographic characteristics The demographic characteristics of the Nation's prisonpopulation are changing. Since 1980 the number of female inmatesin the Nation's prisons has increased at a faster rate (up anaverage 12.0% per year) than the number of male inmates (up anaverage 8.5% per year.) Despite their faster population growth,females comprised only 6% of all sentenced prisoners at yearend1994. In 1994 the male incarceration rate, 746 per 100,000 maleresidents, was more than 16 times higher than the femaleincarceration rate--45 per 100,000 female residents. Increasingpercentages of State and Federal inmates are from racial orethnic minority groups. Between 1980 and 1993, the latestavailable data, the percent of sentenced inmates who were blackrose from 46.5% to 50.8%. Relative to the number of residents inthe U.S. population, blacks at yearend 1993 were 7 times morelikely than whites to have been incarcerated in a State orFederal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 blackresidents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents wereincarcerated in the Nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. The number of prisoners with sentences of more than a yearrose 616,292 between 1980 and 1993 (up 195%). The number of whitemales grew 163%, the number of black males 217%, the number ofwhite females 327%, and the number of black females 343%. The growth in the number of black male prisoners (304,800)accounted for nearly half of the total increase during the13-year period. Hispanics, who may be of any race, are the fastest growingminority group--increasing from 7.7% of all State and Federalinmates in 1980 to 14.3% in 1993. During this period, theHispanic incarceration rate more than tripled--from 163 sentencedprisoners per 100,000 Hispanic residents in 1980 to 529 per100,000 Hispanic residents in 1993. At yearend 1993 nearly139,000 Hispanics were in State or Federal prisons. The total number of Hispanic inmates may actually be somewhatlarger. Because of variations in record keeping, some States areunable to report data on Hispanic origin; other States reportestimates only; and others report only partial counts. Data frompast surveys of State inmates, which are based on inmateself-identification during personal interviews, produce higherestimates of the number of Hispanic inmates. On December 31, 1993, nearly two-thirds of all sentencedprison inmates were black, Asian, Native American, or Hispanic.Growth linked to increasing numbers of inmates in prison forviolent and drug offenses The distribution of the four major offensecategories--violent, property, drug, and public-orderoffenses--changed dramatically in the Nation's prison populationbetween 1980 and 1993. As a percentage of all State and Federalinmates, violent offenders fell from 57% in 1980 to 45% in 1993,property offenders fell from 30% to 22%, drug offenders rose from8% to 26%, and public-order offenders rose from 5% to 7%. The rise in the number of drug offenders was the greatestamong Federal inmates. Prisoners sentenced for drug lawviolations were the single largest group of Federal inmates (60%)in 1993, up from 25% in 1980. The increase in drug offendersaccounted for nearly three-quarters of the total growth inFederal inmates. The percentage of inmates in State prison for a drug crimealso rose significantly, from 6% in 1980 to 22% in 1993. Nearly10 times as many inmates were serving time in State prisons fordrug offenses in 1993 (186,000) as in 1980 (19,000). In absolute numbers, however, the growth in State inmates wasgreatest among violent offenders. Between 1980 and 1993, thenumber of violent offenders grew by 221,200, while the number ofdrug offenders grew by 167,000. As a percentage of the totalgrowth in sentenced State inmates during the period, violentoffenders accounted for 42% of the total growth, drug offenders31%, property offenders 19%, and public-order offenders 7%. Average sentence length and time served for State inmatesrelatively unchanged Data on prison admissions and releases collected annually inthe National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) suggest thatgrowth in the State prison populations has not been the result oflonger sentences. (Each year participating States provideinformation on sentencing and time served for persons entering orleaving prison. In 1993, 38 States and the District of Columbiasubmitted data, accounting for nearly 93% of all admissions and85% of all releases nationwide during the year.) Between 1985 and1992, years in which comparable data are available, the average(mean) maximum sentences of prisoners actually declined from 78months to 67 months. The median sentence length (the 50th percentile) of prisonersadmitted from court remained constant at 48 months. Moreover,despite the increasing use of mandatory minimums and sentencingenhancements during the period, the percent of inmates whoreceived a maximum sentence of 10 years or longer actuallydeclined (from 19.7% in 1985 to 17.7% in 1992). The NCRP data also reveal no significant changes in the timeserved by offenders released from State prison during the period.In 1992 State prisoners released for the first time on theircurrent offense (that is, first releases) served an average of 22months in prison and 5 months in jail. (Time served in jail isthe amount of time an inmate spends in jail prior to enteringState prison and is credited towards time served on the totalsentence.) The amount of time served in prison was slightly lowerin 1985 (20 months), higher in 1986 (24 months), and about thesame since 1987 (22 months). These data reflect the time served by prisoners actuallyreleased. Some prisoners will never be released but will die inprison. Some prisoners with very long sentences do not show upamong released prisoners for many years. As a result, measures oftime served based on released prisoners tend to understate theactual time to be served by persons entering prison. Changing Federal sentencing linked to population growth The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 introduced "truth insentencing" to the Federal justice system. The Act created acommission that specified sentencing guidelines, which went intoeffect in late 1987. The guidelines took into account the gravityof the crime and the offender's criminal record. Under theguidelines offenders convicted of Federal offenses are expectedto serve a minimum of 85% of the actual sentence. After 1986 the average Federal sentence to prison for violentcrimes decreased, while overall time served increased. The resultis a rapidly growing Federal prison population. After 1986 theaverage time served by persons released from Federal prison rosefrom 15 months to 24 months (a 60% increase). For violentoffenses, the time served by first releases increased from 50months to 56 months and for drug offenses, time served increasedfrom 22 months to 33 months. The sentencing reforms also increased the likelihood ofincarceration for convicted Federal offenders. Between 1980 and 1992 the number of defend-ants convicted inU.S. district courts rose from 29,943 to 51,936, and thepercentage sent to prison increased from 46% to 75%. As a result,the number of offenders sent to Federal prisons rose from 13,766to 33,622--an increase of 144%. ("Federal Criminal CaseProcessing, 1980-90," September 1992, NCJ-136945;"Federal Criminal Case Processing, 1982-91, With PreliminaryData for 1992," November 1993, NCJ-144526.) Rise in State prison population the result of increasingnumber of arrests and higher probabilities of incarceration Underlying the growth in the State prison population has beenan increase in the number of arrests from nearly 8.3 millionadult arrests in 1980 to 11.6 million in 1993. Although the totalgrew by nearly 41%, for some offenses the percent increase wassubstantially greater: simple assault (139%), drug abuseviolations (116%), aggravated assault (86%). Compounding theimpact of more adult arrests for selected serious offenses, therate of sending offenders to prison rose between 1980 and 1992(the latest year for which data are available). Except for murderand nonnegligent manslaughter, the number of admissions to Stateprison per 1,000 arrests for serious crimes rose significantly.The likelihood of incarceration upon arrest increased 5-fold fordrug violations, increased 4-fold for weapons offenses, anddoubled for larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and sexualassault other than rape. As a result of the compounding nature of these factors, thenumber of admissions to State prisons from court rose from131,215 sentenced prisoners in 1980 to 318,069 in 1993, anincrease of 142%. Methodology National Prisoner Statistics This Bulletin is based on an advance count of prisonersconducted for the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) programimmediately after the end of each calendar year. A detailed,final count containing any revisions to the jurisdictions'advance count will be published later. Most States provide jurisdiction counts, that is, the numberof inmates under their jurisdiction on December 31, regardless ofthe location of their inmates. These counts exclude inmateshoused for other jurisdictions, such as other State's inmates andpretrial detainees, that are housed in a jurisdiction'sfacilities. Some States provide custody counts, that is, the number ofinmates housed in State facilities regardless of jurisdiction.(See Jurisdiction notes.) These counts exclude inmates housedoutside of each State's prison facilities, such as inmates housedin local jails. Custody counts are used to calculate the totalnumber of inmates in prisons and jails. Estimation procedures The offense distributions of State prisoners at yearend wereestimated for 1980, 1985, and 1990-93. To obtain estimates of thecustody populations by offense, data from inmate surveysconducted in 1979, 1986, and 1991, were combined with counts byoffense of annual admissions and releases. The surveys providedthe basis for estimating the offense distributions of the otheryears. The offense distributions were estimating using forward andbackward stock-flow procedures as outlined in CorrectionPopulations in the United States, 1992 (January 1995,NCJ-146413). Data from the 1979 survey were used for forwardestimates for 1980; data from the 1986 survey (conducted in March1986) were used for 1985 estimates, 1990 forward estimates, and1980 backward estimates; and data from the 1991 survey for 1991estimates and 1992-93 forward estimates. To obtain flow populations for each year, the offensedistributions of admissions and releases were drawn from annualreports of the National Prisoner Statistics (1980-82) program andthe National Corrections Reporting Program (1983-92). Data fromthe 1992 NCRP were used to estimate flows for 1993. The offense distributions of Federal inmates are forprisoners of any sentence length on September 30 in 1980 and1985. Data for 1990-93 are taken from the BJS Federal justicedatabase. Jurisdiction notes Federal--The rated capacity of Federal facilities on December31, 1994, was 68,221 inmates. This does not include contract bedspaces. The number of contract bed spaces at the end of the yearwas 9,534. Alabama--The capacity of the community programs is notincluded in the capacity figures reported. Population countsinclude 1,547 inmates housed in local jails as of December 31,1994, because of overcrowding. Alaska--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. All NPSdata include jail and prison populations. Alaska's capacity isestablished by the Cleary final settlement agreement with theState court and the Community Residential Centers program. Arizona--Population counts are based on custody data.Population counts exclude 118 inmates housed in local jailsbecauseof crowding in the State facilities. Arkansas--Population counts include 565 inmates housed inlocal jails as of December 31, 1994, because of overcrowding. California--Population counts are based on custody data. Colorado--Population counts for m sentence" include anundetermined number of "Inmates with a maximum sentence of 1year or less." Design and operational capacities do notinclude the Bent County Correctional Facility, owned and operatedby the county of Bent (Las Animas, Colorado) and MinnesotaPrairie Correctional Facility (Appleton, Minnesota) which arecontracted. The Bent County facility holds 320 prisoners and theMinnesota facility holds 405 prisoners for the State of Colorado. Population counts include 815 inmates housed in local jailsbecause of crowding in State facilities. Connecticut--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.All NPS data include prison and jail populations. Delaware--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. AllNPS data include jail and prison populations. Capacity countsinclude the halfway houses under the Department of Corrections. District of Columbia--Prisons and jails form one integratedsystem. All NPS data includes jail and prison populations. Florida--Population counts are based on custody data. Georgia--Population counts are based on custody data. Inmates housed in local jails are not considered part of theprison population until they are admitted. Most inmates areawaiting transfer into the prison system. An undetermined numberwere held because of crowding. Hawaii--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. All NPSdata include jail and prison populations. Population counts for"Inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence" includeparole and probation violators. These inmates were previouslycounted as "Unsentenced inmates." Idaho--Population counts include 312 inmates housed in localjails because of crowding of State facilities. Illinois--Population counts are based on custody data.Population counts for "Inmates with over 1 year maximumsentence" include an undetermined number of "Inmateswith a maximum sentence of 1 year." Capacity figures include875 inmates on electronic detention. Indiana--Prison population counts include 903 inmates whowere housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because ofcrowding of State facilities. Another floor was opened in afacility to accommodate a larger number of inmates; as a result,capacity was increased and some crowding was reduced. Iowa--Population counts are based on custody data. Kansas--Population counts for "Inmates with over 1 yearmaximum sentence" include a small undetermined number ofinmates with a sentence of less than 1 year (among thosesentenced under the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act of 1993). Kentucky--Population counts include 632 inmates who werehoused in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because ofcrowding of State facilities.

The number of inmates held in the Nation's local jails onJune 30, 1994, reached a record high of 490,442. Local jails,which are operated by counties and municipalities andadministered by local government agencies, housed about a thirdof all persons incarcerated in the U.S. at midyear 1994; theother two-thirds were in State or Federal prisons. The jail population grew by 30,638 inmates between July 1,1993, and June 30, 1994, the third largest annual increaserecorded since 1983. The 12-month increase was the equivalent ofa 6.7% rate of growth. Between 1983 and 1993, when comparable statistics werecollected, the number of local jail employees grew at a fasterrate than the number of inmates. During this period, the numberof jail inmates increased at an annual rate of 7.5%, while thenumber of full-time and part-time jail employees grew at anannual rate of 10%. By midyear 1993, local jails employed anestimated 165,500 persons. Highlights After a decade of record growth, the number of inmates inlocal jails reached a high of 490,442 on June 30, 1994 Annual Survey Census of Jails of Jails ------------------------------------------- 1983 1988 1993 1994 -------------------------------------------------------------- Number of inmates 223,551 343,569 459,804 490,442 Rated capacity of jails 261,556 339,949 475,224 504,324 Percent of capacity occupied 85% 101% 97% 97% Number of jails 3,338 3,316 3,304 -- Number of staff 64,560 99,631 165,500 -- Number of inmates per employee 3.5 3.4 2.8 -- Annual operating expenditures per inmate $9,360 $10,639 $14,667 -- --Not collected. * The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residentsincreased from 96 in 1983 to 188 in 1994. * In 1993, 8 States had over 200 local jail inmates per100,000 residents: Louisiana (377), Georgia (328), Texas (307),Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225), California (222),and Nevada (215). * Between 1983 and 1993 the number of jail inmates increased106%; the total jail staff increased 156%; and the number ofcorrectional officers grew 165%. * At midyear 1994 the capacity of the Nation's local jailswas 504,324 inmates, as measured by the number of beds allottedby State or local rating officials. * The jail population was 97% of rated capacity. Jail spaceincreased 93% between 1983 and 1994. * White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail population;black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non-Hispanics ofother races, 2%. Factors underlying the growth in the Nation's jail populationincluded: * an increase in adult arrests * a growth in jail admissions * an increased number of felons sentenced to local jails * an increased number of inmates charged with or convicted ofdrug offenses * more inmates held in jails because of crowded State orFederal facilities. Data sources The data in this report are based on results from the 1993Census of Jails and the 1994 Annual Survey of Jails. Every 5years the jail census collections provide detailed information onlocal jail inmates, staff, facilities, and programs. Previouscensuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988.Beginning in 1982 and in years between each jail census, a sampleof jails has been surveyed to obtain basic information on inmatesand jail capacity. These annual surveys provide national-levelestimates on fewer characteristics than the census. (SeeMethodology at end.) As defined in this report, jails are locally operatedcorrectional facilities that confine persons before or afteradjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail usually have a sentenceof a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons in a widevariety of other categories. Jails-- * receive individuals pending arraignment and hold themawaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and absconders * temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile authorities * hold mentally ill persons pending their movement toappropriate health facilities * hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of sentence * transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities * relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile andmedical authorities * sometimes operate community-based programs with electronicmonitoring or other types of supervision. Not included in the survey or census are inmates in sixStates with combined jail and prison systems. At midyear 1994these States-Alaska (except for 5 local jails), Connecticut,Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont--held nearly 6,000inmates who were unsentenced or had sentences of less than ayear. These inmates and the facilities that house them areincluded in BJS prison statistics. The 1993 Census of Jails also included, for the first time,seven Federal facilities that perform the pretrial functions oflocal jails. Data on these Federal facilities and inmates arereported separately. (See the section on Federal jails.) Local jail inmates On June 30, 1994, the Nation's jails held 490,442 inmates, anincrease of 6.7% over the number held on June 30, 1993. The jailpopulation grew by more than 30,000 inmates during the 12-monthperiod, the third largest increase ever recorded. Since 1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on aper capita basis. During this period, the number of jail inmatesper 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188. At midyear 1994 about1 in every 398 adult residents of the United States was in alocal jail. An estimated 6,725 persons under age 18 were housed in adultjails on June 30, 1994. Over three-quarters of them had beenconvicted or were being held for trial as adults in criminalcourt. Most juveniles in correctional custody are housed injuvenile facilities. Who is a juvenile? Most, but not all, States define a juvenile as a person underage 18 who is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction. Exceptionsusually depend on offense severity or an offender's adjudicationhistory. In the 1993 census and 1994 survey, to achieve reportinguniformity, jail authorities were asked to report the number ofinmates under age 18. Of the 6,725 total in 1994, 76% wereidentified as juveniles tried or scheduled to be tried as adults.Statutes and judicial practice some- times allow youths to beheld in adult jails. Often juveniles accused of acts that arecrimes for adults may be held in local jails or police lockups,given certain conditions: * separated by sight and sound from the general population * held for a limited time, typically less than 6 hours. Most confined juveniles are housed in institutions specifiedfor them. In 1993 about 96,000 were in public and privatejuvenile detention and correctional facilities. The average daily population for the year ending June 30,1994, was 479,757, an increase of 2.9% from 1993. Between 1983and 1993, when separate counts by sex were collected, the averagedaily population of female inmates grew at a faster rate (up11.1% per year) than the average daily population of adult maleinmates (up 7.1% per year). States with the largest jail populations In 1993, 5 States incarcerated slightly less than half of alllocal jail inmates: California (69,298 inmates), Texas (55,395),Florida (34,183), New York (29,809), and Georgia (22,663).Twenty-one States reported a jailpopulation that more thandoubled between 1983 and 1993, with growth ranging from 103% inMaryland to 264% in Texas. States that had the largest number of jail inmates per100,000 residents in 1993 were Louisiana (377), Georgia (328),Texas (307), Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225),California (222), and Nevada (215). States with a jailincarceration rate less than half that of the Nation (178 per100,000) were Iowa, Maine, and North Dakota (57), Minnesota andMontana (81), and South Dakota (87). The number of local jail inmates rose the most in the Southand the least in the Midwest. From 1983 to 1993 the inmatepopulation grew 135% in the South, 102% in the Northeast, 81% inthe West, and 79% in the Midwest. For the Nation a declining number of jails held theseincreasing numbers of inmates. In 1993 the total of 3,304facilities was 12 fewer than 5 years before and 34 fewer than in1983. Facility size and the percentage of the inmate populationheld A small number of jails held a disproportionate share of theNation's jail inmates. About 6% of the jail facilities housedmore than half of all jail inmates on June 30, 1993. Facilitieswith an average daily population of 500 or more during the annualperiod ending June 30, 1993, held 53% of local jail inmates.Facilities with an average daily population of fewer than 50persons comprised 57% of all jails but housed about 8% of allinmates. Demographic characteristics of local jail inmates Male inmates made up 90% of the local jail inmate populationat midyear 1994, down from 93% in 1983. An estimated 1 in every212 adult men and 1 in every 2,048 adult women were held in alocal jail on June 30, 1994. On June 30, 1994, a majority of local jail inmates were blackor Hispanic. White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jailpopulation; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and otherraces (Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and AlaskaNatives), 2%. Relative to the number of residents in the U.S. population,black non-Hispanics were more than twice as likely as Hispanics,nearly 7 times more likely than white non-Hispanics, and over 9times more likely than persons of other races to have been heldin a local jail on June 30, 1994. Federal jails June 30, 1994 ----------------------------------------- Estimated number Number of inmates of inmates per 100,000 population ------------------------------------------------------------ Total 490,442 188 White non-Hispanic 191,900 100 Black non-Hispanic 215,400 691 Hispanic 75,500 290 Other race 7,700 74 Note: U.S. resident populations were estimated. Inmate countswere adjusted for nonresponse and rounded to the nearest 100.Rates were based on relevant population subgroups. Adult conviction status, mid-1993 On June 30, 1993, the most recent date for available data, atleast half the Nation's adult jail inmates had been convicted ontheir current charge. Convicted inmates include those awaitingsentencing, serving a sentence, or returned to jail for aviolation of probation or parole. Between 1983 and 1993 thereported number of convicted inmates more than doubled (from107,660 to 226,600). The number of jail inmates awaiting courtdisposition also doubled (from 113,984 to 228,900). In 1993 female inmates were somewhat more likely than maleinmates to have been convicted. Among adult female inmates, 52%had been convicted on their current charge, compared to 50% ofthe male inmates. Rated capacity and percent occupied At midyear 1994, therated capacity of the Nation's local jails totaled 504,324. Ratedcapacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated byState or local rating officials to each jail facility. During the12 months ending June 30, 1994, an estimated 29,100 beds wereadded. Nearly a quarter of a million beds have been added since1983. As of June 30, 1994, 97% of the local jail capacity wasoccupied. As measured by a ratio of the number of inmates housedin jail facilities to the rated capacity, the percent of capacityactually occupied may have been somewhat lower than 97%. Includedamong the total jail inmates were an unknown number of inmateshoused outside of jail facilities--under electronic monitoring,on house arrest, under other kinds of community supervision, ortemporarily in hospitals or treatment centers. As a ratio of all inmates to capacity, the percent ofcapacity occupied increased considerably after 1983, reaching arecord 108% in 1989 and then falling to 97% in 1993. Since 1989rated capacity has risen by nearly 137,000 beds, while the numberof inmates has increased by 95,000. In 1993 the total jail population exceeded jail capacity ineight States and the District of Columbia. Percent of jail State capacity occupied --------------------------------------- Virginia 160% South Carolina 124 District of Columbia 121 New Jersey 120 Texas 115 California 113 Massachusetts 106 Washington 102 Pennsylvania 101 In eight other States, excluding Alaska, the total jailpopulation was below 75% of the combined capacity of all localjails. The lowest occupancy rates were in North Dakota (43%),followed by Wyoming (52%), South Dakota (54%), and Montana (60%).Between 1988 and 1993 the capacity of the Nation's local jailsincreased by 40%, from 339,949 beds to 475,224. In eight Statesthe capacity of local jails increased by more than 60% during the5-year period. Jails in New Hampshire and Massachusettsexperienced the largest percentage increase in capacity. Duringthis period the combined capacities of jails declined in thefollowing jurisdictions: West Virginia, Montana, and the Districtof Columbia. In every census year, facilities with the largest averagedaily populations have reported the highest occupancy rates. In1993 occupancy was 111% of rated capacity in jails with anaverage population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 67% inthose with fewer than 50 inmates. The 25 largest jail jurisdictions In 1994 the Nation's 25 largest jail jurisdictions accountedfor 30% of all jail inmates. The jurisdictions were in 12 States:7 in California; 5 in Texas; 4 in Florida; and 1 each in NewYork, Illinois, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arizona, Pennsylvania,Maryland, Georgia, and Michigan. New York City's system, with 15 institutions, had the largestnumber of facilities. The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los AngelesCounty and New York City, together held more than 38,284, or 8%of the national total. Overall, the 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1994, had atotal population of 149,082 inmates, 10% more than the 135,060 ayear earlier. In 1994, 15 jurisdictions reported having a larger averagedaily population than in 1993. Dallas County, Texas, reported the largest single yeargrowth--2,123 inmates--and the largest growth from 1988 to1994--5,494. Shelby County (Memphis), Tennessee, reported thelargest decrease from 1993 to 1994--1,327 inmates. Local jail employees Local jails employed an estimated 165,500 persons on June 30,1993. Including all full-time and part-time, payroll andnonpayroll staff, the total staff grew by more than 100,000between 1983 and 1993, an increase of 156%. The staff total included 117,900 correctional officers, theemployees most responsible for providing a secure environment andfor directly supervising inmates. Correctional officers comprisedabout 7 in every 10 jail employees in the 3 censuses, 1983-93. Characteristics of local jail staff At midyear 1993 men comprised 70% of all paid jail staff and76% of correctional officers. Excluded were nonpayroll jailemployees, such as teachers or counselors, who were paid byagencies other than jails. Between 1988 and 1993 the female staff in local jails nearlydoubled, from 25,642 to an estimated 48,000. In 1993 nearly athird of all paid staff and a quarter of correctional officerswere women. The race and ethnic composition of jail staffremained unchanged between 1988 and 1993. White employees made upan estimated 71% of the payroll jail staff in 1993, including 69%of the correctional officers. Blacks comprised 22% of all employees, including 23% of thecorrectional officers. Hispanics accounted for 6% of the totalpaid staff and 7% of correctional officers. Inmate-to-staff ratios, 1993 From 1983 to 1993 the number of U.S. jail employees increased156%, as the number of correctional officers went up 165%. Jailstaffs in the Northeast had the largest percentageincreases--more than tripling in 10 years--while those in theMidwest had the smallest, more than doubling. The South, theregion with the largest number of jail employees, registered thegreatest regional growth (75%) from 1988 to 1993. The West, withless than half the number of employees in the South, also had theleast growth in staff (50%). Throughout the period, 1983-93, thejail staff in the Nation and in every region grew more rapidlythan the inmate population. In 1993 jails held 2.8 inmates peremployee. The ratio in 1993 was almost a fifth lower than the 3.4inmates per employee in 1988. As a measure of workload, the number of inmates percorrectional officer also declined, from 4.7 in 1988 to 3.9 in1993. All four regions had decreases in inmate-to-correctionalofficer ratios. The West reported the sharpest decline, from 7.1inmates per officer in 1983 to 5.3 in 1993. The smallerfacilities had fewer inmates per correctional officer (2.4) thandid larger jails (4.6 inmates per officer in the jails with a1,000 or more inmates). The jails that were operating with aninmate population at least 10% over their rated capacity had aninmate-to-correctional officer ratio almost twice that of jailswith less than 75% of capacity occupied. Jails with 91% to 110%of capacity filled employed a correctional officer for more thanevery 4 inmates. Annual jail expenditures Local jails throughout the United States spent a total ofslightly over $9.6 billion during the year ending June 30, 1993.This estimated total (not adjusted for inflation) was more thandouble the $2.7 billion spent in 1983. Approximately 71% of all reporting facilities were able toprovide data on expenditures in 1993. These jails reported totalannual expenditures were nearly $7.8 billion; operating costs,about $5.5 billion; and capital expenditures, $2.2 billion. Gross salaries and wages, employer contributions to employeebenefits, purchases of food, supplies, contractual services, andother current operating costs accounted for 71% of expenditures.Construction costs, major repairs, equipment, improvements, landpurchases, and other capital outlays accounted for the remaining29%. In 1988, operating costs made up 78% of all expenditures andcapital outlays, 22%. Average operating cost per inmate Excluding capital outlays in 1993, the average cost to keepone jail inmate incarcerated for a year was $14,667. Over 10years the cost per inmate had risen 57% from $9,360. (Adjustedfor inflation to 1983 dollars the annual cost per inmate haddecreased by 11%.) The Northeast had the highest averageoperating expenditure per inmate ($22,678) and the South, thelowest ($11,697). Excluding Alaska and the District of Columbia,average annual operating costs per inmate by State were highestin New York ( $29,297) and lowest in Mississippi ($7,014). Inmate deaths During the year ending June 30, 1993, 647 inmate deathsoccurred in the jurisdiction of the jail authorities who provideddata on such deaths. Although asked to report the death ofinmates under the jurisdiction of jail authorities, regardless ofwhere the death took place, some facilities could report onlydeaths that occurred on the jail premises. In addition, about 10%of all jails were unable to report whether any inmate deaths hadoccurred in 1993. In 1993 illness was the leading cause of death in local jails(45%), followed by suicide (36%). Acquired immune deficiencysyndrome (AIDS) accounted for about 10% of reported inmatedeaths; homicide, 3%; and other causes, 6%. The death rate among jail inmates fell by more than a thirdbetween 1983 and 1993, from 232 to 149 per 100,000 inmates. Whilethe rate of death from illness, including AIDS, remainedrelatively constant over the period, the rate of suicide declinedsharply, from 129 per 100,000 in 1983, to 85 in 1988, to 54 in1993. Federal jails In 1993 the Federal Bureau of Prisons maintained a smallnumber of detention facilities that functioned as jails. Thesewere not counted among the city, county, or regional adultdetention facilities called local jails in this report. Localfacilities, however, did hold about 12,000 persons for Federalauthorities, according to data reported by 90% of all facilities.At midyear 1993 the Bureau of Prisons operated 7 jails, holding5,899 persons who were awaiting adjudication or serving asentence, usually of a year or less. Inmate demographics Ninety-three percent of Federal jail inmates were men, aslightly higher proportion than in local jails (90%). Seventy-twopercent were white, 25% were black, and 3% were Asians, PacificIslanders, American Indians, or Alaska Natives. Conviction status Slightly more than half of the Federal inmates wereunconvicted and were awaiting arraignment, trial, or thecompletion of their trial. Facility capacity The 7 Federal jails had a combined rated capacity of3,810-the population being 155% of that capacity. The percentoccupied was about 50% higher than that of local jails ofcomparable size. Inmate deaths Eight inmates died while under the jurisdiction of Federaljail authorities during the annual period ending June 30, 1993.Four deaths resulted from illness or natural causes, two weresuicides, and two were drug overdoses. Staff Seventy-five percent of Federal jail employees were male, ahigher percentage than the 70% of employees for local facilities.A majority of the Federal jail employees were correctionalofficers. Overall, there were 2.9 inmates per staff member in Federaljails, about the same as in local facilities where the ratio was2.8 inmates per employee. However, the number of inmates percorrectional officer (5.5) was higher than in local jails with500 to 999 inmates (4.4). Expenditures Federal jail expenditures totaled slightly more than $166million during the annual period ending June 30, 1993, excludingthose at the Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, facility, in operation only afew months at the time of the census. Gross salaries and wages,contributions to employee benefits, purchases of food, supplies,contractual services, and other current operating costs accountedfor 76% of expenditures. Construction costs, major repairs,equipment, improvements, land purchases, and other capitaloutlays made up the remaining 24%. The average cost to house one Federal jail inmate during theyear ending June 30, 1993, exclusive of capital expenditures was$22,773, as compared to $14,667 among local jails.

Factors behind the growing jail population An increasing number of arrests Underlying the dramatic growth of the Nation's local jailpopulation after 1983 was a rise in the number of arrests from11.7 million in 1983 to 14.0 million in 1993. Over the 10-yearperiod, the total number of arrests grew at an annual rate of1.8%. For some offenses the annual rate of growth wassubstantially greater: simple assault (7.6%), aggravated assault(5.8%), drug abuse violations (5.4%), and weapons violations(3.9%). The increase in arrests resulted in a growing number ofadmissions to local jails. On June 30, 1993, an estimated 26,800persons were officially booked and admitted to local jails, andan additional 9,500 inmates were transferred in from otherfacilities or readmitted after having been temporarily released.The estimated number of new admissions totaled nearly 9.8 millionfor 1993, up from an estimated 6.0 million in the annual periodending June 30, 1983. Among inmates facing felony charges, the likelihood of beingheld in a local jail prior to the disposition of their caseremained nearly the same between 1988 and 1992. Based on thebiennial National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) thatdescribes State felony defendants in the Nation's 75 mostpopulous counties, an estimated 37% were held awaitingdisposition in 1992. Roughly the same percentage was detained in1988 (34%) and 1990 (35%). (Pretrial Release of FelonyDefendants, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [February 1991, NCJ-127202], 1990[November 1992, NCJ-139560], and 1992 [November 1994,NCJ-148818]). More felons sentenced to local jail The impact of more arrests and jail admissions was compoundedby a growing number of felons receiving a sentence to local jail.Between 1986 and 1992 the number of convicted felons sentenced toconfinement in local jails almost doubled: Felons sentenced to local jails ------------------------------- Percent of all Year Number convicted felons ---------------------------------------- 1986 122,400 21% 1988 176,000 26 1990 207,300 25 1992 232,300 26 Percent change, 1986-92 90% Source: Felony Sentences in State Courts (1986, 1988, 1990,and 1992). Jail inmates received about the same average sentences Growthin the local jail population between 1983 and 1993 was not theresult of longer sentences. Results from the National JudicialReporting Program (NJRP) indicate that between 1988 and 1992,years in which comparable data on felons sentenced to local jailsare available, the average (mean) maximum jail sentence amongthose entering jail remained constant. In 1988 and 1992 felonssentenced to local jail received a mean sentence of 7 months.(Felony Sentences in State Courts, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [December1990, NCJ-126923], 1990 [March 1993, NCJ-149077], and 1992[January 1995, NCJ-151167]). Data from the 1983 and 1989 surveys of inmates in local jailsalso reveal no significant changes in the sentence lengthsreceived by sentenced inmates overall, including felons andmisdemeanants. About 50% of the jail inmates had been convictedand sentenced at the time of both surveys. (Profile of JailInmates, 1989, BJS Special Report [April 1991, NCJ-129097]).Between 1983 and 1989, there was an increase in the mean sentence(from 14 months to 17 months) but no change in the median. Inboth years half of the sentenced inmates had received a sentenceof 6 months or less. More drug offenders incarcerated in local jails The largest source of growth among inmates in local jails wasdrug law violators. Based on data from inmate surveys in 1983 and1989, the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of drugoffenses rose from 20,800 to 91,000. In 1983 about 1 of every 10inmates were in jail for a drug offense; in 1989 nearly 1 ofevery 4 were in jail for drugs. From 1983 to 1989 the increase inthe number of persons in jail for drug offenses accounted formore than 40 percent of the total increase in the jailpopulation. Between 1983 and 1989 the percentage of jail inmatesdecreased for violent offenses (from 30.7% to 22.5%) and propertyoffenses (from 38.6% to 30.0%), but increased for public-orderoffenses (from 20.6% to 22.8%). During this period, the totalnumber of inmates increased in every category: violent offendersincreased from 68,600 to 89,000; property offenders from 86,300to 118,700; and public-order offenders from 46,100 to 90,200. Although offense information for more recent years is notavailable, estimates may be made using 1989 percentages. Assumingno change in the percentage distributions, the estimated numberof drug offenders in local jails in 1993 was more than 105,800,representing a 5-fold increase since 1983. More jail inmates held for State/Federal authorities The Nation's jail population also grew between 1983 and 1993as a result of crowding in State and Federal prisons. On June 30,1993, nearly 12% of all jail inmates were prisoners being heldfor State or Federal authorities. An estimated 53,900 inmateswere held for State or Federal authorities in 1993, up from17,281 in 1983. Between 1983 and 1993 the number of inmates held for Stateand Federal authorities grew at twice the rate of the inmatepopulation overall (212% compared with 106%). Approximately 34,200 jail inmates in 1993 were in localfacilities as a direct result of crowding of State or Federalfacilities (representing 7.4% of all jail inmates). The other19,700 inmates held for State or Federal authorities were in jailfor other reasons, such as waiting transfer or early release(pending completion of paperwork or transportation),participation in special programs, and special security needs. Methodology Census of Jails The 1993 Census of Jails was the sixth in a series of datacollection efforts aimed at studying the Nation's locallyadministered jails. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970,1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988. As in previous censuses, the U.S.Bureau of the Census collected the data for the Bureau of JusticeStatistics. The 1993 census included all locally administered confinementfacilities (3,287) that hold inmates beyond arraignment and arestaffed by municipal or county employees. The census alsoincluded 17 jails that were privately operated under contract forlocal governments and 7 facilities maintained by BOP andfunctioning as jails. Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities,such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold personsafter being formally charged in court (usually within 72 hours ofarrest). Also excluded were State-operated facilities in Alaska,Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, whichhave combined jail-prison systems. Five locally operated jails inAlaska were included. The mailing list used for the census was derived from theNational Justice Agency List, which is maintained by the Bureauof the Census for BJS. The census forms were mailed to 3,506facilities on June 22, 1993. Twenty-eight jails were added to the initial mail out, and230 were deleted, resulting in a total of 3,304 facilities. After extensive follow-up, including additional mail requestsand repeated telephone contacts, all jails (except those in onejurisdiction) provided data for four critical data items--numberof inmates, average daily population, rated capacity, and sex ofinmates housed. Data on the these four items for thenonresponding jails were imputed based on data reported in the1994 Annual Survey of Jails. Completed forms with data for all or most items were receivedfor 2,981 jails, resulting in a 90% response rate. Thesereporting jails housed 93% of all local jail inmates on June 30,1993. Estimation procedures Because there was nonresponse and incomplete data on allcensus items except the four critical items, national totals hadto be estimated. The following procedures were used to estimatetotals when data were incomplete: 1. Each item was first assessed for coverage and internalconsistency. For purposes of estimating the totals, extremevalues were examined and then verified by checking other censusinformation or calling the respondents. Detailed categories werealso checked to determine if they summed to the reported totals. 2. To provide a national total, item values were summed andthen multiplied by a nonresponse adjustment factor (NAF). Formost estimates, the NAF was a ratio of the total number ofinmates in all jails to the number of inmates in jails thatreported valid data. Ratios based on inmate counts were used toestimate the number of adults, the number of inmates by sex andage, conviction status by sex, the number of staff byoccupational category and region (tables 11 and 13), and payrollstaff by sex and race. Ratios based on the total average dailypopulation were used to estimate total expenditures. Estimates of detailed categories were further adjusted so that for each item the sum of the detail equaled the estimated total. For example, the estimated numbers of male and female adult inmates were ratio adjusted so that the final estimates summed to the total number of adult inmates. All estimates of inmates and staff were rounded to the nearest 100. Expenditures were rounded to the nearest million dollars. 5. All rates, ratios, and percentage distributions in thisreport are based on reported data only. Annual Survey of Jails In each of the 4 years between the full censuses, a survey ofjails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of theNation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 1994 AnnualSurvey of Jails is the 10th such survey in a series begun in1982. The reference date for the 1994 survey was June 30, 1994. Using information from the 1993 Census of Jails, a new sampleof jail jurisdictions was selected for the 1994 survey. Ajurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipalgovernment that administers one or more local jails. The sampleincluded all jails in 796 selected jail jurisdictions and 23multijurisdiction jails. A multi-jurisdiction jail is one inwhich two or more jurisdictions have a formal agreement tooperate the facility. In drawing the sample for 1994, jail jurisdictions were firststratified into two groups: single jurisdiction jails andmultijurisdiction jails. All of the multi-jurisdiction jails wereincluded in the survey. The remaining jurisdictions were thenfurther stratified into two groups: jurisdictions with jailsauthorized to hold juveniles and jurisdictions with jails holdingonly adults. Jurisdictions were then selected based on theaverage daily population in the 1993 census. All jails in 203jurisdictions were automatically included if the jurisdictionheld juveniles and had an average daily population of 250 or moreinmates in 1993 or if they held only adults and had an averagepopulation of 500 or more. The other jurisdictions (593) werethen selected based on stratified probability sampling. Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. After follow-upphone calls to nonrespondents, the response rate for the surveywas 100%. National estimates for the inmate population on June 30,1994, were produced by sex, race/Hispanic origin, and age groupand for the average daily population during the year ending June30, 1994. National estimates were also produced for ratedcapacity. Sampling error Survey estimates have an associated sampling error becausejurisdictions with smaller average daily populations were sampledfor the survey. Estimates based on the sample survey may differsomewhat from the results of conducting a complete census.Different samples could yield somewhat different results.Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimatesfrom all possible samples, stating the precision with which anestimate from a particular sample approximates the average of allpossible samples. The estimated relative sampling error for thetotal inmate population of 490,442 on June 30, 1994, was 0.50%.(See appendix tables 1 and 2.) Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determinewhether differences between 1993 census counts and 1994 surveyestimates were statistically significant. All differencesmentioned in the report meet or exceed the 95-percent confidencelevel. Measures of population Two measures of inmate population are used: the average dailypopulation for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count onJune 30 of each year. The average daily population balances outany extraordinary events that may render atypical the inmatecount on June 30. The June 30 count provides data oncharacteristics of inmates, such as race, Hispanic origin, andage, that may not be available on an annual basis. Juveniles State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to beincarcerated in adult jails under a variety of circumstances.Because of the differing statutes and practices, however,accurate and comparable data on juveniles are difficult tocollect. The 1994 Annual Survey of Jails provides new and moreaccurate estimates of the juvenile population. For the firsttime, the survey provides estimates of the total number of jailinmates under age 18, the number held as adults, and the numberheld as juveniles. New sampling procedures were also introducedin 1994 to minimize the standard errors of these estimates. Bystratifying jurisdictions based on the authority to housejuveniles, the precision of the juvenile counts were improved.

Based on the 1990Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, the report indicatesthat nearly 9 in 10 institutions conduct urine surveillance among the inmatepopulation, usually on a random basis or on suspicion of use. Marijuanaand cocaine were the drugs most commonly detected--in Federal facilitiesabout 1 in 100 of the tests for marijuana and 1 in 250 tests for cocainewere positive while in State facilities about 1 in 16 tests were positivefor marijuana and 1 in 28 were positive for cocaine. I want to express my deep appreciation to the employees inthe 957 State prisons, 80 Federal prisons, and the 250 community-basedfacilities who participated in the census. The 100-percent response rate is,I believe, important testimony to the utility and significance ofnational data on the operations of our Nation's correctional facilities. Steven D. Dillingham, Ph.D. Director Drug Enforcement and Treatment in Prisons, 1990 By Caroline Wolf Harlow, Ph.D. BJS Statistician About 7 of every 8 prisons in the Nation tested an estimatedtotal of 565,500 inmates for one or more illegal drugs between July 1,1989, and June 30, 1990. In State facilities, 3.6% of the tests forcocaine, 1.3% for heroin, 2.0% for methamphetamines, and 6.3% for marijuanafound evidence of drug use. In Federal prisons, 0.4% of the testsfor cocaine, 0.4% for heroin, 0.1% for methamphetamines, and 1.1% formarijuana were positive. This report uses information provided to the Census of Stateand Federal Adult Correctional Facilities. Data were collected from 957State prison facilities, 250 State community-based facilities, and 80Federal prisons operating on June 29, 1990. Censuses were also conducted in1984, 1979, and 1974, but the 1990 census was the first to gatherinformation on drug interdiction practices, drug testing of inmates and staff,and inmate drug treatment programs. Other findings from the 1990 census include the following: *Ninety-eight percent of State community-basedfacilities--those in which at least half of the residents may leave the facilitydaily--tested residents. All Federal prisons and 83% of State prisonsreported that they tested inmates for drug use. *Seventy-six percent of institutions reported testing inmatesfor drugs when drug use was suspected. Twenty percent tested allinmates at least once during confinement. *At State confinement facilities 1.4% of tests for cocaine,1.0% for heroin, 2.3% for methamphetamines, and 5.8% for marijuanaindicated drug use. *At State community-based facilities 8.9% of tests forcocaine confirmed the presence of the drug, as did 2.2% for heroin, 1.1% for methamphetamines, and 8.1% for marijuana. *State confinement facilities that only tested inmatessuspected of drug use had higher positive rates than facilities that tested allor random groups of inmates (6% for cocaine and 14% for marijuanaversus 1.5% for cocaine and 5% for marijuana). *State and Federal facilities used a variety of methods toprevent drugs from being brought into the institution, includingques-tioning, patdowns, clothing exchanges, and body cavity searches. *At admission inmates were required to exchange clothing in88% of the Federal prisons and 59% of State prisons; inmates were patteddown in 88% of Federal prisons and 78% of the State prisons. *In the facilities using the most intrusive interdictiontechnique, body cavity searches, positive drug test results among inmatestested were lower than in facilities using other methods of interdiction. *Questioning and search of belongings were widely used forvisitors to both Federal and State facilities. *Federal confinement facilities reported that they couldprovide drug treatment for an estimated 7,800 inmates; State confinementfacilities, for 114,000; and State community-based facilities, for 9,400. *Federal facilities were using an estimated 62% of total drugtreatment capacity on June 29, 1990; State confinement facilities, 78%;and community-based facilities, 66%. Introduction The Census of State and Federal Adult CorrectionalFacilities, conducted periodically by the Bureau of the Census on behalf of theBureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), included a new series of questions in 1990.(See Methodology on page 12 for further information about thecensus and the questionnaire.) This addendum--designed with the assistanceof the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Office of NationalDrug Control Policy--asked how facilities interdict drugs andparaphernalia among inmates, visitors, and staff and who was chosen for eachmethod of interdiction. In addition, the addendum gathered information on drugtesting policies, practices, and outcomes. The questionnaire asked facilitiesto estimate the number of inmates in need of drug treatment programs andthe capacity of currently available programs. Methods of drug interdiction Different facilities have a variety of policies and practicesrelated to interdiction of drugs from inmates, visitors, and staff. Facilities may physically check persons entering thefacility. Inmates may be checked for drugs or other contraband when they enter afacility for the first time or reenter after an absence. The checks may berelatively nonintrusive, such as verbal questioning or pat-downs, ormore intrusive, such as body cavity searches and clothing exchanges orsearches of belongings. These checks may be conducted among all enteringpersons, random groups, or only those suspected of carrying drugs.Many prisons may use all of the approaches at different times. The figure below shows a general typology for the range ofmethods for each type of drug interdiction. A plus sign (+) indicates the useof a method and a minus sign (-) means no reported use. Type 1facilities, for example, reported using all three methods to choose personsfor an interdiction activity. Type 4 facilities reported performingan interdiction activity on all persons but not choosing randomor suspected subjects. Interdiction All Random Suspected Type 1 + + + Type 2 + + - Type 3 + - + Type 4 + - - Type 5 - + + Type 6 - + - Type 7 - - + Type 8 - - - Interdiction activities: Most prison facilities patted down inmates and required themto exchange clothes upon admission or any reentry Prison facilities perform many activities to prevent drugsand other contraband from entering. Correctional authorities commonlyquestion inmates, pat them down, require changing intoprison-furnished clothes, and search body cavities. Eighty-eight percent of Federalfacilities reported that they patted down new admissions and required them toreplace their clothes (table 1). Seventy-eight percent of State confinementfacilities and 71% of community-based facilities patted down newlyadmitted inmates. (Community-based facilities are those in which half or moreof the residents are permitted to leave unaccompanied by staff forwork or study. Because inmates regularly leave community-based facilities,drug-related problems in these facilities are different from those insecured facilities.) Fifty-nine percent of State confinement facilities and 26% ofcommunity- based facilities required them to substitute prison clothes.At least three-quarters of both State and Federal facilitiesquestioned new admissions about drugs. When looking for the presence of hidden drugs, facilitieswere less likely to perform body cavity searches than take other interdictionmeasures. Sixty-one percent of Federal facilities, 45% of Stateconfinement facilities, and 14% of State community-based facilitiesreported that they conducted body cavity searches among inmates at admission. Institutions could apply an interdiction activity to allinmates, to groups of inmates selected at random, or to suspected drug users orcouriers. Patting down new and returning inmates and requiring them toexchange clothes generally applied to all inmates (table 2). Over 80%of Federal facilities patted down all inmates and required an exchangeof clothing. Almost 78% of State confinement facilities frisked allinmates, and 57% substituted prison clothes. In 46% of Federal facilities and in 20% of State facilities,body cavity searches were conducted among all entering inmates. About 39%of State confinement facilities reported that a body cavity searchwould be conducted when the staff suspected inmates of carrying drugs. Most facilities searched the belongings of visitors Staff checked visitors' belongings for drugs in 93% ofFederal institutions, 87% of State confinement facilities, and 76% ofthe community-based (table 3). Visitors were patted down fordrugs in 51% of Federal prisons, 69% of State confinement institutions, and40% of community-based facilities. All visitors were generally subjected to searches of theirbelongings (table 4). About 83% of Federal facilities and 57% of Statefacilities looked through the personal possessions of all visitors.Frisking visitors for drugs and checking body cavities occurred primarily ifvisitors were suspected of carrying drugs or paraphernalia. Five in ten ofFederal prisons and 4 in 10 of State facilities patted down visitorson suspicion. About 28% of Federal Facilities and 18% of State facilitiessearched body cavities of visitors if the visitors were suspected ofsmuggling drugs. Staff were also subject to drug interdiction activities: When reporting to work, staff were patted down in about halfof State confinement facilities and in more than a fifth of Federalconfinement and State community-based facilities (table 5). In over 50% ofFederal facilities and 40% of State facilities staff were questioned.Most interdiction activities involving staff were conducted onsuspicion of smuggling drugs. About 45% of Federal facilities and 23% ofState facilities interrogated staff if they were suspected of druginvolvement (table 6). About 19% of Federal facilities also patted downstaff on suspicion, compared to 14% of State facilities. About 23% ofState facilities frisked staff members at random. Maximum security facilities took more stringent druginterdiction measures than other facilities Staff in Federal maximum security prisons were more likelythan those in medium or minimum security facilities to search body cavitiesand to require all inmates to exchange clothing (table 7). AllFederal maximum security institutions required all inmates to put on newprison-issued clothes upon entry or reentry. Nearly 55% of Federal maximumsecurity facilities, compared to 38% of minimum security prisons,conducted body cavity searches of all newly admitted or returning inmates. In maximum security prisons staff were less likely than inother Federal facilities to question all of the inmates or to pat themdown. All inmates were interrogated in 64% of maximum security prisons andfrisked in 73%, while all inmates were questioned in 94% of minimum securityfacilities and patted down in 81%. The staff in State maximum and medium security prisons weremore likely than those in minimum security facilities to make allentering or returning inmates exchange clothes (over 60% of maximum or mediumsecurity prisons, compared to 47% of minimum security prisons). In nearly 1 in5 maximum security State prisons, staff searched the body cavities ofall new or returning prisoners. Staff performed body cavity searches onsuspected inmates in over half of State maximum security facilities. State community-based facilities were less likely than Stateconfinement facilities to search residents to interdict drugs. Staff inabout 59% of State community-based facilities patted down all inmates. In22% of community-based facilities, the staff required all inmates tochange to facility clothing, and in 15%, searched body cavities ofresidents suspected of having drugs. Interpreting measures of drug testing Prevalence of drug use in prisons is difficult to estimate.Part of the difficulty occurs with record keeping and reporting. A drugtest determines the presence of a specific drug at a specificlevel. A single urine sample can be used for a single drug test or formultiple tests for different drugs. Correctional authorities were asked toreport the number of tests for each drug and the number of positive tests.However, some authorities may have reported the number of urine samplestaken if their records included only those figures. Other difficulties in estimating the amount of drug use inprison include the following: *Prisons differ in the selection of whom to test. Mostfacilities do not choose inmates for testing using a sample with a knownprobability of selection: One cannot say that the selected inmates representall inmates in the institution. * Prisons differ in what drugs they test for. Prisonauthorities may not suspect the use of a drug and not test for it, even thoughthe drug is used in their facility. Other prisons may conduct repeated testsfor a drug seldom used. * A single urine specimen can have more than one positivedrug test from an individual using multiple drugs. Describing positive rates bytype of drug will overstate the number of inmates with at least onepositive test. *Prisons differ in how often they test inmates. Drug testingmay be rare in some prisons and frequent in others. *Urine tests only detect the presence of most drugs 48 to 72hours after use, except for PCP and marijuana, which may be detected upto 30 days after use. This varying span, when combined with lack of randomsampling, distorts any estimation of overall drug use. * Depending on various factors, the presence ofmethamphetamines may not be distinguished from amphetamines; therefore, the test resultsfor these two drugs should be considered together. *Prisons may differ in the types of tests used. Some typesare more accurate than others, producing lower numbers of falsepositives and false negatives. Facilities may or may not perform confirmatorytests, and they were not asked to estimate the number of false positives andfalse negatives. For the above reasons, drug test results in this report arenot a measure of the extent of the problem in the various kinds offacilities. Positive results should be interpreted only as indicating thepercentage positive for the specific tests given. Testing urine for drug use Most correctional facilities tested some inmates for illegaldrug use About 87% of all correctional facilities tested inmates forillegal drug use (table 8). All Federal prisons, 83% of State confinementfacilities, and 98% of State community-based facilities reported testinginmates between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990. Authorities in facilities which reported data (85% of allfacilities) indicated that they collected 598,000 urine specimens from468,500 inmates. When these figures are projected to all facilities, includingthose which did not respond to these questions, an estimated 565,500inmates provided 721,800 specimens from July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1990.(See "Estimation procedure" in Methodology.) State minimum and medium security and community-basedfacilities were more likely than maximum security institutions to test inmates.About 85% of the lower security facilities and 98% of community-basedfacilities tested inmates, compared to 76% of the maximum security prisons. Most State facilities testing inmates for drugs performed thetests when the staff suspected particular inmates of drug use; 76% ofthe institutions reported checking inmates based on suspicion of use.Forty-two percent tested both suspected inmates and random groups, and anadditional 14% tested all inmates (type 1). Relatively few facilities (20%)tested all inmates at least once during confinement (types 1-4). Most large State confinement facilities tested for drugs About 92% of State prisons with a population of 2,500 or moretested inmates, compared to around 83% of facilities with fewer than1,000 inmates and 77% of facilities with a population between 1,000 and2,499 (table 9). Over half of the largest facilities tested inmates onsuspicion only. Over half of facilities with a population between 250 and 2,499tested all inmates or random groups of inmates in addition to inmatessuspected of drug use. About 70% of community-based facilities testedeither all inmates or random groups and inmates suspected of usingdrugs. Almost all work release facilities tested for drugs About 92% of facilities that provided special work release orprerelease programs tested inmates for drugs (table 10). Ninety-threepercent of facilities that separately handled offenders reincarceratedfor violating some condition of their supervised release also checkedinmates for drugs. Over 90% of facilities that performed "other"functions, such as presentence, psychiatric, or geriatric services also testedtheir residents. Nearly 60% of facilities for youthful offenderstested inmates. For all inmates tested, State prisons reported higherpositive rates than Federal prisons Nationwide, 3.1% of the tests for cocaine in the 12 monthsbefore June 30, 1990, were positive, as were 1.2% of the tests for heroin,1.5% for methamphetamines, and 5.6% for marijuana. State facilitiesreported higher positive rates for drug tests than Federal facilities (table11). In State institutions, 3.6% of tests for cocaine were positive,compared to 0.4% in Federal prisons. State facilities found 2.0% of the testsshowing recent methamphetamine use and 6.3% showing marijuana use; Federalprisons found 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively. I Same percentage of State and Federal facilities reportedpositive drug tests When facilities rather than individual drug tests areconsidered, Federal and State facilities were about equally likely to have founddrug use in their institutions. Around 6 in 10 of both Federal and Statefacilities which tested for cocaine had at least one positive test. Inover 2 in 10 facilities testing for methamphetamines, the use of the drugwas discovered. Marijuana was detected in about 8 in 10facilities testing. Community-based facilities found higher rates of drug usethan confinement facilities Tests had positive outcomes for 8.9% of the cocaine tests and8.1% of the marijuana tests administered by community-based facilities,compared to 1.4% of the cocaine tests and 5.8% of marijuana tests inconfinement facilities (table 12). Methamphetamines, however, were foundmore often in confinement facilities (2.3% tested positive) than incommunity-based facilities (1.1% positive). Among State confinement facilities, positive test resultswere highest in those testing on suspicion only. How inmates were selected for testing affected the rate ofpositive results. Those State confinement facilities testing only whendrug use was suspected recorded higher rates of positive results thanother facilities that tested randomly or comprehensively. When facilitiestested only on suspicion of drug use, 6% of cocaine tests and 14% ofmarijuana tests were positive, compared to 1.5% or less for cocaine and 5% or lessfor marijuana when facilities tested everyone or at random. The results for State community-based facilities wereopposite those of confinement facilities. Testing on suspicion only produced alower percentage of positive results than testing everyone or arandom selection. In community-based facilities which tested on suspicion only,4.8% were positive for cocaine and 6.4% for marijuana; incommunity-based facilities using other selection methods, around 9% of tests for cocaineand 8% for marijuana were positive. The percentages of positive tests were higher in largefacilities Large prisons, whether Federal or State, had higher rates ofpositive drug tests. In Federal facilities with 1,000 or more inmates, 1.4%of the marijuana tests, 0.6% of the cocaine, and 0.6% of the herointests were positive (table 13). In Federal facilities holding fewer than500 inmates, the percentages were 0.5% for marijuana, 0.2% for cocaine,and none for heroin. Among State prisons, the largest facilities with2,500 or more inmates had the highest percentages of positive tests foramphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. The facilities holding 1,000 to 2,499 inmates had the highestrates for marijuana and methamphetamines. Among Federal prisons, themaximum security facilities had higher rates for positive drug teststhan minimum security facilities. In maximum security prisons, 2.5% of thetests for marijuana, .7% of the tests for cocaine, and 1.4% of thetests for heroin were positive. In minimum security, 0.3% for marijuana, 0.3%for cocaine, and none for heroin were positive. State medium security facilities generally had higherpositive rates than maximum or minimum security prisons. For each drug in mediumsecurity facilities, the percentage positive was as follows: 6.8% formarijuana, 4.2% for methamphetamines, 1.7% for cocaine, and 1.4% forheroin. In maximum and minimum facilities, the equivalent findings were5.0% or less for marijuana, 0.6% or less for methamphetamines, 1.4% orless for cocaine, and 0.8% or less for heroin. Positive results from drug tests varied among facilitiesperforming different functions Facilities which confined inmates returned to custody forparole violations had relatively high percentages of positive drug tests (table14). More than 9% of tests for marijuana were positive, as were 6.2% oftests for methamphetamines, 3.5% for cocaine, and 2.9% for heroin.Facilities holding inmates who participated in work release programs orwho were preparing for discharge also had relatively high positivetest rates: 7% for cocaine, 6.9% for marijuana, and 1.8% for heroin. Drug/alcohol treatment in facilities was associated with relatively highpositive results on tests for cocaine and marijuana use--3% forcocaine and 7.6% for marijuana. Facilities handling youthful offenders generally hadrelatively low positive test results: 2.1% for marijuana and 1.5% forcocaine. Positive drug tests were linked to interdiction activities The State confinement facilities that questioned and friskedinmates but did not exchange clothes or search body cavities had higherrates of positive drug tests than facilities doing all these measures(table 15). The tests in the facilities using less stringent measureswere 5.2% positive for cocaine, 13.5% for marijuana, and 16.2% formethamphetamines. Tests in facilities performing all types of specific druginterdiction activities were 1.2% positive for cocaine, 4.6% formarijuana, and 0.6% for methamphetamines. Facilities which performed all types ofinterdiction activities had higher positive drug test rates thanfacilities which did body cavity searches and/or clothing exchanges. Thefacilities doing all types of interdiction may have adopted more measures as areaction to relatively high test rates. The reported rates were fromresults over the 12 months before the census, while the interdiction measureswere those in place on June 29, 1990. Facilities that did not question, frisk, or search visitorshad the following positive test results: 8.3% for marijuana and 7.4%for cocaine. Facilities that inspected visitors' belongings and searchedbody cavities when indicated, but did not both question and pat downvisitors, had the following positive test percentages: 2.9% for heroin, 2.6%for cocaine, and 12% for methamphetamines. Facilities that reported not making special efforts tointerdict the supply of drugs from the staff had 2.6% positive tests for cocaine,2.2% for heroin, and 6.6% for methamphetamines. Facilities thatquestioned staff, patted them down, and took other actions such as drugtesting, when needed had 1.0% positive tests for cocaine and 0.9% for heroin and methamphetamines. Drug testing of staff was highest in Federal facilities While 83% of Federal facilities reported they tested theirstaff for drugs, 42% of State confinement facilities and 32% ofcommunity-based facilities checked their employees (table 16). About 55% of Federalconfinement facilities tested all staff, as did 30% of State confinementfacilities and 19% of community-based facilities. Seventy-six percent of Federal facilities and about 23% ofState facilities tested employees, the primary staff category tested. A higher percentage of Federal than State facility staff weretested for drugs. Fifteen percent of Federal facility staff were testedcompared to 4% of those working in State confinement facilities and 10%in community- based facilities. A positive test was grounds for dismissal in over a third of facilities that tested staff for drugs In over a third of facilities, policies required that stafftesting positive for drugs be dismissed. In over a seventh, affectedstaff were suspended (table 17). Sixty percent of State confinementfacilities and 44% of community-based facilities referred positive drugdetection cases to internal affairs. Fifty-nine percent of Federal facilitiesreferred the case to a departmentally operated program -- generally anemployee assistance counselor who could refer the employee for outsidetreatment. Federal facilities were more likely than State facilities tokeep their staff and continue to check them for drugs or to reassignthem. Twenty- four percent of Federal facilities continued monitoring staffwith drug tests, compared to 10% of State confinement facilities and12%of community- based facilities. Inmate/resident drug treatment programs and capacities Facilities provided estimates of the number ofinmates/residents who could be treated in each of their drug treatment and interventionprograms and estimates of the enrollment in each program. Facilities alsoestimated their total capacity for drug treatment and their totalenrollment. These totals were generally lower than the sum of all theseparately listed programs and interventions, possibly for the followingreasons: *some programs listed were not considered true drug"treatment" programs; *an individual program might have several of the componentslisted on the addendum--for example, counseling, education, and urinesurveillance--and hence be counted several times in the specific listings; *inmates could be participating in more than one program; *facilities could have some treatment slots which could beallocated to more than one program and therefore were counted more thanonce. Drug treatment/intervention on June 29, 1990 Among the 1,287 State and Federal facilities, 1,024 reportedtheir own estimates of total capacity and enrollment in programs theyconsidered to be for drug treatment. Facility capacities and enrollmentsfor drug treatment were-- Among those Federal facilities that reported, administratorsindicated that on a single day the facilities could treat about 6,100inmates and had an enrollment of about 3,800. For reporting State facilities,both confinement and community-based, the estimated capacity was90,900 and enrollment was 69,900. Prisons could treat an estimated 131,900 inmates for drug addiction If the reported capacity is projected to all prisons, Federalconfinement facilities could treat an estimated 7,800 inmates; Stateconfinement facilities, 114,000; and State community-based facilities,9,400. (See "Estimation procedure" in Methodology.) (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the77.7% of Federal inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates inreporting confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates inreporting community- based facilities.) Federal confinement facilities had the capacity to treat fordrug abuse 14% of the inmate population; State confinement facilities, 18%;and community- based facilities, 55%. Prisons were treating approximately 100,200 inmates If the reported enrollment figures are projected to cover allfacilities, the Federal prison system was treating an estimated 4,800inmates; the State prisons, an estimated 88,700; and community-basedfacilities, an estimated 6,200. (See "Estimation procedure" inMethodology.) (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the77.7% of Federal inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates inreporting confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates inreporting community- based facilities.) Enrollment in drug treatment was below capacity) Federal inmates were using 62% of the drug treatment capacityon June 29, 1990. State prisoners were using 66% of the capacity incommunity-based facilities and 78% in confinement facilities. Many factors play a role in these utilization figures.Inmates may refuse to participate or may have already completed the program.Inmates may not qualify--too new to the institution, not near enough to theend of their sentence, rule breakers, under administrative segregation, orin the wrong custody level. Facilities also may keep some slots open togain flexibility to deal with unexpected situations. Prisons offered a variety of programs Prisons may offer many types of drug intervention ortreatment: detoxification, counseling, education and/or awarenessprograms, urine surveillance, and treatment in special residential unitswithin the facility. Federal facilities reported they could test 33% ofinmates for drugs; State confinement facilities, 10%; and community-basedfacilities, 57% (table 18). Counseling was available for 14% of inmatesin Federal facilities, 12% in State confinement facilities, and 48% incommunity-based facilities. Residential treatment program capacity was from1% to 2% of inmate population for all types of institutions. Of all Federal inmates, 9% were enrolled in some form of drugtreatment on June 29, 1990. Among State prisoners, 14% in confinementfacilities and 37% in community-based facilities were enrolled. The two mostcommon types of programs for both Federal and State correctionalfacilities were education and counseling. Drug education programs enrolled 13% of Federal prisoners, 7%of State confinement inmates, and 25% of residents in community-basedfacilities. Six percent of those in Federal facilities were beingcounseled, as were 9% of State confinement facility inmates and 32% of those incommunity-based facilities. Methodology The 1990 Census of State and Federal Adult CorrectionalFacilities was the fourth enumeration of State institutions and the first ofFederal institutions sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statisticsand conducted by the Bureau of the Census. Earlier censuses were completed in1974, 1979, and 1984. Census universe The facility universe was developed from the Census of StateAdult Correctional Facilities conducted in 1984. This list wasrevised using the 1990 American Correctional Association Directory andinformation obtained from State correctional administrators and the Federal Bureauof Prisons. The census included: prisons; prison farms; reception,diagnostic and classification centers; road camps; forestry and conservationcamps; youthful offender facilities (except in California);vocational training facilities; correctional drug and alcohol treatmentfacilities; and State- operated local detention facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Facilities were included in the census if they: *were staffed with State or Federal employees *housed primarily State or Federal prisoners *were physically, functionally, and administratively separatefrom other facilities *were operational on the reference date, June 29, 1990. The census also included, for the first time, 67 privatefacilities that were under exclusive contract by State governments to houseprisoners. Specifically excluded were-- *privately operated facilities that were not exclusively forState or Federal inmates *military facilities *Immigration and Naturalization Service facilities *facilities operated and administered by local governments,including those housing State prisoners *facilities operated by the U.S. Marshals Service *hospital wings and wards reserved for State prisoners. Questionnaire administration Questionnaires were mailed to facility respondents at the endof June 1990. Second and third request forms and telephone followups wentout in the fall, resulting in a final response rate of 100%. Definitions of community-based and confinement facilities Correctional facilities were classified as community-based if50% or more of the residents were regularly permitted to leave thefacility unaccompanied for work or study. These facilities includedhalfway houses, restitution centers, and pre-release, work release, and studyrelease centers. Correctional facilities in which less than 50% ofthe inmates regularly left the facility unaccompanied were classified asconfinement institutions. Drug addendum An addendum on drug control activities in State and Federalfacilities was included for the first time in the 1990 census. Facilitieswere asked to provide information on the following: *activities they used with inmates, visitors, and staff tokeep out illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia *inmate drug testing practices, including the criteria fortesting inmates, the number of inmates tested in total and by specific drug,and the number positive *staff drug testing, including groups and basis for testing,number tested, and procedures when tests were positive *capacity and enrollment in various types of drug treatmentand intervention programs. Estimation procedures When all prisons in the census did not provide data onparticular variables, estimated figures were used where indicated. Totalfigures were estimated by multiplying the known or reported numbers by theratio of the total relevant population to the reported population. Allfigures were estimated independently and total estimates were thereforelarger than the sum of all subgroup estimates. The total population figureused in the projections varied, depending upon which figure was mostappropriate. The two available population figures are the average dailypopulation and the prison count on the reference day for the census, June 29,1990. For drug testing, table 8, the basis for estimation was the averagedaily population, and for drug treatment capacity and enrollment,the basis was the 1-day count. Because the census was a complete enumeration, the resultswere not subject to sampling error. Public use data tapes for each Census of Adult CorrectionalFacilities in the series, conducted in 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1990, areavailable from the National Criminal Justice Archive, P.O.

During 1993 approximately 2.6% ofthe U.S. population--4.9 million adults--were on parole, onprobation, or in jails or prisons, an increase of 3 millionpeople since 1980. More than 909,000 men and women were in thecustody of State and Federal prisons, 455,500 were in localjails, 671,000 on parole, and 2.8 million on probation: --More than two-thirds of the 4.9 million persons undercorrectional supervision were on probation or parole. --The Nation's parole population had the fastest rate ofgrowth, 205% from 1980 to 1993. --During the 13 years between 1980 and 1993, the probationpopulation grew by more than 1.7 million, larger than theincrease in any other correctional population. --In 1993 nearly 1.4 million offenders were in local jail andState or Federal prison. During the 1980-92 period, the percent of black State andFederal prisoners increased from 46.5% to 50% at a time when thepercentage of blacks in the general population increased from11.8% to 12.4%. The Hispanic prison population doubled from 7.7%to 14.1%, while Hispanics in the general population increasedfrom 6.5% to 9.5%. At yearend 1992, there were 4,094 black male inmates per100,000 black adults in the U.S. population, compared to 502white male inmates per 100,000 adult white residents. Among U.S.adults who neither graduated from high school nor earned ageneral equivalence degree (GED), almost 6% of blacks and 1% ofwhites were in a Federal or State prison serving a sentence of ayear or more. The number of convicted drug offenders increased ninefold(from 19,000 to 172,300) from 1980 through 1992. The number ofviolent offenders accounted for a larger share of the growth inthe total prison population (41%, compared to 32% for drugoffenders). The total number of violent offenders in State prisonincreased by nearly 200,000 during the 12-year period. The number of returned parole violators and newly admittedprobation violators soared between 1980 and 1992. Almost 1 inevery 3 offenders admitted to State prisons (142,000) in 1992were probation or parole violators, compared to 1 in every 6(27,000) in 1980. Violent offenders were more likely to be sent to prison in1992 than they were in 1980. Relative to the number of victims ofmurder, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, the number ofviolent offenders admitted to State prison increased during the12-year period, from 18 admissions per 1,000 violentvictimizations to 27 per 1,000. Between 1980 and 1992 the rate of incarceration in State andFederal prisons more than doubled, from 139 sentenced inmates(inmates serving 1 year or more) per 100,000 U.S. residents to332 per 100,000. In 1992 incarceration rates were nearly 19 timeshigher among adult men than among adult women (883 per 100,000compared to 47) and 8 times higher among adult black men thanamong adult white men. The data are from a 188-page book published by the Bureau ofJustice Statistics (BJS) and listing the correctional populationsof each State and the Federal system. The book lists jail andprison suicide statistics, correctional crowding, electronicmonitoring, sentence commutations, jail AIDS deaths and muchmore.

During April through June1992, shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resulted in anincrease in the kilogram price in many major U.S. metropolitan areas.Throughout the remainder of the year, however, cocaine was readily availableas kilogram prices in virtually all major metropolitan areasreturned to lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993 indicate thatkilogram prices remain at low levels. Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gramlevels averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992compared to 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. Atemporary decline in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during Julythrough September 1992. However, by year's end, purity at all levelshad once again increased. Use Regarding the use of cocaine, the National Household Surveyon Drug Abuse for 1992 indicated that the number of past-year andpast-month users of cocaine has decreased significantly since 1985.Nevertheless, frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown astatistically significant change during the past several years. According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, cocaine use continued to decline among high school seniorsand 10th graders. Among 8th graders, however, survey data indicatedincreased use of cocaine. Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) showsthat the estimated number of nationwide cocaine-related emergency roomepisodes, which had been increasing at a fairly constant rate from theearly-to- late 1980s, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990.During the latter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodesincreased once again and appears to have stabilized at high levels sincethat time. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the smoking ofcocaine continues to be the predominant route of administration used bypatients admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. Thepercentage of patients who indicated that smoking was their primary methodof administration increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to41.4 percent in FY 1992. Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing ofrecently booked male and females arrestees, as reported by the DrugUse Forecasting Program (DUF), remained high in many major U.S.cities in 1992. In fact, rates of cocaine use during the past year were substantially higher than those for opiate and marijuana use. Trafficking Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly citedCentral American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-boundcocaine shipments. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported fromsource countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments aretransported to the United States by land, sea, and air directly or through Mexico. Cocaine traffickers, perceiving enhanced law enforcementactivity along the United States-Mexican border and in the westernCaribbean, have subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into theUnited States. DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers areincreasingly using routes employed four to six years ago. Thisdiversification includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the easternBahamas as well as increased importation into the eastern United States. The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulkquantities of cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.Government drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions reportthe use of cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine amonglegitimate goods. Additionally, cocaine trafficking organizationscontinue to use maritime vessels such as pleasure craft and fishing vesselsto smuggle cocaine from source countries into the United States.Moreover, traffickers utilize low-profile vessels designed to eluderadar detection for smuggling cocaine into Puerto Rico. Several DEA field divisions report cocaine traffickingorganizations have increased their use of airdrop operations. Cocainetraffickers are airdropping cocaine shipments in the Caribbean and off thecoast of, as well as within, Central America and Southern Mexico.Additionally, South American cocaine traffickers have acquired several largecargo aircraft, thereby increasing cargo capacity while overcoming thelimited flight range of smaller aircraft. U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexicanborder continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early1992 indicate that cocaine traffickers have decreased the averagesize of cocaine shipments and shifted transportation routes to lesstrafficked ports of entry. For example, in response to an enhanced lawenforcement presence in southern California, traffickers are increasinglyusing U.S. ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to transportcocaine to California. Domestic Distribution The primary domestic importation points for cocaine remainArizona, southern California, south Florida, and Texas. The principalcities utilized by Colombian cartels for distributing bulkquantities of cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New YorkCity. Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to usecommercial and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postalservice to transport cocaine. Concealed compartments within vehicles arecommonly cited by DEA field divisions. Moreover, cocaine traffickersusing tractor-trailers frequently secrete cocaine in hiddencompartments and among legitimate produce. Extensive use of commercial trucksto transport cocaine from the Los Angeles metropolitan area todestinations throughout the United States occurred during the past year. The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United Statesremains highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases ofoperation are comprised of multiple cells operating within majormetropolitan areas including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City,Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The operators of these cells receiveorders directly from top-level cartel managers in Colombia, and operateindependently of other cells within the same metropolitan area. The operatorsutilize the latest technology, such as computers, pagers, facsimilemachines, etc., in their daily operations. Cellular telephones are oftenbought in bulk quantities and then discarded after being used for severalmonths or less in order to thwart law enforcement telephone interceptefforts. In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in theUnited States is not as compartmentalized as that of the CaliCartel. The drug trafficking groups which comprise the Medellin Cartel employa group decision-making process at the top level as opposed to ahierarchical decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At thelower levels, Medellin-related trafficking groups are not asrestricted as those associated with the Cali Cartel regarding the varietyof distributors with whom they transact business. Hispanic trafficking organizations, particularly Colombianand Mexican, continue to dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking anddistribution within the United States. A greater diversity, however, hasbecome involved in these activities at all levels of the domestictraffic since early 1992. During 1992, four cocaine conversion laboratories were seizedwithin the United States, two in New York City, one in California, andone in Florida. To date in 1993, one cocaine base conversionlaboratory was seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. CRACK COCAINE Availability/Price/Purity Crack continues to be readily available in virtually everymajor city and, to a somewhat lesser extent, many small towns and ruralareas in the United States. Crack manufacturing and distribution havereached a saturation point in the larger metropolitan areas. The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from aslow as $2 to as high as $75, but generally sells for $10 to $50,depending upon the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. Gram prices range from$45 to $150. Ounce-quantities can be purchased for $475 to $2,500. Whenavailable in kilogram quantities, crack prices are comparable to those forkilogram quantities of cocaine hydrochloride, ranging from $17,000 to$35,000. Analysis of crack samples by DEA laboratories during themid-to-late 1980's revealed that retail purity was consistently high,averaging 80- plus percent. Although current retail purity remainsapproximately at that level, sellers in some areas of the country are sellingpoor- quality crack. Adulterants are increasingly being added toincrease the weight or size of the crack dosage unit. Use The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showedthat the number of lifetime, past-year, and past-month users of crackdeclined significantly from 1991 to 1992. Survey data indicate that314,000 Americans used crack during the past month and over 805,000used it during the past year. According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, lifetime use of crack among seniors declined from 1991 to1992; however, past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack by this groupremained relatively stable during that period. Nevertheless, overallfrequency of crack use among high school seniors has decreasedsubstantially since 1987. Reporting from DAWN indicates that smoking is the predominantroute of cocaine administration used by patients admitted to DAWNemergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. Trafficking The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by manysmall (up to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking organizations consisting of bands of individuals fromdistinct ethnic groups. The main participants involved in wholesale cracktrafficking are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, and Haitian and Dominican groups. Saturated markets, low prices, violent competition, andeffective law enforcement pressure in major urban areas have forced somecrack trafficking organizations to develop new markets. Theseorganizations are moving to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas acrossthe nation, creating many problems for local law enforcement and civicauthorities. The largest and more advanced organizations are crisscrossingthe nation in this effort, with the Jamaican posses moving generallywestward and the Crips and Bloods expanding eastward. HEROIN Availability/Price/Purity Within the United States, heroin is readily available in allthe major metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 andthe first few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity at theretail level, and increased supplies available from Southwest Asia. (Notethat high- purity heroin has been imported from Colombia in increasingquantities in the past year. This heroin from Colombia, which underwentsignature analysis prior to DEA's development of a South Americanheroin signature in July 1993, was analyzed as having a Southwest Asian (SWA)signature. As a result, it may account in part for both the increasedpurity and quantity of SWA heroin available in the United States.) Data from DEA's Domestic Monitor Program indicate the 1992nationwide average heroin purity at the retail (street) level was 37percent, considerably higher than the average purity of 26.6 percentrecorded in 1991. Heroin purity at the street level was generally highestin the northeastern United States, where a large percentage of thenation's user population lives. According to DEA's Heroin Signature Program (HSP), SoutheastAsian (SEA) heroin was the predominant type of heroin available in theUnited States for the fifth year in a row, accounting for 44 percent of theHSP samples analyzed in FA 1992 and 58 percent of the total netweight of these samples. U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFKInternational Airport, are primary entry points for heroin destined for theU.S. market, based on seizures analyzed through the HSP. Thenationwide average net weight of airport seizures was almost 800 gramsand the average purity of heroin seized at these airports was 73percent. Use The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992indicated a decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey datashow that the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who haveused heroin at least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to323,000 in 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number ofpast-month heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. (Estimates ofheroin use from the Household Survey are considered very conservativedue to the probable under-coverage of the population of heroin users.) According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, heroin use increased among high school seniors. The surveyrevealed that 1.2 percent of the seniors in the class of 1992 had usedheroin at least once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of1991, yet still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classesof 1989 and 1990. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofnationwide heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had beenfluctuating somewhat during the past several years, increasedsubstantially from the first to the second half of FY 1992. During that period, thenumber of heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, anincrease of 35 percent. Cities showing substantive increases during thelatter half of FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency roomepisodes included Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection ofheroin continues to be the predominant route of administration usedby patients admitted to emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.However, the percentage of patients who indicated that injection was theirprimary route of administration has decreased from 79.1 percent in FY1989 to 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same period, there wasan increase in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin. Those whosnorted heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8 percent in FY1992. Rates of opiate use (to include heroin) detected throughurinalysis testing of recently booked male and female arrestees, asreported by the Drug Use Forecasting Program, remained relatively low andstable in 1992 when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. Trafficking Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under thecontrol of Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smugglingof SEA heroin into the United States, particularly New York City,and are primarily responsible for smuggling the largest bulkshipments, generally in the multihundred-kilogram range. The largestshipments are secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial maritimevessels and air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are smuggled in theluggage of airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. In addition to Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers, Nigeriansremain deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigeriantraffickers rely primarily on dispatching large numbers of internal bodycouriers traveling aboard commercial airlines bound for the UnitedStates. As a result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to recruitother ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, andAmerican citizens, as heroin couriers. Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much lesscentralized than that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard totrafficking groups. Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the UnitedStates are highly cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they arebased on ethnic, familial, and tribal relationships. As a result, SWAheroin trafficking and distribution are generally more prevalent incities having large populations from Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon,Pakistan, and Turkey, such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York. Mexican heroin is produced almost exclusively for the U.S.heroin market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican heroin toand within the United States is controlled by organizations composed ofMexican nationals and Mexican Americans. Mexican traffickingorganizations are often made up of family members, lifelong friends, and othertrusted associates. The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in theUnited States during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according toseizure analysis and investigative reporting. At present, Colombianheroin traffickers are attempting to establish distribution outletsin the United States, particularly in the metropolitan areas of thenortheast and, as a result, are smuggling a heroin of very high purity,generally 80-plus percent. According to the El Paso IntelligenceCenter, the number of Colombian couriers who were arrested on commercialairlines carrying heroin into the United States increased from 41 in1991 to over 260 in 1992, with most of these arrests occurring at eitherMiami or New York's international airports. CANNABIS Availability/Price/Potency Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-productof the Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly usedillegal drug in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant anddelta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psychoactivechemical, are controlled substances. According to DEA reporting, 34 percent of a non-sinsemillaplant contains usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58percent of a sinsemilla plant contains usable material. The yield of acannabis plant is determined by its diameter and the density of thegrow area. The lower the plant density of the grow area, the higher theyield of usable material. The average plant yield for mature,domestically grown sinsemilla is approximately 1.25 pounds per plant. Theaverage plant yield for mature, domestically grown commercial grademarijuana is approximately three-quarters of one pound per plant. Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the pastdecade. Commercial grade marijuana prices rose from $350 to $600 perpound 10 years ago to $300 to $3,000 per pound in 1992. Sinsemillaprices rose from $1,000 to $2,000 per pound 10 years ago to $650 to$9,600 per pound in 1992. Law enforcement efforts have forced some cultivatorsindoors to avoid detection. Indoor growers cultivate higher potencysinsemilla marijuana, which permits them to charge higher prices.Scarcity caused by law enforcement operations also has increased prices. Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent yearsinclude cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana byusing advanced agronomic techniques. As a result, the average THCcontent of marijuana has risen considerably in the last ten years.Furthermore, record-high THC contents were reported in 1992 and 1993.These record- high THC contents are an indicator of the continuing trend byindoor growers to produce higher potency marijuana. According to the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse, approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana atleast once in their lifetime compared to 61.9 million in 1985.Nevertheless, survey data indicate that the frequency of marijuana use hasdeclined substantially from 1985 to 1992. Overall, past-year,past-month, and past-week use of the drug nave diminished by nearly 45percent during that period According to the National High School Survey on Drug Abuse,the long- term decline in the use of marijuana among 12th graderscontinued in 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of12th graders who believed there was "great risk"associated with regular marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the downwarduse pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,and past- month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to1992. Moreover, 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to viewmarijuana use as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.Also, the proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved ofmarijuana use declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception mayexplain the increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declinedfrom FY 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. Thelarge majority, approximately 80 percent, of patients treated forcannabis- related hospital emergencies use marijuana with othersubstances. Patients use marijuana most frequently with alcohol andcocaine. Marijuana use detected through urinalysis testing of recentlybooked male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug UseForecasting Program, increased significantly in many major U.S. cities in1992. Trafficking Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana availablein the United States during 1992. Colombia ranked as a distantsecond as a foreign source of marijuana. Commencing in early 1992,Jamaican traffickers increased marijuana shipments to the UnitedStates. DEA, in conjunction with Federal and State law enforcementagencies, conducted an aggressive cannabis eradication program in 1992.The effort resulted in the eradication of millions of cannabis plants,the arrest of thousands of violators, the forfeiture of millions ofdollars in assets, and the seizure of several thousand weapons.Moreover, the number of indoor growing operations seized in 1992 (3,849)reached an all-time high. The movement toward indoor production isbelieved due primarily to successful law enforcement efforts to curtailoutdoor cultivation. The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992were Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,respectively. These five States accounted for approximately 44 percent of thecultivated cannabis eradicated during 1992. METHAMPHETAMINE Availability/Price/Purity Methamphetamine is the most prevalent clandestinelymanufactured controlled substance in the United States. Availability isconcentrated primarily in the western and southwestern United States wheremost clandestine methamphetamine manufacture occurs. The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) levelhas remained relatively constant during the past four years. Currently, methamphetamine prices range from $5,000 to $22,000 perpound, $300 to $2,500 per ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gramlevels averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 35 and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound puritylevels are unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) Use The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showedthat an estimated 5.2 million Americans, 12 years of age and older,have used methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Survey datafor prior years are unavailable. Survey data for 1992 are not yetavailable.) Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased ata relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 throughthe first half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itselfduring the latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,there was a 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodesinvolving methamphetamine. DAWN emergency room data also indicate that methamphetamineabuse is concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, SanFrancisco, and Los Angeles. In San Diego and Los Angeles,methamphetamine-related hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter halfof 1992. Illicit Manufacture According to DEA reporting, 288 domestic methamphetaminelaboratories were seized during 1992, accounting for 87 percent of allclandestine dangerous drug laboratory seizures. The 1992 figurerepresents a nine- percent decrease from the previous year's total of 315laboratories seized and continues the downward trend in laboratoryseizures, which began in 1990. The main reason for the decrease in laboratory seizures isthe ongoing enforcement of Federal and State chemical-controllegislation. The 1988 Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) becameeffective in 1989, and enables the Federal Government to regulate listedessential chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of dangerousdrugs. Over the past three years, most States have passed legislation similarto the CDTA. Approximately 83 percent of the methamphetamine laboratoryseizures during 1992 occurred in the DEA Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles,Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, Field Divisions. Thisclearly indicates that the manufacture of methamphetamine is stillbased primarily in the western and southwestern United States. Manufacturing/Distribution Organizations Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,and organizations-from independent entrepreneurs and outlawmotorcycle gangs to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations-currentlymanufacture and distribute methamphetamine. (Although late arrivals in the methamphetamine arena, Mexican traffickers are capable ofusing their high-volume production methods and large-scale distributionnetworks to substantially increase the drug's availability in the UnitedStates. For this reason, domestic law enforcement considers the Mexicanpoly-drug traffickers involvement in methamphetamine a significantthreat.) Chemical Diversion Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and Statelevel has made it increasingly difficult for laboratory operators toobtain needed chemicals. Consequently, trafficking organizations have beenforced to seek new sources and develop ways in which to circumvent thelaw. LSD Availability/Price/Purity Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) availability has increasedin the last two to three years and it is available in at least retailquantities in virtually every State in the United States. The sources ofsupply for most of the LSD available in the United States are located inthe northern California area. LSD is relatively inexpensive with an average street dosageunit or "hit" costing approximately five dollars, and oftenas little as one or two dollars. Retail-level doses are seen primarily in blotterpaper form. Currently, LSD potency or strength, which ranges from 20 to80 micrograms per dosage unit, is considerably below levelsreported during the 1960s and early 1970s when potency ranged from 100 to 200micrograms (or higher) per dosage unit. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991estimated that 11.8 million Americans 12 years of age or older have used LSD atleast once in their lifetime compared to 8.4 million in 1985. (Surveydata for 1992 are not yet available.) According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, current (monthly) use of LSD among 10th and 12th grade studentsremained relatively stable from 1991 to 1992. Among 8th graders,however, current use of LSD increased during that same time frame from 0.6percent to 0.9 percent. Moreover, past-year use of LSD rose in all threegrade levels from 1991 to 1992. In fact, past-year use of LSD amongseniors in the class of 1992 increased to the highest level since at least1985. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofnationwide LSD- related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY1989 to FY 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erraticsince that period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remainabove those reported during FY 1989. Illicit Manufacture An increasing number of individuals are attempting tomanufacture LSD. Many of these individuals are not associated with thetraditional northern California groups that are believed to have producedmost of the LSD available in the United States since the late 1960s. Distribution At the wholesale production and distribution level, LSDremains tightly controlled by California-based organizations, which haveoperated with relative impunity for over two decades. Mid-leveldistribution networks in the United States are generally comprised of young adultswho have known each other through long years of association and commoninterests. Public and private mail systems appear to be the primarymeans used for the transportation and distribution of retail and wholesalequantities of LSD. A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories havebeen seized since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. PCP Availability/Price Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available invarying degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities. During 1992, PCPin liquid form, the most common form available in the United States,sold for $150 to $1,000 per ounce nationally. The lowest liquid ounceprices were reported in Los Angeles, the source for most of the PCPtrafficked in the United States. PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's and againfrom the mid-to- late 1970's. In 1978, PCP was transferred fromSchedule III to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, thusclassifying it as a drug with a high potential for abuse. From the period 1981through 1985, abuse of the drug escalated significantly, particularly amongpersons under the age of 21. Around 1986, and continuing through thelate 1980's and early 1990's, demand for PCP was displaced in largemeasure by the widespread availability and use of crack cocaine. Morerecently, however, there are indications that PCP abuse is increasingonce again in a number of cities. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed thatlifetime and past-year PCP use among the U.S. household populationdecreased from 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate anend to this downward use pattern. On the other hand, according to the1992 National High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse, PCP use among 12thgraders has declined significantly during the past seven years. Thisdiminished use is believed due in large part to a significant increase among12th graders in the perceived risk of harm associated with PCPusage. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan-area PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been decliningat a substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353during the first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY1992, a more than 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased PCPabuse rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, andWashington, D.C. Trafficking and Illicit Manufacture Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCPsupply is manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based streetgangs. While buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP fromCalifornia sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be theprimary means for transporting PCP across the country. Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to threein 1991. No PCP laboratories have been seized thus far in 1993. PCPlaboratory seizures since the mid-1980's have ranged from three to 21per year, totals which are considerably less than the high of 79reported in 1978. COCAINE AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated due to successfuldomestic and international law enforcement operations, which caused ashort-term (3-month) impact on cocaine trafficking from South America.Following a period of adjustment, cocaine traffickers once again foundthe means to facilitate the shipment of multiton quantities of cocaine tothe United States. In 1992, cocaine prices ranged from $11,000 to$42,000 per kilogram nationally in comparison to 1991 prices, whichranged from $11,000 to $40,000 per kilogram nationally. During Aprilthrough June 1992, shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resultedin an increase in the kilogram price in many major U.S.metropolitan areas. Throughout the remainder of the year, however, cocaine wasreadily available as kilogram prices in virtually all majormetropolitan areas returned to lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993indicate that kilogram prices remain at low levels. Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gramlevels averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. Atemporary decline in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during Julythrough September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levelshad increased once again. Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gramlevels averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. Atemporary decline in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during Julythrough September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levelshad increased once again. USE The 1992 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (seeappendix) showed that the number of past-year and past-month users of cocainehas decreased significantly since the peak year of 1985. During1992, five million Americans 12 years of age and older had used cocainein the past year compared to 12.2 million in 1985. In 1992, 1.3 millionhad used cocaine in the past month compared to 5.8 million in 1985.Nevertheless, frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shownstatistically significant change during the past several years. Among thefive million people who used cocaine in the past year, 642,000 used itonce a week or more in 1992 compared to 625,000 in 1991 and 662,00 in 1990. The survey also showed that approximately 80 percent ofpast-month cocaine users were young adults ages 18 to 34 in 1992. As inthe past, the rate of past-month cocaine use in 1992 was highest amongyoung adults 18 to 25 years old (1.8 percent of the U.S.population) and ages 26 to 34 years (1.4 percent of the U.S. population). Thepast-month cocaine prevalence rate for the 12- to 17-year-old age grouphas decreased from 1.1 percent of the U.S. population in 1988 to0.3 percent in 1992. Similarly, the 18- to 25-year-old age group hasexperienced dramatic decreases in prevalence from 4.5 percent of the U.S.population in 1988 to 1.8 percent in 1992. For the 26- to 34-year-oldage group, the rate has declined from 2.6 percent to 1.4 percent. Therate for persons aged 35 and older has shown variability, but remainedvirtually unchanged since 1988 (0.3 percent of the U.S. population and0.2 percent in 1992). Lastly, the prevalence rate of past-month cocaineuse among the total U.S. population was estimated at 0.6 percent in1992 compared to 1.5 percent in 1988 and 0.9 percent in 1991. According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse(see appendix for additional survey information),cocaine use continued to decline among high school seniors. Surveyresults showed 6.1 percent of seniors in the class of 1992 said they hadused cocaine at least once in their lifetime, down from 7.8 percent in theclass of 1991 and down from a peak of 17.3 percent in the class of1985. Among 10th graders, lifetime cocaine use decreased from 4.1 percentin 1991 to 3.3 percent in 1992. Among 8th graders, however, lifetime useof cocaine increased from 2.3 percent in 1991 to 2.9 percent in 1992,and past-year use increased from 1.1 percent to 1.5 percent. Other findings from the survey indicate that fewer 8thgraders in 1992 associated great risk of harm with occasional cocaine orcrack cocaine use than did 8th graders in 1991. There was also a decreasein the proportion of 10th graders saying there is great risk of harmwith occasional cocaine use. Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (seeappendix for further information on DAWN) shows that the estimated numberof nationwide cocaine-related emergency room episodes, which hadbeen increasing at a fairly constant rate from the early-to-late1980's, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990. During thelatter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes increased onceagain and appears to have stabilized at high levels since that time. Anumber of drug epidemiologists and treatment specialists believe apossible explanation for this trend reversal is that many hard-corecocaine users are now experiencing the consequences of long-term addiction.As a result, an increasing number of users are seeking publicmedical assistance. Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (seeappendix for further information on DAWN) shows that the estimated numberof nationwide cocaine-related emergency room episodes, which hadbeen increasing at a fairly constant rate from the early-to-late1980's, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990. During thelatter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes increased onceagain and appears to have stabilized at high levels since that time. Anumber of drug epidemiologists and treatment specialists believe apossible explanation for this trend reversal is that many hard-corecocaine users are now experiencing the consequences of long-term addiction.As a result, an increasing number of users are seeking publicmedical assistance. Nationwide, during the fourth quarter of FY 1992,approximately one in four(28.3%) emergency room drug abuse episodes involvedcocaine. Metropolitan areas having a significantly higher proportionof drug emergencies involving cocaine include: Baltimore (63.5%),Atlanta (56.3%), Philadelphia (54.1%), New Orleans (48.2%), Chicago(46.7%), New York (46.3%), Newark (44.2%), Detroit (41.4%), Miami (39.1%), Washington, D.C. (37.5%), St. Louis (36.0%), and Boston(34.8%). Reporting from DAWN also indicates that smoking continues tobe the predominant route of administration used by patients admittedto DAWN emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The percentageof patients who indicated that smoking was their primary method ofadministration increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to 41.4 percent inFY 1992. During the same time frame, there was a decrease in thepercentage of patients who injected or snorted cocaine. Those who injectedor snorted cocaine decreased from 22.0 percent and 14.0 percent,respectively, during FY 1989, to 20.2 percent and 11.1 percent,respectively, during FY 1992. Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing ofrecently booked male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use Forecasting Program (DUF) (see appendix for furtherinformation on DUF), remained high in many major U.S. cities in 1992. In fact,rates of cocaine seducing the past year were substantially higher thanthose for opiate and marijuana use. Among the highest was Philadelphia,where 63 percent of the sampled population tested positive for cocaineuse. In New York City, the figure was 62 percent; in Atlanta, 58percent; in Chicago, 56 percent; in Miami, 56 percent; in Cleveland, 53percent; and in Los Angeles, 52 percent. Cocaine use among recently bookedfemale arrestees was also high in many cities. In New York City, 72percent of the female arrestees sampled tested positive for the use ofcocaine; in Philadelphia, 67 percent; in Cleveland, 66 percent; inWashington, D.C., 64 percent; in Kansas City, 62 percent; in St. Louis, 62percent; and in Detroit, 62 percent. TRAFFICKING General Overview The primary domestic importation points for cocaine destinedfor U.S. consumption remain Arizona, southern California, southFlorida, and Texas. The principal cities utilized by Colombian cartels for distribution of multi-hundred or multi-thousand kilogramquantities of cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.While the Medellin Cartel remains a significant supplier of cocaine tothe major U.S. distribution cities, the Cali Cartel continues tocontrol most of the cocaine brought into New York City, Miami, and LosAngeles. Staging sites in the southwestern United States, where somestockpiling occurs while awaiting transportation, are supplied with cocaine byMexican smugglers using couriers or tractor-trailers, other vehicles,and commercial cargo. Organized groups of Cubans, Dominicans,Jamaicans, Mexicans, and African-American gangs provide retail-leveldistribution of the drug in major U.S. cities. In addition, both theMedellin and Cali Cartels maintain operational headquarters in major U.S.cities to control wholesale distribution networks. During the lastyear, as in the past, traffickers shifted or diversified trafficking routesfollowing major seizures. Traffickers appear to be only temporarilyaffected by the interdiction of pipelines and are taking an average of 10to 14 days to reestablish operations. This suggests continued use ofimaginative concealment methods and the use or maintenance ofmultiple-delivery pipelines and systems to avoid law enforcement. Routes Cocaine traffickers perceiving enhanced law enforcementactivity along the United States-Mexican border and in the western Caribbeanhave subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into theUnited States. DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers areincreasingly using routes employed four to six years ago. Thisdiversification includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the easternBahamas as well as increased importation into the eastern United States.This trend was highlighted by the July 1992 seizure of 5.2 metric tonsof cocaine in Panama which was destined for Baltimore. Moreover, DEAMiami reports that the Medellin Cartel has established a significantpresence in The Bahamas, utilizing the area as a transit point for cocaine enroute to south Florida. Increased cocaine trafficking through the eastern Caribbeanincludes greater use of Puerto Rico, which appears to be a primarytarget of cocaine traffickers who use it as a transshipment point forcocaine destined for the United States, Canada, and Europe. While thesmuggling of cocaine by general aviation aircraft into Puerto Ricocontinues, maritime smuggling is the primary method of transportingcocaine to the island. The appeal of Puerto Rico as a cocaine transit pointis enhanced by two factors: the first is the proximity of Puerto Rico toSouth America, and the second is that once cocaine is successfullysmuggled into Puerto Rico, it can be shipped to the continental UnitedStates with little likelihood of U.S. Customs screening. Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly citedCentral American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-boundcocaine shipments. This was highlighted by the April 1992 seizure of6.7 metric tons of cocaine in Miami transshipped through Guatemala andby the July 1992 seizure in Panama noted previously. During the pastyear, every Central American country was cited as a transshipment pointfor U.S.- boundcocaine. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported fromsource countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments aretransported to the United States by land, sea, and air directly or throughMexico. U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexicanborder continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early1992 indicate that cocaine traffickers are increasinglytransporting smaller (10 to 50 kilograms) cocaine shipments across less traffickedports of entry such as Calexico and Tecate, as opposed to transportinglarge (multihundred kilogram) cocaine shipments across morefrequently used border crossing points such as San Ysidro. Additionally, inresponse to law enforcement in southern California, traffickersincreasingly use U.S. ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to smugglecocaine to California. Methods of Transportation and Concealment Maritime Transportation The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulkquantities of cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.Government drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions reportthe use of cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine amonglegitimate goods. Additionally, cocaine is sometimes hidden in the wallsand support beams of cargo containers as well as in, or attachedto, the vessels themselves. DEA reporting indicates an increaseddemand by cocaine traffickers for cargo ships in order to transportbulk quantities of U.S.-bound cocaine. Furthermore, U.S. Customsreports the large volume of cargo arriving at domestic ports, coupledwith the U.S. Customs capability of inspecting only a small portion of thiscargo, continue to be factors operating in favor of smugglingorganizations. The use of low-profile vessels by cocaine traffickers hasmade maritime interdiction extremely difficult off the coast of PuertoRico. DEA reporting indicates these vessels, fabricated of wood and/orfiberglass and measuring up to only 40 feet in length, are difficult tovisually detect since their coloring blends with the ocean. Moreover,their profiles of only one to two feet above the water are notalways detectable by radar. Investigative reporting indicates thesevessels transport up to one metric ton of cocaine and sail directlyfrom Colombia to Puerto Rico without being detected. Cocaine trafficking organizations also rely heavily on theuse of noncommercial maritime vessels. Pleasure craft and fishingvessels are used to smuggle cocaine from source countries into the UnitedStates. Pleasure craft carrying cocaine enter U.S. waters by blendingin with weekend "traffic "along the southeastern coastwhere weekend vessel activity is heavy. Fishing vessels are also used to carrycocaine directly into the United States as well as to transfercocaine to other vessels off the coast. Air Transportation DEA San Diego, Los Angeles, and Miami report cocainetrafficking organizations have increased their use of airdrop operations.Cocaine traffickers are airdropping cocaine shipments in theCaribbean and off the coast of, as well as within, Central America and southernMexico. A combination of law enforcement successes, including thoseof the United States-Mexican Northern Border Response Force, andconflicts between trafficking organizations for control of clandestineairstrips have contributed to trafficker avoidance of landing aircraftin northern Mexico. Consequently, a number of smuggling organizations,including traffickers associated with the Cali Cartel, feel it is lessrisky to airdrop cocaine shipments to ground or maritime crews inCentral America or the Caribbean than to land aircraft in northern Mexico. South American cocaine traffickers have recently acquiredseveral large cargo aircraft for the transport of cocaine, therebyincreasing cargo capacity while overcoming the limited flight range of smalleraircraft. Moreover, cocaine traffickers within The Bahamas andelsewhere in the Caribbean continue to use smaller aircraft as decoys todivert law enforcement interdiction assets from actual smugglingoperations being conducted in a different locale. Land Transportation Cocaine couriers employ several methods to counter traffickerprofiles at or near the United States-Mexican border; these methodsinclude traveling in family-type groups with women and children toavoid suspicion at checkpoints, hiring non-Mexicans to transportcocaine from United States-Mexican border areas into Los Angeles, andrecruiting Anglo drivers and females to transport cocaine shipments. Kilogram bricks continue to be the predominant form ofpackaged cocaine smuggled into the United States. During the past year, DEAfield divisions have frequently cited rubber/waterproofed packagingof cocaine. Additionally, seizures of multihundred kilograms ofcocaine concealed in U-Haul cardboard boxes and 55-gallon drumsincreased. Tile- shaped cocaine (2"x 8"x 8"), vacuum-packed inmetallic-type material, has also been reported. DEA and the U.S. Customs Service reported traffickers smuggleliquefied cocaine into the United States concealed in water tanks ofmobile homes and recreational vehicles. Traffickers also have labeled55-gallon drums of liquid cocaine to reflect the climatic conditions of thelocale where the drums are shipped, i.e., a shipment to Chicago in thewinter is labeled "antifreeze." During May 1992, U.S. Customsin Houston made the first seizure of liquid cocaine at Houston IntercontinentalAirport from an Ecuadorian national enroute to New York City. DEA Miamireported small amounts of liquid cocaine are sometimes concealedwithin liquor bottles. Moreover, DEA San Diego and Baltimore reportedtraffickers are smuggling liquid cocaine into their areas of jurisdiction. Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to usecommercial and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postalservice to ship cocaine. The use of concealed compartments within vehicles iscommonly cited by DEA field divisions. During the past year, severalcocaine seizures involved multiple concealment sites within the samevehicle, a smuggling technique associated with marijuana trafficking.Popular vehicles among traffickers for transporting cocaine includeNissan vehicles and mini-vans. Additionally, some transportationorganizations use rental vehicles to circumvent vehicle seizures. Cocaine traffickers who use tractor-trailers employ severalmethods to circumvent law enforcement. There is extensive use ofelaborate hidden compartments to secrete cocaine within tractor-trailers.Additionally, cocaine is often hidden among legitimate produce such asonions and watermelons. On the West Coast, tractor-trailers obtainproduce in the San Joaquin Valley to conceal cocaine destined for theMidwest and East Coast cities. Concealment of cocaine in tractor-trailers alsoincludes the use of compartments in air-conditioning units, radiators,and batteries, containers welded in tire rims, and false walls.In the Southwest, large commercial vehicles and trucks are a primarymethod for transporting cocaine. An increase has been noted in the useof tractor- trailers to transport bulk cocaine shipments into the Chicagoarea. DEA reports truckers transporting cocaine sealed in odor-reducingwax among legitimate cargo to avoid detection at checkpoints andscales. Extensive use of commercial trucks to transport cocaine from the LosAngeles metropolitan area to destinations throughout the UnitedStates has occurred during the past year. In addition, traffickerscontinue to seek opportunities to recruit U.S. port officials to facilitatelarge cocaine shipments into the United States from Mexico bytractor-trailer. Domestic Distribution The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United Statesremains highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases ofoperation are comprised of multiple cells operating within majormetropolitan areas to include Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York,Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The operators of these cells receive ordersdirectly from top-level cartel managers in Colombia and operateindependently of other cells within the same metropolitan area. Cell operatorsutilize the latest technology, such as computers, pagers, and facsimilemachines, in their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often boughtin bulk quantities and discarded after being used for several monthsor less in order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept efforts. In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in theUnited States is not as compartmentalized as that of the CaliCartel. The drug trafficking groups, which comprise the Medellin Cartel,employ a group decision-making process at the top level as opposed to thehierarchical decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At thelower levels, trafficking groups can transact business with lessrestrictions on their choice of business associates. Peruvian traffickers reportedly ship cocaine concealed inmaritime vessels and aircraft to the United States and distribute itin the Houston area independent of Colombian organizations. The useof Peru as a source area for multiton shipments of cocaine was evidencedduring January 1992 by the seizure of five metric tons of cocaineaboard a maritime vessel. The vessel originated in Peru and wasreportedly destined for the United States and Canada when it wasinterdicted in the Caribbean. Hispanic organizations, particularly Colombian and Mexican,continue to dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and distributionwithin the United States. However, since early 1992, diverse ethnicgroups, including those of Middle Eastern, East European, CentralAsian, and East Asian descent, have become involved in these activitiesat all levels of the domestic traffic. Cocaine violators in urban areas, such as Boston and Atlanta,have expanded their distribution networks into rural areas, whichhave limited law enforcement resources, thereby reducing the riskof investigation and arrest. MISCELLANEOUS During 1992, the exchange of cocaine for heroin was reportedin Boston, Calexico, New York City, and San Diego. The frequency of suchexchanges appears to be increasing and involves foreign and domesticheroin traffickers seeking cocaine sources in the United States. Inaddition, during the past year, Southwest Asian heroin traffickingorganizations sent heroin and opium via the international mail system toaffiliates in the United States who then purchased cocaine for export toEurope. In 1992, four cocaine base conversion laboratories wereseized within the United States; two in New York City, one in Californiaand one in Florida. One of the laboratories seized in New York City was operational. This represented the first functioning cocainelaboratory seized in that city since 1987. Additionally, the operationalNew York City laboratory used a vapor eliminating device. The device,the first encountered by DEA that employed dry ice, allowed thelaboratory to function in a densely populated area without the strongchemical odors normally associated with clandestine cocaine conversionlaboratories. To date in 1993, only one cocaine base conversion laboratory hasbeen seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. Drug traffickers use high-tech equipment, includingnight-vision goggles and radios with scramblers, as well as military hardwareincluding assault rifles, hand grenades, and bulletproof vests.Trafficking organizations use scouts with radios to monitor lawenforcement activities along the United States-Mexican border. A Texascocaine organization recently attempted to purchase hand-held radiosfor surveillance and body armor for their street-level dealers.Traffickers have become more sophisticated in the use of electronicsincluding scanners with police frequencies. Countermeasures employed by cocaine traffickers against U.S.law enforcement include the use of counter-surveillance and paidinformants. Some traffickers study law enforcement methods of operationby reviewing evidence documents during court proceedings. Reportedly,defense attorneys employed by traffickers obtain investigativedocuments through the "right of the discovery process" and thentransmit by facsimile informational reports to Colombia. CRACK COCAINE AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY The simplicity of the crack conversion process allows anyperson with access to cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) to be a potentialsource of crack. Because cocaine HCl is plentiful and cheap and can beobtained in virtually every area of the country, crack is, therefore,widely available. Crack is reported by drug epidemiologists and treatmentprofessionals to be the illegal drug of choice in many U.S. cities. Notableexceptions include cities and towns along the southwest border, wheredrug traffickers are primarily concerned with transshipping thelarge amounts of cocaine HCl, marijuana, and heroin that are smuggled intothe United States, and certain areas within several north-central andnortheastern States that lack large ethnic minority communities,traditional strongholds for crack distribution and abuse. Nonetheless,three Haitian crack sellers were recently arrested in Portland, Maine,indicating that no region is immune to crack trafficking. Crack distribution and use appear to have reached thesaturation point in large urban areas throughout the country. Intensivecompetition in the mid-to-late 1980's inundated the largest consumer poolswith crack. As a result, a number of crack trafficking groups haverelocated or extended their operations to smaller cities, towns, and ruralareas; the primary motivation for this is profit. Simply put, a rock orvial of crack that sells for $5 to $10 in a large, well-populatedarea will command a significantly higher price, usually $25 to $40 in asmaller, less populated area. The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from aslow as $2 to as high as $75 but it generally sells for $10 to $50,depending upon the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. In general, the largercities have the lowest retail prices. Reporting from New York Cityindicates a dosage unit of crack sells for as low as two dollars, while asingle puff on a crack pipe can be obtained for as little as 75cents. Reporting from Philadelphia and Detroit indicates that crackcan be purchased for as low as $2.50 and $3.00 per dosage unit,respectively. Prices for gram quantities of crack generally range from $45to $150 nationally. At the ounce and kilogram level, crack prices arecomparable to cocaine HCl prices and usually range from $475 to $2,500per ounce and from $17,000 to $35,000 per kilogram. In the mid-to-late 1980's, a readily available supply ofinexpensive and high quality crack at the retail level virtually eliminatedany need for users to perform the crack conversion process themselves.Indeed, quality control was a major factor in marketing the drug.Analysis of crack samples by DEA laboratories revealed that purity wasconsistently high during that period, averaging 80-plus percent. Although retail purity remains high, averaging almost 83percent in 1992, sellers in some areas of the country, such as New York,Los Angeles, and several cities in the Southeast, are sellingpoor-quality crack, cut with adulterants such as lidocaine and procaine.These adulterants increase the weight or the size of the crack and,therefore, the profits. Many retailers will sell recently prepared crackthat has not been dried thoroughly and is still wet from theconversion process. This practice is most profitable when dealing in wholesalequantities where transactions are strictly determined by weight. At thedosage unit or retail level, where the size of the rock is of greaterconcern, procaine serves to increase the dimensions of the rock byadding holes or pockets of air, giving rise to the street term"blow-up." Obviously, the smaller the amount of pure cocaine present in the rock,the less intense euphoric reaction the user will experience. Inaddition, a limited number of retailers are selling bogus or"beat" crack to unfamiliar customers because their regular customers consumevirtually the entire supply. Substitutes include soap, chalk, plaster,peanuts, popcorn, and candle wax, which is known on the street as"perp." Practices such as these are creating an increasing number of dissatisfied and wary customers. An almost inexhaustiblesupply of cheap, high-purity cocaine HCl, combined with a relativelysimple and safe production process, makes home conversion by the crackuser more appealing than the risk of purchasing and smoking low-qualityor sham crack. In fact, sellers in some northeastern cities sell twoqualities of cocaine HCl, a high-purity powder for users who willperform the conversion to crack themselves, and a low-purity powder foringestion through snorting only. It has also been reported that usersin Chicago prefer the freebase method of conversion in the belief thatthis method yields a higher purity product than the crack conversionprocess. USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showedthat the number of lifetime, past-year and past-month users of crackdeclined significantly from 1991 to 1992. The highest percentages ofcrack use were among those who were disproportionately represented in socioeconomic groups that have historically faced increasedhealth risks, including African-Americans, the unemployed, andhigh-school dropouts, as well as young adults aged 18 to 34. According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, lifetime use of crack among high school seniors declined from1991 to 1992; however, past-year, past-month, and daily use of crackby this group remained relatively stable during that period.Nevertheless, overall frequency of crack use among high school seniors hasdecreased substantially since 1987. Of particular concern is the slight rise in frequency ofcrack use among 8th graders. From 1991 to 1992, survey data indicate that anincreasing number of 8th grade students had used crack during theirlifetime as well as on a yearly and monthly basis. Also, fewer 8thgraders in 1992 associated great risk of harm with occasional crack use thandid 8th graders in 1991. TRAFFICKING Trafficking/Distribution Levels Crack trafficking is conducted at three broad levels, namely,wholesale trafficking, mid-level distribution, and retail selling. Itmust be emphasized that these classifications are not concrete andthe activities of a specific violator or group may vary. Forexample, as will be explained later, the functions of a Jamaican possemay encompass all three levels within the same organization. Wholesale Trafficking: Crack traffickers purchase cocaine HClin kilogram or multikilogram allotments from traditional cocaineHCl sources, including Colombians and Mexicans. The wholesaletraffickers will either package the cocaine HCl into ounce quantities orconvert it into crack themselves and then divide it into ounces for saleat the next level. Wholesalers usually represent large groups thatare responsible for the majority of the interstate transportationof crack and cocaine HCl intended for crack conversion. The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by manysmall (up to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking organizations consisting of bands of individuals fromdistinct ethnic groups. The main participants involved in wholesale cracktrafficking are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, andHaitian and Dominican groups. Without exception, each of these groupsstarted out as poly-drug traffickers, dealing primarily in marijuana andcocaine HCl, and continue to sell these drugs. Similarly, street-levelsellers often sell retail units of other drugs in addition to crack. Mid-level Distribution: Distributors further divide theounces of crack into dosage units for sale at the retail level. If theypurchase cocaine HCl, they can perform the conversion process easilythemselves. These distributors often operate crack houses or managestreet-corner sales locations and supervise up to 20 individual sellers.Mid-level distributors can be either members of larger groups orindependent operators. Retail-level Sales: Sellers carry dosage units of cracktotaling no more than a few grams at any one time. Workers in crack houseswill sell dosage units from the one or two ounces that are delivered bythe mid- level distributors. Retailers are typically young males whoare unemployed or destitute and many of them are crack addictsthemselves. At the retail level, crack is sold by countless individualsellers, usually in inner-city sections of large metropolitan areas.Upon arrest, these retailers are almost immediately replaced. While cracksellers and users are present in virtually every ethnic community andeconomic group, the majority are from low-income, urbanAfrican-American and Hispanic neighborhoods. Trafficking Networks Over the past few years, crack trafficking has expanded fromthe large urban centers to smaller cities, towns, and rural areasacross the United States. Major crack trafficking groups, such as theCrips, the Bloods, and Jamaicans, are successfully extending theirnetworks from large cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, and NewYork City, to street corners and dwellings in virtually every Stateincluding Alaska and Hawaii. This is occurring primarily for tworeasons. First, these groups are attempting to enlarge their customer poolsand increase their potential profits; second, the threat of disruption bylaw enforcement pressure or aggressive competition has generatedthe search for less hostile environments. Jamaican posses are making advances away from the traditional strongholds of Miami and New York City, targeting new crackmarkets. Areas witnessing increased posse activity include Dallas andKansas City; Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia; and theFlorida Panhandle. Jamaican posses reportedly have been distributingcrack as far westward as south-central Los Angeles. In a similarmanner, the Crips and the Bloods or their affiliates have been movingeastward into cities such as Birmingham, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, andPhoenix, as well as into West Coast cities such as Seattle. Recentreports in the media suggest that these gangs are also moving into New YorkCity. In effect, posses and gangs have crisscrossed the nation withcrack- trafficking networks. When crack first became available in New York City, it wassold by small local bands of independent street sellers. Quite soon,however, these sellers were incorporated into the lowest level of largeorganized networks. The most successful groups increased theirmembership by adopting other gangs through strong-armed persuasion oreliminated their leadership altogether. As the groups grew larger, theyattracted more law enforcement attention. In the late 1980's, New YorkCity's two largest crack distribution organizations, Lido and BasedBalls, were successfully dismantled by Federal, State, and local lawenforcement agencies. Currently, the larger groups in the United States are tryingto insulate themselves from law enforcement detection by scaling down and streamlining their crack production and sales operations. Thetedious and labor-intensive process of shaving off dosage unit sizerocks of crack from larger chunks and packaging them in countless tinyplastic bags or vials in cumbersome factory style operations is illsuited to the clandestine nature of drug distribution. Recentdisruption of a large number of organizations by law enforcement has createda distribution and sales system composed of many small groupsoperating in a limited number of neighborhoods. Trafficking Groups The major crack trafficking organizations consist of streetgangs, such as the Crips and the Bloods, and groups of Jamaicans,Haitians, and Dominicans. They all use similar trafficking and distributiontechniques and are engaged in interstate and intrastate transportationof wholesale amounts of crack and cocaine HCl. They also have theknowledge, experience, drug connections, manpower, and firepower to plytheir trade over long distances. The majority of the information contained in this section wasobtained from the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime LawEnforcement Network Fifth Annual Conferences on International CaribbeanOrganized Crime held June 15-19, 1992, and June 29 through July 2,1993, in Baltimore. Jamaicans: One of the most effective crack trafficking groupsin the United States is the Jamaican posse. Posses consist of gangsof Jamaican immigrants, often illegal aliens, that are involved in manycriminal activities other than drug trafficking, including robbery,fraud, and money laundering. From these activities, posses receive anestimated one billion dollars annually drug proceeds. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) estimatesthat, currently, there are approximately 35 posses operating in theUnited States with total membership numbering at least 11,000. Mostposses maintain some type of link to the larger, more establishedgroups or parent posses in New York City or Miami, such as the Shower,Spangler, Dunkirk, and Jungle posses. New York City is generallyconsidered to be the hub of Jamaican posse activity. Jamaican posses are extremely violent, competitive, andindividualistic. As a result, the structure of Jamaican organized crime willremain fragmented, lacking disciplined organizations and allianceswhich are common characteristics of traditional organized crime. Also,successful prosecution by Federal authorities over the past severalyears has disrupted much of the organization and control of the mostprominent posses that operated nationwide. As a result of thesefactors, a large number of newly named splinter groups have evolved under thedirection of new posse bosses. Jamaican posses are attempting to insulate themselves fromlaw enforcement pressure and violent competition by distancingthemselves from the often dangerous day-to-day operation of crack housesand by distributing larger amounts of cocaine, in effect simplysupplying those same crack houses and street level distribution sites.Jamaicans are also initiating alliances with members of other ethnic drugtrafficking groups. For example, Jamaicans have been attempting toestablish connections with Colombian and Mexican wholesale suppliers ofcocaine in order to eliminate middlemen and related additional costs.Also, Jamaicans have been employing other minorities such asHaitians because they are willing to work for less in the lower levels of the distribution chain. Jamaicans also are distributing other illegal drugs such asheroin and marijuana; a few have been able to realize higher profitsfrom heroin distribution. Moreover, some Jamaicans have returned totrafficking marijuana because the Federal penalties for marijuanatrafficking are less severe than those for crack and cocaine HCl, yet theprofit potential is almost as high. A common method of operation by Jamaican posses is termed"drip" trafficking. In an attempt to escape law enforcement effortsand to protect against seizure, loss, or theft by competitors,Jamaican posses do not stockpile large amounts of drugs and money; rather,they move smaller quantities more often and more quickly. In their efforts to expand crack sales and increase profits,Jamaican posses are branching out to other cities and rural areas toestablish new drug markets where competition from rival gangs and lawenforcement activity is lessened. This migration has been observed inDallas, Denver, Kansas City, Washington, D.C., and northern Florida. The Southwest border area has seen a significant influx ofJamaican traffickers during the last five years because cocaine HCland marijuana are much cheaper to purchase in that region of the country.As a result, they have set up storefronts, usually garages, hair salons,or music stores, to mask distribution outlets and to launder proceeds.Since weapons can be purchased for less in Texas than in othersouthern States, Jamaicans often use females to make straw purchasesof guns which are then sent to New York and other cities in theNortheast. Drugs, proceeds, and weapons are all shipped to differentlocations using a variety of means. Commercial airlines have proven tobe an effective method of transportation. When interdiction effortsat particular airports become prohibitive, couriers drive toairports in other cities to elude law enforcement. Buses, trains, andrental vehicles are also popular methods of shipment. Falsecompartments are frequently built into vehicles for transportation of drugs,money, and weapons. Additionally, mail services such as United ParcelService and Federal Express are used to ship drugs and profits for theJamaican posses. Dominicans: While some official estimates of the number ofDominicans living in New York City are as low as 350,000, ATF claims theactual number, including illegal aliens, may be closer to 1,000,000. The hierarchy of Dominican gangs is slightly different thanthat of the Jamaicans in that the Dominican bosses usually run theirnetworks from the Dominican Republic directly, traveling to and from theUnited States as needed. Dominican gangs are always armed and employ modernequipment and techniques in their daily operations, includingwalkie-talkies, "kel" transmitting devices, booby traps (to protectdrugs and money from police action as well as from theft by competitors), and useof counter- surveillance, which they practiced in the Dominican Republicin order to elude the police. Like the Jamaican posses, the Dominican traffickers are veryviolent and competitive and, as a result, do not easily form tightlystructured and disciplined organizations. Although some reports suggest theemergence of a Dominican drug cartel, no evidence has been broughtforth to verify the existence of an organization capable of orchestratinglarge-scale importation and trafficking activities. However, thiseventuality should not be dismissed because, since the early 1980's, theDominican Republic has been used by Colombians as a refueling and transshipmentpoint for drugs destined for the United States and cooperation betweenColombian and Dominican traffickers has flourished. Dominicans have made gains in establishing money-launderingoperations and front companies, most commonly travel agencies and checkcashing businesses. At times, they purchase businesses outright ormake deals with the owners or proprietors to carry out their orders. Itis not known to what extent drug proceeds are sent directly to theDominican Republic. Overall money transfers are estimated to beapproximately $800 million per year. Haitians: Haitian drug traffickers in the United States havebeen able to strengthen their status in the drug trade through twosignificant events. First, an influx of Haitian immigrants since theearly 1970's has provided a large pool of recruits for the drug trade.Second, by the late 1980's, Haiti had become an important way station forcocaine HCl shipped into the United States by the Colombian cartels. At present, Haitian crack traffickers operate in a limitednumber of major cities, primarily Miami and New York, and have notextended their operations as the Jamaicans have. Many Haitian sellers aremoving their way up the distribution hierarchy by working at the lowerlevels of crack operations run by other ethnic groups. Street Gangs: Street gangs, operating under the umbrellanames of the Crips and the Bloods, extended their networks from thestreets of Los Angeles to many major American cities in the last half of the1980's. Sales of crack and cocaine HCl brought them power andinfluence during that time. Gang members learned quickly that the cheapcocaine available in Los Angeles could be sold as cocaine HCl or crack at greatprofit in other parts of the country. Los Angeles street gangs are very loosely organized in smallunits or "sets" falling under the auspices of the twopredominant gangs, the Crips and the Bloods. The general street gang structurebegins with diverse groups of gang members acting as street-level sellersconducting transactions in amounts up to several grams or even ounces onthe street or in rock houses. A few of these sellers rise to becomemid-level distributors, dealing in amounts of up to one kilogram ormore and working between the street-level sellers and the majortraffickers. Capable of brokering multimillion dollar deals, the majortraffickers, often referred to as "high rollers," are notusually visible gang members and often have direct contacts with Colombianwholesale cocaine suppliers. Initially, gangs sold marijuana and PCP prior to enteringinto cocaine HCl and crack trafficking, distribution, and sales.Eventually, they developed a mode of operation that closely resembles theJamaican model. Typically, gang members travel to and establish crackoperations in smaller cities and towns where there is little policepressure and competition from rivals. They often gain entry into acommunity by visiting or living with friends or relatives. In addition tosecuring lodgings, these visits provide access to young people,potential recruits and customers, and help them attain legitimacy andacceptance within the community. Soon, the gang members will seek out inmany instances low-income single mothers and offer them $100 a dayto use their apartment or house as a crack conversion ordistribution site. A common marketing technique known as "double up" isused by these street gangs to attract new customers and involves the sale of twodosage units of crack for the price of one. Sales Locations With few exceptions, crack distribution takes place either inurban or suburban dwellings of all types or at inner-city streetcorner locations. Virtually every large city in America has seen theemergence of both of these retail sales locations. The prevalence ofone site over the other may be directly linked to two factors. First, weather plays a major role in determining the chosenmethod of crack distribution. For example, in cities with cold winters,sellers will set up crack houses to escape the elements themselvesand to offer customers more hospitable accommodations. In summer, theoperation may be moved outdoors where increased pedestrian traffic providesthe necessary cover for street corner sales. Second, the presence of significant law enforcement activitymay force street corner retailers to set up indoor crack facilities toevade detection. Conversely, if gangs are suffering substantiallosses due to police raids on established crack houses, they may dispatchsellers to specific, pre-designated street corner sales locations. The sale of crack at street corner locations is considered tobe ideal because it provides sellers many avenues of escape when facedwith police pressure. If a particular street becomes too"hot" with police activity, the retailers merely move a few blocks away andcontinue selling. Moreover, tactics can be employed to mask streetcorner sales of crack. In New York City, crack distributors have beenknown to dispatch a seller along with up to 10 people dressed exactlyalike to work a street corner in an attempt to disrupt surveillanceefforts. In addition, street corner operations do not requireexpenditures for rent and utilities, as is the case with crack houses. HEROIN AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY Within the United States, heroin is readily available in allmajor metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 andthe first few months of 1993, there was an increase in puritynationwide at the retail level and increased supplies available from SouthwestAsia. (It should be noted that high purity heroin has been importedfrom Colombia in increasing quantities in the past year. This heroin fromColombia, which underwent signature analysis prior to DEA's developmentof a South American heroin signature in July 1993, was analyzed ashaving a Southwest Asian (SWA) signature. As a result, it may accountin part for both the increased purity and quantity of SWA heroin in theUnited States.) At present, street-level purity, the key indicatorof availability, is at high levels, particularly in thenortheastern metropolitan areas. Heroin from every major source area is available in theUnited States, which is the most lucrative wholesale and retail level heroinmarket in the world. The origin of heroin smuggled into the UnitedStates and the proportion from each source area is tracked by DEA's HeroinSignature Program (HSP). Each year an in-depth chemical analysis isperformed on 600 to 800 samples taken from heroin seizures and purchasesmade in the United States. The samples selected for signature analysisinclude all DEA seizures at U.S. points of entry and otherseizures/purchases selected at random from DEA, in addition to Federal Bureau of Investigation, and U.S. Customs Service seizures andpurchases. As a result of signature analysis, DEA chemists are able toassociate the heroin sample with a heroin manufacturing process unique to aparticular geographic source area. The proportion of samples associatedwith each geographic area is measured both in terms of the number ofsamples from each geographic source area and, since 1989, the net weightof the heroin samples from each area. In 1991, Southeast Asia (SEA) was the prevalent source areafor heroin in the United States for the fourth year in a row, accountingfor 58 percent of the heroin samples analyzed through the HSP. SWAheroin and Mexican source heroin accounted for half of the remainingsamples with 21 percent apiece. In 1992, the results of the HSP wereskewed by the introduction of a number of samples of purported Colombianheroin. Because a specific signature for heroin from Colombia was notavailable then, most heroin samples of alleged Colombian origin areanalyzed as having a Southwest Asian signature. With this in mind,preliminary HSP figures for 1992 reflect that 44 percent of the heroinsamples analyzed were from Southeast Asia, 39 percent from Southwest Asia orColombia, and the remaining 17 percent from Mexico. Signature analysis also reveals that SEA heroin accounted for88 percent of the total net weight of the heroin samples analyzed in1991, and 58 percent in 1992. SWA heroin (including heroin from Colombia)accounted for nine and 32 percent of the total net weight of the heroinsamples analyzed in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Mexican heroinaccounted for three percent of the total net weight in 1991 and 10 percentin 1992. U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK InternationalAirport, are primary entry points for heroin shipments destined for theU.S. market. The HSP shows that 91 percent (454 out of 498) of the heroinseizures that took place at the U.S. border and points of entry during1992 occurred at airports, and that over 75 percent of the airportseizures occurred at New York's JFK International Airport. Thenationwide average net weight airport seizure was almost 800 grams and theaverage purity of the heroin seized at these airports was 73 percent. Nationally, in 1992, a kilogram of SEA heroin sold for$90,000 to $250,000. In the northeastern United States, SEA heroin isalso commonly sold in units (700 grams), which sell for $90,000 to$115,000. The price for SWA heroin ranged from $80,000 to $200,000 per kilogram.Wholesale level prices for Mexican heroin were the lowest of any typeof heroin and ranged from $50,000 to $150,000. The wide range in theprice of a kilogram reflects several variables including buyer/sellerrelationship, quantity purchased, purchase frequency, purity, andtransportation costs. Numerous and diverse foreign sources of supply alsoaccount for the wide variances. At the mid-level of the traffic, where dealers sellquantities ranging from an ounce to multiounces, SEA heroin and SWA heroin soldfor $5,500 to $12,000 per ounce. Mexican black tar heroin sold forbetween $1,800 and $4,000 per ounce, and Mexican brown powder heroin pricesranged from $ 1,000 to $ 1,800 per ounce. Domestic prices for Colombian-source heroin are generallycompatible with the prices for heroin from Southeast and Southwest Asia.Kilogram prices quoted in undercover negotiations range up to $150,000and vary depending on final point of delivery. In actual undercoverpurchases of smaller amounts, one-eighth of a kilogram cost $23,500,one-fourth of a kilogram cost $42,500, and one-half kilogram sold for$62,250. Heroin is sold at the retail level in the United States atprices ranging from $10 to $50 and in quantities ranging from 10 to50 milligrams. The retail price remains relatively constant atthis level because retail-level purity, rather than retail-level price,is adjusted by the distributors to account for availability and tomanipulate profit margins. The HSP provides purity information on heroin shipmentssmuggled into the United States at the importation, or wholesale, level.For all types of heroin at this level, the nationwide average purity in1992 was 64 percent. SWA heroin was the purest form available at thewholesale level, averaging 72 percent. SEA heroin nationwide averagedslightly lower at 68 percent, while Mexican heroin averaged 33percent. At the retail level, purity is tracked by DEA's DomesticMonitor Program (DMP), a heroin purchase program designed to provide price,purity, and geographic source area data on heroin being distributed onthe streets of U.S. cities. The program is conducted quarterly in onecity from each of DEA's 19 field divisions and San Juan, Puerto Rico. According to DMP data for 1992, the nationwide average purityfor retail level heroin was 37 percent. This percentage was much higherthan the average of 6.9 percent recorded a decade ago and alsoconsiderably higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent recorded in1991. The increase in average purity corresponded directly to anincrease in availability of high purity SEA and SWA heroin. AlthoughMexican heroin has been traditionally of lower purity than other herointypes in recent years, it too increased in purity at the street level.Street-level purity of SWA heroin analyzed in the DMP during 1992 was thehighest for all sources, averaging 55.8 percent, while Mexican heroin, at25.6 percent, almost doubled between 1991 and 1992. SEA heroinremained widely available in the northeastern United States with anaverage purity of 34.4 percent. Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest inthe northeastern United States, where a large percentage of thenation's user population lives. In New York City, one of the majorimportation and distribution centers for SEA and SWA heroin, the averagepurity at the street level for these types of heroin was, respectively,54.3 percent and 69.7 percent. Boston recorded the highest averagepurity of retail level heroin in all of the DMP cities with an averageof 73.7 percent during 1992. USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992indicated a decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey datashow that the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who haveused heroin at least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to323,000 in 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number ofpast-month heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. The increasein the number of lifetime heroin users to 2,653,000 in 1991 appearsto have been an anomaly, as the 1992 estimate has declined to1,840,000. (Estimates of heroin use from the Household Survey areconsidered very conservative due to the probable under coverage of thepopulation of heroin users.) According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, heroin use increased among high school seniors. Although 1.2percent of the seniors in the class of 1992 reported they had usedheroin at least once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of1991, it was still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classesof 1989 and 1990. Moreover, for the first time in recent years, there wasa statistically significant decline among seniors in theperceived risk of harm associated with heroin use. The National High School Survey also shows that lifetimeheroin use among 8th graders increased from 1.2 percent in 1991 to 1.4percent in 1992, past year use remained steady, and past-month useincreased from a 0.3 percent in 1991 to 0.4 percent in 1992. Among 10thgraders, both lifetime and past-month use remained stable from 1991 to1992, while past-year heroin use increased form 0.5 percent to 0.6percent. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofnationwide heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had beenfluctuating somewhat during the past several years, increasedsubstantially from the first to second half of FY 1992. During that time frame, thenumber of heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, anincrease of 35 percent. Cities showing substantive increases during thelatter half of FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency roomepisodes included Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. Possible explanations for the rising levels of heroin-relatedemergency room episodes have been provided by a number of drugepidemiologists and treatment specialists. Reports indicate that segments of thecrack cocaine user population are using or switching to heroin as ameans to mitigate the depressive effects associated with withdrawalfrom crack. There are additional reports of the appearance, in a limitednumber of areas, of new distributors attempting to establish markets aswell as the growing involvement of youth gangs in the heroin traffic.Moreover, heroin is now being sold in white as well as African-Americanand Hispanic neighborhoods in a limited number of cities. In NewYork City, anecdotal information indicates that more teenagers andfemales are selling heroin than in the past. Lastly, there is aperception among some users that heroin is a safer drug than cocaine, whilecertain others consider heroin use to be "cool." The latterrepresents a radical departure from previous attitudes toward heroin use. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection ofheroin continues to be the predominant route of administration usedby patients admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.However, the percentage of patients who indicated that injection wastheir primary route of administration has decreased from 79.1percent in FY 1989 to 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same time frame,there was an increase in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin.Those who snorted heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8percent in FY 1992. Increases in snorting are attributed, in part, to afear of contracting AIDS through needle sharing and the availabilityof high- purity heroin on the street. Opiate use (to include heroin) among recently bookedarrestees as reported by the DUF Program remained relatively low andstable in 1992 when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. Citieshaving the highest percentage of positive urinalysis tests for heroinamong booked male arrestees in the first half of 1992 were Chicago at 19percent; New York City at 18 percent; San Antonio at 15 percent; San Diegoat 16 percent; Washington, D.C., at 11 percent; Los Angeles at 11percent; and Philadelphia at 12 percent. Female arrestees tested positiveat high rates in New York City (24%), Portland (22%), Washington,D.C., (19%), San Diego (17%), Detroit (15%), Phoenix (15%), San Antonio(14%), and Los Angeles (13%). TRAFFICKING SEA Heroin Trafficking Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under thecontrol of Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smugglingof SEA heroin into the United States. Chinese traffickers in theUnited States with links to these international criminal groups are themost prolific importers and distributors of heroin from Southeast Asia.Chinese or Thai nationals are often used to transport the heroin and aregenerally responsible for the largest bulk shipments, in themultihundred kilogram range, of SEA heroin smuggled into the United States. Around 1986, these Chinese smuggling groups took over themultibillion dollar wholesale heroin trade that had been controlled forover two decades by Traditional Organized Crime groups in the UnitedStates. Over the next few years, ethnic Chinese traffickers flooded thenortheastern United States, the largest heroin market in the country, withbulk shipments of high-purity SEA heroin. In recent years, thesehighly structured clandestine Chinese organizations have increasedthe size and number of heroin shipments to the United States. In the wakeof increased availability, the layers of mid-level distributorsin the New York City area were eliminated and Chinese wholesalers solddirectly to Dominican street-level dealers, a development that resultedin enhanced heroin purity at the street level. SEA heroin traffickers use a variety of transportation routesto smuggle heroin into the United States from the Far East. One of themajor routes originates in Bangkok and terminates in New York City, thelargest heroin importation and distribution center in the UnitedStates. (Each year since 1986, roughly half of DEA's nationwide seizuresoccur in the New York City metropolitan area.) Maritime cargo shipmentsare the primary transport method for smugglers using this route andthe shipments may transit a variety of countries including HongKong, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan. Many shipmentsfrom the Far East are also transshipped through Canada and then intothe northeastern United States. Traffickers smuggle heroinshipments aboard commercial airlines originating in Bangkok and then transitalmost any Asian city, as well as a number of cities in Europe andCanada. In addition to New York City, other U.S. cities in theNortheast, including Boston and Philadelphia, are also used as entry points.Traffickers also use West Coast cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, andSeattle as entry points for heroin shipments destined for the Northeast. Chinese traffickers employ a variety of smuggling methods.Generally, the size of the heroin shipment determines the smugglingmethod. The largest shipments, ranging from 50- to multihundred-kilogramquantities, are secreted in containerized freight aboard commercialmarine vessels and air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are concealed in theluggage of airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. SEAheroin smugglers also use the mails and delivery services totransport multigram to kilogram quantities into the country. Traffickers using commercial cargo originating in sourcecountries frequently attempt to disguise the origin of the cargoshipment by first transshipping containers through several other countries orby falsifying the container documentation. In 1992, 35 kilogramsof heroin, which were shipped from Singapore concealed in ceramic tiles,were seized in Newark, New Jersey. In May 1991, the largest heroinseizure in U.S. history occurred near Oakland, California, when 494kilograms of SEA heroin were seized from a commercial cargo of plasticbags aboard a merchant vessel. The shipment originated in Thailand and was transshipped through Taiwan prior to importation into theUnited States. In addition to the Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers,Nigerians remain deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigeriantraffickers dispatch large numbers of internal body couriers travelingaboard commercial airlines bound for the United States. These"swallowers," including Nigerians as well as other nationalities recruitedas couriers, can smuggle up to two-kilogram amounts of SEAheroin per trip. Moreover, recent reporting suggests that a number of Nigerian trafficking groups are experimenting with smuggling larger (multikilogram) shipments of heroin concealed in commercialmaritime cargo. Most Nigerian organizations are based in Lagos, Nigeria.Since they are formed along tribal lines at the senior levels, theorganizations are close-knit. Drug barons who control the Nigerianorganizations remain well-insulated by directing lower-level traffickers torecruit the numerous couriers, often non-Nigerians, and to organizetravel to the United States. In 1992, Nigerians returned almost all profitsgenerated in the United States to Lagos, Nigeria, or to Europe forlaundering. As a result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue torecruit other ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, andAmerican citizens, as heroin couriers. New York's JFK InternationalAirport was the entry point used most frequently by Nigerian trafficking organizations in 1992. However, during the past year,Nigerian traffickers diversified both the smuggling routes used toreach the United States and their points of entry into the country. Forexample, West Africans, in all likelihood controlled by Nigerians,made a limited number of attempts to smuggle heroin through entry pointsalong the United States Southwest border and the Canadian border during1992. Nigerians have established heroin distribution networks inU.S. cities with well-established Nigerian populations such as Atlanta,Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Newark, New York, and Washington,D.C. These networks are capable of supplying heroin ranging from100-gram to multikilogram quantities on a regular basis. During 1992,reporting from a DEA investigation in Dallas indicated that Nigerian herointraffickers collaborated with members of Jamaican posses in distributingheroin from Jamaican-controlled crack houses in Dallas and hired possemembers as enforcers to protect Nigerian operations. SWA Heroin Trafficking SWA heroin in the United States increased in availability andpurity during 1992 and the first few months of 1993. While some ofthe rise in purity levels for SWA heroin is in all likelihoodattributable to the influx of high-purity heroin from Colombia, investigativereporting and laboratory analysis show that traditional SWA herointraffickers are also smuggling a purer form of heroin into the United States. Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much lesscentralized than that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard totrafficking groups. A number of ethnic groups from Southwest Asia, theMiddle East, and Europe are active in smuggling SWA heroin into the UnitedStates, and its distribution; these ethnic groups include Afghans,Greeks, Iranians, Israelis, Lebanese, Pakistanis, and Turks. SWAheroin is transported to the United States directly from producingcountries, as well as transshipped through Europe and Africa. Significantquantities of SWA heroin bound for the United States are alsotransshipped through the Canadian cities of Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.Although New York City is a major SWA heroin importation and distributioncenter, heroin is also smuggled into and distributed throughout theNortheast; in Mid-Atlantic cities such as Baltimore and Washington,D.C.; in some cities on the West Coast such as Los Angeles, San Diego, andSan Francisco; in some Midwestern cities including Chicago andDetroit; and in Puerto Rico. Other points of entry for SWA heroin includeHouston and Miami. Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United States arehighly cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are based onethnic, familial, and tribal relationships. SWA heroin importers andwholesale level distributors generally are very cautious and rarelytransact with outsiders. As a result, SWA heroin trafficking anddistribution are generally more prevalent in cities that have largepopulations from Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey, such asChicago, Detroit, and New York City. SWA heroin traffickers rely less on commercial cargo as asmuggling method than their counterparts from Southeast Asia.Generally, SWA heroin traffickers, unlike Chinese traffickers, do notsmuggle heroin on a large scale, such as multiple bulk shipments. However, theyare able to regularly smuggle shipments ranging from one to 20kilograms and, on occasion, larger amounts. Many SWA heroin traffickingorganizations use commercial cargo and couriers aboard commercial airlines tosmuggle one to five kilograms on a steady basis. However, severalorganizations are capable of smuggling from five- to 10 kilogram shipmentsaboard maritime vessels on a fairly regular basis. Pakistani traffickers, who smuggle SWA heroin, controlimportation routes into the United States and distribution networks inNew York City and other cities in the East and Midwest. This heroin isoccasionally transshipped through California as well. Pakistanitraffickers are adept at developing new smuggling techniques and unique concealmentmethods, such as specially designed vests with pockets to concealheroin, which are worn underneath the clothes of couriers on airlines. Pakistanis regularly transact business with Afghan and Indian traffickers, and other ethnic groups from Southwest and SouthAsia. Some Nigerians still smuggle and distribute SWA heroin but mostare now more active in trafficking SEA heroin. Lebanese trafficking groups appear to be increasing theirlevel of smuggling into and distribution in the United States,particularly in Boston, Detroit, and New York, cities with large Lebanesecommunities. Moreover, some SWA heroin originally destined for theEuropean market is now smuggled into the United States because Lebanesetraffickers, in an effort to maximize profit margins, are exchanging SWA heroinfor cocaine with Colombian cocaine organizations. (At the wholesalelevel, heroin prices in the United States are higher than in Europe, whilecocaine prices in Europe are higher than in the United States.) Mexican Heroin Trafficking Mexican heroin, in brown powder form as well as the morewidely available black tar form, is produced almost exclusively forthe U.S. heroin market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexicanheroin to and within the United States is controlled by organizationscomposed of Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans. Mexican trafficking organizations are often made up of family members, lifelongfriends, and other trusted associates. While some Mexican organizations control the entire processfrom opium production and heroin processing in Mexico to the managementof transportation and distribution networks in the UnitedStates, other trafficking organizations operate independently on a smallerscale. Mexico's extensive land border with the United Statesprovides smugglers numerous entry points into the country. Heroin is smuggledacross the U.S. Southwest border in relatively small amounts, most oftenranging from gram- to multiounce quantities, by large numbers ofillegal immigrants and migrant workers. Occasionally, there are largeseizures, such as the April 1993 seizure of approximately 10 kilogramsof black tar heroin at Blythe, California, but such amounts are theexception. Generally, Mexican heroin seizures do not exceed one or twokilograms. The use of numerous couriers to smuggle relatively smallquantities of Mexican heroin is characteristic of the smuggling methodsemployed by Mexican heroin traffickers. These traffickers take advantageof their close proximity to the United States by stockpiling thelarger quantities of heroin in Mexico and then smuggling smalleramounts as transactions in the United States are arranged. Mosttraffickers believe their heroin stockpiles are less susceptible to lawenforcement in Mexico, and by storing heroin there they minimize the dangerof U.S. authorities seizing significant amounts of heroin. Accordingto investigative reporting, even large poly-drug Mexicanorganizations, which are capable of smuggling multiton quantities of cocaineand marijuana, limit smuggling of Mexican heroin into the UnitedStates to kilogram and smaller amounts. Traffickers who distribute Mexican heroin within the UnitedStates are generally Mexican immigrants, primarily from the States ofDurango, Michoacan, Nuevo Leon, and Sinaloa. Mexican organizationscontrol distribution at the wholesale level but are not generallyinvolved in street sales which are often managed by local gangs. Smuggling methods include concealment in motor vehicles,public transportation vehicles, internal and external body carry,and commercial package express services. Females are used muchmore frequently than males as couriers for transporting heroin andmoney across the border. Once the heroin is smuggled into the United States,transportation is arranged to metropolitan areas in the western andsouthwestern States where there are sizable populations of Mexican immigrants.Heroin is also transported to the Chicago, Denver, and St. Louismetropolitan areas, primary markets for Mexican heroin. In the UnitedStates, Mexican black tar heroin is usually sold by the "piece" orMexican ounce, which weighs 25 grams. Colombian Heroin Trafficking The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in theUnited States during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according toseizure analysis and investigative reporting. While most evidencesuggests that Colombian traffickers are still operating at a fairly lowlevel, the potential of the Colombian heroin threat is serious,primarily because of the smuggling resources controlled by the Colombiancocaine cartels. At present, Colombian heroin traffickers are attempting toestablish distribution outlets in the United States, particularly inthe metropolitan areas of the Northeast, and, as a result, aresmuggling a heroin of very high purity, generally 80-plus percent. Thehigh purity is essential in order for the Colombian traffickers to breakinto the fiercely competitive retail heroin markets in Boston, Newark,New York City, and Philadelphia, where street level purity averagesover 50 percent. Colombian heroin is also available in southern NewEngland cities, such as Hartford and Bridgeport, Connecticut, andProvidence, Rhode Island, where, according to reporting from the BostonField Division, Cali Cartel cocaine networks are operating.Currently, significant investigations of Colombian heroin traffickingorganizations are underway in Miami, Newark, New York City, San Diego, andSan Juan, Puerto Rico. Since 1991, most of the Colombian heroin smuggled into theUnited States has been transported by couriers aboard commercial airlines,a method requiring numerous couriers carrying amounts ranging up to akilogram per trip. Colombian couriers commonly transport the heroin infalse- sided briefcases and luggage, inside hollowed-out shoe soles,or by internal body carry methods. Much of this activity appears tobe the work of smaller, independent Colombian traffickers, accordingto investigative reporting from the DEA Bogota Country Office. According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the number ofColombian couriers who were arrested on commercial airlines carryingheroin into the United States increased from 41 in 1991 to over 260 in1992; most of these seizures occurred at either Miami or New York'sinternational airports. The majority of Colombian couriers arrested inMiami confessed to being en route to New York City or possessed follow-ontickets for that destination. Individuals with an end destination ofMiami were often instructed to check into a local hotel and awaitfurther instructions. The primary method of smuggling (ingestion) employed byColombian traffickers and the seizure amounts (usually less than 500grams) indicate that Colombian traffickers presently are not able tosupply heroin on the same scale as Chinese, Nigerian, or SouthwestAsian traffickers. To date, the largest shipment seized involved aJune 1992 airdrop of just under 15 kilograms of heroin on a PuertoRican beach; this shipment may have been tied to the Colombian cocainecartels. However, as the cocaine cartels become more involved inheroin smuggling and distribution, the seriousness of the threat will increase significantly, given their vast resources, control overtrafficking routes, and access to a stable cocaine (crack) clientele inthe United States. CANNABIS AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-productof the Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly usedillegal drug in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant anddelta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psycho-activechemical, are controlled substances. The flowering tops, also known ascolas or buds, are valued because of their higher THC content. Theflowering tops and leaves are collected, dried, and then smoked in a pipe oras a cigarette. Hashish, which is processed from cannabis, is alsovalued to a limited extent by some individuals in the United States. Typically, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla (pollinated) plantcontains usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58 percentof a sinsemilla (unpollinated female) plant contains usablematerial. The higher the plant density of the grow area, the lower theyield of usable material. In addition, the diameter of the plant is moreimportant than the height for yield predictions. Indoor plants are generallysmaller than outdoor plants due to space limitations. The averageplant yield for mature, domestically grown sinsemilla is approximately1.25 pounds per plant. The average plant yield for mature, domesticallygrown commercial grade marijuana is approximately three-quarters ofone pound per plant. Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the pastdecade. Prices for a pound of commercial grade marijuana during theearly 1980's ranged from $350 to $600, while in 1992 the cost ranged from$300 to $3,000. Sinsemilla with its inherently higher THC content,ranged from $1,000 to $2,000 ten years ago. In 1992, the price rangedfrom $650 to $9,600 per pound. Successful law enforcement efforts haveforced some cultivators to move indoors. Cultivators have increasinglymoved indoors to avoid detection and to exploit the profit potential ofpotent sinsemilla marijuana. Indoor growers cultivate sinsemillabecause the higher THC content of sinsemilla permits growers to chargehigher prices. Scarcity created by law enforcement operations hasalso increased prices in some areas. Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent yearsinclude cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana bymaking use of advanced agronomic practices such as hydroponics and cloning.Such techniques also involve the use of special fertilizers, planthormones, steroids, and carbon monoxide. During the late 1970's andearly 1980's, the THC content of commercial grade marijuana averaged undertwo percent. By comparison, the average in 1992 was 3.68 percent.The average THC content of sinsemilla in 1992 was 8.34 percentwhich compares to an average of approximately six percent in thelate 1970's and early 1980's. Moreover, in February 1993, a new U.S.record was recorded for the highest concentration of THC analyzed in amarijuana sample. The sample had a THC content of 29.86 percent whichis nearly 32 percent higher than the previous record of 22.67 percentreported during 1992. The record high THC content of this sample is anindicator of the continuing trend by indoor growers to produce higher potencymarijuana over recent years. USE According to the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse, approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana atleast once in their lifetime. Of these, approximately 2.2 million werefrom 12 to 17 years of age, nearly 13.5 million were from 18 to 25 yearsof age, and almost 52 million were 26 years of age and older. Of the17.4 million people who used marijuana at least once in the pastyear, nine million used the drug once a month during 1992, and 5.2million used it once a week or more. Survey data also indicate that thefrequency of marijuana use has declined substantially from 1985 to 1992.Overall, past-year, past-month and past-week use of the drug havediminished by nearly 45 percent during that time frame. According to the National High School Senior Survey on DrugAbuse, the long-term decline in the use of marijuana among seniorscontinued in 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion ofthat population who believed there was a "great risk" ofharm associated with regular marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of thedownward use pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,and past- month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to1992. Moreover, 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to viewmarijuana use as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.Also, the proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved ofmarijuana use declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception mayexplain the increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declinedfrom FY 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. Infact, the number of marijuana-related emergency room episodes rose from9,231 in FY 1991 to 12,108 in FY 1992, an increase of more than 30percent. DAWN reporting also shows that nearly one-half of the patientstreated for cannabis-related hospital emergency room episodes during thefirst six months of 1992 were under 26 years of age; approximately 70percent of these patients were male. The large majority, approximately80 percent, used marijuana in combination with other substances. Patientsmost frequently used marijuana in combination with alcohol. Thenext most common combination involved the use of marijuana withcocaine. Marijuana use among recently booked male arrestees asreported by the DUF Program increased in many major U.S. cities in 1992. Thehighest levels of marijuana use were reported in Omaha, where 38percent of the sampled population tested positive through urinalysis. InIndianapolis, the figure was 35 percent; in San Diego, 35 percent; inDenver, 34 percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 32 percent; and in Miami, 30percent. Marijuana use among recently booked female arrestees alsoincreased in many cities. In Indianapolis, 26 percent of the femalearrestees sampled tested positive for the use of marijuana; in San Diego, 25percent; in Dallas, 24 percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 21 percent; in Denver,19 percent; and in Kansas City, 18 percent. TRAFFICKING Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana availablein the United States during 1992. Mexican marijuana is smuggled intothe southwestern United States by vehicles, private aircraft,armed backpackers, and horse or mule caravans. Colombia ranks as adistant second behind Mexico as a foreign source of marijuana.Colombian marijuana is smuggled into the United States by noncommercialvessels using traditional maritime routes. Jamaican traffickers haveincreased marijuana shipments since January 1992. Jamaican marijuana issmuggled into the United States by private and commercial aircraft,and maritime vessels. DOMESTIC CULTIVATION/ERADICATION An estimated 6,000 to 6,500 metric tons of cannabis werecultivated in the United States during 1992. During that year,approximately 3,405 metric tons, representing 7.49 million cultivated plants,were eradicated. Reporting indicates that 31 percent of thecannabis plants eradicated during 1992 was sinsemilla. The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992were Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,respectively. These States accounted for approximately 44 percent of thecultivated cannabis eradicated during 1992. Reports from Indiana and Nebraskaover the last two years could signal a possible new trend in marijuanaproduction. The two States report an increase in tended/enhanced ditchweed, aform of marijuana, which grows in the wild. Although ditchweed haslow potency, it is mixed with cultivated marijuana to increase quantity. There has been an increase in the cultivation of cannabisindoors year- round in elaborately supported operations that have rangedfrom several plants grown in closets to thousands of plants grown inspecially constructed underground sites capable of producing marijuanaworth millions of dollars. Growers also continued to plant cannabisin remote outdoor areas, often concealed or camouflaged by surroundingvegetation. During 1992, the 13th annual DEA-sponsored Domestic CannabisEradication and Suppression Program (DCE/SP) was conducted in conjunctionwith other Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in 50States. The National Guard and Civil Air Patrol also participated. TheDCE/SP resulted in the eradication of 7.49 million cultivatedcannabis plants, 264 million low-potency ditchweed plants, the arrest of12,369 violators, and the seizure of 5,541 weapons. Moreover, thenumber of indoor growing operations seized in 1992 reached an all-timehigh of 3,849, up from 2,848 seized in 1991. Indoor cultivationoperations were confiscated in all 50 States during 1992, with the greatestnumber, 561, seized in the State of Washington. The movement toward indoorproduction is believed due primarily to successful law enforcementefforts to curtail outdoor cultivation. The average indoor cultivationoperation has approximately 100 plants. In addition, an average of oneweapon was seized from each indoor operation. In recent years, the DCE/SP has placed increasing emphasis onthe investigation and prosecution of major domestic cannabiscultivators and trafficking organizations. The net result during 1992 was theseizure of assets valued at over $69.3 million, over twice the amountseized in 1989 ($29.5 million). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,National Park Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs also have long-termprograms to combat cannabis cultivation on public lands. One of the major accomplishments of the DCE/SP continues tobe Hawaii's Operation WIPEOUT. During 1991, it was estimated that theprogram eradicated approximately 85 percent of Hawaii's summercannabis crop. During 1992, Operation WIPEOUT's continued success wasevidenced by reports that mainland smugglers were attempting to smugglemarijuana into Hawaii in order to fill the vacuum. Operation WIPEOUT isnow conducted as a maintenance program. Every 90 days, theWIPEOUT teams conduct aerial surveillance and eradicate what few cannabisplants they find before the plants reach maturity. More emphasis is alsobeing placed on arresting cultivators. Another major accomplishment of the DCE/SP was the successfullobbying efforts to convince the California State Government toconsider herbicidal spraying as a means of eradication. To date, theCalifornia State Government continues to study the proposal. Previousrequests to use herbicidal spraying in California were met with strongresistance based on environmental, as well as political, concerns.Spraying will be conducted in limited areas on a trial basis. Kansas, SouthDakota, and Texas are also considering herbicidal spray programs. DEA continues to conduct a special enforcement programentitled Operation GREEN MERCHANT that targets major indoor growingoperations. To date, DEA, together with State and local authorities hasseized nearly 4,000 growing operations, arrested over 1,500violators, and frozen millions of dollars in illicitly acquired profits andassets. METHAMPHETAMINE AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY Methamphetamine is available in varying quantities in mostareas of the United States, except for the northeastern and Mid-Atlanticregions where, for the most part, it is encountered infrequently.Availability is primarily concentrated in the western and southwesternUnited States where most clandestine laboratory activity occurs.Methamphetamine is also available in limited retail amounts in the Southeast andsomewhat larger quantities in the Midwest. The production of methamphetamine, as evidenced by the numberof reported clandestine laboratory seizures to DEA, hasdecreased each year since 1989. During 1992, 288 methamphetamine laboratorieswere seized. This is in comparison to 652 laboratories seized in 1989, 429in 1990, and 315 in 1991. The decrease in laboratory seizures is attributed to theongoing enforcement of Federal and State chemical controllegislation. The 1988 Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) becameeffective in 1989, and enables the Federal Government to regulate listedprecursor and essential chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis ofdangerous drugs. Over the last three years, most States have passedlegislation similar to the CDTA. The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) levelhas remained relatively constant during the past four years. In 1992,methamphetamine prices ranged from $5,000 to $22,000 per pound, $300 to$2,500 per ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gramlevels averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,compared to 35 and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound-puritylevels are unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showedthat an estimated 5.2 million Americans 12 years of age and olderhave used methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Lifetimeprevalence rates for 1985, 1988, and 1990 are not available. Thelifetime prevalence rate for 1992 is not yet available. Dataconcerning past- year, past-month, weekly, and daily prevalence rates formethamphetamine are also unavailable.) Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan area methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased ata relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 throughthe first half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itselfduring the latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,there was a 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodesinvolving methamphetamine. Despite this, second-half FY 1992 emergencyroom episodes remained below those reported in FY 1989. DAWN emergency room data indicate that methamphetamine abuseis concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, SanFrancisco, and Los Angeles In San Diego and Los Angeles,methamphetamine-related hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter halfof 1992. Nationally, approximately 75 percent of the patients treatedfor drug abuse episodes involving methamphetamine were white; nearly65 percent were male; approximately 25 percent were between 18 and 25years of age, and 40 percent were between the ages of 26 and 34. Approximately 45 percent of patients treated in emergencyrooms as a result of methamphetamine abuse indicated that their use of methamphetamine was due to dependence. Approximately 20percent had come to the emergency room because of an overdose, approximately30 percent as a result of an unexpected reaction to the drug, and morethan 20 percent came due to the chronic effects associated withmethamphetamine abuse. Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection ofmethamphetamine continues to be the predominant route of administration usedby patients admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for methamphetamine-relatedproblems. Despite this, the percentage of patients who indicated thatinjection was their primary method of administration decreased slightlyduring the past year from 38.4 percent in FY 1991 to 34.9 percent in FY1992. Moreover, there has been an increase in the percentage ofpatients who smoked methamphetamine during the past several years. Thosewho smoked methamphetamine increased from 3.9 percent during FY 1989 to6.8 percent during FY 1992. ILLICIT MANUFACTURE Laboratory Seizures Although clandestine methamphetamine laboratory seizuresdeclined during 1992, methamphetamine remained the most prevalent,clandestinely manufactured controlled substance in the United States.According to DEA reporting, 288 methamphetamine laboratories were seizedduring 1992, which accounted for 87 percent of all clandestine dangerousdrug laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure represents a ninepercent decrease from the previous year's total of 315 laboratories seized andcontinues the downward trend in laboratory seizures that began in 1990. DEA field divisions in Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix,San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, seized approximately 83 percentof all methamphetamine laboratories during 1992. This clearlyindicates that the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine is stillprimarily based in the western and southwestern United States. Methamphetamine laboratory seizures declined from 1991 to1992 in 14 DEA field divisions including the San Francisco Division whichcontinued to report the highest number of seizures. Sixty-sevenclandestine methamphetamine laboratories were seized during 1992 by theSan Francisco Division compared to 81 in 1991. However, DEA's LosAngeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, and St. Louis offices reported anincrease in the number of laboratories seized within their respectiveareas. Clandestine laboratories have been seized from everyimaginable location from suburban homes, garages, apartments, mobile trailers,urban dwellings, and industrial areas to specially-designedunderground vaults. The laboratories have been camouflaged,booby-trapped, buried underground, conveyed, and abandoned. Laboratory Operations Laboratories are usually constructed in very rural areasacross the United States; however, an increasing number of smalllaboratories are being located in urban and suburban neighborhoods where theypose a significant threat to health and safety. Not only aremethamphetamine laboratories used to produce an illegal, often deadly drug,but they have caused explosions, fires, and toxic fumes. Chemicalsassociated with clandestine laboratories have proven to be environmentalpollutants and health hazards. Clandestine laboratories are usually operated on an irregularbasis rather than on a regular schedule. Operators often produce abatch of methamphetamine then disassemble the laboratory and store itor move it to another location while they acquire additional chemicals.Storage facilities are often utilized to house (safeguard) chemicals,glassware, and the finished product. An operator will often utilizedifferent locations to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, it isnot uncommon for an organization to have multiple laboratory sites.Relocating the laboratory affords some protection against detection by lawenforcement authorities. Clandestine laboratory operators are often well-armed, andtheir laboratories are occasionally booby-trapped as a securityprecaution. Numerous weapons, including explosives, are routinelyconfiscated in conjunction with clandestine laboratory seizures. Publicsafety, and environmental concerns are of little importance to illicitdrug laboratory operators. Every year, a number of clandestinelaboratories experience fires or explosions which lead to their discovery.Laboratory operators often waste essential chemicals as they attempt tosynthesize a high-quality batch of finished product. They usuallydispose of these and other hazardous chemical wastes by unsafe and illegalmethods, often dumping these wastes on the ground or in nearby streams andlakes, pouring them into local sewage systems, or burying themunderground. Individuals who synthesize methamphetamine are commonlyreferred to as "chemists" or "cooks." This level ofeducation and knowledge of chemistry can vary from high school dropouts with no realchemical knowledge to professional chemists with graduate degrees inchemistry. These "cooks" most typically have very littleformal training; rather, they frequently follow a handwritten recipe or have learnedto synthesize methamphetamine from underground publications, apprenticeships, or during incarceration. There are, however,a number of "chemists" that are fairly adept orknowledgeable with regard to synthesizing methamphetamine. These individuals utilizechemicals more efficiently, thus increasing the yield ratio of chemicals tofinished product. In addition, the "chemist" has theproficiency to solve problems which may occur during the manufacturing process.This is in contrast to operators who simply follow a recipe and who aregenerally unqualified to perform corrective measures. MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGIES Although the manufacture of methamphetamine can beaccomplished by a variety of chemical synthesis methods, it is most commonlyproduced using the phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) or ephedrine reductionroutes of synthesis. The ephedrine reduction method was once most oftenused in clandestine laboratories located in California, and has sincebecome widespread throughout much of the United States. It ispreferred over the P2P method of methamphetamine production for threereasons. First, it is a simpler route of synthesis; second, the effects ofthe resulting product are more pronounced; and, third, ephedrine is morereadily available to clandestine laboratories in California and inthe Southwest. A relatively new and simple procedure to synthesizemethamphetamine has been noted using a variation of the ephedrine reductionmethod. The process is being called a "cold cook" method on thestreets because an external heat source is not required for the synthesis toproceed. The method uses commonly available material and chemicals tomanufacture between one to two ounces of methamphetamine per batch. Theprocess is commonly performed in such readily available containers astwo 32-ounce sports drinking bottles, insulated coffee cups, mugs, or inmodified laboratory glassware. CHEMICAL DIVERSION Integral to the manufacture of illicit methamphetamine arethe chemicals and equipment necessary to operate a clandestine laboratory.Whether the phenyl-2-propanone, ephedrine reduction, or other method ofsynthesis is used, various combinations of chemicals, glassware, andequipment are required. The acquisition of chemicals is, therefore, a vitaland readily identifiable component of the illicit traffickingcycle. Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and Statelevel has made it increasingly difficult for operators to obtain neededchemicals. Consequently, trafficking organizations are constantlyseeking new sources and developing ways in which to circumvent the law.They manufacture some of their own chemicals, utilize"runners" to purchase necessary chemicals under threshold amounts, and experimentwith alternate, non-regulated chemicals. Laboratory operatorsobtain regulated chemicals, such as ephedrine, by purchasingover-the-counter products which are exempt from the provisions of the CDTA.Chemicals are also acquired from "rogue" chemical companies or inStates which have less restrictive chemical laws or in such countries as Mexicoand Canada. MANUFACTURlNG/DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS Methamphetamine manufacturing/distribution operations varygreatly in size, structure, and degree of sophistication. Somelaboratory operators act as their own chemists; others hire chemists to run thelaboratories for them. Many manufacturers are independent producers whocook for various organized groups. This is particularly true of larger organizations which may hire or contract chemists tomanufacture methamphetamine in return for cash, finished product, or acombination of the two. Other cooks manufacture for themselves ratherthan for a particular organization. Leasing storage facilities,procuring chemicals, securing the laboratory site, and setting upglassware and equipment may be the responsibility of one person or manydifferent individuals. Several individuals may simply work together tocombine their expertise, chemicals, etc., on an ad hoc basis. Thenumber of individuals which comprise an operation and the function eachperforms differs from one organization to the next. Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,and organizations from independent entrepreneurs and outlawmotorcycle gangs to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations currentlymanufacture and distribute methamphetamine. Nationally, independententrepreneurs represent the largest identifiable group involved inmethamphetamine- related investigations. To a lesser degree, outlaw motorcyclegangs continue to play a role in the distribution aspect andinfluence production in certain areas. They most typically insulatethemselves by financing manufacturing operations rather than becomingdirectly involved themselves. The most noteworthy trend in recent years is currently takingplace in California where Mexican traffickers dominate the large-scaleproduction and distribution of methamphetamine in the San Diego,Riverside, San Bernadino, and Fresno areas. In fact, the high volume ofmethamphetamine manufactured and distributed is the distinguishingcharacteristic of Mexican traffickers involved in dangerous drug production. Numerous 22-liter setups are frequently utilized inlaboratories operated by Mexican traffickers to produce an average of 20to 80 pounds during each manufacturing process. Traffickers set uplaboratories or "cooks" in very remote areas throughout southernand parts of northern California Organizations may purchase property or pay for theshort-term use of a site in order to acquire a secure manufacturinglocation. An organization may utilize one location multiple times. Mexican illegal aliens are most frequently encountered atthese laboratory sites. In some cases, they are hired as helpers orto maintain the reaction process, while the actual chemistvisits periodically to ensure the operation is functioning properly.In other cases, Mexican illegal aliens are responsible for all facetsof the manufacturing process. Chemicals are generally stored instash houses and brought to the laboratory site on a limited basis. Theamount of chemicals present at the laboratory is usually restricted towhat is required to complete a particular cook. Chemicals are procured for these laboratories from sources inthe United States and Mexico. Chemical brokers recruit runners to makepurchases at rogue chemical companies. Additionally, ephedrine, aprecursor for methamphetamine, is easily accessible to Mexican traffickers;the chemical is currently shipped, without restriction, fromGermany to Mexico and subsequently smuggled across the UnitedStates-Mexican border in privately owned vehicles. Moreover, brokers supplychemicals to numerous manufacturing organizations. Organizations assisteach other in obtaining chemicals and glassware. A certain amount ofcooperation exists among many of these organizations; links between thesegroups were already established through their long-standing cocaine,heroin, and marijuana connections. There are indications that groups which previouslymanufactured methamphetamine are now finding it more cost effective topurchase it from Mexican sources. In addition, there is limited evidenceto suggest that Mexican traffickers may be attempting to expand theiroperations to other areas of the country. There are also indications that methamphetamine is currently being manufactured in Mexico and subsequently smuggled into the United States. SOURCE AREAS California is a primary source for methamphetamine in manyareas throughout the United States. However, the manner in whichmanufacturing operations are carried out often makes it difficult todetermine the origin of the source of supply. Operators manufacturing in aparticular area may distribute the finished product to associatesresiding locally, in neighboring States, or in other geographic areas.Privately owned vehicles are the modes of transportation used most frequentlyin the nationwide distribution of methamphetamine. LSD AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY DEA reporting indicates that LSD (Iysergic acid diethylamide)is available in at least retail quantities in virtually everyState in the United States and that availability is increasing in a numberof States. Reporting also indicates that an increasing number ofindividuals or groups are manufacturing and distributing or attempting tomanufacture and distribute LSD in the United States. In the last twoyears, DEA seized or purchased LSD in 33 States and Washington, D.C. LSD availability has been reported by either DEA offices or Stateand local police authorities in many of the remaining 17 States.Northern California appears to be the source of supply for most of theLSD available in the United States. LSD is available in several forms, including blotter paper,tablets, gelatin, sugar cubes, and liquid. Tablets can be purchased inseveral areas, however, most of the retail doses are in theblotter-paper form. Microdots are available in California, Illinois, Indiana,Michigan, New Jersey, and Vermont. Gelatin in the "windowpane"variety has been reported in Michigan and sugar cubes are available inColorado and the Washington, D.C., area. Personal-use doses of liquid LSD invials have also been reported in Colorado, Illinois, New York, and WestVirginia. LSD is relatively inexpensive. The average price isapproximately five dollars per retail dosage unit and costs less than one dollarper dosage unit in wholesale lots of 1,000 dosage units or more. Whencompared with marijuana, which sells for $40 to $450 per ounce, LSD isperceived by many drug users as a bargain, especially if one considers theduration of its effects which can persist for up to 12 hours in higherdoses. Although there has been some fluctuation in the price of LSDnationally during the past several years, overall prices remainrelatively low. LSD potency or strength is measured in micrograms. In the1960's and early 1970's, LSD potency generally ranged from 100 to 200micrograms per dosage unit or higher. Analysis of exhibits during thelate 1970's indicated an average potency in the 30- to 50-microgramrange. From the mid-1980's to the present, LSD potency has remainedconsiderably below levels reported during the 1960's and early 1970's and hasgenerally been in the range of 20 to 80 micrograms per dosage unit. Asa result of this comparatively low dosage level, many users perceive LSDas "safe," thus enhancing the drug's attractiveness. USE The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse data for LSD arelimited to estimates of lifetime use, defined as the use of LSD at leastonce in a person's lifetime. During 1991, 11.8 million Americans, 12years of age and older, reported having used LSD at least once compared to8.4 million in 1985, an increase of 40 percent. The data revealtwo significant expansions in the number of lifetime users ofLSD; one expansion occurred from 1985 to 1988 and the other from 1990to 1991. According to the 1992 National High School Survey on DrugAbuse, past year use of LSD among seniors in the class of 1992 increasedto the highest level since at least 1985. Current (monthly) use ofLSD among 10th and 12th grade students remained relatively stable from1991 to 1992. Among 8th graders, however, current use of LSDincreased during that same time frame from 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent.Moreover, past- year use of LSD rose in all three grade levels from 1991 to1992. DAWN reports indicate that the estimated number of nationwideLSD- related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY1989 to FY 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erraticsince that period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remainabove those reported during FY 1989. ILLICIT MANUFACTURE AND TRAFFICKING A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories havebeen seized since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. LSD producers fall into two groups. The first is composed ofchemists, manufacturers, and distributors, located in northernCalifornia, who work together in close association; they are normally major manufacturers capable of distributing LSD nationwide. Thesecond group of producers work independently. The independent producersare encountered in almost any part of the country, however, theirproduct is intended for local consumption only. Wholesale LSD trafficking patterns are not well understood;however, three theoretical models have been developed, which outline organizational structures, production methods, andtrafficking patterns. These theoretical models may help to explain how clandestineLSD activity occurs. Law enforcement officials call theseorganizational patterns: the Independent Entrepreneurial Model, theInner/Outer Circle Group Model, and the Association Model. The Independent Entrepreneurial Model: A number of lawenforcement officials believe some LSD manufacturers and distributors,who are not part of the northern California group, entered the market dueto increased demand and the opportunity for high returns on asmall investment. Examples of this type of loosely-structuredorganization have been noted in cases in Austin, Texas; New Orleans,Louisiana; Hartford, Connecticut; and Denver and Boulder, Colorado. Thecommon feature in each of these cases was an individual or a smallgroup of individuals who manufactured LSD independently from anyCalifornia source of supply. Some entrepreneurs who have manufactured orhave attempted to manufacture LSD have been known to lawenforcement officials for years; however, the number of independenttraffickers appears to have increased recently. The Inner Circle/Outer Circle or Single Group Model: Thismodel is thought to be organized under one close-knit group, the innercircle, which controls the vast majority of LSD manufacturing anddistribution in the United States. The inner circle is probably composedof five to 10 principal individuals who possess specialized functions.These specialists would include chemists, bulk storage custodians, financial/transportation specialists, and executives whomanage overall operations. The inner circle controls the means ofmanufacture; they assemble, operate, disassemble, and store laboratoryequipment; and keep a reserve amount of LSD on hand for distribution. They sellfrom 10- to 200-gram lots to a limited number of multigram distributors.This inner circle presumably accrues multimillion-dollar profits andonly conducts business with the next level of distribution referred to asthe "outer circle." The outer circle consists of multigram distributors whosupply a number of teams, groups, or individuals. They sell LSD at $1,000 to$3,000 per gram and accrue an estimated $300,000 to $600,000 per year. Close Association Model (An alternative theory to the InnerCircle/Outer Circle or Single Group Model): In this model, a small groupof people located in northern California, who have known each other forover two decades, control the manufacture and distribution of LSD.However, in contrast with the Inner Circle/Outer Circle theory, thesepeople do not work in one structured organization. They come together, asnecessary, to acquire chemists, chemicals, working capital, etc. Theywork as consultants or advisors to each other in order to meet theircommon goal of producing and distributing LSD. They may work together asa unit to prepare and distribute one batch of LSD, but after that isaccomplished, they leave the association until another opportunity arises.They have strong loyalty to each other and are living comfortably, butthey are not thought to be motivated primarily by profit. DISTRIBUTION Lower-level distribution of LSD usually occurs in three ways.First, an individual attends a rock concert, meets a source of supply,and exchanges telephone numbers with the source of supply.Normally, these purchases are for retail quantities of up to 100 doses.Second, if this individual decides to continue distributing, he/she wouldthen call the source for additional amounts. Usually the source has eithercontinued on the concert tour or has returned home, which is frequentlynorthern California. If the source intends to stay on the tour-makingsubsequent communication difficult-the source provides the telephonenumber of an associate for future orders. After the initial purchase,almost all transactions are made via the public and private mailsystems. Payments to a source of supply are usually made through legitimatemoney wiring services. Third, some dealers travel directly to Californiato meet their sources of supply. Reporting indicates that shipment methods used to transportboth large and small quantities of LSD are often similar. LSD isfrequently concealed in greeting cards, in cassette tapes, or inarticles of clothing that are mailed to a post office box established bythe recipient. This post office box is usually listed under afictitious name or business. Normally, no return address is provided onthe package or envelope. Moreover, it is suspected that some multigramdistributors will travel to their source in order to obtain supplies. Retail or user level quantities range from one- to 10-dosageunits. Low- level distributors sell 50- to 100-dosage-unit quantities.Mid-level distributors sell 1,000-dosage-unit quantities as well asmultiples of 1,000 units. These distributors normally have more than onesource of supply and sell to several lower-level dealers. The sourcesof supply for gram-distributors are in all likelihood located innorthern California. These sources normally convert LSD from powder orliquid form to blotter form. Multigram distributors travel toCalifornia to obtain LSD personally and are in association with numerouslower-level dealers. PCP AVAILABILITY/PRICE Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available invarying degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities, primarilyBaltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, SanFrancisco, and Washington, D.C. During 1992, PCP in liquid form, the mostcommon form available in the United States, sold for $150 to $1,000 perounce nationally. The lowest liquid-ounce prices were reported inLos Angeles, the source for most of the PCP trafficked in the UnitedStates, where such quantities sold for $150 to $300. Nationwide, the pricefor PCP in powdered form ranged from $400 to $2,000 per ounce. During1992, the price for a gallon of PCP ranged from $3,000 to $10,000 inLos Angeles and up to $13,000 in New York City. Individual cigarettessaturated with PCP sold for between $5 dollars and $70 nationwide. USE PCP is sold on the street under numerous names including:Angel Dust, Crystal, Supergrass, Killer Joints, Ozone, Wack, EmbalmingFluid, and Rocket Fuel. These names reflect the range of its bizarre andvolatile effects. The liquid form of PCP is the most commonlyencountered, but it is also sold in tablets, capsules, and as a powder. PCP istypically applied to a leafy material such as mint, parsley, oregano,or marijuana, and then smoked. PCP has been used to adulterate commercially-manufactured cigarettes, usually by dipping themin liquid PCP, which is PCP dissolved in ether. The most popularcommercial cigarettes are dark paper-wrapped brands such as Shermans orTijuana Smalls. PCP can also be injected hypodermically intocigarettes. In 1957, PCP was developed as a human anesthetic and laterused in veterinary medicine as a powerful tranquilizer. In 1965,medical use for humans was discontinued because of adverse side effects suchas confusion and delirium. In 1978, its commercial manufacturewas discontinued and PCP was transferred from Schedule III toSchedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, thus classifying it as a drugwith a high potential for abuse. PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's when it wastrafficked as a "Magic Peace Pill." Abuse of the drugresurfaced from the mid-to- late 1970's because of low price and powerful effects. Fromthe period 1981 through 1985, abuse of the drug escalated significantly, particularly among persons under the age of 21. Cities whichexperienced significant PCP availability and abuse levels in theearly-to-mid-1980's included Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, NewOrleans, New York City, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Washington,D.C. Around 1986, and continuing through the early 1990's, demandfor PCP was displaced in large measure by the widespread availability anduse of crack cocaine. More recently, however, there are indicationsthat PCP abuse is increasing once again in a number of cities. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed thatlifetime and past-year PCP use among the U.S. household populationdecreased from 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate anend to this downward use pattern. From 1990 to 1992, the number ofAmericans aged 12 years and older, who used PCP at least once, increased fromsix million to 8.2 million, while the number who had used PCP in the pastyear increased from 307,000 to 467,000. Nevertheless, the numberof past-year users in 1992 remained significantly below the numberreported in 1985 when approximately 1.2 million Americans reported using PCPat least once yearly. According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey onDrug Abuse, PCP use among 12th graders has declined significantly duringthe past seven years. From 1985 to 1992, the percentage of seniors whoused PCP at least once in their lifetime decreased from 4.9 percent to2.4 percent. Comparable declines were also reported during thatsame period in the percentage of seniors who used PCP during the pastyear and past month as well as on a daily basis. This diminished use isbelieved to be due in large part to a significant increase among 12thgraders in the perceived risk of harm associated with PCP usage. Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number ofmetropolitan-area PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been decliningat a substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353during the first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY1992, more than a 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increasedPCP abuse rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, andWashington, D.C. TRAFFICKING AND ILLICIT MANUFACTURE Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCPsupply is manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based streetgangs. While buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP fromCalifornia sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be theprimary means for transporting PCP across the country. Femalecouriers are used very frequently and the amounts transported generally rangefrom one to two quarts. PCP traffickers also use the U.S. mail system andexpress delivery services to transport PCP. Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to threein 1991. Two of the 1992 seizures were in northern California and one eachnear Chicago and Philadelphia. PCP laboratory seizures since themid-1980's have ranged from three to 21 per year, totals which areconsiderably less than the high of 79 reported in 1978. No PCPlaboratories have been seized thus far in 1993. APPENDIX The NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, sponsored by theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), isa series of national surveys to measure the prevalence and frequency ofdrug use among the U.S. household population aged 12 and over. Thesurvey samples the civilian non-institutionalized population living inhouseholds, college dormitories, and military installations and,therefore, does not include some segments of the U.S. population which maycontain a substantial proportion of drug users, such as transients andthose who are incarcerated. The SAMHSA publishes survey results on anannual basis. The NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SURVEY is a series ofnationwide studies of drug use frequency and related attitudes among high schoolseniors in the United States. The survey is conducted annually by theUniversity of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded byresearch grants from the SAMHSA. In addition to high school seniors, thestudy includes the recently-added national surveys of 8th and 10th gradestudents. For the 1992 survey, approximately 50,000 8th-, 10th-, and12th-grade students across the country were questioned. The DRUG ABUSE WARNING NETWORK (DAWN) is a large-scale datacollection system implemented in 1972 and designed to be an indicator ofthe severity, scope, and nature of the nation's substance abuseproblem. The purpose of DAWN is to provide data on the incidence of drugabuse related episodes from participating hospital emergency roomslocated in 21 U.S. metropolitan areas. DAWN is managed by the SAMHSA. The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE (NIJ) established the DrugUse Forecasting Program (DUF) in 1987 to identify and monitortrends in drug use among arrestees in the United States. Each quarter, atcentral booking facilities in 24 participating jurisdictions,arrestees are asked to participate in a voluntary, anonymous interview andto provide a urine specimen. Urine samples are analyzed to detect theuse of cocaine, opiates, marijuana, PCP, methadone, benzodiazines(such as Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene (such as Darvon),barbiturates, and amphetamines. The results of the urinalysis testing arepublished by the NIJ on a quarterly and annual basis.

While the coca plant can be foundthroughout most of Latin America, varieties containing the cocainealkaloid (the basis for cocaine HCl) are cultivated and converted primarily inPeru, Bolivia and Colombia. There are two different species and several differentvarieties of coca plants which contain the cocaine alkaloid and these varietiesprosper under quite different climatic conditions. At the same time, themethods used to cultivate and harvest coca leaf differ depending onclimate,tradition,and other factors. The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste,cocaine base, and cocaine hydrochloride is also a varied process with many stepsinvolved and many chemicals necessary. THE COCA PLANT It has been estimated that there are over 200 Erythroxylumspecies growing in the Western Hemisphere. Only 17 species can be utilized toproduce cocaine. Fifteen of the 17 species contain relatively low levels ofcocaine alkaloid and subsequently are not cultivated. In South America twospecies and two varieties within each of these species are cultivated. Theyare: --E. coca Species var. coca var. ipadu --E. novogranatense Species var. novogranatense var. truxillense These varieties are traditionally cultivated in the followingareas: --Bolivia E. coca var. coca --Peru E. coca var. coca E. novogranatense var. truxillense E. coca var. ipadu --Colombia E. novogranatense var. novogranatense E. coca var. ipadu E. novogranatense var. truxillense The most widely grown variety of coca is E. coca var. cocawhich is cultivated on the eastern slope of the Andes from Bolivia inthe south to as far north as central Ecuador. This area of the Andes has atropical climate and experiences high amounts of rainfall. Coca in this regionis usually grown between 1,650 and 4,950 feet in elevation. E. novogranatense var. novogranatense thrives in the drierregions of Colombia and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela. It is also grownat lower elevations where the climate is generally hotter. The mainvariety of E.novogranatense, var. truxillense, is grown up to anelevation of 4,950 feet. The last variety, E. coca var. ipadu, is found insouthern Colombia, northeastern Peru, and western Brazil in the Amazon basin. E.coca var. ipadu is primarily cultivated by Indians for their own consumptionand is not as high in cocaine alkaloids as the other three. It is not an easy task, even for an expert, to readilydistinguish between the different varieties of coca plants. One of the ways toidentify the variety is to look at the leaves. Both varieties of E. coca(E. coca var. coca and E. coca var. ipadu) have broadly elliptic leaves. Theleaf of var. ipadu has a rounded apex, whereas the apex of var. coca ismore pointed. The leaf of var. coca is large, thick and dark green in color. The leaf of E. novogranatense var. novogranatense is palegreen with a rounded apex and is somewhat narrower and thinner than theleaf of var. ipadu and var.coca. E. novogranatense var. truxillense is verysimilar to var. novogranatense except that it does not possess the linesparallel to the central vein of the leaf that are characteristic to so manyvarieties of coca plant. The cocaine alkaloid content of the E. coca and the E.novogranatense species also serves to distinguish between these species and the manyother species of wild coca that grow in Latin America. These other speciescontain much lower levels of cocaine alkaloid. The usual cocaine alkaloidcontent of a sample of coca leaf material is between 0.1 and 0.8 percent.The cocaine alkaloid content can go much higher, however, as was shown inone sample of coca leaf from the Chapare region in Bolivia that measured 1.2percent. Coca grown on the upper slopes of the Andes also contain morecocaine alkaloids than coca grown in low-lying areas. It is therefore believedthat the best quality coca is grown at higher altitudes. CULTIVATION While methods of cultivating the coca plant are similar inmany ways throughout Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, there are differencesin techniques because of terrain, tradition, and other factors. Some coca plantations have been in existence for years. Inother areas, however, such as Peru's Upper Huauaga Valley, new plantationsare being established daily. A typical farmer who is preparing a fieldfor coca will usually pick an area that slopes slightly so that water willnot drown his plants. He will then begin clearing his field, normally bycutting trees and stumps and setting fire to the debris, a clearing method knownas slash and bum. The felled trees are left in the field and the coca issimply planted around them. The farmer has no motivation to move the logssince there is no market for the timber. Logs are absent from the older fieldsbecause of rot or because the farmer gradually cleared his field. Once the field is cleared for cultivation, the farmer canready his crop for planting. The first step in cultivation generally begins withthe seed. Seeds are usually gathered from December through March from plantsranging from two to three years in age. They are often poured into water at theonset to identify bad seeds, which will usually float to the top andare discarded. The good seeds are planted in small plots that are kept shadedfrom the sun. Seeds are sown about two inches apart at a depth ofapproximately one half inch in humus enriched soil. These seedbeds are kept wellwatered and weeded frequently and the seeds will usually germinate within 20 to30 days. Sometimes the seeds are presoaked in water to hastengermination which will then occur in about ten days. Seedlings usually reach transplanting size in about twomonths. At this age they are about 12 inches tall. While the measurements vary,seedlings generally are planted in holes about a foot deep and about oneand-one-half feet from each other within rows about three feet apart. Another popular method of establishing new fields of E. ipaduinvolves taking a cutting from an established coca bush and planting it in theground. This method (cloning) is getting more popular as it gives thefarmer a head start. There are two methods of planting a cutting. One involvessticking several branches a couple of feet long into the ground. The othermethod is to cut three or four inch cuttings from a branch, each one withprotruding smaller branches. The cutting is soaked in water a day or so and thenplanted in loose, fertile soil. It is reported that coca leaf can beharvested from these plants within six months and seeds develop on theseplants after one year but the seeds lack embryos and are not viable. A coca plant cultivated from seed will generally reach fullmaturity and its leaves harvested between 12 and 24 months after beingtransplanted. Even though coca growing in the wild has been known to reachheights of up to 30 feet, that which is cultivated is almost always pruned back tofacilitate harvesting the coca leaf. Cultivated fields are usually keptat a height of three to six feet. All picking of coca leaf is done by hand.Harvesters have to be very quick in their work yet careful not to damage theleaf buds on the bush while stripping off the leaves. Leaves are said to beready for harvest when they take on a yellowish tint and have a tendency tocrack when bent. Coca leaf can be harvested between two and six times per yeardepending on climatic conditions. Coca growing at lower altitudes willusually be harvested more often than coca growing at higher altitudes.The most abundant harvest, sometimes accounting for about half of the totalyearly harvest, takes place after the rains in March. Subsequent harvests takeplace in June/July and November, the normal dry season in SouthAmerica. Some harvesting, however, takes place all year round. When the leaves are harvested, they are put in sacks and takento a closed room and spread out on the floor. The next day, the leaves aretaken to a flat area, where they are spread in thin layers on a tarpaulinin direct sunlight and left to dry. If there is a lot of sunshine andminimal cloud cover, the drying phase can be completed in six hours. Duringinclement weather, it takes much longer because at the first sign ofrain the leaves are gathered up and taken into shelter. If a load of cocaleaves is caught by a rainstorm during drying, it could ruin the whole load. Thisis because the leaves will ferment if the moisture goes over 14 percent. Thistends to cause a breakdown of the cocaine alkaloids. After the drying phase is completed, the coca leaves are sweptinto large piles and left for about three days before being taken tomarket and/or processing facilities. The weight of packaged leaves variesfrom the 100 pound "carga" in the Bolivian Chapare, to the 25pound "arroba" in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley. In Colombia, coca leaves are notusually sold; however, when dried coca leaves are sold, it is usually inpackages of 25 pounds. Peru Peru, the world's largest source of coca, has both licit andillicit cultivation. Licit coca is cultivation by farmers registeredwith the National Coca Monopoly (ENACO). ENACO buys and sells it toretailers either for resale domestically, for chewing or for herbal tea, or forexport to produce soft drink flavoring or pharmaceuticals. The 18,000hectares that have been registered for licit coca cultivation are centeredin the department of Cuzco. Illicit coca cultivation occurs primarily in the UpperHuallaga Valley region of northern Peru including the departments of San Martin,Huanuco, and Ucayali. Other areas under cultivation include the valleys ofLa Convencion and Lares in the department of Cuzco, and the provinces ofHuanta and La Mar along the Rio Apurimac in the department of Ayachucho. Thereare also smaller growing areas located in the departments of Puno and Pasco. The Upper Huallaga Valley is a tropical area with a mildclimate that receives an average of 12.44 feet of rain during the year.June through September is the dry season when the region gets very littlerainfall. The mean annual temperature is 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Coca isusually grown here between 1,980 to 2,640 feet above sea level but is sometimesplanted up to 6,270 feet in altitude. The soil in the Upper Huallaga Valleyis well drained and rich in iron, an important element for all plant life. The area surrounding Cuzco has an average rainfall of between1.32 and 5.94 feet annually which usually falls between the months ofOctober and April. The average temperatures in this region are greater than 53degrees Fahrenheit. Coca is generally grown between 2,409 and 4,257feet above sea level. The soil is especially poor in iron content. A semi-tropical climate with warm days and abundant rain fall,between 6.6 and 7.26 feet per annum, characterizes the Ayacucho area. Cocais usually grown on steep slopes which require terracing at an elevationof between 1,650 and 4,290 feet. Soils in this area are red and high iniron. Bolivia Bolivia is the world's second largest source of coca leaf.There is both licit and illicit coca cultivation occurring in this countryas well. In mid-1988, a law became effective that made coca cultivationillegal in most of the country. The law also established legal, transitional,and illegal zones of cultivation and declared that 12,000 hectares of cocawould be the amount grown to meet the traditional demand for coca. There are roughly three main growing areas in Bolivia. Thethree areas are the Yungas de La Paz, the Chapare, and the Apolo. Cocacultivation in the Yungas de La Paz is located between the cities of Guanay andInquisivi, northeast of La Paz on the eastern slope of the Andes.Cultivation in the Chapare occurs in the provinces of Carrasco, Chapare, andArani in the department of Cochabamba, east of La Paz. The small area ofApolo is in the La Paz department north of the city of La Paz. Nearly all the licit coca is grown in the traditional growingareas of the Yungas. The overwhelming amount of illicit coca is grown inthe Chapare where it is estimated that about 75 percent of the country's cocacrop is cultivated. The amount of coca grown in the Apolo is much lessthan in either of the two other areas. Parts of the Yungas have been cultivated for hundreds ofyears. Coca is planted at between 4,800 and 6,000 feet in altitude onterraced fields, generally on steep slopes. Some of these fields have a slopeof more than 45 degrees. The Yungas is characterized by a five-month rainyseason that runs from December to April receiving about 4 feet of rainfall peryear, followed by seven dry months. The soil content is poor, and this areahas suffered severe erosion problems. In the Chapare, the weather is continually wet and warm, withan annual rainfall averaging around 13 feet. The growing areas in thisregion are broad, low plains containing some hills. Coca is cultivated atbetween 660 and 1,650 feet above sea level where the temperature averagesaround 57 degrees Fahrenheit. The soil is clay based, rich alluvial(sediment deposited by flowing water). The Apolo, located in La Paz department, is also a noteworthycoca-growing region of Bolivia. Coca in the Apolo region is ofteninterplanted with coffee, a major crop in the area. Soil in the Apolo is notsuited very well to coca; the longevity of a coca bush there is only from fiveto eight years. Coca plants in the Apolo are therefore constantly replaced. Colombia Colombia ranks third in worldwide coca leaf production withall cultivation being illicit. There is widespread cultivation in the easternplains region of the Llanos which encompasses about one-half of Colombia.The heaviest areas of cultivation are located in the departments ofPutumayo, Caqueta, Guaviare, and Vaupes. There is substantial expansion of thecoca crop in the Bolivar department in the north-central area of Colombia aswell as areas of cultivation in the south and southwest part of the country. In the southern coca-growing region, the temperature averagesbetween 49.5 and 52 degrees Fahrenheit and there is light rainfall. Coca isnormally grown between 3,300 arid 6,600 feet above sea level. The soil inthis region is iron rich; however, there is some erosion. COCAINE PROCESSING The conversion of coca leaves to coca paste, cocaine base, andcocaine hydrochloride occurs primarily in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.Peru and Bolivia are the primary locations for the conversion of leafto coca paste and cocaine base, while Colombia is the primary location forthe final conversion to cocaine hydrochloride. It is believed that bothPeruvian and Bolivian traffickers have begun increasing their production ofHCI in the last few years. There are a number of chemicals and solvents which play vitalroles in the processing of coca leaves to paste, base and HCI. Many ofthese chemicals are quite common; all are theoretically substitutable and all havelegitimate uses making them difficult to control. Coca processing can be broken down into three stages. Thefirst is the conversion of the coca leaf into coca paste; this is almostalways done very close to the coca fields to cut down on the transport of thecoca leaves. The second phase is the conversion of coca paste into cocainebase. This step is usually omitted in Colombia and the process is taken straightthrough from paste to cocaine HCI. The final stage is conversion of base toHCI. Coca Leaves to Coca Paste The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste is accomplished ina coca paste pit, or "pozo. " A typical coca paste pit is a verycrude structure located near the harvesting site and consists of only a very fewitems. Some paste pits have even been reported in peasants' houses. The pastepit is usually a hole in the ground, lined with thick, heavy plastic, or mayeven be a 55-gallon drum with the top cut out. Paste pits are oftenlocated near streams so that the processors will have a constant supply offresh water, which is used in the first stage of processing. The process ofconverting leaves to paste usually takes a few days. Often, however, theleaves will be "worked" or "stomped" for only a few hoursrendering less paste than if "worked" for several days. It is apparentlysometimes more desirable to move the paste out than to get more paste per kilogram of cocaleaf. Depending on the size of the pit and the amount of leaf, the whole processwill require the energy of two to five workers. The following recipe for coca paste is but one of many.Recipes will differ depending on where the laboratory is located. Some will optnot to use water in the first step and amounts and mixing times vary widely.However, this remains a good benchmark formula. --Step 1 The coca leaves are put in an above-ground container or in aplastic lined pit. An alkaline material (sodium carbonate) and water areadded to the leaves. Here the alkaline material enables the cocainealkaloid present in the leaf to be extracted into kerosene. --Step 2 A water immiscible solvent (kerosene) is added to water,solution, and leaves. The mixture is then agitated. Usually this isaccomplished by having several people stomp on the leaves. The solvent acts toextract water insoluble cocaine alkaloids from the alkaline solution. --Step 3 Cocaine alkaloids and kerosene separate from water and leaves.The water and leaves are then drained off. --Step 4 Cocaine alkaloids are extracted from the kerosene into adilute acid solution. Alkaline material (sodium carbonate) is added to theremaining solution which causes a precipitate to form . The acid and thewater are drained off and the precipitate is filtered and dried toproduce coca paste, a chunky, off-white to light brown, putty-like substance. Coca Paste to Cocaine Base The processing of coca paste into cocaine base is morecomplicated than paste production, requiring more sophisticated equipment and addedskills. Cocaine base can be processed at the paste facility, but baselaboratories may be located away from the cultivation zones. Usually the baselaboratories are located near rivers or have a clandestine airstrip located inthe vicinity to facilitate both the movement of coca paste into the baselaboratory, but also the movement of cocaine base to cocaine HCl laboratories. As with the paste recipes, the base recipes have manyversions. This one is one of the more common and a continuation of the paste recipe. --Step 1 The coca paste is added to sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acidand water. The paste is dissolved into the acid solution. --Step 2 Potassium permanganate is combined with water. This mixture isadded to the coca paste and acid solution. Potassium permanganate is usedin this step to extract other alkaloids and material that is undesired in thefinal product. In particular, potassium permanganate is used to break downthe alkaloid ciscinnamoylcocaine found in large concentrations in E.novogranatense varieties. If the coca paste has a high concentration of thisalkaloid and potassium permanganate is not used, then crystallization ofcocaine HCl will be very difficult. --Step 3 This mixture is allowed to stand for about six hours. --Step 4 The solution is filtered and the precipitate is discarded.Ammonia water is added to the filtered solution and another precipitate isformed. --Step 5 The liquid is drained from the solution and the remainingprecipitate is usually dried with heating lamps. The resulting powder iscocaine base. It is common in Colombia to skip the base stage of cocaineprocessing and go right from coca paste to cocaine HCl. This can be accomplishedby eliminating the last part of step number four in coca paste processing andskipping to step number two of the cocaine base phase where the coca pasteis added to the potassium permanganate solution. Cocaine Base to Cocaine Hydrochloride (HCl) The final stage of cocaine processing requires even more skilland equipment, and is much more dangerous than the previously mentionedsteps. Unlike paste and base processing, cocaine HCl processing calls forexpensive chemicals that are harder to find and often not manufactured in theprocessing country. The HCl laboratory usually consists of several buildingsincluding dormitories, eating facilities, an office, storage facilities,and the laboratory itself. Also usually found at HCl laboratories arecommunications operations, generators, filtering and drying equipment, and,more recently, chemical recycling facilities. The HCl laboratory willsometimes have direct access to an airstrip. The following recipe is a continuation of the above two. Atthis point the methods of processing vary only slightly. --Step 1 Acetone or ether is added to dissolve the cocaine base and thesolution is filtered to remove undesired material. --Step 2 Hydrochloric acid diluted in acetone or ether is added to thecocaine solution. The addition of the hydrochloric acid causes thecocaine to precipitate (crystallize) out of the solution as cocainehydrochloride. --Step 3 The remaining acetone/ether solvent can be discarded orreused. --Step 4 Cocaine HCl is dried under heat lamps, laid out to dry withthe aid of fans, or dried in microwave ovens. NATURAL ENEMIES AND ERADICATION EFFORTS Although the coca bush is a very strong plant and will livefor many years and produce many harvests of leaf, it will do better if takencare of, fertilized, and treated with herbicides and insecticides. Occasionally, a coca field will become infested with one ofthe plant's natural enemies. The main pests and the effect that they areknown to have on the plant are discussed below. The larvae of the moth Eloria Noyesi presents the most seriousthreat to the coca plant. This moth lives through out the coca-growingregion of South America and seems to feed almost exclusively on E. coca. Ithas also been recorded feeding on E. novogranatense in Colombia and northernPeru. The larva will develop in about a month and will eat up to 50leaves in its lifetime. The larva will also eat the shoots of the bush thatgrow out after harvest. If Eloria attacks a plant repeatedly, even a strongplant will die. The moth is usually only abundant from December to April. Cocagrowers are using insecticides to eradicate Eloria. The larvae of Eucleodora Coca, a fly, seems to cause harm onlyto Trujillo coca. (There have been major infestations of this insect inthe past usually occuring from April to August.) The larvae spend their entirelives on the plant, feeding on the leaves and shoots . As with the Eloria,Eucleodora is being controlled with insecticides. Very little is known about the effect of the leaf-cutting ant,Acromyrmex, on coca. Growers in the Upper Huallaga Valley report that seriousdamage in the past has been done to their coca cultivation. The damage isoften controlled with the use of insecticides and flooding. The beetle,Aegoidus Pacificus, also poses a threat to Trujillo coca. The adult beetle laysher eggs in the bark of the coca plant, and the larva later burrows into thestem of the plant. This usually results in an infestation of pathogenicfungi which is ultimately responsible for the death of the coca plant. Aswith the other pests, the beetle can also be controlled with insecticides. Most of the other insects which attack coca only do so whenthere are shortages of their normal food supply. Some scientists believethat cocaine and other alkaloids may present some natural defense againstmost pests. Nevertheless, sometimes insects such as spider mites,grasshoppers, leafhoppers, and beetles find it necessary to eat coca. The coca plant is also susceptible to numerous species ofpathogenic fungi. Fungi seem to present the greatest threat to a plant duringthe wet season. The most serious threat seems to come from a fungus called"witches broom ." The exact effect of this fungus on the coca plant is not clearbecause of the limited amount of study which has been done on this fungusinfesting coca plantations. Natural enemies hold hope for control of the coca plant in thefuture. At present, however, the most successful methods in controllingthe growth of coca are herbicides and manual eradication. As of early 1990, all eradication of the coca plant in Boliviaand Colombia was being done manually. The usual method has been for a teamof eradication workers to go into a field and pull up the bushes plant byplant. In Peru, manual eradication of coca is often suspended because ofsecurity reasons. Prior to that time, a number of gasoline-powered cutters hadbeen supplied to the workers making it easier and much quicker to cut the coca.The problem with this method is that sometimes the coca bush will sproutfrom the stump within 12 to 18 months. As such, the cutting must be made veryclose to the ground to insure that the plant does not sprout again. A number of herbicides have been tested for use in eradicatingthe coca plant including hexazinone and tebuthiuron (spike) . Application ofboth has been deemed successful in killing the plant as long as they areapplied in the correct manner and amount. Within ten to twenty days afterapplication of hexazinone or tebuthiuron the coca bush sheds all its leavesand usually within 60 to 90 days the coca plant will be completely dead. The United States is working with some South Americangovernments to develop an herbicidal eradication program; Bolivia, however, hasprohibited the use of herbicides for this purpose.

Constantine Administrator Drug Enforcement Administration United States Department of Justice Before the: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Regarding: International Drug Trafficking Organizations inMexico Location: Dirksen Senate Office Building Room 419 Washington, D.C. Date: August 8, 1995 Note: This document may not reflect changes made inactual delivery. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: I'm pleased to appearbefore you today to discuss the growing role of internationaldrug trafficking organizations operating in Mexico and to tellyou what the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is doing toattack these organizations that are responsible for smugglingtons of illegal drugs across the U.S./Mexico border. Mexico is pivotal to the success of any U.S. drug strategy. Notonly do we share a common border, through which three-fourths ofthe cocaine enters our country, but Mexico has long been a majorsource country for heroin and marijuana. Within the last fewyears, it has also become a major source country formethamphetamine, as well as a transit country for chemicals,especially ephedrine, used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. My purpose at this hearing today is to talk about the drugtrafficking situation and to highlight our concerns about theincreased role of these international drug gangs operating inMexico. My comments will be limited to observations ontrafficking organizations and their methods of smuggling, the lawenforcement communities' efforts to work with Mexico, and anassessment of our chances for success in decreasing the flood ofillegal drugs that enter this country each day and have adevastating impact on the citizens on both sides of the border. A Glimpse of the Problem Mr. Chairman, an important 1989 drug seizure gave us a glimpse ofthe magnitude of the problem law enforcement faces and alsoillustrates just how important Mexico is to our efforts tocontrol illegal drugs coming into our country. In late 1989, DEAmade America's largest cocaine seizure on record (over 21.5 tons)in Sylmar, California. This cocaine came across the border at El Paso and was trucked tothe West Coast. Drug law enforcement was encouraged by such ahuge seizure, and we were convinced that we had seriously woundedthe Colombian drug organizations by preventing such a largeamount of illegal drugs from reaching our streets. But, we realized our encouragement was premature when we analyzedseized records. What we found was even more astounding. Welearned that during only a 3-month period, the organization hadsucceeded in smuggling 55 tons of cocaine into the U.S. Thiscocaine had been trucked to Los Angeles and had already beendistributed on our streets. One of the most disturbing aspects of this case is that ten yearsago, we measured drug seizures in grams and pounds. Today, weroutinely measure seizures in tons-even multitons. In January,for example, in Pasadena, Texas, a suburb of Houston, we seized6.5 tons of cocaine. In July, we seized over 5 tons of cocaine inthe border town of El Paso. And one of the primary reasons forthese multiton shipments of cocaine is the efficient andmutually-rewarding relationship that has emerged between thecocaine mafia in Colombia and the drug trafficking groupsoperating in Mexico. In fact, Mr. Chairman, we estimate that the Colombian drug mafiais using Mexico as a cocaine safe haven to store, at any onetime, as much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine that will eventuallybe smuggled across the U.S. border for distribution on Americanstreets. This is enough to provide a line of cocaine to everyman, woman, and child on this planet--and then some. At aconservative estimate, this cocaine would be worth over $700million to $1 billion on America's streets. Role of the International Drug Traffickers The fact that these traffickers have been able to accommodate thetransportation needs of the Cali cocaine mafia is not somethingthat happened overnight. Criminal organizations from Mexico havehad decades of practice. Traditionally, the Mexican bordereconomies have been significantly affected by the smugglingactivities into and out of the United States. It was theseorganized smuggling organizations that rose to prominence in thelate 1960s and 1970s when marijuana trafficking presented thepotential for huge profits. During the early 1980's, most of the Colombian cocaine enteredthe United States through South Florida by way of the Caribbean.But, traffickers were forced to find new routes when U.S. drugagencies increased enforcement action in the Caribbean and SouthFlorida. The Colombian drug lords naturally turned to thetrafficking groups in Mexico which had what they were lookingfor: proximity to the United States, a 2,000 mile expanse ofborder offering unlimited smuggling possibilities, and an alreadyestablished drug trafficking infrastructure that stood ready toserve their needs. The drug trafficking organizations easily adapted theiroperations to include cocaine trafficking, and by the mid-80's,were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombiancocaine. Delegating cocaine transportation to the traffickers inMexico was a tactical decision on the part of the Cali mafia.With the transportation assistance of these traffickers, thecocaine barons could now move larger bulk quantities throughMexico which would have been logistically impossible to move byany other means. By turning the riskiest part of the cocainedistribution cycle (the transportation) over to thesetraffickers, the Cali mafia could turn its attention to otheraspects of their cocaine enterprise. This drug traffickingpartnership has become one of both convenience and profit. One of the first traffickers to move cocaine through Mexico andto the U.S. was Juan Ramon Matta-Ballesteros, a Honduran, who,from the mid-'70s to the mid-'80s, was actively involved with theMexican Guadalajara Cartel. This was the group responsible forthe kidnapping torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique(Kiki) Camarena in 1985. The death of Agent Camarena outraged theAmerican public. Matta-Ballesteros has been convicted in threeseparate U.S. cases and is serving a term of life imprisonment. Emerging Traffickers Coming into their Own Today, there is no question that drug traffickers operating inMexico have become major players in the international drug trade.These veteran traffickers have been good students and havelearned valuable lessons from the drug experts--the Cali mafia.They have seen the benefit (and profits) of working together in apartnership to provide a needed transportation service to thecocaine organizations in Colombia. Receiving payment in both cashand cocaine, they have begun to establish their own cocainedistribution networks and territories, stretching from theSouthwest border areas as far as New York. In effect, the Calimafia has been a willing partner in helping these organizationscreate distribution and sales networks in the U.S. Like the Cali mafia, these trafficking organizations havedemonstrated their flexibility to change trafficking routes whenlaw enforcement action along any one route becomes too risky totheir business. These drug groups have also followed the lead oftheir predecessors by expanding and diversifying their productline. Sophisticated trafficking organizations based in Mexico nowmanufacture methamphetamine and smuggle the precursor chemicalsnecessary for its manufacture. And, perhaps most important, asthey have expanded their role in the drug trade, they have madevaluable worldwide contacts, which will be necessary as theycontinue to establish themselves as important players in theworld of illegal drugs. There are a number of trafficking groups in Mexico that havegained a firm foothold in the trafficking of drugs, but I'd liketo take a moment to describe the four major drug traffickingorganizations that work closely with the Cali mafia: Tijuana Cartel The organization sometimes referred to the "TijuanaCartel," is headed by Benjamin Arellano-Felix and hisbrother Francisco. They control most of the drugs crossing theborder on the West Coast between Tijuana and Mexicali. Feuding between this group and other organizations has becomeincreasingly violent. In fact, it was the feuding between theArrellano-Felix organization and rival drug dealers that led tothe killing of Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas-Ocampo at theGuadalajara airport in 1993 The Arellano-Felix brothers are currently the subjects of anationwide manhunt by law enforcement authorities for theirinvolvement in the Cardinal's killing. On June 23, Mexicanauthorities arrested Hector Luis Palma-Salazar, the leader of arival drug organization that is believed to be behind theattempted assassinations of the Arellano-Felix brothers, as wellas the murder of Cardinal Posadas-Ocampo. Benjamin and FranciscoArellano-Felix have both been indicted in San Diego, California,and are DEA fugitives. The Caro-Ouintero Organization The Caro-Quintero organization is involved in the cultivation,processing, smuggling and distribution of heroin and marijuanaand the transportation of Colombian cocaine into the U.S. Thisorganization was previously led by Rafael Caro-Quintero, known asthe "Mexican Rhinestone Cowboy," who began his criminalcareer at the young age of 12 or 13 as an apprentice to PedroAviles, a notorious Mexican drug trafficker. Caro-Quintero is currently in a Mexican maximum security prisonfor his involvement in the kidnaping, torture and murder of DEASpecial Agent Enrique Camarena, as well as for marijuana andcocaine trafficking. His brother, Miguel Caro-Quintero, now runsthe organization, and is under indictment in Tucson and Denver. Juarez: Cartel One of the most notorious and powerful of these traffickingorganizations is the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization,sometimes referred to as the "Juarez Cartel."Carrillo-Fuentes has been the chief transporter for the recentlyarrested Cali mafia leader Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela. Carrillo-Fuentes owns several airline companies, which enableshim to fly 727s from Colombia into Juarez, where he runs hisorganization from his ranch headquarters. Increasingly, murdersin Juarez have been associated with Carrillo-Fuentes. In July,the leader of the juvenile gangs he recruits to smuggle drugsacross the border was found shot 23 times in the head. Here inthe United States, Carrillo-Fuentes has been indicted in Miami onheroin and marijuana charges, and in Dallas on cocaine charges. Juan Garcia-Abrego Another influential Mexican trafficker acting in concert with theCali mafia is Juan Garcia-Abrego, who is involved in smugglingdrugs from the Yucatan area in Mexico to South Texas and up toNew York. Juan Garcia-Abrego was recently added to the FBI's topten most wanted fugitives, with a $2 million reward for hiscapture. This is the first time an international drug traffickerhas been included on the FBI list. This organization transports large quantities of cocaine for theCali mafia, as well as marijuana and heroin for othertraffickers. Garcia-Abrego pioneered deals in which Mexicantraffickers take payment in cocaine, which substantially raisedtheir profits, and at the same time diversified their involvementfrom beyond smuggling to the role of suppliers to their own drugdistribution networks. He and his organization are notorious forthe violence they employ to further and protect their illicittrade. He also ships bulk amounts of cash for the Cali mafia. During afour-year period, from 1989 to 1993, $53 million was seized inconnection with the Garcia-Abrego organization. Two AmericanExpress bankers in Brownsville, Texas, were indicted forlaundering $30 million for Garcia-Abrego, and to date, 70 membersof his organization have been prosecuted and convicted in theU.S. Juan Garcia-Abrego has been indicted in Houston and remainsa fugitive. Expanding Influence: Cocaine and Methamphetamine DEA is very concerned about the expanding role of drugorganizations based in Mexico which are playing an increasinglylarger role in the shipment and distribution of cocaine andmethamphetamine to the United States. Cocaine In the last few years, we've seen international traffickingorganizations make major changes in their efficiency intransporting bulk shipments of cocaine to transportingorganizations in Mexico. Traditionally trafficking organizationsused twin-engine general aviation aircraft to transport cocainefrom Colombia to transhipment locations in Mexico and theCaribbean. Today, however, the Cali mafia has bought passengerjets (like 727's) gutted them, and are using them to transportmultiton loads of cocaine to the trafficking organizations inMexico. In March of this year, for example, a Caravelle jetaircraft was seized in the Mexican State of Sonora, after beingabandoned by traffickers when its tires became stuck in the dirtrunway. Mexican Government forces later seized 2.8 tons ofcocaine that are believed to have been off-loaded from thatCaravelle. Law enforcement has also uncovered two tunnels built to movecocaine from Mexico into the United States. The first wasdiscovered in Arizona in 1990. The second nearly-completed tunnelwas discovered in 1993 near the Tijuana Airport and led to anunfinished warehouse in the United States. Methamphetamine U.S. law enforcement is also concerned about the growing role oftrafficking gangs operating in Mexico involved in themethamphetamine trade. We directly attribute the increasedamounts of methamphetamine available in the U.S. to thesetrafficking organizations which have replaced domestic outlawmotorcycle gangs as the predominant methamphetamine producers,traffickers, and distributors. Unfortunately, DEA is very much aware of the problem of thesemethamphetamine gangs operating in the U.S. Last summer, DEASpecial Agent Richard Fass was shot and killed in Tucson by amethamphetamine trafficker during an undercover operation. Thering leader of the gang responsible for Agent Fass' death hasstill not been apprehended and is believed to be in Mexico. TheDEA is currently working with both the FBI and Mexicanauthorities to apprehend him. In the last three years, these trafficking organizations havevirtually saturated the western United States market withhigh-purity methamphetamine, known also as "speed"or"crank." In some areas of California, it has nowreportedly replaced cocaine as the drug of choice. With asaturated West Coast market, these traffickers have begun toexpand their markets to the East Coast and in the South. DEA'ssouthern offices report a growing presence of these traffickinggroups providing methamphetamine to domestic traffickingorganizations in rural and suburban areas of Georgia, Tennessee,Kentucky, and the Carolinas. As supplies have increased, prices have fallen, making it a cheapalternative to cocaine. Some have called it the "poor man'scocaine." In 1991, for example, the lowest pound pricenationwide was $6,000. Today, in California, methamphetaminesells for between $2,500 and $3,600 per pound. With increased availability, methamphamine use has increased.According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network, the number ofemergency room episodes involving methamphetamine has increasedsteadily since 1991, particularly in the West. From 1991 to 1993,episodes more than doubled in both Los Angeles and Phoenix. The dominance of Mexico-based, poly-drug organizations inmethamphetamine trafficking is further evidence of their growingsophistication. The smuggling skills developed while transportingcocaine for the Cali mafia has enabled these organizations tobranch out into moving other contraband, such as precursorchemicals, especially ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, used in themanufacture of methamphetamine . They have established international connections in Europe, Asiaand the Far East to obtain the shipment of tons of precursorchemicals, particularly ephedrine, to addresses in both UnitedStates and Mexico. During 1993 and 1994, the majority ofephedrine shipments destined for Mexico were supplied by suchdiverse countries as China, India, the Czech Republic, andSwitzerland. From mid-1993 to early 1995, DEA documented thediversion of almost 170 tons of ephedrine used in illicitmethamphetamine production. It's important to note, however, thatDEA has obtained cooperation from many of these countries to stemthe flow of chemicals going to Mexico. It's difficult to predict where this newest surge ofmethamphetamine use and trafficking will lead, but we must notassume that it has peaked. Unlike other drugs, methamphetamine isone that these criminal organizations can control entirely frombeginning to end. They have the international contacts to obtainthe necessary precursor chemicals to make the drug. They have theclandestine labs to process the chemicals into methamphetamine onboth sides of the border. They have expanded their distributionnetworks across the nation by the use and intimidation of illegalaliens. And, unlike their previous role as middle-men movingcocaine and heroin, they can keep 100 percent of the profits fromtheir methamphetamine sales. U. S. law enforcement may be in for a difficult and violent fewyears as we work to get the methamphetamine problem undercontrol. We've already seen "meth" smuggling gangs faceoff against each other. Recently, in San Diego, a confrontationbetween meth smuggling groups with ties to Mexico resulted in 26homicides. There may be more bloodshed on our streets, as thesedrug gangs fight to protect (and expand) their drug turf. DEA's Response In response to the threats of the Mexico-based traffickingorganizations and their surrogate drug gangs operating here inthe United States, DEA has taken a number of steps to work withour law enforcement partners in Mexico, as well as with ourFederal, state, and local colleagues here at home. DEA has joined forces with the FBI in a Southwest BorderInitiative that targets the major Mexican traffickingorganizations for enforcement actions. Combined teams of state,local and federal law enforcement led by DEA and FBI SpecialAgents are working together with a common goal of disruptingthese gangs and bringing their leaders to justice. For the first time, the DEA, the FBI, the Department of JusticeCriminal Division, and respective U.S. Attorneys in every statealong the Southwest Border are coordinating both intelligence andmanpower resources against a common enemy--the poly-drugtrafficking organizations that are transporting increased amountsof cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine across ourborders. Both the DEA and the FBI hold high expectations for thesuccess for this operation. Three new binational Border Task Forces have been established andwill focus on the four principal trafficking organizations.Senior personnel of the DEA, FBI, and DOJ Criminal Division serveon a U.S./Mexican Plenary Group, working to enhance ourcooperation against narcotics, money laundering, arms smuggling,and other crimes. Mr. Chairman, in this open forum I cannot explain the specificsof how this new initiative will work, but I would be happy todiscuss this in more detail in a closed session or a privatebriefing. Our support for Mexico's drug fighting efforts is critical totheir success--and ultimately to our own. Attorney General Renoand Mexican Attorney General Antonio Lozano-Gracia have pledgedto work cooperatively to address the problems. Hopefully, a closeand coordinated law enforcement response by our two countrieswill have an impact on this growing problem. Future Threats: An Assessment There is no question that the international drug traffickingorganizations operating in Colombia and Mexico have had a directimpact on the multiton quantities of cocaine law enforcement isforced to deal with today. These organizations have proven to bea serious threat to both the United States and Mexico. In recent years, as the political and economic ties between theUnited States and Mexico have strengthened, a new generation ofinternational traffickers have been able to carve out an everlarger share of the world's drug trade and pose a growing threaton both sides of the border. We've seen these traffickingorganizations grow from low-level smuggling groups tosophisticated organizations that smuggle more and more drugs ofevery kind--cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and nowmethamphetamine--into the U.S. They are increasingly being paidfor their transportation expertise with cocaine, a move thatcould prove to be the undoing of the Cali mafia and could shiftthe balance of power within the worldwide cocaine trade. Mr. Chairman, in a few years down the road, I believe it'sentirely possible that these newly emerging groups could rise toan equal (or superior) footing with the Cali mafia. If thishappens, life as we know it in both the United States and Mexicowill change dramatically. They care little for the devastingimpact they have on the people of Mexico and the United States.They are international criminal elements that must be dealt with. The President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, has publically statedto the American media that drug trafficking is a threat toMexican national security, not only because of the crime that isinherent in such activity, but also because of the growing wealththat enables traffickers to corrupt police and governmentinstitutions. As these organizations grow in wealth and sophistication, theythreaten to overwhelm the capabilities of any law enforcementsystem, including Mexico. By comparison, we have a professionallaw enforcement system in the United States, at the Federal,state and local level, that promotes and encourages highstandards in recruitment, training, internal inspections,standards of operations and accountability to electecl officials. We have a criminal justice system that is quick to respond tocharges of unethical or corrupt actions on the part of lawenforcement. It has helped to professionalize our law enforcementagencies and insure a continuing quest for ethics and integrity.Despite our best efforts, unethical or illegal activities dooccasionally occur within the ranks of our law enforcementagencies, requiring swift and decisive government action topreserve the public's faith and trust. As a society, we provide modern and sophisticated resources toour law enforcement agencies to combat the criminal elementsconfronting them. The law enforcement institutions in Mexico donot presently have an infrastructure similar to those in the U.S.The development of such institutions will require a substantialcommitment of time and resources to achieve the necessary levelof professionalism. The potential exists that if this is notdone, they may be overwhelmed by the wealth and influence of thedrug organizations. We are not alone in recognizing this problem. Attorney GeneralLozano has moved to have special police units report directly tohim. He has announced a plan to include reviews of all Federalpolice officers and prosecutors, with mandatory drug testing, tocombat internal corruption. I cite this only to illustrate thatthe Mexican government itself recognizes this is a problem. It is imperative that we work with our partners in Mexico toblunt the influence these drug traffickers are having in both ourcountries. It is also imperative that our own Federal, state, andlocal law enforcement continue to work cooperatively together tomake the best use of our resources, as well as to increase ourimpact on these trafficking organizations. Surely, when we speakof tons of drugs coming across our borders and causing tremendousdamage to the health and well-being of our citizens, we aretalking of a national security threat that demands our immediateand continuous attention. DEA is hopeful that future counterdrug efforts with Mexico willbe successful. In the past year, Mexico has instituted newprograms that include attempts to professionalize its lawenforcement institutions and increase cross-border cooperation toaddress the threat of the international traffickers. The directand cooperative communication between Attorney General Reno andAttorney General Lozano should be of great help in securing acoordination of our resources to address a common problem. Thethreat is serious--and it is real.

Review has never been made public. Rep. Henry Waxman obtained a copy, but only under conditionthat it not be released to the public. Review not disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act; arequest by San Francisco Chronicle for the review was deniedrecently. Only real press coverage is reference to the coverup on CNN inAugust 1994 and in San Francisco Chronicle in December 1994. The second review In fall 1994, Brian Biles of the Office of the AssistantSecretary for Health, wrote to CDC asking for an update oninformation since the University of California Report. This second review, much shorter and less expansive than thefirst review, is sent to the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS(James Curran) by the Assistant Director for Substance Abuse andHIV Prevention (T. Stephen Jones) on November 22, 1994, andpresumably forwarded on to the Office of the Assistant Secretaryfor Health. The review contains the following: Summary of new evidence from New York City showing a decreasein HIV transmission among NEP clients that concludes thatalthough the numbers are small, the evidence is plausible."(page 1 ). Three additional studies with evidence of decreases in HIVrisk behavior (page 3). No evidence of increased drug use in a San Francisco study(page 3). New data showing that the decrease in hepatitis B and Cinfections associated with needle exchange is now seven- toeight-fold. 'this study demonstrates more clearly than anyprevious research that use of NEPs is associated with decreasesin blood borne infections." (Page 4) Data from Montreal showing higher HIV infection rates, higherrates of HIV risk behaviors and higher rates of new HIV infectionamong NEP clients that "require further study." (page5) This finding is most reasonably interpreted as showing thatNEPs are reaching the drug users at highest risk for HIV (a goodthing). No formal recommendations with respect to federal policy. The existence of this review has never been made public. Public health significance Approximately 1/3 of all AIDS cases occur among injectionsdrug users, their sex partners and their children. Only about 15% of injectors are in drug treatment on any givenday. Over 10,000 drug users, their sex partners and their childrencontract HIV each year. This is 1-2 preventable HIV infectionsper hour. Needle exchange may decrease new HIV infections by 33%,according to the New Haven mathematical model.

SUMMARY The UC research team has done a careful and scientificallysound compilation and review of all the available data on needleexchange and the availability of needles and syringes toinjection drug users (IDUs). The UC team also gathered new datathrough surveys of needle exchange programs (NEPs), key informantinterviews, and focus groups of IDUs. NEPs are intended to decrease human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) transmission associated with injection drug use byreplacing used, potentially HIV-infected syringes with sterileones. They also can help IDUs obtain drug treatment and otherpublic health services. The emergence of more than three dozenNEPs in the United States suggests an increasing acceptance ofthese programs as part of a community response to the dualepidemics of injection drug use and HIV infection. However, insome communities, NEPs have been very controversial. Some lawenforcement, drug treatment, and community leaders are concernedthat these programs give "the wrong message" about druguse and may reduce law enforcement agencies' ability to combatdrug use and associated violence. Other concerns are that NEPshave not been shown to be effective in eliminating HIVtransmission and may draw scarce resources away from other,possibly more effective, programs such as drug treatment. The CDC concurs with the UC findings that (1) NEPs areeffective in removing used, sometimes HIV-contaminated needlesand syringes from circulation and replacing them with sterileones, (2) IDUs using NEPs decrease HIV drug-risk behaviors (e.g.,decreased sharing of injection equipment, decreased frequency ofinjection), (3) NEPs are effective in recruiting IDUs to enterdrug treatment, (4) HIV prevalence in syringes returned to NEPsdecreases, and (5) mathematical models of NEPs estimatesubstantial decreases in HIV transmission among NEP clients.Taken together, these observations indicate that NEPs are likelyto reduce HIV transmission, even though the epidemiologic studiesof NEPs do not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases inHIV transmission. The existing epidemiologic studies are limitedin their ability to detect such changes. No data existsindicating increases related to NEPs in either drug use or in thenumber of discarded syringes. W8 endorse the UC reportrecommendation that additional research and evaluation on NEPs isa high priority to further assess the impact of these programs-sand the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery ofNEP services. Two other issues have prompted reconsideration of Federalpolicy on needle exchange: (1) the magnitude of the HIV epidemicamong IDUs and the related epidemics among their sex partners andnewborns in many areas of this country and (2) the limitations ofalternative intervention options to prevent drug-related HIVtransmission (e.g., limited capacity of drug treatment availableto IDUs and limitations of bleach disinfection of injectionequipment). Based on these observations and the weight of datapresented in the UC report, we believe that the benefits of NEPsas a component of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drugusers exceed the theoretical risks of such programs. We concludethat the ban on Federal funding of NEPs should be lifted to allowcommunities and States to use Federal funds to support NEPs ascomponents of comprehensive HIV prevention programs. We recommendthat NEPs receiving Federal funds be linked to substance abusetreatment programs and other HIV prevention services. We alsorecommend that such programs be required to include evaluationcomponents to validate their effectiveness. Increasing the ability of IDUs to obtain and possess sterileneedles and syringes should decrease HIV transmission for thosewho will not or cannot stop injecting drugs. Therefore, we alsorecommend that States consider the repeal of laws requiring aphysician's prescription to buy needles and syringes and theremoval of criminal penalities[sic] for the possession of needlesand syringes, while maintaining the criminal penalties on otherdrug use equipment. Additional evaluation of these interventionsis crucial. 3. BACKGROUND The substantial role of injection drug use in the HIV/AIDSepidemic One-third of reported U.S. AIDS cases are related directly orindirectly to injection drug use[1]. A disproportionate number ofAIDS cases among people of color in the United States is relatedto infection drug use. In 1992, almost half of all AIDS casesreported among African Americans (49 percent) and Hispanics (48percent) were directly or indirectly related to injection druguse. The majority of reported AIDS cases among women and childrenin the United States are related to injection drug use. Amongadult and adolescent women reported with AIDS in this country,nearly three-quarters (71 percent) were directly or indirectlyrelated to injection drug use; 50 percent of women with AIDSreported injecting drugs and an additional 21 percent reportedsexual contact with a male who injected drugs. Two-thirds (66percent) of children with perinatally acquired AIDS had motherswho reported injecting drugs themselves and/or having sex with anIDU. Preventing HIV/AIDS associated with injection drug use Use of drug injection equipment (especially needles andsyringes) by more than one person (often called"sharing" or "multiperson use") is theprimary mechanism for the spread of HIV related to injection druguse. Sexual transmission among IDUs also occurs. Several culturaland social factors are associated with the multiperson use ofneedles and syringes and other injection equipment. However,legal restrictions on the purchasing and possession of needlesand syringes by IDUs are central factors in the multiperson useof needles and syringes. IDUs' access to and legal ability topossess sterile needles and syringes are limited by a variety ofState and Federal laws, including (1) prescription laws[2], (2)drug paraphernalia laws[3], and (3) the [1]AIDS cases associated with injection drug use include AIDScases among a) heterosexual men and all women who reportinjecting drugs, b) men who have sex with men who also injectdrugs, c) men and women who do not inject drugs but haveheterosexual relations with drug injectors, and d) newbornchildren whose mothers inject drugs or have sex with male druginjectors. [2]A State law that requires a physician's prescription as acondition for sale of needles and syringes in pharmacies (in 10States and the District of Columbia}. Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act[4]. InStates without prescription laws, the selective refusal of somepharmacists to sell needles and syringes to persons who might beIDUs is an additional barrier. In its July 1991 report on "The Twin Epidemics ofSubstance Use and HIV, n the National Commission on AIDSrecommended: "Remove legal barriers to the purchase andpossession of injection equipment. Such legal barriers... limitthe availability of new/clean injection equipment and thereforeencourage the sharing of injection equipment, and the increase inHIV transmission. Prevention and treatment for drug dependency and addiction areimportant HIV prevention strategies. However, only 10 to 20percent of all drug users are in drug treatment programs at anygiven time. Drug treatment capacity is not expected to increasesubstantially in the near future, and the capacity will remainsmaller than that required to provide drug treatment for all whoneed it and are willing to start. In addition, a substantialproportion of IDUs are unable or unwilling to stop injectingdrugs and start drug treatment. Outreach programs are another component of HIV prevention forIDUs. In addition to providing condoms and advising drug users tostart drug treatment and to decrease drug use, since themid-1980s, outreach workers have advocated the use of householdbleach to disinfect drug-injection equipment (particularlyneedles and syringes). In April 1993, the CDC, the Center forSubstance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of SAMHSA, and the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of NIH issued an HIV PreventionBulletin describing the limitations of bleach disinfection ofneedles and syringes and indicating that (1) sterile, never-usedneedles-and syringes are-safer than bleach-disinfected,previously used needles and syringes and (2) bleach disinfectionis useful only when there is no other safer option. In thisstatement, Public Health Service (PHS) agencies clearly pointedout the limitations of one of the few HIV risk-reductioninterventions for IDUs who share needles and syringes. [3]A State (or local) law that places criminal penalties onthe possession and distribution of needles and syringes and otherequipment used in the consumption or manufacture of drugs (in 46States and the District of Columbia. [4]The Act includes needles and syringes in the list of drugparaphernalia that cannot be transported by the U.S. PostalService or any other means of interstate conveyance. 4. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OF NEEDLE EXCHANGEPROGRAMS IS THE UNITED STATES Congress has included provisions in at least six lawsrestricting the use of Federal funds for NEPs. For example, theFY 1994 Appropriations Act for the Department states that"no funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to carryout any program of distribution of sterile needles for hypodermicinjection of any illegal drug, unless the Surgeon General of theUnited States determines that such programs are effective inpreventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use ofillegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for suchpurposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorizedin the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public Law 102-321)." 5. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT ("THE PUBLICHEALTH IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATESAND ABROAD") This project was carried out by a team of researchers at theSchool of Public Health of the University of California,Berkeley, and the Institute for Health Policy Studies at theUniversity of-California, San Francisco. The study began in April1992 and was supported by funds from the CDC through acooperative agreement with the Association of Schools of PublicHealth. The project staff gathered nearly 2,000 "datasources," including journal articles (475), conferenceabstracts (381), reports (236), and unpublished materials (159).Between May and September 1992, the team carried out site visitsto 15 cities (10 in the United States, -3-in Canada, and 2 inEurope). During these site visits, structured observations of 33needle exchange sessions were made. In addition, 110 keyinformants (including NEP staff, public health officials, andcommunity leaders supporting and opposing the NEP) wereinterviewed, and 18 focus groups of clients and non-clients ofthe-NEPs (12-9 IDUs ~ participated in the focus groups orindividual interviews) were held by the UC project staff. UCproject staff obtained extensive information on the budgets ofthe NEPs visited. To obtain a more complete picture of the NEPsin the United States, the project staff conducted a postal surveyof 20 NEPs not visited. The major findings of the UC study are presented in a Summary,Conclusion, and Recommendations document (43 pages). The detailedanalysis and findings of the UC study are presented in Volume One(519 pages). Volume Two, a city-by-city description of NEPactivities and related information from the site visits to nineU.S. and three Canadian cities, will be available in lateDecember 1993. Drafts of all chapters of the UC report were reviewed by adistinguished panel of expert reviewers representing a range ofopinions on needle exchange (Dr. Mindy Fullilove, Dr. Don DesJarlais, Dr. Ed Kaplan, Dr. Herbert Kleber, Dr. Douglas Owens,Dr. Beny Primm, and Ms. Beth Weinstein). The UC teas used stringent scientific standards in itsanalysis and interpretation of the collected published andunpublished studies on NEPs and needle and syringe availability.The UC report is the most extensive and comprehensive study ofneedle exchange ever published. 6. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA The information in this section on NEPs in the United Statesand Canada is derived from the UC report. The first NEP to provide comprehensive services in the UnitedStates opened in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington. As of September 1,1993, there were at least 37 NEPs operating in 30 cities in 12States. By June 1993, more than 5.4 million syringes had beendistributed (almost always in exchange for used syringes) by NEPsin the United States. In calendar year 1992, U.S. NEPsdistributed more than 2.4 million syringes. Needle exchange has provoked intense political debate at thenational level and in some States (e.g., California, New York)and cities (e.g., Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Berkeley).Nonetheless, in many cities (e.g., Seattle, Tacoma, SanFrancisco, Honolulu,- New Haven), large-scale NEPs have beenestablished with substantial community support. In New York City,after years of intense political debate, five NEPs were legallyopened in 1992 and now distribute about one million syringes ayear. The UC team collected U.S. public opinion polls that-at-included questions regarding needle availability needle cleaning.These public opinion polls indicate that approximately half ofthe general public has supported harm reduction efforts,including needle cleaning, legalization of needles sales, needleexchange, and needle distribution. While this public support hastended to increase over time and has been somewhat higher forneedle exchange than for needle distribution, needle exchangeremains a controversial issue. Substantial variations exist among U.S. NEPs in legal status,administrative structure, and sources of funding. Nineteen U.S.NEPs are "legal,"[5] eight are"illegal-tolerated,"[6] and six are"illegal-underground."[7] Six U.S. NEPs areadministered by State or local governments, six bycommunity-based organizations (CBOs with government sponsorship,eight by CBOs without government sponsorship, and thirteen bywhat the UC report called "activist" organizations.Private donations are a major source of funding at 19 U.S. NEPs,more than any other source of funding. Fourteen NEPs arefinancially supported by foundation grants, 12 by funds from aCBO and/or activist organization administering the NEP, 12 bycity or county government, and 4 by State governments. FifteenU.S. NEPs depend entirely on volunteer staff, and all but sevenNEPs use volunteers. Twenty-seven of 33 U.S. NEPs surveyed orvisited have "one-for-one rules" (one sterile syringeis given out for each syringe turned in). Seventeen NEPs provide'starter needles" (one or more [usually three] syringesprovided to new NEP clients without requiring turn-in of usedsyringes). Ten NEPs have limits on the number of syringes thatcan be exchanged. Rules governing the exchange procedures aregenerally well enforced. U.S. NEPs serve ethnically diverse IDU populations thatgenerally reflect local ethnic and racial patterns. The mean ageof U.S. NEP clients ranges from 33-41 years with a mean durationof drug injection ranging from 7-20 years. NEPs successfullyreach IDUs who are not enrolled in drug treatment, with studiesin the United States reporting one-third to one-half of NEPclients having no prior exposure to drug treatment. NEP clientsare at significant risk for drug-related HIV transmission with 10to 60 percent reporting some needle sharing and about one-thirdreported sharing needles in the month preceding interview. U.S. NEPs are reaching thousands of IDUs in the 30 cities inwhich they operate. In addition to needle exchange, a variety ofpublic health services are provided on site or are available byreferral, including drug treatment, HIV counseling and testing,primary medical care, tuberculosis and sexually transmitteddisease screening and treatment, and social services. The UC teamfound that among NEPs visited with data on these activities, sixNEPs had referred more than 2,000 drug users to drug treatmentand that more than 800 drug users had started drug treatmentafter referral by four NEPs. [5]An NEP in a State that does not have a prescription law oran NEP that has a specific exemption to the prescription law. [6]In a state with a prescription law, an NEP which a locallyelected body (e.g., city council) has voted to support orapprove. [7]In a State with a prescription law, an illegal-undergroundNEP which has not been supported by a locally elected body. The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchangeprograms visited is relatively low at 5169,000, with governmentrun programs tending to have larger budgets. Some NEPs are moreexpensive because they also provide substantial additionalservices such as drug treatment referrals. The UC team extensively reviewed the previously publishedmathematical models that estimated the impact of NEPs on HIVtransmission, and developed additional models of theeffectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NEPs in the UnitedStates. These efforts, in agreement with other independentreviews (e.g., the General Accounting Office [GAO] review),confirmed the theoretical and technical validity of the modelused to estimate the impact of the New Haven NEP. Applied toother cities, a simplified version of this model predictedreductions ranging from 17 to 70 percent in new drug-related HIVinfections among NEP clients. In one of the cities, the estimatedcost-per-HIV-infection-averted by NEPs was between S3,700 and$12,000. These estimated costs of preventing an HIV infectioncompare very favorably with the costs of other lifesavingprograms and are much less than the present value of the lifetimecosts of medical care for a person with HIV infection ($119,000). The UC report also reviews the development of NEPs in Canada,where the federal government provided leadership and initialfunding (requiring provincial matching funds) for HIV preventionprograms for drug users, including NEPs. In Canada all NEPs arelegal, and there has been very limited community or professionalopposition to the NEPs. Since the first Canadian NEPs were openedin 1989, the number of cities with active NEPs has steadilyincreased to a total of 28 cities in early 1993. More than 2.5million syringes were distributed through December 1992 by thefive Canadian NEPs visited by the UC team. 7. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON DRUG USE Accurate measurement of drug use patterns and numbers of drugusers in communities is technically very challenging, in partbecause drug use is-an illegal activity. Therefore-, it isextremely difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of NEPson community drug use. The UC report provides data on both the behavior of NEPclients and community measures of drug use. The UC report clearlydocuments that substantial numbers of IDUs (both clients andnon-clients of the NEP) have been referred to drug treatmentprograms, a substantial step in reducing drug use by thoseindividuals and in the community. The UC report presents theresults of 26 evaluations in the United States and abroad thatprovide information on changes in drug-risk behavior among IDUswho were using NEPs; 16 of the 26 were judged to be of acceptablescientific quality. Although not definitive, the majority ofthese studies found that drug-related risk behaviors for HIVtransmission were significantly reduced among NEP clients. In addition, the UC team reviewed national drug use indicatorsand the findings of IDU focus groups. The limited data for U.S.cities with NEPs from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), DrugUse Forecasting (DUF) system, and Uniform Crime Reports do notshow clear trends in patterns of drug use in those cities withNEPs. The IDU focus groups conducted in cities with NEPsconsistently indicated that the participants believed that NEPswould have little effect on drug use in the community. We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data arequite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-relatedincreases in community levels of drug use. However, thelimitations of both available research methods and existing dataaddressing this issue underline the need for continuingevaluation and research on the impact of NEPs on drug use.Additional evaluation and research and the development of newresearch methods in this area should be a component of Federallysupported NEPs. A key concern of NEP opponents is that these programs willdirectly or indirectly increase drug use. Opponents view NEPs asdirectly increasing drug use by providing the means (needles andsyringes) to inject drugs. They also see NEPs as indirectlypromoting drug use by appearing to condone and facilitate druguse and thereby undermining the credibility of society's messagethat using drugs is illegal, unhealthy and morally wrong.However, no study in the United States or abroad was found thatshowed that NEPs increase community drug use. 8. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON PREVENTING HIVINFECTION A major question in the policy debate over NEPs is theireffectiveness in preventing-HIV infection among IDU-s-and-theircontacts. Several findings strongly support the conclusion thatNEPs reduce HIV transmission. First, the process of needleexchange removes used, often HIV-contaminated, needles andsyringes from the hands of IDUs and replaces them with sterileneedles and syringes. Second, NEPs are often effective inreferring NEP client and non-client IDUs to drug treatmentprograms. Third, NEP clients report decreases in their HIV drugrisk behaviors. Fourth, mathematical models of the impact of NEPsin New Haven and other cities consistently estimate substantialreductions (ranging from 17 to 70 percent) in HIV transmissionfor the IDUs using NEPs and their sex partners and children.Fifth, there is some evidence that hepatitis B infection isreduced by NEPs. On the other hand, epidemiologic studies whichdirectly address HIV prevalence and incidence in relation to NEPshave been methodologically weak. One case-control study (inAmsterdam) found no protective effect of the NEP on HIVseroconversion among IDUs. However, the Amsterdam study was notprimarily designed to test NEP effectiveness and included only alimited number (31) of new HIV infections. We concur with the UCconclusion that the relationship between NEPs and HIV infectionmay be very difficult to determine conclusively. 9. REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOMMENDATIONS In this section, the recommendations of the UC study arereviewed. "Recommendations for the federal government The federal government should repeal the ban on the use offederal funds for needle exchange services. Substantial federal funds should be committed both toproviding needle exchange services and to expanding research intothese programs. CDC comment: Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with theminor modifications indicated in this section. Given the significance of injection drug use in HIVtransmission in the United States, it is important to implementNEPs as one possible component of comprehensive HIV preventionprograms for drug users. Comprehensive programs should includeincreases in drug treatment, street and community outreach todrug users, and effective school and community-based programs toprevent initiation of drug use. The ban on Federal funding ofNEP-s should be removed-to allow States-and-communities theoption of including NEPs in comprehensive programs. NEPs will bemore readily integrated into comprehensive programs when there isevidence of substantial local support for NEPs as indicated byany of the following: requests for an NEP from a State or localHIV community planning process; substantial funding for NEPs fromlocal and/or State government or nongovernmental organizations;and efforts to reform the laws limiting the sale or possession ofneedles and syringes. The PHS should fund additional evaluations of NEPs[8] togather more data on the impact of these programs and to assessthe relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of NEPservices. Additional research is needed on the initiation of druguse and drug injection and changes in community drug use,particularly in communities with high prevalence of drug use, asthey relate to NEPs and other interventions that increase theavailability of sterile needles and syringes. PHS agenciessupporting research on NEPs should develop and promote the use ofstandardized data elements, methods of data collection, andprotocols for evaluation and analysis. State governments in the ten states and the District ofColumbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. - States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply tosyringes. CDC comment: Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with themodifications indicated in this section. Although the major focus of the UC report was NEPs, there isample evidence of the importance of allowing access to sterileneedles and syringes for drug users who will not or cannot stopinjecting drugs. In the United States and other countries,difficulty in obtaining and/or possessing needles and syringescontributes to multiperson use of needles and syringes andthereby to HIV transmission. NEPs can provide only a part of theincreased access to needles and syringes that is needed toprevent HIV infection in IDUs, their sex partners and children.Changing the prescription and paraphernalia laws would increaseIDU access to sterile needles and syringes with little or noexpenditure of public funds. An ongoing CDC and Connecticut evaluation of 1992 changes inthe prescription and drug paraphernalia laws in Connecticut[9]provides convincing evidence of the potential benefit of theserecommendations. The evaluation found (1) steady increases of"non-prescription" purchases of needles and syringesfrom pharmacies, (2) that IDUs reported their primary source ofneedles and syringes shifted from street/black-market purchasesto pharmacy purchases and (3) that sharing ("multipersonuse") of needles and syringes decreased from 52 percentprior to the new laws to 32 percent 8 to 12 months after the newlaws were implemented. Similar increases in pharmacy purchasesand decreases in sharing of needles and syringes were found inFrance after a prescription law was repealed in 1987. [9]In 1992, Connecticut removed all criminal penalties for (a)the sale, without a prescription, of up to 10 needles andsyringes and (b) the possession of up to 10 needles and syringes. The implementation of these recommendations is primarily theresponsibility of State governments. We recommend that theFederal government and others support strong evaluation studiesof the impact of changes in these laws on drug use patterns andHIV transmission risk behaviors. The use of standardized researchmethods yielding comparable results should be encouraged. "Recommendations for local governments and communities Local governments should enter into discussions with localcommunity groups to develop a comprehensive approach topreventing HIV in injection drug users. their sex partners. andtheir offspring. This approach should include needle exchangeprograms and the expansion of drug treatment services. Local communities should seek to further increase sterilesyringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution. orexchange of syringes by pharmacists." CDC comment: Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate. The experience with implementing NEPs in the United States andother countries indicates that NEPs are better accepted andoperate more efficiently when there is extensive communityinvolvement in planning how the NEP services will be provided.NEPs should be components of comprehensive, multifaceted HIVprevention programs for IDUs. Pharmacy sale of sterile needles and syringes is-an--importantcomponent in increasing the availability of sterile injectionequipment to IDUs. Retail pharmacies could provide widespreadaccess to sterile needles and syringes, especially in areas whereNEPs would be impractical (e.g., rural areas). Pharmacists areimportant "gate keepers" for the availability ofsterile needles and syringes. Many pharmacists will need trainingto realize the importance of their public health role in helpingensure the availability of sterile needles and syringes to IDUs. 10 . INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF STERILE NEEDLES ANDSYRINGES CDC believes that increasing the availability of sterileneedles and syringes is appropriate Federal policy for thefollowing reasons: (1) HIV transmission associated with injection drug use is amajor contributor to the growth of the current AIDS epidemic inthe United States. Injection-related HIV transmission has causedincreases in the number of AIDS cases among women and children,in heterosexually acquired HIV infections and in cases oftuberculosis. (2) Restrictions on access to and the possession of needlesand syringes increase the multiperson use ("sharing")of drug injection equipment that transmits HIV. (3) A recent bulletin from the CDC, NIDA, and CSAT indicatesthat bleach disinfection of used drug injection equipment is notas safe as using sterile needles and syringes. Such disinfectionis recommended only when sterile needles and syringes are notavailable. (4) Evaluation of NEPs in the United States and othercountries indicates that these programs can provide services tolarge numbers of IDUs, remove millions of used needles andsyringes from circulation, and increase access to drug treatmentand other high priority public health services. (5) The preponderance of evidence indicates that NEPs diminishHIV transmission without increasing drug use. (6) Evaluation of changes in the prescription and drugparaphernalia laws in Connecticut indicates that drug userschange their usual source of needles and syringes from street and"black market" purchases to purchases -from pharmaciesand substantially decrease sharing of injection equipment. We recommend that the PHS adopt a policy goal of increasingthe availability of sterile needles and syringes for IDUs. Thisspecific HIV prevention strategy would be one component ofcomprehensive, multifaceted HIV prevention programs for IDUs. Thefollowing activities should be considered to implement thispolicy: Allow Federal funding of NEPs, especially when these NEPswould also provide their clients with access to HIV counselingand other priority public health programs (e.g., drug treatmentand tuberculosis screening and treatment). Programs that receiveFederal funding should have substantial evaluation and/orresearch components, either as part of the project or as aseparately funded activity. Continue funding for research and evaluation studies of theimpact of NEPs on HIV risk behaviors and HIV infection. (1) the repeal of State laws requiring a physician'sprescription for the purchase of sterile needles and syringes,(2) the repeal of State and municipal laws and regulations makingthe possession of needles and syringes a crime, and 3) theremoval of needles and syringes from the list of materialscovered by the Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.Evaluations of the impact of these changes should be funded Work with the professional associations of pharmacists andpharmacies to develop policies that increase the pharmacy-basedavailability of sterile needles and syringes.

Needle exchange programs have continued to increase in numberin the U.S. and by September 1, 1993 at least 37 active programsexist. The evolution of needle exchange programs in the U.S. hasbeen characterized by growing efforts to accommodate the concernsof local communities. increasing likelihood of being legal,growing institutionalization, and increasing federal funding ofresearch, although a ban on federal funding for program servicesremains in effect. How do Needle Exchange Programs Operate? About one-half of U.S. needle exchange programs are legal, butfunding is often unstable and most programs rely on volunteerservices to operate. All but six U.S. needle exchange programsrequire one-for-one exchanges and rules governing the) exchangeof syringes are generally well enforced. In addition to havingdistributed over 5.4 million syringes, U.S. needle exchangeprograms provide a variety of services ranging from condom andbleach distribution to drug treatment referrals. Do Needle Exchange Programs Act as Bridges to Public HealthServices? Some needle exchange programs have made significant numbers ofreferrals to drug abuse treatment and other public healthservices, but referrals are limited by the paucity of drugtreatment slots. Integrating needle exchange programs into theexisting public health system is a likely future direction forthese programs. How Much Does It Cost to Operate Needle Exchange Programs? The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchangeprograms visited is relatively low at $169,000, withgovernment-run programs tending to be more expensive. Some needleexchange programs are more expensive because they also providesubstantial non-exchange services such as drug treatmentreferrals. The annual cost of funding an average needle exchangeprogram would support about 60 methadone maintenance slots forone year. Who Are the IDUs who Use Needle Exchange Programs? Although needle exchange program clients vary from location tolocation, the programs generally reach a group of injection drugusers with long histories of drug injection who remain atsignificant risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)infection. Needle exchange program clients in the U.S. have hadless exposure to drug abuse treatment than IDUs not using theprograms. What Proportion of All Injection Drug Users in a CommunityUses the Needle Exchange Program? Studies of adequately-funded needle exchange programs suggestthat the programs do have the potential to serve significantproportions of the local injecting drug user population. Whilesome needle exchange programs appear to have reached largeproportions of local drug injectors at least once, others arereaching only a small fraction of them. Consequently othermethods of increasing sterile needle availability must beexplored. What Are the Community Responses to Needle Exchange Programs? Unlike in many foreign countries, including Canada, proposalsto establish needle exchange programs in the U.S. have oftenencountered strong opposition from a variety of differentcommunities. Consultation with affected communities can addressmany of the concerns raised. Do Needle Exchange Programs Result in Changes in CommunityLevels of Drug Use? Although quantitative data are difficult to-obtain, thoseavailable provide no evidence that--needle exchange programsincrease the amount of drug use by needle exchange programclients or change overall community levels of non injection andinjection drug use. This conclusion is supported by interviewswith needle exchange program clients and by injecting drug usersnot using the programs who did not believe that increased needleavailability would increase drug use. Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect the Number of DiscardedSyringes? Needle exchange programs in the U.S. have not been shown toincrease the total number of discarded syringes and can beexpected to result in fewer discarded syringes. Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of HIV drug and/orSex Risk Behaviors? The majority of studies of needle exchange program clientsdemonstrate decreased ratios of HIV drug risk behavior, but notdecreased ratios of HIV sex risk behavior. What is the Role of Studies of Syringes in injection Drug UseResearch? The limitations of using the testing of syringes-as a measureof injecting drug users' behavior or behavior change can beminimized by following syringe characteristics over time,. or bycomparing characteristics of syringes returned by needle exchangeprogram clients with those obtained from non-clients of theprogram. Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of Diseases Relatedto Injection Drug Use Other than HIV? Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs oninjection-related infectious diseases other than HIV providelimited evidence that needle exchange programs are associatedwith reductions in subcutaneous abscesses and hepatitis B amonginjecting drug users. Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect HIV Infection Rates? Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIVinfection rates do not and, in part due to the need for largesample sizes and the multiple impediments to randomization,probably cannot provide clear evidence that needle exchangeprograms decrease HIV infection rates. However, needle exchangeprograms do not appear to be associated with increased rates ofHIV infection. Are Needle Exchange Programs Cost-effective in Preventing HIVInfection? Multiple mathematical models of needle exchange program impactsupport the findings of the New Haven Model. These models suggestthat needle exchange programs can prevent significant numbers ofinfections among clients of the programs, their drug an sexpartners, and their children. In almost ail cases, the cost perHIV infection averted is far below the $119,000 lifetime cost oftreating an HIV-infected person. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations for the federal government The federal government should repeal the ban on the use offederal funds for needle exchange services. Substantial federal funds should be committed both toproviding needle exchange services and to expanding research intothese programs. Recommendations for state governments State governments in the ten states and the District ofColumbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws.[1] States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply tosyringes.[2] Recommendations for local governments and communities Local governments should enter into discussions with localcommunity groups to develop a comprehensive approach topreventing HIV in injecting drug users, their sex partners, andtheir offspring. This approach should include needle exchangeprograms and the expansion of drug treatment services Local communities should seek to further increase sterilesyringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution, orexchange of syringes by pharmacists. Recommendations for researchers Descriptions of the "kinetics" and determinants ofneedle use patterns: injection drug users sources of needles.methods of disposal of needles, frequency of needle re-use, andneedle-sharing patterns. How do these change when a needleexchange program or other changes in needle availability areimplemented? Evaluations of "natural experiments" in which needleavailability laws pharmacy based syringe sale, distribution, or exchange and toidentify the barriers to their participation. Assessments of the effects of design features of needleexchange programs (e.g., administering bodies, sitecharacteristics, opening hours, and program rules} upon processmeasures of needle exchange programs (e.g., needles distributed,drug treatment referrals discarding of needles). Ethnographic and other qualitative research to assess thefactors involved in drug use initiation and in transitionsbetween various routes of drug use. Case-control studies of the relationship between use of theneedle exchange program and acute hepatitis 8, particularly incities with active surveillance for the infection. Large, multi-center case-control studies within existingcohorts of injecting drug users to assess whether use of theneedle exchange program is associated with hepatitis B or HIVseroconversion Mathematical modeling using program data and behavior changeevaluations to determine which aspects of program designdetermine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. [1]Prescription laws preclude the purchase of a syringewithout a prescription. limiting sterile syringe availability andcreating a risk of arrest for needle exchange program staff andclients.

Curran, M.D. Ph.D. Assistant Surgeon General From: Deputy Director Office of AIDS Research Subject: Comments on the CDC's Draft Response on NeedleExchange We have reviewed the draft CDC response to the Office of theAssistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General regardingthe University of California report on needle exchange. Inaddition to the comments provided in our earlier review of thereport (included as Tab B in the CDC draft response), we providethe following comments that are specific to the draft CDCresponse letter: 1. Agency Position Issue Page 1: The second paragraph implies that the NIH, along withSAMHSA, HRSA, and the FDA, has provided "recommendation forneedle exchange." This is either inaccurate or misleading.We suggest that the wording "And recommendations for needleexchange" be dropped from the sentence. 2. Research The CDC draft response appropriately includes an emphasis onthe need for increasing research and evaluation of needleexchange programs (NEPs) and other related aspects of HIV anddrug abuse. However, in light of the reported gaps in informationconcerning the efficacy and impact of needle exchange programs,requiring evaluation to be an integral component of any federallyfunded NEP becomes critical if we are to take an iterativeapproach to this issue. The following text changes are recommended: Page 2: In the last sentence of the second paragraph the word"include" should be change (sic) to"require"; Page 11: The first sentence of the last paragraph should be"The PHS should require substantial evaluation be part ofany federally funded NEP so as to continue to gather more data onthe impact..."; and, Page 15: The last sentence of the first paragraph should bechanged to read, "Programs that receive Federal fundingshould be required to have substantial evaluation and/or researchcomponents, either as part of the project or as a separatelyfunded activity." 3. Agency Designation Page 4: The fourth paragraph lists the CDC, CSAT and NIDA asco-sponsors of a bleach use guidance. For parity , all agenciesshould be designated. This could be achieved by indicatingCSAT/SAMHSA and NIDA/NIH, or by stating, " The NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes ofHealth,..."

" We have reviewed the report, "The Public Health Impact ofNeedle Exchange Programs in the United states and Abroad, "from a research perspective, We have provided several points foryour consideration in your response on needle exchange to theAssistant Secretary for Health: 1. This report is a good initial analysis of this issue andserves as a useful starting point for further examination; 2. Utilizing needle/syringe exchange (NSE) programs as an HIVprevention strategy is a complex issue. The current state of thescience with respect to this issue is neither complete norcomprehensive, .requiring further study on this, as well as,alternative behavioral interventions; 2. There are a number of significant issues and problems withrespect to needle exchange program that the data available to theUniversity of California have not addressed (see attachedanalysis); 3. The report appropriately suggests a substantial federalcommitment to research in this area. Such support should include,but should not be limited to, .funding for: 1) buildingsubstantiai evaluation and/or research components into existingNSEs; 2) research demonstration projects that address NSEprogram: design issues; 3. research on other forms ofneed~e/syringe distribution (e.g., pharmacy or vending machinPstrategies); and, 4) research on the relationships and impact ofNSEs on other prevention strategies (e.g., bleach use) and othernon-injecting at-risk populations (e.g., non-injecting drug userswho trade sex or money for drugs). In addition, until more isdefinitively known and has been time tested, any NSE serviceprograms funded should have appropriate research and/orevaluation components built into them as a prerequisite forFederal funding. For a more detailed analysis of the specific research issuesand questions that remain unanswered by the report, we haveattached comments on the report provided by the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse.

Sent by Xerox Telecopier 7021:11-12-93 :10:48 AM : 44323174027789;# DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service National Institutes of Health National Institute on Drug Abuse 5500 Fishers Lane Rockville, Maryland 20857 Memorandum Date: November 12, 1993 To: Jack Whitescarver, Ph.D. Deputy Director Office of AIDS Research National Institutes of Health From: Acting Chief Clinical Medicine Branch Division of Clinical Research National Institute on Drug Abuse Thru: Associate Director for AIDS National Institute on Drug Abuse Topic: Comments on University of California Report, " ThePublic Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the UnitedStates and Abroad" In general, medical/public health interventions, likemedications, may be evaluated within a framework that examinessafety, efficacy, side effects, deleterious effects and bothpositive and negative interactions with other treatments orconditions. With respect to any of the effects, questions includewhat subpopulations are likely to experience the effect and howlong it is likely to last, including recommendations with respectto the length of treatment. In fact, to the degree to which thisReport provides the equivalent of a section of the Physician'sDesk Reference(PDR) devoted to needle/syringe exchange (NSE) itwill be helpful all who are concerned with the implications ofNSEs. Viewing this Report in the aforementioned framework it becomesclear that with respect to overall "effects" NSE isassociated in the aggregate with reductions in self reports ofneedle-related HIV risk behavior. However, a major problem with the existing data examined bythe Report is the lack of sensitivity of the data to detection ofadverse effects of NSE on individuals or subpopulations andinteraction with, for example, the various modalities of drugabuse treatment. There is no equivalent of studies that searchfor individuals who purport to have experienced "adversereactions" or negative consequences or interactions that maybe attributable to participation in NSE. It is questionablewhether in the context of medications development the FederalGovernment would approve and/or provide funds for a medicationfor which this type of data were not available. In the spirit of seeking the information that would be neededfor a complete PDR section on needle/syringe exchange, we willreview some concerns about the potential adverse impact andinteractions of NSE. One major concern of critics of NSEs as an AIDS interventioneffort is the degree to which the availability of sterileneedles/syringes would server to promote drug use. While theneedle exchange studies reported from around the world from thelast two world AIDS conferences do not, and perhaps cannot, provethat the presence and/or use of a needle exchange does notincrease drug use, there have been no reports that confirm suchan increase. However, there are a number of direct and indirectways in which drug use maybe promoted for individuals andsubpopulations that have not been addressed by existing data. Forexample, one wonders what happens to the drug use of individualswho seek drug treatment through an NSE and are told that there isno slot available for them. Analogous to that for needle/syringe exchange, the criticismof the potential for increasing injection drug use was raised forbleach distribution. This particular criticism (although not allcriticisms) with respect to bleach was, in the aggregate andwithin limits, refuted by the results of the National AIDSDemonstration Research data which is consistent with the modelthat when contact is established with drug users, trust is build,information is imparted and risky behavior is reduced, despitethe fact that safe needle use is also being assisted at the sametime(XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). Nonetheless, the demonstration ofbeneficial effects does not preclude the simultaneous existenceof deleterious effects. NSEs may not be uniformly effective in acting as a bridge toother public health services, depending on such factors as towhat degree the services are "on-site" versus"remote" as well as "immediately available"versus "requiring waiting". Studies of the servicelinkage process suggest that higher rates of successfulengagement with other services will be attained for thoseservices that are on-site and immediately available. It would beuseful to attempt to characterize users and non-users ofadditional services and to delineate those factors that affectthese decisions. Inconsistent of infrequent users of the NSEs may remain and bestabilized at high risk behavior levels. With respect to theinconsistent or infrequent users of the NSEs, it will beimportant to determine the factors influencing periods of useversus non-user. More over, looking at NSEs as an"innovation" with respect to injection drug user, theliterature of models of [LINE LOST IN COPYING - Ed.] middle andlate adopters of NSEs may be useful in terms of delineatingpopulations with distinct patterns of motivations, risk factorsand responses to the NSEs. Change or lack of change in the micro-structure, i.e.,details, of behaviors associated with drug use may negatebeneficial effects of NSEs. In looking at drug risk behaviors, itis important to attempt to assess whether NSEs affect rate ofsharing of cookers, cotton, water, etc. as well as such practicesas frontloading, backloading and booting. With respect to drugrisk behaviors it is thus important to examine NSE effects onbehavioral norms of (1) non-NSE-users and (2) drug usingnon-injectors as well as (3) NSE users. NSE users may sell paraphernalia or exchange it for drugs orsex. In fact, the possibility should be examined thatnon-injectors may use the NSEs as a source for paraphernalia thatmay used in transactions with injectors. The rate at which NSE users (versus NSE non-users) initiatenew injectors and influence other IDUs to utilize or not utilizethe NSE should be examined. Moreover, questions of the influenceof the NSE on injections frequency should be examined closely.For individuals, the availability of clean paraphernalia mayremove one brake on increasing the frequency of injection. Certainly, NSE effects on the number of IDUs entering drugtreatment need to be examined. However, the fate of IDUs who haveused the NSE prior to entry into drug treatment should also beexamined. NSE participants or injections drug users whose networkincludes NSE participants may relapse to needle use and/or dropout of drug treatment at a higher rate than NSE non-users. NSE effects on social network may lead to problems. Since NSEsimply a high rate of flow of IDUs through the neighborhoodsurrounding the site, there may be a tendency for dealers,operators of shooting galleries and/or crack houses andprostitutes to relocate to the same area. If possible, theseeffects and their implications should be assessed. The potentialeffects of NSEs on setting up bridges between networks of IDUs inhigh and low HIV seroprevalence neighborhoods should be examined.If NSEs serve to create such bridges they would, especiallythrough inconsistent seropositive users, serve as conduits tofacilitate viral spread. If data are generated on local changesin seroprevcalence and/or seroincidence over time in areassurrounding NSEs, (including baseline levels prior to theestablishment of the NSE and changes during the growth of theNSE), then some of these questions may be able to be addressed.Data pertinent to the perceived effects of participation in theNSE on the sexual, social and drug-using networks of theindividuals would also be helpful in beginning to address thesehypotheses. Additional network effects may occur or existing networkeffects may be potentiated if NSE sites are located close to drugtreatment programs (methadone or drug free programs), hospitals,psychiatric facilities, homeless shelters or other facilitiesthat attract concentrations of individuals who are vulnerable toinitiating drug injections, relapsing to drug use or injections,having sex with injections users or becoming victims of crimeassociated with injections users. As is addressed in the Report, the surveyed NSEs variedgreatly in along many parameters including estimates of theproportions of injection drug users reached by the program, theamount of education offered, the degree to which injectionequipment beyond needles/syringes were distributed, emphasis ondrug treatment referrals, costs, the extent of ongoingevaluation, acceptance by the local community, legalacceptance/tolerance, etc. These are major program design andfeasibility that could determine differences between highlyeffective programs and those with a substantial negative impact.Support for grams without consideration of these issues would bethe equivalent of support for all treatment programs in any areain the absence of standards and quality assurance. Finally, the interrelationships between NSEs and the use ofbleach need to be examined. For example, we have evidence thateven IDUs who use bleach tend to not use it effectively. Does theexistence of needles from NSEs decrease the probability that IDUswill even attempt to use bleach if the share? Will they feel thatthe needles are at least relatively safer and thus real thatbleach use is not necessary? Does the distribution of bleachincrease the probability that IDUs will share NSE distributedneedles? Are NSEs attempting to intervene in terms of educationwith respect to bleach use? This, of course is not an exhaustive list of questions orissues, but is meant to represent a set of problems whoseexistence has not been addressed by the data available to theUniversity of California study. However, even in the absence of Federal Support, NSE is agrowing part of HIV prevention efforts. This Report appropriatelysuggests a substantial Federal commitment to research in thisarea. With respect to the funding of services, it appearsreasonable, as the Report suggests, that the ban on funding belifted. Nonetheless, it would appear prudent in light of theincomplete data and the aforementioned set of concerns that noservices e funded that do not included a substantial evaluationcomponent with appropriate instrumentation and methodologies toidentify adverse as well as beneficial contribution of theseprograms to HIV and other infectious disease transmission anddrug use patterns. Perhaps as a prelude to defining standards forFederal funding of NSE services, there should be funding forincorporating evaluation in existing NSEs and setting upresearch/demonstrations projects that address NSE program designissues. Beyond the issue of NSEs per se, the argument is made in thisReport in favor of immediate implementation of the entire varietyof interventions that increase the availability of sterileneedles/syringes, including pharmacy sales and the abolition ofprescription and paraphernalia laws. Given the stated priority ofthe objective, presumably this support would extend to otherforms of needle/syringe distribution, e.g., vending machines likethose used in Europe. While the objective appears reasonable, it would be helpful ifthe Report addressed more of the complexities of this issue sothat sterile needle/syringes are not viewed as a "magicbullet" that obviates the need to continue work onbehavioral interventions. For example, there have been extensiveobservations of "secondary sharing" in which addicts ingroups use frontloading and backloading to distribute"cooked" drugs to their syringes. In these situation ifan addict brings his/her own syringe, but has previously used thesyringe even once and engaged in "booting" (drawingblood back into the syringe and reinjecting after initialinjection to make sure that any residual drug in the syringe isused), blood may be distributed to others' syringes. Moreover,contaminants of "cookers', "cotton" and"rinse water" may be similarly distributed. Finally, all strategies for distributing needles/syringes maynot be equivalent. For example, it is questionable whetherpharmacies will provide other forms of injections equipment, HIVeducation, HIV testing and counseling, referral to drug treatmentprograms, on-site medical car, etc. Similarly, these servicewould presumable not be available through such distributionsources as vending machines.

Stephen Jones, M.D. Center for Disease Control Prevention November 9, 1993 NOTE TO: George Lewis RE Comments on Needle Exchange Study As you may be aware, Beny asked me to review this reportduring the early of it's preparation earlier this year. While thefinal summary report does reflect many of the changes werecommended, there are several noteworthy areas which warrantsome attention. Page 4, Paragraph 4. The report indicates that, "althoughNEPs may make referral to drug treatment an important part oftheir services, they acknowledge that many IDUs, including somein drug treatment programs, continue to inject drugs and shareinjection equipment. They therefore seek to reduce the harmassociated with these practices...". While there may be someinjecting drug users in certain treatment modalities who continueto inject drugs, the reference here implies that this practicehas more significance than the evidence warrants. Moreimportantly, the statement, in a somewhat convoluted fashion,implies that referral to treatment in contrast to NEP does notoffer assurance that drug users will not inject drugs. Page 11, Paragraph 5. The report notes that. NEPs vary greatlywith respect to the emphasis they place upon making referrals todrug treatment and other public health services. This stems inpart from the desire to make the NEP "user friendly",the recognition that many active IDUs express no interest inentering drug treatment, and the related belief that an overemphasis on drug treatment could alienated potential NEPclients." This assertion for which two literature referencesare cited is a dangerously misleading generalization. First it isunclear what the authors mean by "user-friendly". Thisimplies that drug treatment is somehow not user friendly which isclearly not the case. Secondly, the references to drug treatmentare based published papers which were published before OTI/CSATcame into existence, a development which has had an enormouseffect on the nature and quality of national drug treatmentservices. We must remember that many of staff of these NEPs areonly casually familiar with the various treatment modalities, thebehavioral characteristics of drug using populations and aregenerally not qualified to make determinations about who isinterested in treatment or not. In point of fact many drug usersare not interested in treatment, enter treatment for many otherreasons, e.g. secure primary care or to take a respite from theiraddiction lifestyle, other than to address their addictions. Itdoes not follow, even from the limited evidence provided in thecited studies, that emphasizing or overemphasizing treatmentproduces alienation. finally, the determination of who should bereferred or not should never be left to so-called perceptions ofstaff regarding "readiness for treatment". Page 12, Conclusion. There are a number of reasons whyreferrals to drug treatment are limited other than the paucity ofdrug treatment slots. One important consideration which may be alimiting factor to referrals may in fact have more to do with howvarious NEPs have evolved in relation to drug treatment programsin the same area. It is abundantly clear that these programs havenot been in philosophical agreement regarding how to address theneeds of the addict. Page 13, Conclusion. I don't think there is any seriousdisagreement that the cost of NEPs are substantially cheaper thanany form of treatment including methadone. It is also true thatNEP is cheaper than coronary angioplasty, renal dialysis and arange of other health care expenditure. The reference made tomethadone seems to suggest that there is contrast, or perhapsimply that there is tacit substitution effect. The reference madeto methadone should be deleted since its incorporation in thecontext of the conclusion is largely irrelevant. Page 14, Paragraph 5. Our understanding of injecting drug useamong women is not as well developed as for men. While there isevidence which suggest that men initiate women, this is by nomeans an absolute. the fact remains that there are IDUpopulations of women which operate independently from those ofmen. Our limited knowledge of injecting behaviors among womenclearly indicates that there may be other factors involved withrespect to injecting behavior which may make it problematic toapply NEP directed at male IDUs to female IDUs. Page 16, Conclusion. The conclusion tragically fails toappreciate the full range of antipathy and fear which AfricanAmericans communities have for the "symbolicsanctioning" of drug abuse by endorsing NEP in theircommunities. After years of "Just Say No", theperception of many leaders in these communities is that NEPrepresents a step back and not forward. Irrespective of whetherthis perception is valid or not, the presence of these compellingbeliefs cannot be dismissed lightly. It is insulting to thesecommunities, also contrary to all of our Public Health platitudesaround cultural sensitivity to dismiss these visceral communityconcerns by stating that "newer African Americanorganizations established specifically to address HIV preventiongenerally support NEP as did several mayors..." Thisstatement literally indicates that the view of traditionalleaders from the African American communities and from churchleaders can and should be ignored in favor of those who supportNEP. This statement by it's intent, fosters divisiveness and isantithetical to efforts made by other segments of public healthincluding those concerned with preventing HIV disease to engageand not alienate the African American community. Page 18, Conclusion. The overall issue here is the questionwhich frames this section, "Do NEPs result in changes incommunity levels of drug use?" Clearly this is very complexquestion which could not be answered within the scope of thestudy, but one which nonetheless warrants a poignant level ofinquiry. However, the conclusion seems to go beyond the paucityof evidence to conclude that there is "no evidence that NEPsincrease the amount of drug use by NEP clients or change overallcommunity levels of non-injection and injection drug use."This convoluted logic would have us believe that if it cannot beestablished that NEP has an effect on drug use, then the absenceof correlates, irrespective of methodological limitations, istantamount to saying it has no effect. This conclusion is furthersupported by indicating that interview with NEP clients and byIDUs not using NEP, confirmed that they did not believe thatincrease needle availability would increase drug use. It is notclear how these two groups would qualify to speculate on newincidence, especially by younger members of the community. Ingeneral, this ipso facto logic is not only distressing, butraises very real questions overall scientific validity of thisreport. Page 21, Conclusion. Though the majority of studies citedindicated a decreased rate of HIV drug risk behavior, the realissue here which is not addressed are whether these behavioralchanges are sustainable overtime. While there are clearlycompelling finding of short term behavioral change, theseindications do not provide definitive conclusions regarding theeffectiveness of NEP overtime. The proper statement of thisconclusion should insert the caveat that the studies reviewed donot conclusive evidence at this time that these behaviors aresustained overtime. Warren Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service MEMORANDUM Date: November 16, 1993 From: Associate Administrator for AIDS HRSA Subject: CDC Report on the Public Health Impact of NeedleExchange Programs To: James Curran, M.D. Associate Director for HIV/AIDS, CDC We at HRSA have reviewed this very thorough report on needleexchange programs and concur with its major finding andrecommendations. We believe that needle exchange programsdefinitely have a place in what must necessarily be acomprehensive approach to the prevention of HIV infection amongdrug users. In addition, we were pleased that the report wentbeyond needle exchange programs per se to discuss the need forchanges in current prescription and paraphernalia laws at theState level. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to review thisexcellent report. G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H. Assistant Surgeon General Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service MEMORANDUM Date: December 2,, 1993 From: Associate Administrator for AIDS HRSA Subject: Draft Response on Needle Exchange To: James Curran, M.D., M.P.H. Associate Director for HIV/AIDS, CDC In general we think the CDC's draft response to Jo IveyBoufford, M.D. concerning the University of California report onneedle exchange programs did an excellent job of covering thesalient issues. We do have a number of specific comments, whichfollow: page 2, paragraph 2: We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that :"Substance abuse treatment programs also require substantialfunding increases in order to accommodate the needs ofindividuals who decide they want to enter treatment as a resultof their involvement in needle exchange and other outreachefforts to IDUs. page 7, first paragraph: We think it is important to mention the fact that needleexchange remains an issue of special concern issue amongAfrican-American and other minority politicians and communityleaders. Whether or not we think this concern is justified, weneed to acknowledge that it exists. page 8, last paragraph: We think it should be acknowledged that the degree to whichnew HIV infections are reduced is strongly affected by (1) the"penetration" of needle exchange in a particular cityand (2) the complexity of the drug-using populations and networkin particular communities (i.e., the number of, and kinds ofconnections between, drug injection networks). page 9, "Impact of Needle Exchange Programs on DrugUse": Again, we think it is crucial to acknowledge and discuss thefact that many African-American and other minority politiciansand community leaders fear that needle exchange programs condonedrug use and should be opposed on those grounds. The last paragraph in this section should provide morespecific data to address this concern. page 10, last paragraph: The fifth sentence should read, "Third, NEP clientsreport decreases in their HIV drug-risk behaviors." We disagree that the relationship between NEPs and HIVinfection may be impossible to study conclusively, particularlysince "conclusiveness" depends on the criteria beingused. This issue could be studied with several replications(different cities or neighborhoods) to obtain better data thannow exist on this point. page 11, last paragraph: We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that, "The CDCshould develop and foster the use of standardized data elements,methods of data collection, and protocols forevaluation/analysis." page 12 first paragraph: In the last sentence, we suggest adding the phrase,"using standardized methodologies." page 15, first paragraph: Again, we suggest adding to the last sentence's phrase aboutthe use of standardized data collection and evaluationmethodologies. We appreciate the opportunity to review this response. G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.

November 22, 1994 From: Assistant Director for Substance Abuse and HIVPrevention, Office of the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS To: Associate Director for HIV/AIDS Re: Request for Update on Needle Exchange Studies and LawsRelated to Needle and Syringe Sale and/or Possession 1. Background The following information is provided in response to therequest of Brian Biles, Office of the Assistant Secretary forHealth, for an update on (a) studies of needle exchange programs(NEPs) since the 1993 release of the University of California(UC) three-volume, 700 page report on NEPs[1] and (b) recentdevelopments related to laws related to NEPs and possessionsand/pr sale of syringes. 2. New York City NEP evaluation reported at 1994 APHAConference * At the 1994 American Public Health Association (APHA)Conference, Dr. Don Des Jarlais presented and estimate of anapproximate 50% reduction in rates of new HIV infections amonginjecting drug users (IDUs) using NEPs in New York City (NYC). * This estimate was based on several small follow-up studiesof HIV incidence among IDUs using NEPs compared to HIV incidenceamong IDUs in a vaccine preparedness cohort and cohort studies inmethadone maintenance.[2] A manuscript based the APHA oralpresentation is being prepared. Until this study is more fullydescribed, it is difficult to assess the basis for this estimateof NEP impacting NYC. However, although the numbers are small,the estimate is plausible. 3. Legal aspects of needle exchange, possession, and sale ofsyringes * In 1993 and 1994, three states (Maryland, Massachusetts, andRhode Island) enacted laws authorizing pilot NEPs; two states(Connecticut and Hawaii) enacted laws expanding existing NEPlegislation. * In September 1994, the Mayor and City Council o Los Angelesdeclared a "local state of emergency." The declarationwas based on "... finding that an emergency in connectionwith the AIDS epidemic and the transmission of HIV throughcontaminated needles does exist, and that this emergencythreatens to cause extraordinary loss of life."[3] Thisstate of emergency was used as a basis for authorizing supportfor "responsible" NEPs. * In 1993 and 1994, similar declarations of states ofemergency have been made in nine other California cities andcounties - Alameda, Berkeley, Marin, Oakland, Salinas, SanFrancisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and West Hollywood. * A major reason for NEPs is the existence of several lawsthat restrict the purchase, distribution, and possession ofsyringes. These laws include "prescription laws," underwhich a prescription is required to purchase syringes and"drug paraphernalia laws," which establish felonyand/or misdemeanor criminal penalties for the possession and/ordistribution of syringes for nonmedical purposes. About ninestates have prescription laws and more than 40 states have drugparaphernalia laws. In 1993, Maine repealed its prescription law. * In 1992, Connecticut partially repealed it drugparaphernalia and prescription laws. The new laws allow purchaseof as many as 10 syringes without a prescription and possessionof as many as 10 syringes without a medical condition. A CDC andConnecticut Health Department evaluation of the impact of thesenew laws found that IDUs reported substantially less multipersonuse ("sharing") of injection equipment. Also, after thechange in the laws, more than 80% of Connecticut pharmacies sellsyringes without a prescription and, for drug injectors, therewas a dramatic shift from "black market" sources ofsyringes to purchases in pharmacies[4]. 4. Limitations of bleach disinfection and recommendation touse sterile syringes Several studies published in a special section of the July1994 "Journal of AIDS" indicate that while bleachdisinfection can reduce the HIV transmission risk of IDU reuse ofsyringes, it is not as safe as using a new, sterile syringe. Thefollowing quotation summarizes the argument: We reiterate that IDUs who cannot stop injecting drugs shoulduse sterile needles and syringes; ideally only once and thensafely dispose of them. IDUs should be told never to re-useinjection equipment that had been previously used by someoneelse.... If one re-uses injection equipment, consistent andthorough cleaning of equipment with disinfectants, such asfull-strength household bleach for longer rather than shorterperiods of time, should decrease, but may not eliminate the HIVtransmission risk[5]. The following sections present additional information on NEPsthat has become available since the release of the UC report. 5. Decreases in HIV risk behaviors among NEP clients The following data from San Francisco and New York, citieswith high volume NEPs, indicate decreases in HIV risk behaviorsreported by NEP clients: * Decrease in needle-sharing rates associated with increaseduse of the NEP among street recruited San Francisco IDUs[6]. * Reduction in needle-sharing rates among IDUs attending NEPsin New York City[7]. * Reductions in the proportions of IDUs attending drugdetoxification programs in New York City who injected with a usesyringe and who lent used syringes to others, associated with theopening of NEPs in that city. 6. No evidence of an increase in drug use in San Francisco, acity with a high-volume NEP The San Francisco NEP opened in 1987. It is a now one of thehighest volume NEPs in the United States; 343,888 syringes wereexchanged during the Spring of 1992. The following data come fromrepeated surveys (from 1988 to 1992) of IDUs in San Francisco: * The median number of injections decreased from 1.9 per dayin the Fall of 1987 to 0.7 per day in the Spring of 1992.[6] * The mean age of IDUs in the repeated surveys in SanFrancisco increased from 36 years in the Spring of 1987 to 42years in the Spring of 1992[6]. * The proportion of San Francisco IDUs reporting that theyfirst injected drugs in the previous year decreased from 3.0% inthe Spring of 1989 to 1.1% in the Spring of 1992[6]. Taken together, the last two finding suggest that significantnumbers of persons have not begun injecting drugs in a city witha high-volume NEP. 7. Increase in estimated reduction of HIV incidence among IDUsusing the New Haven NEP Earlier estimates derived from mathematical models indicatedthat the rate of HIV infection among clients of the NEP in NewHaven, CT, was reduced by 33% by their use of the NEP. Updatedestimates from that model suggest that the reduction is more than40%[9]. 8. Lower incidence of hepatitis B and C among IDUs using theTacoma NEP A study of hepatitis B and C among IDUs in Tacoma, Washington,using multivariate analysis to adjust for the demographiccharacteristics of the IDUs found that, compared with nonusers ofthe NEP, IDUs who had ever used the Tacoma NEP were seven timesless likely to become infected with hepatitis B and eight timesless likely to become infected with hepatitis C[10]. This studydemonstrates more clearly than any previous research that use ofNEPs is associated with decreases in blood -borne infections. 9. Substantial entry in to drug treatment of New Haven NEPclients Between September 1992 and July 1993, 112 of 596 NEP clients(19%) in New Haven entered drug treatment. In addition, 205 IDUswho did not exchange syringes were referred to drug treatment bythe NEP[11]. 10. Substantial IDU utilization of high-volume NEPs One issue about NEPs is how much they will be used by IDUs.Studies from tow cities with high-volume NEPs, New York City andSan Francisco, indicate that substantial proportions of IDUssurveyed report use of the NEPs. * Des Jarlais reported data indicating that in 1993 nearlyhalf (46%) of IDUs surveyed in New York City had used an NEP[2]. * Surveys of IDUs in San Francisco in the Spring of 1992 foundthat 45% "usually" obtained their syringes from the SanFrancisco NEP[6]. 11. Increasing Number of NEPs in the United States The UC report found at least 37 active NEPs in the UnitedStates as of September 1993. As of October 1994, an estimated 70NEPs were in operation in the United States[12]. 12. Support from the general public for NEPs for AIDSprevention In the first national opinion poll on NEPs, a 1994 nationaltelephone survey of 1,001 people, the majority (55%) ofrespondents favored "Implementing needle exchange programsto reduce the spread of diseases such as AIDS."[13] 13. Support for federal funding of NEPs from the NationalAcademy of Sciences A study on AIDS behavioral research published in 1994 by theInstitute of Medicine, described NEPs as "highlypromising" and called for the lifting of the ban on the useof federal funds for NEP services. "The weight of evidencesuggests that needle exchange does more good than harm,"concluded the authors[14]. 14. High HIV seroconversion among Montreal IDUs The highest levels of HIV seroprevalence among IDUs in Canadahave been reported from Montreal. Bruneau reports from the St.Luc IDU cohort that among 850 IDUs recruited 1989-1993, the half(54%) reporting use of a Montreal NEP had higher HIVseroprevalence (18.2% vs. 5.6%) compared with nonattenders. Amongthe 507 IDUs with multiple visits to the study site, theseroconversion rate was higher (11.6 vs 3.5 per 100 person-years[p<0.0001]) among IDUs using NEP[15]. A study of incarcerated IDUs found that IDUs using a MontrealNEP reported higher rates of HIV risk behaviors (vs. IDUs who didnot use a NEP). Montreal NEP attenders were more likely thannon-attenders, to have same sex partners, to work in the sexindustry, to report injecting with needles used by anHIV-infected IDU, and re-use borrowed injection equipment withoutcleaning[16]. The higher HIV seroprevalence, HIV seroconversion, and HIVrisk factors among IDUs attending the Montreal NEP requirefurthers study. 15. Comments and conclusions Since the 1993 release of the UC report: * The number of U.S. NEPs has increased, and more states andlocalities have approved NEPs by legislation or declaration ofsates of emergency; * In communities with high-volume NEPs, substantialproportions of IDUs report using the NEP; * Biological evidence suggests decreases of bloodborne virustransmission among NEP clients, with the evidence stronger forhepatitis than HIV; * There is additional evidence that in most cities with NEPs,NEP clients have lower rates of HIV risk behaviors; and * Higher HIV seroconversion rates among IDUs using theMontreal NEP were documented and must be further investigated. Appendix IV Legal Barriers to Federal Funding of Needle Exchange Programs EXCERPTED FROM March 1993 report by General Accounting Office(GAO), titled "NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS -- Research SuggestsPromise as an AIDS Prevention Strategy. Since 1988, Congress has passed at least six laws (in additionto the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration(ADAMHA) Reorganization Act of 1992) that contain provisionsprohibiting or restricting use of federal funding for needleexchange programs and activities. These provisions are containedin: the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental HealthAmendments Act of 1988; the Health Omnibus Programs Extension of1988; the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of1990; and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services,and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of 1990,1991, and 1993 (the Appropriations Act of 1992 did not containsuch a provision). The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental HealthAmendments Act of 1988 required states, as a condition forreceiving ADAMHA block grant funds under title XIX of the PHSAct, to agree that funds would not be used to carry out anyprograms of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermicinjection of any illegal drug or distributing bleach for thepurpose of cleansing needles for such hypodermic injection...." This provision was repealed by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act(1992). The Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 authorizes fundsand programs aimed at combating the AIDS epidemic and preventingits transmission. Among other things, the act authorizes grantsand contracts through the Director of the National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases to assist public and nonprofitprivate entities in conducting research and training in advanceddiagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for AIDS. Thesegrants may be used to operate demonstration projects in long-termmonitoring and outpatient treatment of HIV-infected individuals.The act also authorizes funds for AIDS education. Additionally,the Director of the National Institutes of Health is to establishprojects to promote cooperation among public health agencies andwith private entities in research concerned with the diagnosis,prevention, and treatment of A[DS. The act provides further: None of the funds provided under this Act or an amendment madeby this Act shall be used to provide individuals with hypodermicneedles or syringes so that such individuals may use illegaldrugs, unless the Surgeon General of the Public Health Servicedetermines that a demonstration needle exchange program would beeffective in reducing drug abuse and the risk that the publicwill become infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immunedeficiency syndrome." The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act ofl990 (42 U.S.C. � 300ff et seq.) authorizes grants to localitiesdisproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The actprohibits use of funds made available under this Act, or anamendment made by this Act . . . to provide individuals withhypodermic needles or syringes so that such individuals may useillegal drugs." The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, andEducation, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of l990 and1991 contained identical prohibitions regarding needle exchangeprograms (section 520 of P.L. 101-166 and section 512 of P.L.101-517). The provision stated: None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used tocarry out any program of distributing sterile needles for thehypodermic injection of any illegal drug unless the President ofthe United States certifies that such programs are effective instopping the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use ofillegal drugs." In contrast, the Departments of Labor, Health and HumanServices, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Actof 1993, states in section 514 of the General Provisions": Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no fundsappropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out anyprogram of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermicinjection of any illegal drug unless the Surgeon General of theUnited States determines that such programs are effective inpreventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use ofillegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for suchpurposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorizedin the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P L. 102-321)."

JURITH, Staff Director ELLioTT A. BROWN, Minority Staff Director (11) Introduction The Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control held a 2day hearing in the 2d session of the 100th Congress to examine the legalization of all illicit narcotics. These informational hearings, entitled "Legalization of Illicit Drugs: Impact and Feasibility," were held in response to public debate that began in early 1988, after the mayor of Baltimore told a Washington, DC meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors that existing U.S. drug policy had failed. The mayor suggested legalization and decriminalization as possible approaches to solving the problem. The hearings were designed to consider the seriousness of a variety of legalization proposals that had been offered by drug policy observers who, after the Baltimore mayor's call for a look at legalization, stepped up their own criticisms of U.S. antidrug policy. In effect, they pronounced the symbolic war on drugs lost. Now that the hearings have been completed, and testimony has been studied and restudied, the committee, led by Chairman Charles B. Rangel and Ranking Member Benjamin Gilman, has produced a list of findings resulting from the many hours of testimony. The findings are not for any specific legislative purpose. Instead, they are intended solely as an advisory to any Members of the U.S. Congress and the public as to what the committee believes was established by the proceedings. How the Hearings Evolved In the spring of 1988, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke was speaking to his colleagues at the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual meeting on crime and drugs. During the speech, Mayor Schmoke surprised the gathering when he suggested that elected officials should consider the legalization or the decriminalization of illicit drugs in response to America's escalating drug crisis. In his speech, Mayor Schmoke criticized America's current antidrug approach as a wasteful proposition bent too far toward law enforcement and not far enough toward treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. Recalling his days as a prosecuting attorney, Mayor Schmoke cited what he viewed as the miniscule impact of arrests and convictions of drug traffickers and drug users on the overall drug problem. Schmoke's comments were the proverbial "shots heardaround the world," as few, if any, public officials had treaded into such politically explosive waters before on the sensitive narcotics issue. Select Committee Chairman Rangel (D-NY) responded almost immediately to Mayor Schmoke's legalization calls. Chairman Rangel decried the notion as stemming from frustration and exhasperation with the Nation's mushrooming drug crisis. Chairman Rangel contended in interviews and opinion articles that legalization would be a tactical error in the war on drugs that would quite possibly lead to a nation full of drug addicts. Throughout the ensuing months after the hearing was announced, people on both sides of the issue began tangling publicly over the question. An informal national debate had begun, and many looked toward the hearings scheduled by Chairman Rangel as a final commentary on the subject at least for the time being. in calling for the hearings, Chairman Rangel expressed a desire to get to the heart of suggestions being proposed by legalization proponents. Although pro-legalization advocates claimed they were simply calling for a debate on the issue, Chairman Rangel impressed upon them that they should come forward with specific plans and proposals, rather than just debate the subject. Chairman Rangel made a special plea with public officials suggesting legalization or decriminalization to come forward with specifics to satisfy the burden of their responsibility to the American public. Throughout the debate, Chairman Rangel asked legalization advocates a series of questions in order that they might clarify their positions. Among them: (1) has anybody ever considered which narcotic and psychotropic drugs might be legalized? (2) would we allow all drugs to become legally sold and used, or would we select the most abused few, such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana? (3) who would administer the dosages-the State or the individual? (4) what quantity of drugs would each individual be allowed to get? (5) what about addicts, would we not have to give them more in order to satisfy their craving, or would we give them enough just to whet their appetites? (6) what do we do about those who are experimenting? Do we sell them drugs, too, and encourage them to pick up the habit? (7) furthermore, will the government establish tax- supported facilities to sell these drugs? (8) would we get the supply from the same foreign countries that support our habit now, or would we create our own internal sources? (9) would there be an age limit on purchases, as is the case with alcohol? (10) how many people are projected to become addicts as a result of legalization? (11) what about pilots, railroad engineers, surgeons, police, cross-country truckers and nuclear plant employees who want to use marijuana and cocaine during off-duty hours? (12) what about crack cocaine as a legalized drug? Would we want to legalize something as harmful and as destructive to our youth as this? Legalization: A Recurring Theme The legalization debate seems to rise to the surface when the drug crisis reaches alarming levels, as it has recently. The drug issue eventually moved to the top of the list of Americans' concerns during 1988, given the spate of news stories on the growing influence of the narcotics trade in everyday lives. Throughout the year, there were revelations from the Select Committee on Narcotics and other congressional committees about the suspected involvement of some foreign leaders in the drug trade. Americans were also bombarded by reports of the increased prevalence of deadly, addictive crack cocaine; growing gang involvement in the narcotics trade; a tripling of cocaine imports to the United States in the 1980's; a significant rise in drug- related violence sparked by tension between warring traffickers and by street dealers bent on attention- getting retaliatory tactics. At the time of the hearing, one major news poll revealed that the American public was more concerned about the crisis of illegal drugs than about any other issue- including the budget deficit. The ABC News polling data also indicated that Americans were wary of legalization, Nine out of ten opposed legalizing all drugs and about 50 percent of the respondents feared drug use would rise under legalization. In a Gallup survey released 2 months prior to the hearing, about 75 percent of those surveyed were opposed and nearly 70 percent felt that legalization would aggravate the Nation's drug problem. Through the years, advocates of legalization have favored an end to existing drug laws, often using the end of Prohibition in the 1930's and the end of organized crime's involvement in the illegal liquor trade as an example in making their case. Chairman Rangel, on the other hand, asked of legalization advocates in 1988: What drugs would we legalize? Who would manufacture and distribute them? In what neighborhoods would they be sold and marketed? Would crack cocaine be legalized in a legalization scheme? Would there be age and quantity limits on purchases? How much would we give addicts, enough to satisfy their craving? Other opponents of the legalization theory suggested that in addition to a potential meteoric rise in addictions, there is no guarantee that the black market for drugs would close down, especially if restrictions are placed on purchase quantity and on the quality of various narcotic substances. Overview of the Proceedings Thursday and Friday, September 29 and 30, 1988, were 2 significant days in the 100th Congress regarding the drug issue. In those 2 days, a total of 34 witnesses representing Congress, law enforcement, government, academia, and various drug-related interest groups testified before the Select Committee on Narcotics on legalization. By the time the hearing commenced, the legalization issue had gained such national exposure that the proceedings were carried live over public television and public radio, and was covered by a large contingent of print media. At this point and time in 1988, legalization was a very important topic to many Americans concerned about the worsening drug crisis. In addition to the announced lineup of witnesses, several Members of Congress who do not serve on the Select Committee on Narcotics offered testimony on the subject. Representative Carroll Hubbard (D-KY) and Representative Roy Dyson (D-MD) both told the panel that the Nation's drug crisis had become more than just a problem in urban America. In rural areas served by both those Members, there has been a noticeable increase in narcotics-related problems. Representative Benjamin Cardin (D-MD) warned about the confused messages that would be sent to the youth if drugs were legalized. Representative Kwesi Mfume (D-MD) also outlined his opposition, but said that more attention should be given to demand reduction. Following is a summary of the statement of each witness. The summary is intended to capture the essence of what the witness presented to the panel in his or her opening statement, and is not a verbatim translation of the actual testimony. Findings 1. The ideas and recommendations of pro-legalization forces remain varied and wide ranging. There is no commonly agreed upon approach that should be taken to legalize illicit narcotics. 2. The American public remains largely opposed to the notion of legalizing illicit drugs. 3. There is no data to support the theory that legalizing illicit drugs would result in less crime, more affordable narcotics or decreased drug experimentation, abuse or addiction. 4. There is no agreement on the types of currently illicit drugs that should be considered for legalization. 5. No definitive information exists that would show how America's youth would be affected by legalization, whether positively or negatively. 6. There should be a stepped up effort to look at the expansion of treatment and rehabilitation resources around the country. 7. The Federal war on drugs must devote more resources to curbing drug trafficking and abuse in major U.S. cities. 8. Narcotics law enforcement efforts need to be improved, especially in major U.S. cities) 9. Training for the staff of drug abuse treatment centers needs to be expanded and improved. 10. Federal drug abuse policies need more input from residents of major American cities and not just from governmental leaders,police chiefs, and substance abuse professionals. 11. The burden of proof regarding the benefits of drug legalization must be placed on the advocates of such a policy. Until the proponents of drug legalization can demonstrate that the benefits of such a policy outweigh the risks to health and drug-related violeiiee, drug legalization should be rejected. 12. American schools should continue to convey the message that drug abuse is against the law, harmful to health, and a detriment to optimal academic performance. 13. Employee assistance programs [EAP's] in government and industry must be strengthened to help employees and their families deal effectively with drug abuse, 14. We have not yet begun to fight the war. Consequently, legalization should not be considered an alternative. Summary of Statements by Members of Congress CHAIRMAN CHARLES B. RANGEL (D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROT. Legalization has been widely discussed in academic settings, and on radio and TV talk shows. But this is the first time in a long time the issue has made its way to the Congress. Most of those who have been advocating legalization have been calling for either a debate, a discussion or a consideration. But after an advance reading of some of the testimony, it does not appear that any of the witnesses are truly'advocating legalization. Some are saying legalization ought to be discussed because the war on drugs is being lost with law enforcement. But the Nation has yet to declare a real war on drugs. For 8 years, the Congress has met resistance to antidrug efforts. The Reagan administration has shied away from providing funds to State and local governments so that they can fight the war on drugs. How can we say we have a war on drugs when a total of 2,800 DEA men and women are dedicated to fighting the war on drugs at the Federal level? Some legalization proponents are calling for a greater educational and rehabilitative commitment, but we do not even have a single federally run rehabilitation program. Some say we must do more with drug education, but so far we have only had slogans like "Just Say No" and"Zero Tolerance." No opium or coca leaves are grown in this country, yet the Secretary of State never utters his contempt for the nations where these poisons are grown. Legalization proponents must be prepared to discuss their ideas and recommendations in detail. HON. LAWRENCE COUGHLIN (R-PA), RANKING MINORITY MEMBER, SELECT COMMITTEE: ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL Having a hearing on legalization could send a wrong message to America's young people that drugs are OK. Having a discussion could be a copout in the war on drugs. The hope is that the hearing will not be interpreted as an indication that legalization is being suggested. To quote the attorney general of Pennsylvania, Leroy Zimmerman, "In Philadelphia, over 50 percent of thechild abuse fatalities involved parents who heavily used cocaine. Cheaper, legal cocaine would result in more children dying and more babies being born addicted." HoN. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN (R-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL Drug kingpins are Continuing to cash in on America's insatiable appetite for illicit drugs. These multinational criminal syndicates have built evil empires from the drug trade. The power of the drug trade threatens the authority of governments worldwide. Colombia, for example, is virtually under siege from the traffickers, When the narcotics trade recently offered the Colombian people the money to pay off the nation's foreign debt, the people refused, resisting the financial temptation and opting to take the moral high ground. Those calling for legalization in America are seeking to compromise the same values and morals that remain at stake in Colombia. They are looking to cut a deal with the drug trade. Legalization would not put an end to the international cartels, who would figure out ways to adapt and penetrate the U.S. market. It would not end drug-related crime, as many addicts on the street would continue to commit criminal acts because of impaired judgment and instability from illicit drug use. It is hoped that fresh, new ideas will emerge from the hearings that will make the Nation more effective in the war on drugs. HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK (D-CA), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL In New York and Oakland, only about 10 percent of the cocaine and heroin addicts are able to be treated for their addictions. In both cities, people seeking drug treatment are required to wait at least 6 months for treatment. Drug-related crime has skyrocketed as a result of a lack of treatment slots. Legalization is not the answer. We must find a way to treat the drug abuser. I am introducing a bill to provide treatment for addicts seeking help. The bill would be financed through the Social Security Programs' disability insurance provisions and utilize a Medicare-like payment principal for outpatient and inpatient services. HoN. JAMES H. SCHEUER(D-NY), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL The ultimate copout in the war on drugs is to stand pat with the current ineffective drug control policy. Pumping more resources into a transparently failed system would be an admission of defeat in the war on drugs. Our system has totally failed. If seizures, arrests, and convictions are going up, then so is violence and addiction. We must end the preoccupation with the criminal justice aspect of the problem and focus more on education and treatment. A new system and a new strategy would involve changing people's behavior. We have successfully changed attitudes and behavior on alcohol and tobacco consumption. The question is, How do we reduce the demand for drugs? We need to examine the costs and benefits of police crackdowns. We have to address a broad spectrum of options and put substantially more resources into those programs that really work. HON. CARDISS COLLINS (D-IL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL Drugs have been a problem for many years. It is one of the greatest public evils in the United States. The present administration has demonstrated a profound lack of understanding on the drug issue. The First Lady has told us to "Just Say No," while the Presidenthas said no to an effective policy to rapidly eradicate drug crops from society. It seems incontrovertible that the immediate effect of legalization would be rampant drug use. This would occur for at least a short period, as the lion that has been held captive for many years would be let out of the den. Even if legalization were to have the desired effect, it would not work until the lion became accustomed to the new liberties. That could be a very long time, and the Nation could not afford to wait. Legalization could lead to a legal and constitutional quagmire, in which the newly legal rights of individuals must be merged with the obligation to protect society. HON. DANIEL K. AKAKA (D-HI), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL The issue is not whether we ought to sanction the use of drugs, but whether legalization can break the stranglehold that drugs have had on our communities. We have contended that drugs affect all of us, not just users and pushers. That has never been more apparent than it is today. HON. FRANK J. GUARINI (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL Legalization is not the cure for the Nation's drug problems. It is the wrong policy, and it sends the wrong signal. It sends the signal to the drug lords that the Nation has lost, and they have won. It tells America's youth that the U.S. Government says yes to drugs. People should be motivated so that they don't need drugs. They need to be given something to believe in. A sense of purpose and a spirit of idealism need to be renewed in America. Hope and dreams should replace despair and hunger. There should be a dialog on the issue, as it may in the long run contribute to bringing an end to the drug crisis. HoN. DANTE B. FASCELL (D-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL The fight against drugs must focus on interdiction, education, and rehabilitation. We just passed an oninibus drug bill in the House, but no matter how vigorously we attack the problem, we must key on reducing demand. The issue should be discussed, and all views should get a fair hearing. But legalization and decriminalization are not the solutions to the drug problem. A clear connection has been established between crime and drugs. While many individuals commit crimes to get drugs, others who commit crimes are found to have used illicit drugs just prior to the commission of the crime. Legalization will compound the situation because drugs will be easier to obtain. It sends a misguided and contradictory signal. If drugs were legalized, how would we be able to tell our kids to stay off drugs? How can we urge other countries to work with us in interdiction and eradication efforts? We must increase aid to State and local law agencies. Efforts must be concentrated on interdiction, demand reduction, and on rehabilitation and education. HON. WILLIAM J. HUGHES (D-NJ), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL I am very much opposed to legalization. This view comes after reflecting on 24 years as either a prosecutor or a Member of Congress. Where in the entire world has legalization worked? Witnesses would do well to indicate this to the committee in testimony. Also, indicate to the committee how the profits are going to be removed from the drug trade under legalization. The black market will not be eliminated. Policies of recent years are workable if they are followed with the proper commitment. To date, the commitment has not been made in terms of effort and resources. The Nation's strategy is good. Many of the provisions in the omnibus drug bill advance us in the right direction. Once the Nation gets serious about the problem, we will begin to turn the corner. HoN. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ (D-TX), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL Drugs take away the God-given gift of human potential that we all have. Illegal drugs are damaging our children, our communities and our Nation as a whole. None of this would change under legalization. The question of legalization is not one of economics or money or the black market. The position of those who advocate legalization is recognized. But when reasonable people discuss unreasonable proposals, it is a sad commentary on the impact that illegal drugs have had on society. HoN. KWEISI MFUMF (D-MD), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL I am extremely opposed to the concept of legalization. However, it is important that the debate take place. Both sides in the debate agree on one thing: Illicit drugs are tearing our Nation apart. It is estimated that some 23 million Americans use illicit drugs once monthly. A total of 6 million of these people use cocaine. Young people in the United States use illicit drugs more than their counterparts in any other nation of the world. Proponents argue that legalization would remove the profit motive. That may very well be, but drug use is driven by demand and that's where more attention needs to be focused nationally. History shows that drugs made legal for adult consumption cannot be kept out of the hands of children. Under legalization, more children and young people would experiment with drugs, as is the case with alcohol. It has been estimated that about 75 percent of all drug users become addicted. Proponents often point to England and Holland as models for a legalization proposal. But the concept has not worked in either of those two countries. The policy of legalized heroin had to be discontinued in England as the number of heroin users increased and the black market continued to thrive. In Amsterdam, Holland, where marijuana is legal, crime and hard drug use remains a problem. An additional consideration is the threat of babies born to drugaddicted mothers. That probably would be exacerbated under legalization. So would other problems, such as car and train accidents and corruption. The U.S. focus on eliminating the drug problem should expand beyond the one-dimensional effort to stop the supply. More focus should be placed on demand reduction, specifically treatment and rehabilitation. If the United States is fighting a war on drugs, the battlefields are not in Colombia and Bolivia, but rather in our schools and our communities. HON. MICHAEL OXLEY (R-OH), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL The idea of legalization should not even be dignified with a 2-day hearing by the committee. Consideration of the notion of legalization sends a bad message to the rest of the Nation and to the rest of the world. America's teenagers who may be considering experimenting with drugs may see that legalization is being considered and think that it is now OK to use drugs. Legalization is unacceptable in a civilized society. My hope for an outcome to the hearings is that the book on legalization will be closed once and for all. HON. Tom LEWIS (R-FL), SELECT COMMITTEE ON NARCOTICS ABUSE AND CONTROL It is contradictory that those committed to fighting drugs have agreed to give a hearing to the legalization issue. Making drugs more affordable and more available could be detrimental to society. Particularly objectionable is the view of legalization advocates that the government itself can make a profit from the drug trade. Legalizing drug profits and making dealers out of the government and private citizens is appalling. HON. CARROLL HUBBARD, JR. (D-KY) The urban drug problem is well known. But the war on drugs needs to be fought in rural America, as well. The drug problem is acute and serious in outlying areas. In my own congressional district, in western Kentucky, the U.S. Customs Service is aware of the severity of the drug problem. They and the Drug Enforcement Administration know of contraband-carrying flights from Colombia and Mexico that arrive at our rural airports. These small airports are safer for drug dealers than flying into places like New Orleans and Miami. I hope that the Congress will be able to lead the public and our government away from legalization. I hope that those who are proposing legalization would realize that more people would experiment with drugs under Such a plan. In my district, even the schools are not immune to the drug trade. At a grand jury hearing last December in Bowling Green, I testified that there were individuals selling drugs to Western Kentucky University students. My wife and I received death threats as a result of my testimony, in which names were revealed. Like others, I wonder what we can do to increase education about drug abuse, and move as a nation toward a spiritual, rather than chemical, dependence. HON. ROBERT GARCIA (D-NY) Legalization poses dangerous repercussions for the Nation. It cannot be risked. It could not be sustained. The legalization proposal comes at a time when public opinion toward drug abuse is beginning to take a turn for the positive, and after the House has just passed major antidrug legislation to improve on the 1986 antidrug bill. Given the problems we continue to experience with tobacco and alcohol, the risks of legalization are just too great. The biggest concern about legalization is the effect that it would have on America's youth. Legalization would result in the widespread use of drugs, especially among youth. The greatest impact would be felt in minority communities and in the inner city. As long as there are drug users who cannot afford drugs legally, there will be a black market. Unless we legalize all drugs-including crack, PCP, LSD-and unless we make them universally available, there will be crime. Legalization fails to take into account whether special restrictions would have to be placed on pilots, law officers, truck drivers and others in hazardous occupations. It also fails to consider the spread of AIDS through intravenous drug use. HON. Roy DYSON (D-MD) Legalization is a foolhardy and reckless proposal that would have a negative impact on the family. The drug problem has filtered down to rural America. In one of the counties located in my district, the number of drug offenses rose 114 percent from 1986 to 1987. Activists like Timothy Leary, Alan Ginsberg and Jerry Rubin 20 years ago advocated that drug use was okay and should be accepted as a form of escapism from the rough times of the real world. But over the past 20 years, we have seen the personal and financial ruin that drug use brings about. Under legalization, America would become enslaved to drugs. Decriminalization is simply a backdoor way of legalizing narcotics. Legalization would send a bad message. It would increase drug use and addiction. It would result in the expenditure of billions of additional dollars in health care costs and in lost productivity. We must begin teaching our children at an early age about the dangers of harmful drugs. Though education must play a vital role in our antidrug efforts, we must still initiate stiff sanctions against those who grow, use and sell illicit narcotics. HoN. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN (D-MD) In a survey of my Third Congressional District (portions of Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County), 69 percent of the respondents oppose legalization and decriminalization. A war on drugs cannot be won unless the profit is taken out of the drug trade. But decriminalization is not the way to accomplish that. Constituents are saying that our discussions on the national drug debate should also take into account the damage from other harmful substances, such as alcohol and cigarettes. More money should be focused on establishing effective treatment and education programs if a real war on drugs is going to be waged. What is needed is a comprehensive approach combining foreign and domestic policy sensitive to the urgency of interdiction efforts, stricter enforcement, more resources to educate our youth to the dangers of drugs and treatment programs without waiting lists. Summary of Testimony From Thursday, September 29, 1988 MAYOR KURT L, SCHMOKE, BALTIMORE America needs to reexamine its current drug policy. The Nation is spending about $10 billion annually to enforce drug laws that are catching only a fraction of the violators. The drug problem in America is defined in two components: addiction and crime. Law enforcement is unable to resolve either of these two problems and actually has worsened the crime problem. The black market is a result of the manufacture and sale of cocaine being criminalized and profits from drug sale-, are enormous because the substances cannot be obtained legally. Nationwide, there were 750,000 drug arrests in 1987 and Baltimore had 12,000 drug arrests, yet both represent only a fraction of the drug violators. Prisons and jails are packed with drug offenders, One-third of all Federal prisoners are incarcerated on drug offenses. Cigarettes kill hundreds of thousands, but no move has been made to make them illegal. Antismoking campaigns and other Neither PCP nor LSD should be legalized. But a maintenance system involving designated hospitals should be implemented for cocaine and heroin abusers, with the opportunity for abusers to enroll in a treatment program aimed at reducing the intake of either of these drugs down to zero. MAYOR EDWARD I. KOCH OF NEW YORK CITY Mayor Schmoke's proposal to maintain heroin and cocaine addicts is not new. The concept has been tried in Great Britain, and it has failed. Addiction and crime both rose as a result of doctorprescribed drug maintenance in that country. Legally received cocaine could be turned into the derivative crack by mixing in baking soda or some other base in the heating process. This would be a surreptitious way for crack addicts to obtain their fix if cocaine and heroin were legalized and prescribed. Organized crime still, would play a role in drug production and distribution for those who are either underage or cannot get the amount and quality they desire. In Great Britain, 84 percent of the government-registered addicts during that country's heroin maintenance program were discovered to be using other drugs illicitly. With a population of 240 million people and about 6 million regular drug users in that group, drugs still remain unacceptable and drug users remain a sizable minority in the Nation. If legalization were to go into effect, there would be a gradual acceptability that would lead to an increase in users. There is little distinction between decriminalization and legalization, and both are bad ideas that should be opposed. MAYOR DENNIS CALLAHAN OF ANNAPOLIS, MD The most compelling argument for not supporting the notion of legalization comes from the problems our society currently experiences with alcohol. According to the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, alcohol abuse costs America about $117 billion annually in medical, property, productivity and other losses. Of this amount, only about $2,5 billion related to law enforcement costs while the rest concerned accidents and other problems associated with the abuse of alcohol. Even marijuana should not be legalized. Advocates for legalizing only this drug claim an overdose of it would only put the user to sleep, but they could be asleep while at the controls of a locomotive or another vehicle. In Alaska, marijuana can be grown legally on private plots and it can be consumed on the premises. A survey of 250,000 high school students done by the Atlanta-based organization, Parents' Resource Institute, indicates that about one in five of those surveyed admitted to smoking marijuana. About one in two of those surveyed in Alaska admitted to smoking marijuana. It appears that the sanctioning of marijuana use has contributed significantly to the much higher usage figure in this State compared to the rest of the Nation. HoN. JACK LAWN, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION Drugs are not bad because they are illegal. Instead, drugs are illegal because they are bad, and legalization advocates are missing the point in blaming drug laws for the crime and violence that has resulted from the Nation's drug crisis. The problems that we continue to experience with legalized alcohol use provide strong evidence that legalization would be a bad idea. Greater availability results in greater use and greater abuse. The National Council on Alcoholism reports that one of every three American adults contends that alcohol has brought them family trouble. About 100,000 10- and 11- year-olds reported getting drunk once weekly in 1985, and about 100,000 deaths a year in the United States can be attributed to alcoholism. Of that number, 23,000 are killed on highways and cirrhosis of the liver is the sixthleading cause of death in America. The United States is signatory to the Single Convention on Drugs of 1961, and to the Convention of Psychotropic Drugs of 1971. Both these treaties require the country to establish and maintain effective controls on illicit substances. The sanctity of these treaties and U.S. credibility in the international right against drug abuse would be severely damaged if these substances were legalized. Legalization would adversely affect.young people and the crime rate. The American public has said in recent opinion polls that it opposes legalization. Legalization is a simple answer to a complex problem. The answer in fighting the drug crisis comes from focusing more on demand reduction efforts. ARTHUR C. "CAPPY" EADS, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,NATIONAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, 27TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, BELTON, TX The whole notion of legalizing drugs ignores the reason why drugs were made illegal in the first place. They are bad for the user, the community and society as a whole. Drug use often translates into child neglect and abuse, runaways, molestation and other crimes and maladies that result from individuals being under the influence of drugs. It is wrong to assume that funding for enforcement versus funding for treatment and rehabilitation are distinctly different, and that they are competing categories, as both areas must be adequately funded for an effective antidrug strategy. Effective treatment programs are essential in sentencing drug offenders, while sanctions against drug use are critical components of a treatment and prevention strategy. We have yet to implement in the United States, a full- scale attack on the drug problem combining law enforcement, treatment and prevention efforts into an effective strategy. HON. STERLING JOHNSON, JR., SPECIAL NARCOTICS PROSECUTOR, NEW YORK CITY Calls for legalization are borne from frustration with an inadequate response from the executive branch of the government. Unfortunately, not one single piece of antidrug legislation has come from the executive branch of the government. The only major antidrug legislation has come from Congress. It is improbable that heroin addicts could be maintained, as Mayor Schmoke contends. If an addict's habit is maintained at a certain level, over time the level of that addict's habit will rise. The black market would remain in existence under legalization. Further, the matter of whether doctors, pilots and other people in sensitive occupations would be allowed to use legal drugs must be examined closely. Legalized drugs will not stop crime, and the experience with prescribed heroin in Great Britain provides evidence that a downward trend in crime is not necessarily the case of lessened restrictions on drug use. Finally, the concept of free needles, which is supported by Mayor Schmoke and also New York Citv Mayor Koch, is a bad idea. It sends out erroneous signals that conflict with any and all efforts to put an end to the use of harmful illicit drugs. JERALD VAUGHN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE The IACP represents more than 15,000 top-level law enforcement executives in the United States. The group is unequivocally opposed to drug legalization. Overcrowded jails and prisons and loaded court dockets indicate success, rather than failure, of law enforcement in the battle against illicit drugs. Money is not being wasted on law enforcement, as only 3 percent of all expenditures at the Federal, State and local level involve the civil and criminal justice system. A total of 1.4 percent of Government spending goes toward the provision of law enforcement services, and less than 1 percent of the Federal budget is earmarked for law enforcement. Less than 500,000 law enforcement officers are assigned to protect more than 245 million American citizens, and the lead antidrug agency has just 3,000 officers. The IACP, in conjunction with the Justice Department, the Bureau of Justice Assistance and DEA, called together law enforcement authorities from all levels for five drug strategy sessions in 1987. A major finding from those sessions was that crime could be reduced through cooperative community strategies. This information was produced in manual form. The United States has seen fit to protect Americans from substances that may be harmful through the regulation of the sale and distribution of these products. There has lieen little complaint about the infringement on individual rights in the process. It is understood that these products-meats, milk, prescription drugs, serums and vaccines-are regulated because the manufacturer alone cannot be depended upon to put the interests of the consumer ahead of the interests of profit. Legalization is not a realistic option. At best, it is a last resort when all else has truly failed. WILLIAM CHAMBLISS, PH.D., PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY The drug trade was estimated at about $1 billion a year 50 years ago in 1938. Today, it is valued at somewhere around $130 billion, which is larger than the gross national product of most nations in the world and many multinational corporations, Drug profits remain essential to the survival of organized crime. Churning out these profits and protecting them involves engendering corruption of law enforcement authorities, and this remains an ongoing goal of organized crime, which remains a hazard of trying to stop the flow and use of drugs by criminalizing it. Because of the level of poverty and other factors, it is impossible to expect a complete end to the drug trade even if police were able to arrest each and every drug pusher tomorrow. The costs of enforcing drug laws outweighs the benefits, A new drug policy should first take into account that marijuana should be considered separately from such substances as cocaine and heroin. States that have decriminalized marijuana have had positive experiences as a result. Although the experiment with prescribed heroin in Great Britain has not been totally successful, it is more successful than what the United States has experienced with criminalized heroin. Both heroin and cocaine should be legalized and dispensed by medical professionals. DR. CHARLES R. SCHUSTER, PH.D., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE NIDA is strongly opposed to the legalization of illicit narcotics. First, there are a series of questions-including the many posed by Chairman Rangel-that must be answered before we can even begin to consider something as complicated as legalization. For example, the pharmacological effects of cocaine differ so that it is impossible to consider how much would be considered enough, or a legal limit. Second, there appears to be an attitude readjustment occurring regarding drug abuse. According to the latest national high school survey on drug abuse, drugs are being seen by this group as more dangerous and there is a reporting of more self-abstention from illicit drug use than in other recent high school surveys. In the 1980 survey, 11 percent of the respondents reported daily marijuana use. The 1986-87 survey indicated that figure had dropped to 3.3 percent. As attitudes among adults and teenagers change, so will behavior. What is also needed are more good treatment programs, since we know that effective treatment works. DR. ARNOLD TREBACH, PH.D., FOUNDER, DRUG POLICY INSTITUTE America would be better off if all drug laws were removed today. Americans are at their best when they negotiate settlements, and at their worst when arguments are pushed to the wall. It is absolutely essential that we remove laws restricting use of marijuana and heroin for medicinal purposes. It is also important to begin viewing drug addicts from a different perspective. We should be more concerned about getting them treatment rather than branding them criminals. This would include some form of maintenance, which is admittedly controversial. There should be limited experimentation with recreational drugs. The 1973 Nixon Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse as well as the 1982 report of the National Academy of Sciences suggest an attempt at limited decriminalization or legalization. ADM. JAMES WATKINS, U.S. NAVV (RET.), CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT'S AIDS COMMISSION An emerging problem stemming from rampant drug abuse is that of AIDS. One of the conduits of the deadly HIV virus that leads to AIDS is contact with an individual who is an abuser of drugs intravenously. The IV drug abusers make up only 25 percent of all AIDS victims, but about 70 percent of heterosexual native citizens have contracted the disease from contact with an intravenous drug abuser. About 70 percent of perinatal AIDS cases involve a parent who is either an IV drug abuser or who has a sexual partner who abuses drugs intravenously. More treatment is needed for IV drug abusers. There are some 1.2 million IV drug abusers in the United States, but only about 148,000 are in some form of treatment at any given time. What is needed is a full-scale effort that addresses both supply and demand. During its time as functioning body, the President's AIDS Commission heard testimony regarding the use of needle exchange programs. The overriding opinion of many black leaders who testified at an inquiry held in New York City is that IV drug abuse is killing the black community. However, these same leaders were opposed to needle exchange programs, and view them as a copout answer to a very serious problem. They are considered the first step to full-fledged legalization. The most important thing that can be done to lick the drug problem is to help young people avoid using drugs in the first place. DR. TOD MIKURIYA, M.D., PSYCHIATRIST, BERKELEY, CA It is good to see an increase in public awareness about the dangers of alcohol and tobacco and about the increasing tendency to classify them as drugs of abuse. While we focus heavily on the problems of drugs like cocaine and crack, very little attention has been paid to the problems caused by poisoning from alcohol and tobacco. We need to move closer to acceptance of these substances as dangerous drugs. A comprehensive proposal regarding drug use in America would encompass the following six points: (1) The removal of product liability exemptions for alcohol. (2) The removal of price supports for tobacco. (3) The establishment of a drug users' cooperative. (4) The legalization of home cultivation of cannabis. (5) The disallowance of searches of citizens' homes without a warrant. (6) A testing of those who test others for drug use. JOHN GUSTAFSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NEW YORK DIVISION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES Our agency oversees about 400 local treatment and prevention programs, with a capacity to treat 46,000 people and to provide counseling services to another 17,000. About 22 percent of New York's population has abused some type of substance within the last 6 months. Half of this number abuses drugs on a regular basis. More than 600,000 people art- considered non-narcotic substance abusers and about 260,000 are narcotics addicts. The social and health consequences of legalization would be too great. Legalization advocates are ignoring the seductive properties of drugs like cocaine, which laboratory tests show leave the user craving for more. While alcohol Prohibition may have been a law enforcement failure, it was a success healthwise. During the 1920's, alcohol-related mental illness declined significantly, but shot back up after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. From 1917 until 1921, New York State made narcotics available through clinics. But that practice was discontinued after it was discovered that many people were supplementing their legal supply with drugs purchased from the black market. This is a lesson for those considering legalization today. We cannot overlook the impact that legalization would have on health and health care systems. Many illicit drugs lead to chronic health problems for users, and this problem would be pronounced under legalization. STEVEN WISOTSKY, PROFESSOR OF LAW, NOVA UNIVERSITY An independent national commission should be set up to take a fresh look at U.S. drug policy. Such a commission should have two fundamental goals: To reduce drug abuse, and to reduce the social problems stemming from the existence of the black market illicit drug trade. A clear definition should be reached and agreed upon in terms of what "the drug problem" in America is. Isit drug use in general? Is it drug use by children and teenagers? Is it drug use that proves to be injurious to others or to the drug users themselves? Is it the black market and the events associated with that market in terms of crime and violence? Detailed studies and polls should be conducted to determine how drugs should be legalized. This should be along the lines of marketing surveys done to prepare for the sale and distribution of other products. For example, focus groups can be set up, and groups of individuals-such as prison volunteers serving life sentences-can be used for tracking the effects of certain drugs and also for gauging the addictive qualities of narcotics. Among the priorities of drug control should be the protection of children, the protection of the safety and health of the public and the preservation of individual liberties in the process. The real moral high ground in finding a Solution to the drug crisis is one that will allow responsible, competent adults to have the freedom of choice so long as they do not intrude on the rights and privileges of others. No drug control policy should affront the Constitution. DR. MITCHELL ROSENTHAL, M.D., PRESIDENT, PHOENIX HOUSE, NEW YORK, NY Drug legalization would increase drug use and would further aggravate all the destabilizing influences that plague societv today. Addiction to illicit drugs has an enormous impact on the character, behavior and values of the abuser. While just as many cigarette smokers have become dependent on that product, the number of cocaine users, the power of cocaine addiction and the amounts that addicts would use if it were readily available and less expensive is ignored by those pushing legalization. Illicit drug use rapidly diminishes one's ability to lead a normal, productive life. Drug abuse causes self- destructive behavior, lowering the self-esteem and creating the potential for violent, antisocial behavior. Projections that drug use would double or even triple under legalization should be taken seriously. The greatest increase would come from those between the ages of 12 and 21 years old. Projections of drug-related deaths post-legalization range from 100,000 to 500,000. The social order will suffer. Drug users are generally irresponsible people whose deviant behavior ranges from destroying relationships to inability to lead productive work lives to crime. All of these possibilities will be raised with legalized drugs. We can realistically expect to overcome the drug crisis with a shifting public attitude and a stronger effort to enforce drug laws on the street. ETHAN NADELMANN, PH.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY Neither legalization nor decriminalization should be considered a surrender. They are the policies that drug dealers fear most. What is legalization? It is a model of analysis. It is a cost benefit analysis of current policies. We have to look at our policy and costs and compare to other systems and figure out which has the most benefits for the money- What is the drug problem? This must be defined before going further. In the 1920's, people did not talk of"the alcohol problem." Instead, they separated the probleminto one of crime--the Al Capone types and their influence on the consumption of alcoholand into another category of alcohol abuse. It was decided that Prohibition was not worth the costs, even if it reduced abuse to a degree. Nevertheless, today the drug problem is not separated as such and "the drug problem" is defined as bothcrime and abuse. We will not be able to move forward until we make the distinction as was made with alcohol in the 1920's. Nearly 20 percent of all State and local resources go to fighting drugs, In Washington, DC, more than half the people in jail are there on drug-related charges, and the figure in New York City is about 40 percent. SUE RUSCHE, NATIONAL DRUG INFORMATION CENTER, FAMILIES IN ACTION It is important that the perspective of families be included in the national debate on legalization. In looking at both the alcohol and cigarette industries they spent more on advertising in the previous year than Congress appropriated to fight the drug crisis. We do not need any more legal industries of this sort amassing large profits in selling their products to our children and to ourselves. Some legalization proponents make the argument that alcohol is legal and is not sold to young people. But alcohol sales to minors are routine as sales clerks fail to ask for identification or look the other way when obviously underage young people make an alcohol purchase. If we cannot expect the alcohol and tobacco industry to prevent sales to minors, then how can we expect a cocaine or opiate industry from doing the same? At the very least, illicit drugs are as harmful as alcohol and tobacco. Fewer people die from them than from alcohol and tobacco because fewer people use them, and fewer people use them because they are illegal. There are 18 million marijuana users compared to 116 million alcohol users; and there are 6 million cocaine users compared to 60 million tobacco users. Alcohol and tobacco are leading killers in the United States. We do not live with alcohol and tobacco, we die with them. It would take two walls like the Vietnam Memorial shrine in Washington, DC to memorialize all those killed by alcohol in a year. It would take 7 to 10 walls to cover all those who die from tobacco. Some say taxes from drugs sales could go toward treatment and education, but no money from the sale of alcohol and tobacco ever goes toward education and treatment for those problems. Legalization would not eliminate profits- They would simply be shifted from the drug traffickers on the street to the people who run legitimate businesses. It is unreasonable to think that drug use would not increase under legalization. A total of 11 States have decriminalized marijuana. From 1972 to 1978, in those States, marijuana use, as a result of the decriminalization, rose 125 percent among young adults, 130 percent among high school seniors, 200 percent among older adults and 240 percent among teenagers. We are beginning to see drug use drop off in this country. We would like to see the Congress create a National Drug Corps similar to the Peace Corps, where parents and children could be trained to give I or 2 years of service fighting drug abuse in their communities. Summary of Testimony From Friday, September 30,1988 DR. DAVID F. MUSTO, M.D., DRUG HISTORIAN, YALE UNIVERSiry Around the turn of the century, drugs such as cocaine, heroin and morphine were legally sold and consumed in the United States, Consumption of these drugs reached a peak around 1890 to 1900. Because of the high rate of consumption and the effects these then-legal narcotics were having on individuals and families, America moved toward enacting laws and controls that have led to today's drug laws. We are currently experiencing our second epidemic with cocaine. The first occurred around the mid 1880's, when this drug was made available in 14 different forms. One could smoke it, rub it on in a salve, inject it, or even sniff it. Cocaine's image as the "All-American tonic" endedaround 1900, when it came to be known as the most dangerous drug in the country. The first congressionally passed legislation regulating cocaine was in 1914, and was called the Harrison Narcotics Act. A key to reducing the demand for drugs will be a changing of the public's attitudes. Those supporting a look-see at legalization must be reminded that there are many things in our society that we do not attempt a look-see because we know in advance it is bad and would lead to worse problems. One of them, for example, is racial discrimination. We ask for laws restricting it because we know it is bad. Ending the drug crisis will be a very gradual thing. It cannot be done in just 2 or 3 years. Drug use in America peaked around 1979, and at that time there was a call for legalization. The argument for legalizing cocaine in the 1970's was that cocaine was a harmless drug unless misused. Today, the argument is that legalizing it will remove the criminal influence. We now see cocaine as bad in itself, and this is a tremendous attitude turnaround that can be used as a foundation for a further decline in cocaine usage. DR. DALE MASI, PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK AND COMMUNITY PLANNING, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND The workplace cannot afford the legalization of illicit drugs. In previous testimony before the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, my position was that there was a dramatic need for an increase in industry drug programs in this country. That need is greater today: (1) A majority of illicit drug users are in the workplace. (2) Alcohol is the primary drug of abuse in the workplace. (3) Prescription drugs are the second largest drug of abuse in the workplace. (4) The most recent surveys indicate that 19- to 25-year- olds are the biggest abusers of cocaine, with 25- to 30- year-olds being the second largest group. If cocaine is legalized, it would outdistance both alcohol and prescription drugs as the most abused drug in the workplace. Drug abuse in the workplace translates into escalating health insurance bills. In addition, it contributes to the problems of absenteeism, sick leave, accidents, other rising health costs and more worker compensation claims. More emphasis will have to be placed on companies educating workers about the dangers of drug abuse, as has been the case with tobacco. Few companies, a study by Cook and Harrell shows, have drug education promotion programs. The IBM Corp. stands out as a model for the rest of the industry in the country. Schools of medicine, social work and psychology today rarely require that students take a course in alcohol or drug addiction. Fewer schools of psychology require a course in drug addiction than was the case in 1950. The council on social work education, the accrediting arm for such schools, does not even require that such courses be taught for master's and social work candidates. We need employee assistance programs that concentrate on reaching employees early. New funds are needed for meaningful programs, especially outpatient services. DR. LAWRENCE BROWN, M.D., CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, HARLEM HOSPITAL CENTER AND THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS Legalization advocates seem to be motivated by two arguments, One is that current response to the drug crisis has been shamefully inadequate. Number two, legalization appears to represent a reasonable alternative to the current response. Our current policy on drug abuse can be addressed from two angles. We can look at it either from the perspective of those who use drugs, or from the perspective of the consequences of drug use. A most common problem of those admitted to Harlem Hospital for treatment of kidney failure and in need of dialysis is prior drug abuse. Our approach to drug abuse as a nation is that we continue to view it as a stigma, rather than the public health problem that it truly is. It is ridiculous that so little of the educational training involves the study of drug abuse, Professional and health professional schools should be encouraged to try to include drug abuse studies in their curriculums. Existing drug treatment facilities must be improved as well. The least attractive facilities are often allocated for outpatient drug treatment services. An expansion of treatment capability must focus on both quality and quantity. The legalization debate provides the country with an excellent opportunity to reassess Federal drug policy. These discussions will far exceed their potential if they are used to chart a bold new course in responding to America's drug crisis. DAVID BOAZ, VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AFFAIRS, CATO INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC Alcohol did not cause high crime rates in the 1920's. Prohibition of alcohol was the problem. With today's drug crisis, it is not the drugs, but rather the prohibition of these drugs that are causing problems with crime and violence. There are six ways in which drug laws impact negatively on society: (1) Drug laws drive up the price. Users are forced to commit crimes to support their habits. Prohibition pushes some prices as much as 100 times higher than normal. Some experts say half the crime in major cities results from drug prohibition and many policemen will say the same thing if they were free to express themselves honestly. (2) Drug laws cause corruption. The extraordinary profits become an irresistible temptation to policemen. (3) Buyers are forced to come in contact with criminals, unlike those who purchase alcohol without the help of criminal,q because it is no longer illegal. (4) Intense law enforcement forces the creation of stronger, more potent drugs. Crack, for example, is a result of drug prohibition. (5) Civil liberties are abused under drug prohibition. (6) A final negative result of drug prohibition is that it leads to futility. In the case of today's drug crisis, the drug war simply is not working. GLORIA WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), VOCATIONAL REHARILITATION SPECIALIST, REHABILITATION SERVICES ADMINISTRATION) DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT, WASHINGTON, DC As a rehabilitation specialist in drug and alcohol abuse, it is frightening to consider what the caseload would be if drugs were legalized. How can anyone with any insight or perception believe that legalizing drugs would be the answer to the drug crisis? If the main reason to legalize drugs is to remove the profit from the criminals and drug traffickers, then it is also saying that the U.S. Government "wants a piece ofthe action." Uncle Sam would become the biggest dope pusherof all time. Generations of young Americans are dying from drug abuse. Minds and motivation are being destroyed. Families are being destroyed. America is being weakened. Legalization could not be accomplished without having to rely on imports. Small, drug-producing countries would soon become superpowers and nations with gross national products inflated by cocaine and heroin production would have access to nuclear warheads. Fraudulent prescriptions are already a big business in the United States. The future for America would be very dim under legalization. Medical schools, laws schools and other institutions of higher learning would not touch students who use drugs, even if they were legal, because it is known that drug users are a detriment to themselves. Under legalization, there would not be enough hospitals to take care of everybody. Doctors and nurses would be in demand like never before. Long lines of dope fiends waiting for a fix or a hit would replace the winos in the streets. Those favoring legalization are being insensitive. Legalization is a further step toward the perpetuation of evil influence over society, rather than a positive step toward resolving some of the criminal problems in society like poverty, insufficient health care, and insufficient education. America should wage a real war against drugs, using any means necessary to prevent it from entering our ports and coming across our borders. RICHARD KAREL, JOURNALIST Across the board legalization is not the answer to the drug crisis that plagues the country today. More dangerous drugs should continue to be prohibited, while less dangerous narcotics be made legally available. During the time that America was under alcohol Prohibition, Great Britain was attacking the alcohol problem through a combination of higher taxes, rationing and limited hours of distribution. When the Volstead Act was repealed, alcohol abuse rose in the United States while Great Britain had already began experiencing a leveling off of alcohol use. Alcohol abuse has remained relatively low since. Recent Studies indicate a decrease in cirrhosis of the liver in the United States despite alcohol being a legal substance. With tobacco, limited restrictions and education have cut sales of this product to minors. Prohibition is neither necessary nor advisable for either of these products. The focus should be on keeping dangerous drugs like crack and PCP away from children, and on preventing clinically controlled drugs from being diverted. This would provide a moral justification for the antidrug activities of law enforcement. PAUL MOORE, DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, THE SCOTT NEWMAN CENTER, Los ANGELES, CA The Newman Center unequivocally opposes drug legalization. The more time spent debating the issue, the more credibility it receives. Time should be spent developing more sound policies regarding treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. Society seems to be hooked on hyped miracle solutions that look good but would not work. Drugs, drug abuse and the associated crime are all symptoms of deeply rooted problems in our society. Drugs did not invent poverty, broken homes, latchkey children, greed or the human desire for a quick- 'ix. Drugs did not contribute to the general breakdown of moral and ethical values. Without drugs, these problems would not disappear and with drugs they are pronounced. There is a perception that the drug problem can be sanitized through legalization, giving residents of ghettos and barrios all they want so long as they refrain from committing crimes against the rest of society. The threat of legalization is that it stands to send a whole new set of mixed messages to America's youth. Drugs already have a glamorous image. If drugs were legalized, the gains from national efforts of the past decade-such as a decrease in consumption and a change in attitude of the Nation's youth-would be lost. MARVIN MILLER, MEMBER, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, NORML, WASHINGTON, DC Drugs are a problem and they create a tremendous strain on the Nation's financial resources. It is commonly known that there are no funds available for desperately needed educational and training programs. The underground narcotics trade is being allowed to run rampant and control the marketplace. It controls purity as well. All iirugs are, being treated as if they are the same. A combined total of $10 billion is spent annually on State and Federal antidrug efforts. Most of this expenditure goes for enforcing marijuana possession laws. About 40 percent of all drug arrests relate to marijuana. Of the 40-percent figure, 9 of 10 cases involve simple possession. There are some 50 million marijuana smokers in the United States. They are otherwise law-abiding citizens who pay taxes and are productive. The Nation's $10 billion antidrug budget allots only about 5 percent for education programs. No money exists for national education or treatment programs. NORML has put together a bill to make marijuana available legally as a controlled and regulated substance. An administrative law judge has ruled that marijuana is the most benign substance known to man. It is not addictive. It does not generate violence. The Nation should look at new ways to battle the drug crisis. Not every drug can be legalized, yet at the same time, 50 million marijuana using Americans should not be branded criminals. RAY WHITFIELD (RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT), DRUG ABUSE CONSULTANT, WASHINGTON, DC Legalization is not a positive proposal. It is based on what may be a false assumption, that legalization is a proposal intended to reduce drug abuse. Drug-related murders would not necessarily decrease as a result of legalization. Drug-related murder should take into account drug related death, which is less glamorous, but also a tragic consequence of drug abuse. Many in our society have turned to drug abuse simply because they are hopeless and helpless. Drugs ease the pain of their reality. Many people have lived lives much worse than what the criminal justice system can mete out. The Nation's Government has been duplicitous in dealing with the drug crisis. While Government does not officially sanction drug use, it has pushed policies that contribute to it-such as the lack of antidrug education and treatment centers in ghettos during the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, and the closing of the only two Federal treatment centers in Lexington, KY and Texas. Drugs generally have not been considered a national problem so long as there was the perception that it was a problem of minoritics and poor whites. Middle and upper income individuals, meanwhile, generally have looked at cocaine as a suitable, nonaddictive drug. Now that cocaine and its negative consequences have reached suburbia, it is a national problem. This is duplicity. Drug abuse is not the root problem. It is a very destructive symptom of other maladies. SENAT0R JOSEPH GALIBER, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY In the last 20 years or so, little or nothing has happened in terms of solving the Nation's drug crisis. I introduced a bill in the State assembly earlier this year to set up a commission to study legalization and decriminalization in the State of New York. America has always been the noble experiment on freedom that other nations around the world have looked to as an example. But now, out of frustration, Americans are beginning to espouse violations of freedoms and civil liberties as the answer to this frustration. Drug trafficking must be eliminated through the legalization of narcotics. Responsible officials are suggesting arming our police with more powerful weapons. They have suggested shooting down suspicious planes. They have called for a doubling of agents and resources, martial law and the death penalty for drug traffickers. We fail to realize the coexistence of two separate problems regarding the Nation's drug crisis. There is drug abuse and there is drug trafficking. It is the trafficking that causes shootouts, raids, deaths and injuries. If all drugs were legalized right now and given away free, then the traffickers would cease coming in immediately. The profit would be gone. Drug abuse would not be eliminated under legalization, but the horrible problems associated with the drug trade would be gone. The questions posed by Chairman Rangel can be answered in the context of the alcohol industry: Question. What narcotics and drugs would be legalized? Answer. All. Question. Who would be allowed to buy these narcotics? Would there be an age limit? Answer. The same limitations as those for purchasing alcohol. Question. Would we sell drugs to people who just want to experiment and encourage them to pick up the habit? Answer. We would sell drugs in the same fashion and with the same restrictions as the selling of alcohol. Question. Where would these drugs be sold? Answer. In the same places and under the same controls as alcohol, Question. Where would we obtain our supply of these legal drugs? Answer. In the same way that there are manufacturers of alcohol. Do you for one minute think the tobacco industry has not put together long ago contingency plans to produce marijuana cigarettes when legalization becomes a reality? Question. Would private industry be allowed to participate in this market? Answer. Of course. In the same way as in alcohol. Question. If drugs would become legal, would we allow pilots, railroad workers and nuclear plant employees to use them? Answer. Do we permit them to use alcohol? Question. If drugs were legalized, how would we back up our argument with our children and youth that drugs are harmful? Answer. In the same way that we do with alcohol. The Volstead Act, which made liquor illegal, created violence, warfare, bloodshed, corruption, illicit dealers and sellers on a sale that was unprecedented until now. Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past by continuing to escalate a war which is totally unnecessary. ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF HON. LARRY SMITH OF FLORIDA Legalization will not alleviate the drug problem. Drugs such as heroin and cocaine destroy both the mind and the body. The new form of cocaine known as crack or rock is highly addictive. Legalizing drugs would be the same as admitting that we, as a people and society, cannot control our actions and prefer self-destruction. Who among us wants the U.S. Government to be in the business of distributing cocaine, heroin, PCP or any other killing, brutalizing substance? Very few people believe that legalized drugs would reduce the impact of drug abuse on society. Such a proposal might eliminate some of the existing criminal element involved in drug trafficking, but it would not stop somebo4y (whether the government, tobacco companies, or pharmaceutical companies) from profiting from the human misery associated with drug use and abuse. If we would not legalize drugs for juveniles (and we would not), a flourishing market would still exist to sell to them illegally. What about crime? If we distribute or make legal drugs that cloud the mind or remove inhibitions, does anyone believe that there will be less crime? Does anyone believe that people who are on only a fixed ration of free or legal drugs will not want more and that someone will sell it to them illegally? And that to pay for those extra" drugs the drug users will notcommit crimes? Congress should do everything it can to eliminate drug trafficking and drug abuse. The task will not be easy, but that does not mean that we cannot try to alleviate this devastating problem. Legalization would be the easy way out, but it would not solve the underlying problem.

GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK in the House of Representatives Thursday, October 6, 1994 Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to myattention that drug legalization advocates are using theelectronic information superhighway to organize the legalizationmovement and share information on drug use. The informationsuperhighway was certainly not created to propagate suchmisinformation and the criminal activity associated with it. Thisuse was brought to my attention by drug legalization opponentswho use the information superhighway everyday in their vocations. Apparently, the National Organization for the Reform ofMarijuana Laws recently entered remarks which I personally madein opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as anexample of `rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.' BecauseI believe, along with 95 percent of America, that the use ofillicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as an enemy of drugusers. Well, Mr. Speaker, I am honored. The use of illegal drugs inan anathema to the social and moral fabric of our Nation.President Reagan's and President Bush's `War on Drugs ' waspremised on the belief that society was better served andprotected if our Nation universally and actively opposed druguse. This program worked as planned. The use of cocaine,marijuana, heroin, and most other illegal drugs declined. OurNation's young children and teenagers who grew up during the1980's were told and made aware of the evils and the hardshipsassociated with drug use. I fear for the kind of message thechildren growing up in the 1990's are receiving. Pro-drug use andlegalization messages on the information superhighway throughInternet are wrong. I was appalled to learn that this information even includessuch things as tips on growing marijuana and ways to evade lawenforcement. As more and more Americans jump onto this latesttechnological advancement, more and more citizens will haveaccess to this ill-advised information. For example, theinformation superhighway is now available in most elementary andsecondary schools and in many American homes. Now elementarystudents like my own grandson can obtain valuable informationabout an obscure nation in the South Pacific during a socialstudies class and then flip a screen to discover the glories ofdrug use and criminal activity. Drug legalization advocates from all over the country areusing this universal technology to further their movement anddeceive more Americans. As Congress reviews this very importanttechnology during the 104th Congress, the use of this service bypro-drug organizations and individuals for the propagation ofthis ilk must be addressed. As a nation founded on the freedomsof speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuitof happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs.

GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK in the House of Representatives Thursday, March 2, 1995 A Note to Readers: If you want some currentinformation, direct from Europe, to compare with Mr. Solomon'sstatements here, take a look at DrugText Europe. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, let me commend to you the followingarticle written by a distinguished doctor and chairman of theInternational Drug Strategy Institute, Eric A. Voth, M.D. Dr.Voth advocates retaining tough drug laws to guard against risingcrime and experimentation. Citing Holland as an example, thelegalization of drugs has resulted in greatly increased crime andaddiction. The only way to combat the increase of drug use inthis country is to stand firm against recent attempt by prodruggroups to mute public awareness. These groups attempt to disguisethe dangers of drug abuse and consequently jeopardize futuregenerations. REPEATING HISTORY'S MISTAKES The international drug policy debate rages regarding decisionswhether to fundamentally change drug policy toward legalizationor decriminalization of drug use, or to remain with restrictivepolicies. If we examine two examples of softening of drug policy,we will find ample reason to continue with restrictive policy. In the mid to late 1970's during the Carter administration,drug policy visibly softened. Several states decriminalizedmarijuana, and in fact Alaska legalized marijuana. Drug policy`specialists' in their infinite wisdom supported the flawedconcept called `responsible use' of drugs as a way that userscould maintain personal use of drugs and avoid the ravages ofaddiction and physical problems. Permissive drug policy originated with organizations like theNational Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. PresidentCarter's drug policy advisor Peter Bourne, as well as others likeArnold Trebach, Mathea Falco, Peter Reuter, Mark Kleiman helpedto press for the lenient policy. Interestingly, during that time the use of marijuana and otherdrugs drastically increased. Use also increased in adolescentsdespite the fact that drugs never become legal or decriminalizedfor that age group. The use of marijuana among high schoolstudents in Oregon during decriminalization was double that ofthe national average. National averages of marijuana use amonghigh school seniors increased to 50% of seniors having used inthe previous year, and 10.7% used daily. Ultimately, parents began to object to the rampant use ofdrugs , especially marijuana, among their children. In the early1980's the `parents' anti-drug movement began. Because of thedrastic failure of lenient drug policies, steady pressure wasexerted at national and local levels for restrictive drugpolicies. A huge national wave of high quality research,grassroots prevention organizations, and tightening of drug lawsbegan. Predictably, the use of drugs among `recreational' usersdropped. High school seniors use of marijuana dropped to 23% ofseniors using within the last year and 2% using on a daily basis.The use among hard addicts did not drop. Strangely the cry hasbeen sounded by some that the drug war did not work. That outcry,however, was almost exclusively being sounded by individuals whofavored legalization or decriminalization back in the 1970's. Thesame individuals who called for soft policy in the earlier eraare calling for the new harm reduction policy today. Hiddenwithin such policy is the intent to gain decriminalization ofdrugs . Holland has decriminalized drugs and tried harm reduction.Since the softening of drug policy there, shootings haveincreased 40%, robberies 62%, and car thefts 62%. This experimentwhich was meant to decrease organized crime has resulted in anincrease in organized crime families from 3 in 1988 to 93 today. The number of registered marijuana addicts has risen 30% andthe number of other addicts has risen 22%. The major difference between today and the 1970's is that theprolegalization effort is more organized and better funded. Themillionaire Richard Dennis from Chicago has given millions to thedrug legalization effort. Billionaire George Soros has given $6million to the Drug Policy Foundation to help seek legalizationof drugs . He created the Open Society Fund which in turn fundsMathea Falco's Drug Strategies organization. Steadily, thesegroups put a happy and acceptable face on the idea of druglegalization or decriminalization. Their public relation campaign has softened public attitudes.Moves such as full page ads in national newspapers suggestingalternatives to drug policy are examples. Organized efforts atsuch ideas as hemp as a fiber alternative, medical marijuana,needle exchanges, therapeutic LSD, and others pervade the media.The Internet is bristling with pro-drug talk groups discussingrecent drug experiences and how and where to obtain drugs . In the face of these facts, the holdovers from the 70's drugpolicy makers are still asking for lenient drug laws. Asubstantial number of today's addicts started their use under thelenient policies of the 1970's. We have had our experience withdecriminalization, and it is time that we recognize it and putthat concept to bed. The only hope for drug policy is a concerted effort of drugprevention which upholds the notion of no drug use, druginterdiction, and drug treatment.

It contains material on the nature, scope andextent of organized crime, particularly as it relates to drugtrafficking, money laundering, and labor racketeering. The President's Commission on Organized Crime The President's Commission on Organized Crime was establishedby Executive Order 12435 July 28, 1983. The Executive Orderdirects the Commission to: Make a full and complete national and region-by-region analysis of organized crime; Define the nature of traditional organized crime as well as emerging organized crime groups, the sources and amounts of organized crime's income, and the uses to which organized crime puts its income; Develop in-depth information on the participants in organized crime networks; Evaluate Federal laws pertinent to the effort to combat organized crime; Advise the President and the Attorney General with respect to its findings and actions which can be undertaken to improve law enforcement efforts directed against organized crime; Make recommendations concerning appropriate administrative and legislative improvements and improvements in the administration of justice; and Report to the President from time to time as requested, and to submit its final report by March 1, 1986. The Commission is authorized to issue subpoenas for thetestimony of witnesses and the production of information, toissue orders compelling testimony over a claim of the privilegeagainst self-incrimination, and to seek the assistance of theDepartment of Justice in applying for writs of habeas corpus adtestificandum or judicial orders requiring testimony or theproduction of information before the Commission. In addition, theCommission may obtain, use, and disclose electronic surveillancedata obtained by law enforcement agencies under Title III of theOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, and otherinformation from Federal departments and agencies under the BankSecrecy Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, as well as fromfinancial institutions under the Right to Financial Privacy Act. In the discharge of its responsibilities, the Commission hasprepared this report on organized crime's role in drugtrafficking and drug abuse. Based on the totality of the evidencebefore it, the Commission has concluded that drug trafficking andabuse together constitute the single most serious organized crimeissue confronting this Nation. Therefore, in contrast to the other subjects covered in theremainder of it's final report, this topic is treated in aseparate volume. The research and drafting on this report wasperformed on the Commission's behalf by Chief Investigator ManuelGonzalez (FBI). Research assistants Abigail Johnson and MaryKarol, Deputy Counsel Kevin McEnery, Investigator Thomas Sheehan(DEA), and Contract Consultant Susan Mellody, under thesupervision of Deputy Executive Director Rodney G. Smith.

The drug trade generates billions of dollarsfor organized crime each year, imposing incalculable costs onindividuals, families, communities, and governments worldwide.But drug trafficking is only part of a broader, unifiedphenomenon, which also includes the illicit use of drugs. It isdrug users who finance organized crime through their drugpurchases, and it is they who must accept responsibility for thebroad range of costs associated with the drug industry. Drug abuse ruins individual lives, drains billions of dollarseach year from American society, and erodes the nation's qualityof life. The violence and corruption that are an integral part oforganized crime drug trafficking take the lives of American andforeign officials and private citizens, undermine drug controlefforts, and threaten entire governments. To the extent that thestability of friendly nations is threatened, particularly in thishemisphere, our own national security is jeopardized. The impactof organized crime and drug trafficking on society thus hasfar-ranging consequences, from the mental or physical destructionof the individual drug user to questions of national security. This Commission has found drug trafficking to be the mostwidespread and lucrative organized crime activity in the UnitedStates. According to this Commission's survey of local lawenforcement agencies, marijuana, cocaine, and dangerous drugtrafficking are the three primary activities of organized crimegroups, as defined by local agencies, nationwide. Drugtrafficking accounts for almost 38 percent of all organized crimeactivity across the country and generates an income estimated tobe as high as $110 billion. A concept fundamental to this report is the dual nature of thedrug phenomenon: drug supply and drug demand are mutuallydependent aspects of a single global problem. All strategic andtactical evaluations in this report have been arrived at in thiscontext, and it is imperative that the planning undertaken bythis government and its allies be performed within the sameframework. The gaps that now exist between strategists who seekto reduce supply and planners who want to reduce demand must beclosed. The situation confronting us is a crisis both nationallyand internationally. Our response can be no less than nationaland international mobilization. As this report sets out indetail, the menace of drugs is not restricted to a particularsegment of society, but is now of a scope and severity that is athreat to our national security and therefore a legitimatenational security issue. The appropriate response must therefore involve our entiresociety, not just our law enforcement and health professionals.Parents, educators, employers, the legal profession, financialinstitutions, the military, and the diplomatic and intelligencecommunities must all recognize that we are in a nationalemergency. Military strategists have warned and painful nationalexperience confirmed that a war must not be fought without aclear notion of the victory sought. In this war on drugs - aphrase worn by use but nevertheless the only accurate descriptionof what must be done - this Commission has adopted a definitionof victory: the dramatic reduction, if not complete elimination,of drug abuse in this society. The ultimate goal is a distantone, to be sure, requiring patience, determination and vision. Noless an objective is acceptable. Short fixes, compromises, andresignation are a breach of faith with ourselves, our children,and generations to come. Just as we must clearly define victory, so must we identifythe enemy. Here again, there is no room for compromise. We mustunite against drugs themselves, and anyone who is their ally.Producers, refiners, smugglers, and sellers, all those we know as"traffickers," are obvious targets. It is ourobligation to look further and recognize that those among us -friends, relatives, colleagues, and other "respectable"people - whose small, personal drug purchases at the base of theconsumption pyramid are the driving force behind the traffickers'assault on this country. It is the consumer's dollars that cometogether to finance the organized crime drug traffickingdescribed in this report, and it is thus their responsibility andours to confront this truth. This means an end to tolerance ofdrug use at every level of society. While all drug trafficking, by its nature, requires somedegree of organization, it is essential for the purposes of thisreport to identify the threshold at which the organizationinherent in drug trafficking can be distinguished from organizedcrime drug trafficking. The Commission's definition of organizedcrime, which sets out the six characteristics of organized crimegroups, is helpful in making this distinction. Thesecharacteristics are: continuity, structure, defined membership,criminality, violence, and power as its goal. These elements,together with a reliance on the "buffer" that thisCommission has found to be an integral part of organized crime,are common to the world's most notorious traffickingorganizations. This report examines the organized crime groups that trafficin illicit drugs. To the extent necessary to grasp the dynamicsof worldwide drug traffic, it also details the nature of thedrugs themselves. It describes the array of enforcement agenciescurrently in place, analyzes their various strategies andtactics, and presents specific recommendations for more effectiveanti-drug efforts. In the portion of this report devoted to efforts to reduce thesupply of illicit drugs, "Supply Strategies," it isclear that our law enforcement and other government agencies,particularly on the Federal level, are deployed with a degree ofdetermination, imagination, and resource commitment unparalleledin American history. This government must continue to pursuestrategies to reduce supply with all possible vigor, or it is thegovernment's obligation to do all within its power to protect itscitizens, no matter how formidable the foe. Nevertheless, if thedemand for illicit drugs continues at its present voraciouslevel, improvements in the area of reducing supply will continueto be slow, expensive, infrequent, and too often only temporary. This report places great emphasis on the need for completenational resolve in this area and for that resolve to betranslated into fully coordinated governmental action.Compartmentalization and parochialism, which have been far toocommon in past efforts, must be brought to an end. In thisregard, we are at a particularly propitious moment in history.The slow and painful evolution of our strategy has finallyachieved a centralized authority for our national effort: theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board. Not just another advisorybody, this Board is a true congregation of every component of ournational government's anti-drug effort. It provides the means forachieving a thoroughly coordinated national attack on everyaspect of drug trafficking and abuse. It is vital that the PolicyBoard move effectively, thoughtfully and decisively, but it ismost urgent that it move. Indecisiveness are signals inthemselves, the wrong signals, to drug traffickers, users,concerned parents, health and social planners, and even foreigngovernments. Perhaps most critically, indecisiveness and delayare the wrong signals to those U.S. governmental agencies thatmust choose where anti-drug efforts will fall on the list ofcompeting priorities in a time of hardening fiscal austerity. Byaction, not mere promises, the Policy Board must send the propermessage: we are in a fight for our lives, and every agency mustarrange its priorities accordingly. Our strategies to reduce supply will require not onlydedication, but patience and objectivity. The war against drugswill not be won until individuals stop using them. Strategies toreduce supply can do no more than hold the line against illegaldrugs while public attitudes and private choices change. That isnot to say that our enforcement strategies should not beaggressive and persistent. On the contrary, this report makesclear that there is much in this area that is being done andshould continue, and much more that might be done. Many of thespecific recommendations in this report are devoted to thistheme. What is necessary at the outset, however, is anunderstanding that such efforts must not be judged by anunrealistic standard. As long as this society is willing toprovide its enforcement agencies scarcely more than a penny forevery dollar our citizens squander on illicit drugs, it has noright and no reason to expect more. Ultimately, the curse of drug abuse will be broken, but onlyby a nationwide dedication to persistent and unyielding assaultson both supply and demand. The supply is already under siege byour enforcement, diplomatic, and intelligence communities.Because an end to consumption is our ultimate goal, it is aconcerted and direct attack on demand that must be mounted. Illicit drugs are an attack upon the integrity, character, andhealth of the individual. Although discussions of drugs are oftenframed in terms of costs to society and society's responses, thefact is that individuals, not societies, take drugs. It is theindividual user who finances all of the violence, corruption, anddegradation that this report describes. The powerful,sophisticated, and thoroughly evil organized crime drugtrafficking groups described herein are a reflection of nothingmore than our self-destructiveness. It is as a result ofindividual acts of will that such groups came to be and aresustained, and it is by individual acts of will that they willfinally be defeated.

In the past scientists made a clear distinctionbetween physical and psychological drug dependence, but thehealth and social consequences of cocaine use have demonstratedthat the two courses lead to the same end: cocaine, like otheraddictive drugs, ruins lives and kills. Widely available acrossthe United States, cocaine is now used by individuals of allsocioeconomic groups. The cocaine industry generates an estimated$11 billion in illicit income annually, and it is growing.Cocaine production, importation to the United States andconsumption have all increased significantly in recent years. Thecocaine industry is fueled by the approximately 25 millionAmericans who have tried cocaine, of which five to six millionuse it at least once per month. Of the regular users, it isestimated that almost half may be considered addicted. Althoughthe total number of users appears to have leveled off in the lastfew years, cocaine consumption has increased 12 percent between1983 and 1984, from 50-68 metric tons to 55-76 metric tons. Ascocaine consumption has increased, so too have more dangerousforms of use of the drug and the deleterious effects associatedwith it. Cocaine-related deaths increased 77 percent from 1983 to1984 and cocaine-related emergency room visits increased 51percent. Requests for treatment for cocaine use have increased600 percent during the past three years. In 18 states, cocaine isreported as the primary drug of abuse for clients in treatmentfacilities. There is no indication that without a comprehensiveeffort at reduction of both the supply of and demand for cocaine,the increases in cocaine use or its deleterious medical andsocial effects will subside in the near future. From a lawenforcement perspective, the consequences of this tolerance andaddiction are the intense, steady and increasing demand for theproduct, which generates vast revenues for organized crime.Today's Cocaine User The cocaine industry is sustained by the appetite of thecocaine user. With the possible exception of marijuana, cocaineis used by a wider demographic cross-section of society than anyother controlled substance. Facts demonstrate that the popularbelief that cocaine use is restricted to the wealthy is a myth.For example, a study of 6,406 males arrested for serious crimesand processed in New York City's Manhattan Central Booking policeoffice in 1984 reveals that 42 percent tested positively forcocaine in their system, the drug most frequently detected. Theuse of cocaine in combination with other drugs appears to beincreasing. Fifty-nine percent of the cocaine-related deaths in1984 involved other drugs, particularly alcohol, heroin and PCP.In addition, more dangerous routes of cocaine administration arenow being used. Use of "speedballs," injections ofheroin and cocaine, which are often lethal, increased 37 percentfrom 1983 to 1984. Smoking of coca paste and base, forms ofconsumption with particularly dangerous health consequences, havealso increased. Surveys of cocaine users demonstrated there is no"typical" cocaine user. Results of a 1983 survey ofcallers to the national 800-COCAINE hotline indicate that theaverage caller was a 31-year old, white, middle class male withat least some college education and a job with an annual salaryexceeding $25,000. Results of the 1985 survey of callers to thehotline reveal that more women, minorities and adolescents calledthan just two years earlier, and 73 percent of callers in 1985reported an income of less than $25,000 per year. While almosthalf of the calls to the hotline in 1983 came from the northeast,calls were fairly evenly geographically distributed in 1985. Justas it has spread geographically and to different socioeconomicgroups, cocaine use has increased among certain age groups. Mostalarmingly, an increase in adolescent use of cocaine has beenreported in the 1984 and 1985 surveys of drug use among highschool seniors. The surveys found that current use of cocaineamong respondents climbed from 4.9 percent in 1983 to 5.8 percentin 1984, and to 6.7 percent 1985. According to the surveys,annual and lifetime use of cocaine also increased. HealthConsequences of Cocaine Use One reason that use of cocaine is sowidespread is because of the properties of the drug itself.Cocaine is derived from the leaves of the coca plant(Erythroxylon coca) and has been identified by Dr. Donald IanMacDonald, administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and MentalHealth Administration, as one of the most powerfully addictivesubstances known to man. Cocaine is a stimulant traditionallyused to produce euphoria. Other initial effects, however,typically include excitation, increased alertness, insomnia, lossof appetite, increased heart rate, increased respiration andincreased blood pressure after even one use. Death can alsoresult from first time use as discussed below. Repeated use ofcocaine can cause chronic fatigue, convulsions, depression,irritability, loss of sex drive, memory problems, nasal bleeding,paranoia, severe headaches, increased body temperature and death.These symptoms are neither theoretical nor infrequent. Chroniccocaine use causes tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and addiction.Tolerance is evidenced by the fact that chronic cocaine usersneed to increase their dosage of cocaine to achieve the sameeffects as lower dosages. As dosage increases, the effect ofcocaine use become more pronounced. According to cocaineresearcher Dr. Reese T. Jones, "The existence of a truewithdrawal syndrome following cocaine use seems compelling."This syndrome includes "depression, social withdrawal,craving, tremor, muscle pain, eating disturbance,encephalographic changes and changes in sleep patterns." The addictive nature of cocaine and its toxicity have beendocumented in both animal studies and human experience. Accordingto the results of a study reported in the July 5, 1985 issue ofthe Journal of the American Medical Association, 90 percent ofrats self-administering cocaine intravenously died within 30days, while the mortality rate for rats self-administering heroinwas only 36 percent. The study found that rats using cocaine lostup to 47 percent of their body weight, ceased grooming themselvesand deteriorated in general health. Several rats experiencedseizures, but immediately self-administered more cocaine afterthe cessation of convulsions. The study concludes that in regardto human cocaine use: As the intake of cocaine increases and theconcentration of this compound becomes greater (through theavailability of higher-purity drugs, by IV injections or by'free-basing') the number of fatalities associated with cocaineabuse is likely to increase. Hundreds of fatalities each year areassociated with cocaine use. According to Dr. Mark Gold, directorof research at Fair Oaks Hospital in New Jersey: "We have noway of predicting who'll die from the drug and who won't. Itcould be a regular user or it could be a first-time user."Although overdose is the primary cause of cocaine deaths, deathcan also result after a regular cocaine user takes the sameamount of the drug that he usually takes. This phenomenon isknown as "kindling" and is not well understood byscientists. According to Miami's Deputy Chief Medical ExaminerDr. Charles Wetli, "What was a safe dose one day becomes afatal dose the next." The precise cause of cocaine-relateddeaths, regardless of dosage, include respiratory failure,cerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrest or seizures. Because cocaineincreases blood pressure and heart rate, individuals withcardiovascular problems are at particular risk. Cocaine'stendency to induce convulsions also creates special risks forepileptics. Death by cocaine is often preceded by anxiety,hallucinations, high body temperature and seizures. One commonmyth about cocaine is that addiction and death cannot result fromintranasal use, or "snorting," which is the most commonroute of administration. While cocaine deaths are usuallyassociated with intravenous use, coroners have documented casesof death from intranasal use of cocaine. One particular dangerassociated with intravenous use of cocaine, or any drug, isinfection. Hepatitis and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome(AIDS) have both been associated with intravenous drug use.Cultivation The cultivation, refinement and trafficking necessaryto bring cocaine from the fields of South America to the streetsof the United States obviously requires organization. Coca bushesare grown primarily in the South American countries of Peru,Bolivia and Colombia. The plants are first harvested as early as18 months after planting, and can usually be harvested from threeto four times annually for up to 20 years. The cultivation ofcoca has increased significantly in recent years, primarily as aresult of the cultivation of new coca plants and the maturationof previously existing coca plants. Notwithstanding increased lawenforcement pressure in Colombia, the tremendous profitsassociated with cocaine trafficking have encouraged the spread ofcoca cultivation throughout the region. Processing In arelatively simple chemical process, coca leaves are convertedfirst to cocaine paste, then base, then cocaine hydrochloride(HCl), the form of coca most commonly abused in this country. Theconversion of leaf to paste to base usually occurs near thecultivation site. The dried leaves are first moistened in analkaline solution and then soaked in kerosene. The kerosene isremoved leaving a cocaine precipitate. This in turn is filtered,producing a paste. The paste is dissolved in a solution ofsulfuric acid and then potassium permanganate. This mixture isthen filtered, ammonium hydroxide is added and the precipitatethat forms is coca base. Traditionally, base has been smuggledout of Peru and Bolivia by small aircraft or boats to Colombia,where most of the refining from base to HCl takes place. Innumerous cocaine laboratories in the jungles of Colombia, cocabase is transformed into pure cocaine HCl by adding ether andacetone, and filtering this mixture, which is then dried. Toproduce one kilo of pure cocaine, approximately 500 kilos of cocaleaves are needed. The pattern of processing and transshipment issomewhat different from that of cultivation. In the area ofrefining and smuggling cocaine, it is estimated that 75 percentof the drug available in the United States comes from Colombia,15 percent from Bolivia, 5 percent from Peru and 5 percent fromEcuador, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. However, these figures aresubject to frequent changes because of the mobility of drugtraffickers. For example, while most of the conversion to HCltakes place in Colombia, and other South American countries, anincreasing number of cocaine laboratories are being seized in theUnited States. Six such laboratories were seized here in 1982, 11in 1983, 21 in 1984 and 25 during the first half of 1985. Reasonsfor this trend include increased law enforcement in Colombia andthe increasing cost of ether and acetone in Colombia. The cost ofthese chemicals has increased as a result of controls imposed bythe Colombian government on their importation and sale and aconcerted effort initiated by the U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration to disrupt the supply of chemicals essential inthe cocaine refinement process. A 55-gallon drum of ether nowcosts approximately $7,000 in South America, while the sameamount costs only $500 to $600 in the United States. Further,acetone and ether are widely available for commercial purposes inthe United States, making control of their illicit use much moredifficult than it has been in South America. Heroin Scope of the Problem Traditionally viewed as the "hardest drug," heroin'sreputation is well-earned. Although there are fewer heroinaddicts than users of other illicit drugs, more deaths andemergency room visits are associated with heroin than with anyother drug. Heroin's "worst drug" status has alsodeveloped because of the crime generally associated with heroinuse, a stereotype of the heroin addict as an inner-city streetdweller who commits crimes as his sole means of support, the factthat heroin is most often used intravenously, the dramaticaddiction and withdrawal symptoms associated with use of thedrug, and the relatively quick and generally lethal effects of aheroin overdose. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates there were490,000 heroin addicts and users in 1981. It is estimated thatthousands more individuals use heroin occasionally, but are notincluded in this number. While the addict population has remainedrelatively steady since 1979, indicators of heroin consumptionand effects have increased in recent years. Annual heroin-relateddeaths reached 1,046 in 1984, a 31 percent increase from 1983.Emergency room visits involving heroin use increased 55 percentfrom 1981 to 1984, with 10,901 such visits in 1984. Thisrepresents a decrease from the 11,028 emergency room visits in1983. Estimated heroin consumption increased 55 percent from 1981to 1984, with 5.97 metric tons of heroin consumed in 1984. As aresult of increased heroin purity and increased use of the drugin combination with other drugs, the number of heroin addicts andthe number of deaths and emergency room visits associated withheroin use should be expected to increase. Heroin is thus an extremely valuable commodity for organizedcrime: in fact, an ounce of pure heroin is approximately tentimes more expensive than an ounce of gold. Heroin users provideorganized crime with billions of dollars each year: it isestimated that illegal income from heroin sales in the UnitedStates totaled $6.12 billion in 1982. The Heroin Addict Historically, data collection and law enforcement experiencesupport the view that heroin use has been an urban phenomenon,confined in large part to minority populations. One recent studyof black inner-city heroin users across the country suggests theextent of heroin's grip in those areas: Because of the regular availability of heroin and thestructure of the relationship of intercity residents to society,the heroin lifestyle has become firmly established as analternative lifestyle for Black youngsters. Such studies typically reveal a portrait of the heroin addictas an unemployed, minority male with little education who commitscrime to support his habit: A 1985 study of heroin users in Eastand Central Harlem found the following: 75 percent were male; 55percent were black and 44 percent Hispanic; 36 percent were under30 years of age; 61 percent had less than 11 years of education;and 81 percent were unemployed. The annualized crime rate forthese heroin users was 1,075 crimes per person. Crimes committedby heroin addicts includes property crime, violent crime and drugoffenses. While regular use of heroin is generally addictive, thereappears to be a group of users, known as "chippers,"who are able to use heroin occasionally over a long period oftime without becoming addicts. In his study of heroin, StanfordUniversity professor John Kaplan maintains: It is now clear that there exists a sizable population ofnon-addicted but regular heroin users who seem well integratedinto society and in many ways indistinguishable from the rest ofthe population. Recently a new group of heroin users has emerged that includesboth addicts and non-addicts. These are the "middleclass" users, who are involved with heroin as a result oftheir cocaine habits. In order to counteract the effects of heavycocaine use, many began to use heroin intranasally, andeventually became addicted to the drug. Dr. Forest Tennant,director of a number of drug abuse clinics in the Los Angelesarea, observes: As cocaine use increases, we're seeing more addicts becauseheroin is the strongest neutralizer around for cocaine toxicity .. . And we're not talking about gang members and derelicts. I'mtreating people who pay their union dues, go to the PTA, taketheir kids to Little League. We've even got a program forexecutives. Health Effects of Heroin Use While narcotics serve an essential medicinal purpose asanalgesics, or painkillers, they are often abused. Heroin, themost abused opiate, is derived from the opium poppy (Papaversomniferum). Heroin is generally used intravenously, the mostefficient and dangerous route of administration."Speedballs," injections of heroin mixed with cocaine,are particularly dangerous. Heroin can also be usedsubcutaneously, called "skin-popping." All of theseintravenous forms of use are associated with AIDS and hepatitis,as discussed earlier. In addition, heroin can be smoked or usedintranasally. Heroin is a particularly dangerous drug because of the easewith which a user can overdose, A lethal dose of heroin is only10 to 15 times a normal dose. According to Dr. Donald C. ThomasIII, former director of emergency care at the District ofColumbia General Hospital: Heroin numbs you to pain, gives you a euphoria, takes you awayfrom reality, makes you slower and changes appetites . . . Thereal problem for an addict is that the threshold between the doseof heroin that gives that effect, as opposed to the dose thatwill kill him by suppressing respiratory or cardiac centers inhis brain, is very narrow. Multiple overdose deaths sometimes result from one"batch" of heroin. In March 1985, for example,according to local press accounts, 8 people died and 14 werehospitalized in a few days in Washington, D.C., after injectingsome particularly potent heroin. Seven months earlier, 10 peopledied in Washington within 8 days in a similar incident. It isstriking evidence of the drug's overpowering influence that thisrisk of sudden death apparently poses no deterrent to theseasoned user. As expressed by one heroin addict: A true, full-blown drug addict would follow a morgue wagon toits origin of overdose to obtain that substance. Cultivation Heroin entering the United States is produced from opiumpoppies, which are harvested in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan(Southwest Asia, the Golden Crescent); Burma, Thailand and Laos(Southeast Asia, the Golden Triangle); and Mexico. In 1984, anestimated 51 percent of United States heroin came from SouthwestAsia, 32 percent from Mexico and 17 percent from Southeast Asia. From 1983 to 1984 illicit opium production decreased inSouthwest Asia. This change resulted from decreased figures foropium production in Afghanistan caused by adverse weatherconditions and a change in the methodology used to estimate opiumproduction in Afghanistan. While total opium production forSouthwest Asia decreased in 1984, significant productionincreases were noted in Southeast Asia and Mexico. Opium poppy cultivation has begun to appear in the UnitedStates as well. During a Federal raid in August 1985, more than4,000 opium plants were discovered in Vermont, Washington,Michigan and California. Although officials of the DrugEnforcement Administration believe this opium was used forsmoking, the potential for domestic heroin production exists. While America's heroin addict population has remainedrelatively stable, the problem of heroin addiction in Europe hasincreased significantly in recent years. According to a 1984United Nations report: The drug abuse and trafficking situation in Western Europe isgrim and deteriorating . . . Western Europe remains seriouslyaffected by heroin abuse which is a major public health problem. The number of heroin addicts in the opium producing and othercountries is also significant. There is a greater sense of the need for internationalcooperation on the problem of drugs, in part because drugproducing nations are now feeling the effects of drug abuse, withwhich the industrialized world has dealt for decades. Thisdevelopment is critical if drug control efforts, including croperadication, interdiction and drug education, are to besuccessful. Processing The production of heroin begins after the petals of the opiumpoppy flower have fallen. Several incisions are then made in theseed pod from which sap oozes. The sap dries, darkens and becomesgummy, and is scraped from the pod. This dried sap is raw opium.Each pod can be incised up to five different times. To produce one kilogram of heroin, a precipitating agent isadded to 10-12 kilograms of opium. This mixture is pressed,leaving one kilogram of morphine base. This base is treated withacetic anhydride, which yields one kilogram of heroin. In anotherproduction method, poppies are allowed to mature and dry.Alkaloids are then extracted from these plants leaving poppystraw concentrate, which is sold in a brownish powder form. Marijuana Scope of the Problem According to the most recent National Survey on Drug Abuse,which was conducted in 1982, 50-60 million Americans,approximately 20-25 percent of the entire population, have triedmarijuana; and 20 million people use the drug at least once permonth. Marijuana use has been widespread in this country for thelast two decades. Both the number of users and the duration ofmarijuana's popularity indicate that marijuana use is firmlyentrenched in American society. Although some surveys indicate that the number of marijuanausers has been declining recently, levels of use remainsignificantly higher than for any other illicit drug. TheNational Survey on Drug Abuse indicates a decline in marijuanause for some age groups. Yet the survey shows that in 1982, 11.5percent of 12-17-year-olds and 27 percent of 18-25 year olds usedmarijuana at least once per month. The study indicates a slight,but steady, increase in marijuana use among people over age 25.In 1977, 3.3 percent reported monthly marijuana use, comparedwith 6.0 percent in 1982. According to the survey of high schoolseniors conducted each year by the University of MichiganInstitute for Social Research, marijuana use among high schoolseniors peaked in 1978, when 37 percent of these studentsreported monthly use of marijuana and 11 percent reported dailyuse of the drug. By 1984 these figures had dropped to 25 percentand 5 percent respectively. However, this decline in marijuanause ended in 1985 when 26 percent of the survey respondentsreported monthly marijuana use. Marijuana consumption and the number of marijuana-associatedemergency room visits have remained relatively steady in recentyears. In 1984 Americans consumed an estimated 7,800-9,200 metrictons of marijuana, as compared with 8,000-9,600 metric tons in1983. Use of marijuana in conjunction with other drugs,particularly PCP, diazepam and cocaine, increased in 1984. The Marijuana User Marijuana is probably used by a wider demographiccross-section of American society than any other drug. Thiswidespread use was recognized by the 1972 National Commission onMarihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse: The stereotype of the marihuana [sic] user as a marginalcitizen has given way to a composite picture of large segments ofAmerican youth, children of the dominant majority and very muchpart of the mainstream of American life. While it appears that marijuana, like other drugs, is mostcommonly used by those between the ages of 18 and 25, its use isby no means confined to that age group. One analysis of marijuanause found that: Marijuana is now found at the Friday afternoon brainstormingsessions of a New York publishing house. In the cabs of long-haultrucks. In the office of a president of a cosmetic firm. Even, itis alleged, among executives of major American banks. According to the 1982 National Survey on Drug Abuse, 23percent of 16 and 17 year olds, 8 percent of 14 and 15 year olds,and 2 percent of 12 and 13 year olds used marijuana at least onceper month. Surveys have indicated marijuana use in children asyoung as nine years old. Health Effects of Marijuana Use Marijuana includes any part of the plant Canabis sativa. Inaddition to marijuana, the following forms of cannabis are alsoabused: hashish, a resin of the plant; hashish oil, a liquidconcentrate derived from cannabis; and sinsemilla, from thefemale cannabis plant. The effects of marijuana use have been the subject ofexaggeration and misunderstanding for decades. In 1936, forexample, the film "Reefer Madness" portrayed thoseeffects as instant violence and insanity. In 1972 the NationalCommission on Marihuana [sic] and Drug Abuse embraced theopposite extreme: No conclusive evidence exists of any physical damage,disturbances of bodily processes or proven human fatalitiesattributable solely to even high doses of marijuana . . . [The]few consistently observed transient effects on bodily functionseem to suggest that marihuana [sic] is a rather unexcitingcompound of negligible immediate toxicity at the doses usuallyconsumed in this country. Both views have been refuted by medical evidence gatheredsince the early 1970's. Today marijuana is described as "themost chemically complex of all commonly used illegal drugs."Marijuana contains 421 known chemicals, which when smoked arecombusted into more than 2,000 chemical compounds. Marijuana isvariously classified as a stimulant, depressant and hallucinogenbecause its effects vary among users. Those chemicals found only in cannabis are calledcannabinoids. The primary intoxicant in marijuana isdelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The concentration of The inmarijuana has steadily increased over the last decade as a resultof improved agricultural techniques. Analysis of marijuanasamples indicates that the average percentage of The in marijuanahas increased from .7 percent in 1973, to 3.1 percent in 1982, to5.6 percent in 1983. The potencies have been reported as high as14 percent in domestically produced sinsemilla. Since 1967 when the first intensive government researchprogram on marijuana began, over 7,000 scientific papers havebeen published on the subject. Contrary to the findings of the1972 National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, adversephysical and psychological effects associated with marijuana usehave been demonstrated. The measurement of long-term effects ofmarijuana use are at present problematic because marijuanasmoking has been prevalent in the United States for onlyapproximately 15 to 20 years, shorter than the latency period formany marijuana-related diseases. In the case of tobacco it wasnot until after 50 years of heavy use that there was ampleevidence to issue warnings about its effects. Despite the common public perception that marijuana is lessharmful than tobacco, scientific evidence indicates thatmarijuana, in fact, causes substantially more adverse healtheffects, due in part to the properties of the drug itself and themanner in which it is smoked. Marijuana is not filtered, as aremost tobacco cigarettes, and marijuana smoke is generally inhaledmore deeply and held in the lungs longer than tobacco smoke.Marijuana smoke has been found to contain many of the samechemicals as tobacco smoke; indeed it has 50 percent more ofcancer-causing hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. According to the American Lung Association, marijuana smokingharms the lungs and may cause bronchitis, emphysema and lungcancer. Evidence supporting this conclusion has been building fora number of years. For example, a 1976 study reported thatexaminations of human lung tissue "have found malignantcellular changes after shorter periods of exposure to marijuanasmoke than to tobacco smoke." One comprehensive review ofmarijuana projects that: Starting in the latter 1980's, we predict an increase in therate of lung cancer among middle-aged people, representing themarijuana epidemic that began in the mid-sixties. Those smokingboth tobacco and marijuana are most at risk. Marijuana use can also adversely affect both male and femalereproduction. Marijuana use by pregnant women is particularlydangerous and has been linked to lowered birth weight, fetalabnormalities and nervous disorders in offspring. These adversephysical effects are magnified because cannabinoids, being fatsoluble, collect in the fatty organs of the body, such as thetestis or ovaries, brain and liver. This is of particular concernbecause marijuana is used by a large population of young peoplewhose lungs, reproductive organs, and other parts of their bodiesare still maturing and are particularly vulnerable to the adverseeffects of drugs. In addition to these physical effects of marijuana use,several psychological and behavioral effects have also beenassociated with the drug. These behavioral changes have beencalled "the amotivational syndrome." Although lack ofmotivation may often precede marijuana use, many clinicians haveconcluded that: Motivational effects are directly related to use and . . .following cessation of marijuana use normal motivation mayreturn. In addition to the effects of marijuana on motivation,marijuana use has been found to affect short-term memory,concentration, and logical thinking. A 1982 report concerning theimpact of marijuana use on education concludes that: Every element of learning is incompatible with either theacute intoxication or the chronic mental change that marijuanause can bring. A 1980 study reported that use of marijuana 20 times or moreper month is "positively correlated with absenteeism andpoor school achievement among high school seniors." Theseconclusions are particularly disturbing given the fact that tensof thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of adolescentsuse marijuana every day. A final concern in this area, marijuana's role as a"gateway" to subsequent use of more dangerous drugs,cannot be categorized as either physical or psychological. Whilemany beliefs about marijuana have been proven wrong by subsequentresearch, this concept has been affirmed. This"gateway" theory does not indicate that marijuana usewill definitely lead to the use of other drugs; however,according to a review of marijuana studies conducted by theDepartment of Health and Human Services, Statistically, there is little question that use, particularlyheavier use, is associated with a likelihood of experimentationwith other drugs. Synthetic Drugs Scope of the Problem Many illicit drugs do not occur naturally. Unlike cocaine,heroin and marijuana, which are derived from plants, syntheticdrugs are produced solely from chemicals. These synthetic drugsinclude stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens, known asdangerous drugs; synthetic narcotics, such as methadone; andcontrolled substance analogs, often called "designerdrugs." A controlled substance analog has a chemicalstructure similar to a controlled substance, and is designed toproduce a similar effect. Use of synthetic drugs is widespread in the United States.More than six million Americans used synthetic drugs fornon-medical purposes in 1982. Over 2.5 million people abuseddepressants, approximately 2.8 million abused stimulants, andalmost 1 million abused hallucinogens. Consumption of"dangerous drugs" increased 15 percent between 1983 and1984, from an estimated 2.66 billion dosage units to 3.06 billiondosage units. The greatest increases were associated withmethamphetamine and phencyclidine (PCP). Methamphetamine-relatedemergency room visits increased 20 percent from 1983 to 1984, anddeaths associated with both amphetamine and methamphetamine alsoincreased in 1984. Statistics regarding the use of controlled substance analogsare difficult to compile. This is because the use of thesesubstances is a relatively new phenomenon, and medical examinershave generally failed to identify controlled substance analogs asa cause of death. Despite these difficulties, one syntheticanalog has been responsible for the deaths of at least 100 peopleon the West Coast. While most of these deaths occurred inCalifornia, many law enforcement authorities fear that productionand use of controlled substance analogs might spread across thecountry because of the ease of production and large profit marginassociated with these drugs. This spread has already occurred inat least one instance: drug treatment program directors inCalifornia, Florida, New York, Texas and Virginia have reportedcases of use of the controlled substance analog MDMA. Synthetic Drug Users While synthetic drugs are used for a wide range of medicinalpurposes, they are also widely abused by individuals from allsocioeconomic groups. According to a 1978 study of individuals intreatment for stimulant and/or depressant drug abuse, 68 percentwere men, 61 percent were white, 20 percent black and 19 percentof another ethnicity, 59 percent were unemployed, 77 percent hadpreviously been treated for drug abuse, 59 percent were 25 yearsof age or older, and 46 percent had less than a twelfth gradeeducation. While most people associate heroin use with crime, a 1982study by the RAND Corporation found violent crime to be committedmost often by multi-drug users, particularly those usingcombinations including dangerous drugs. Certain synthetic drugsare particularly associated with crime. A study of all arresteesin Washington, D.C., from May 1984 to April 1985 found that PCP,an hallucinogen, is the drug most often detected in thesearrestees. An average of over 30 percent of all adults arrestedin Washington, D.C., during this period tested positive for PCPuse. A study of almost 5,000 male arrestees in New York City in1984 found that 12 percent of those arrested had PCP in theirbodies. Health Effects of Synthetic Drug Use Tolerance to stimulants develops quickly. Because of the"crash," or depression, followed by stimulant use,users tend to take stimulants more often in order to compensatefor or avoid the post-stimulant letdown. Stimulant users aresubject to a vicious cycle in which they must take depressants atnight to be able to reverse the stimulant's effects. Stimulantscan cause physical dependence and death. Withdrawal ischaracterized by depression, fatigue and excessive sleep, whichmay last for several days. Other withdrawal symptoms, includinganxiety and thoughts of suicide, may last for weeks or months. Depressants can also cause tolerance and physical dependence.Abuse of depressants is marked by impaired judgment, slurredspeech and loss of motor coordination. Depressants areparticularly dangerous when used in combination with alcohol orother drugs. Heavy use of depressants can cause a weak, rapidpulse, shallow respiration, coma and death. Hallucinogens alter mood, and, in large doses, cause delusionsand hallucinations. This impaired judgment can lead a user tophysically harm himself or others. "Flashbacks," inwhich the user has a brief recurrence of the psychedelic effectsof hallucinogens, sometimes occur long after the drug is used.Tolerance and psychological dependence can also result. PCP,often called "Angel Dust," is one of the most dangerousand widely abused hallucinogens. Reactions to PCP areunpredictable and include euphoria, depression, anxiety or panic.PCP use is associated with extremely violent behavior, includingassault, rape, and murder. Feelings of omnipotence sometimes leada PCP user to suicidal behavior, including walking in front ofmoving vehicles or jumping out of windows. Controlled substance analogs are designed to mimic the effectsof various drugs and are particularly dangerous because of theirtoxicity. One synthetic analog, 3-methyl fentanyl, is up to 1,000times more potent than morphine. According to Dr. Robert J.Roberton of California's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs,"You could kill 50 people with the amount that fits on thehead of a pin." Fentanyl analogs, the most commonly abused controlledsubstance analogs, produce a feeling of euphoria similar to thatassociated with heroin use. These drugs also produce respiratorydepression and muscle rigidity. MPTP, which is a synthetic analogof the narcotic meperidine, causes brain damage, Parkinson'sdisease and death. Although Parkinson's disease usually strikespeople in their fifties and sixties, people of various ages, whohave used MPTP, have contracted the disease, which causes slowedmovement, tremors, rigidity, dementia and death. The neurologicaldamage associated with use of MPTP is irreversible. Drug Abuse Fuels Drug Trafficking Drug abuse in the United States is a problem of vast andgrowing proportions Millions of Americans use cocaine, heroin,marijuana, or synthetic drugs, or combinations of these drugs.Consumption of cocaine and dangerous drugs has increased recentlyas have the deleterious health effects associated with then. Thedownward trend in marijuana use which began in 1979 appears tohave ended at least temporarily in 1985. Particularly dangerous forms of drug use have increased duringthe last few years. Use of "crack," coca base which issmoked and which has been called the most potent, addictive, andcheapest form of cocaine, has become prevalent in the New YorkCity area. Use of "designer drugs," some of which havecaused Parkinson's disease, have been blamed for over 100 deaths.There is evidence of a link between intravenous drug use and thecontraction of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Drug abuse affects much more than the individual drug user; italso impacts on families, communities and entire governments. Thetaint of drugs has reached into virtually every aspect ofAmerican life, from public safety to the integrity ofprofessional sports. These problems and the full range of massivegovernment and private responses discussed in this report,including increased education and enforcement efforts, expandedintelligence and interdiction programs, and diversions ofmilitary resources, costing billions of dollars, is the directresult of a single cause: the destructive self-indulgence ofindividual drug purchasers. Each time a drug user buys cocaine,heroin, or other drugs, he makes a contribution to organizedcrime. Such contributions are the sole sustenance of theviolence, corruption, illness and death that trafficking groupsbring to this and other societies.

Large trafficking organizations dominate the illicitdrug market. These groups include the "families" ofAmerica's La Cosa Nostra, as well as an array of more recentlyidentified crime groups such as the Sicilian "Mafia,"outlaw motorcycle gangs and groups based in the Nigerian andColombian communities. While La Cosa Nostra has historically beeninvolved in narcotics trafficking, newer organizations, in manyways quite different from La Cosa Nostra, now play a major rolein the drug trade. Generally, these newer groups develop solelyaround drug trafficking operations and are activity-specific,dependent only on drug-related criminal activity for income. Theytend to be more fluidly organized than La Cosa Nostra, and arenot as self-contained but are marked by a degree of violence andcorruption unsurpassed by any other criminal activity. Organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking, however,share a central feature with other organized crime groups in thatthey consist of a core criminal group and a specialized criminalsupport designed to facilitate illicit activity. This"core/support" configuration is one this Commission hasfound to be common to all organized crime groups today. Cocaine Trafficking America's cocaine supply at present originates exclusively inSouth America. Coca is cultivated principally in Peru, Bolivia,Colombia and Ecuador, and conversion laboratories have beenlocated in Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela. Other South Americanand Caribbean countries serve as transshipment sites. All phasesof the cocaine trade, including cultivation, processing anddistribution have expanded since 1984, and the industry shows nosigns of diminishing despite the fact that cocaine supply alreadyexceeds consumer demand. Control of the cocaine industry has traditionally beenmaintained by a cartel of Colombian traffickers. Colombian groupsare the largest, wealthiest, most sophisticated organizationstrafficking in cocaine. A key to their domination of the markethas been their control of the processing laboratories used toconvert coca grown traditionally in Bolivia and Peru. Export ofthe drug to the United States has also been handled almostexclusively by Colombian trafficking organizations. WhileColombians currently control an estimated 75 percent of thecocaine distributed to the United States, their domination hasbeen lessened recently both by the Colombian government'simposition of severe restrictions on the importation of chemicalsessential to cocaine processing and by the destruction of cocaineprocessing sites throughout Colombia by government authorities.In 1984 three major Colombian conversion laboratories werediscovered and destroyed: at Tranquilandia, the largest facility,ten metric tons of cocaine and 10,000 barrels of processingchemicals were seized. In total, Colombian authoritiesconfiscated 16 metric tons of cocaine in 1984, a 600 percentincrease from the 2.5 metric tons seized in the previous year.The pressures on cocaine traffickers were compounded in that yearby the Colombian government's decision to extradite drugtraffickers to the United States, and by the subsequent issuanceof warrants for the arrest of several major traffickers. Intensified Colombian law enforcement measures have hadsignificant impact on trafficking operations. The initiativeshave prompted many traffickers to seek refuge in other SouthAmerican countries, and in some cases to relocate theirprocessing laboratories. These incidents have resulted in ageographic dispersal of cocaine processing and export activities,most notably to Bolivia and Peru. While it appeared initiallythat activity in these countries was sponsored and overseen byColombian traffickers, increasing evidence suggests that groupsin both countries are becoming self-sufficient. Suchdevelopments, however, remain an exception to the prevailingColombian dominance. Despite the spread of cocaine activity through South America,Colombian groups have left little room in the cocaine trade forsmall-scale smugglers. While some independent operators andsmaller smuggling groups occasionally work independently of theColombian cartel, most are tied to the larger organization in atleast a contractor relationship. The Colombian Connection: Origins The Colombian involvement in U.S. cocaine trafficking can betraced to the influx of Cuban citizens to South Florida after theCastro Revolution in the early 1960's. Some of the Cuban-settledcommunities became bases for the continuation of establishedCuban organized crime networks known as the "CubanMafia." The Cuban Mafia had been a major distributor of thecocaine in Cuba, where the drug has long been accepted as asocial luxury, and thus had existing connections with SouthAmerican cocaine trafficking organizations. At first, the FloridaCuban Mafia factions imported only enough cocaine to satisfymembers of their own community, but by the mid-1960's, they beganto import greater quantities of the drug in an effort to expanddistribution and increase profit. By 1965 Colombians suppliednearly 100 percent of the cocaine moving through the Cubannetworks. Colombians refined the drug and Cubans trafficked anddistributed it in the United States. The system worked for atime, but the Colombians increasingly desired control of theentire operation. Through the late 1960's and early 1970's theybecame more involved in cocaine production, and increased theirtrafficking role. By 1978 Colombian traffickers had cut all tieswith the Cubans and assumed the dominant role they now play insupplying cocaine to the American market. Colombian groups have continued to control the U.S. cocainemarket through the 1980's for a number of reasons.Geographically, Colombia is well-positioned both to receive cocafrom Peru and Bolivia and to export the processed drug to theUnited States either by air or by sea. In addition, the country'svast central forests effectively conceal clandestine processinglaboratories and air strips, which facilitate the traffic.Perhaps most importantly, the Colombians have a momentum bybenefit of their early involvement in the cocaine trade. Theyhave evolved from small, disassociated groups intocompartmentalized organizations and are sophisticated andsystematized in their approach to trafficking cocaine in theUnited States. Further, groups in the Colombian population in theU.S. provide traffickers access to this country and often servesas a distribution network for Colombian cocaine. The Colombian Organization The major Colombian trafficking organizations are structuredto control each intermediate step required in processing andexporting cocaine. Like traditional organized crime groups, theyare built of interdependent and essential component"divisions," each with a specialized area ofresponsibility. Different members act as laborers, processors,transporters, financiers and enforcers. In addition,organizations generally supplement their regular membership withcriminal support of affiliates who perform services on a feebasis. Few members of any organizational division are aware ofthe others involved in the enterprise, and trafficking bosses arewell-insulated and protected by their organizations. Organization laborers and processors prepare cocaine for U.S.consumption. Most laborers in the cultivation phase are Peruvianor Bolivian peasants who cultivate and harvest coca in remoteareas of the Eastern Andes, then process the coca leaves to basein nearby villages. The growers are allied in small, independentgroups, but are typically financed, overseen, and protected bymembers of a larger Colombian organization. Processed coca base is usually flown on light aircraft fromthe mountain villages to Colombian processing facilities by thosemembers of the Colombian organization responsible fortransportation. The planes land at clandestine airstrips, oftensimple mud runways, located near the processing laboratories. Thelaboratories vary widely in size, ranging from crudesmall-quantity operations to large, sophisticated complexes, andcan be found both in Colombia's jungle and urban areas. Coca base is typically processed to cocaine hydrochloride inthe laboratories, then bagged and taped into kilogram packages,which are sometimes coded to indicate a particular United Statesdestination. The packages are loaded into duffle bags or burlapsacks, then moved by the transportation group to a "stashhouse," a storage facility usually located near a seaport ora clandestine airstrip. The cocaine is held at the stash houseuntil it is exported from Colombia. Colombian trafficking organizations currently export anestimated 62 percent of the cocaine they process on privateaircraft. The remaining 38 percent is shipped on ocean vessels orsmuggled on commercial air carriers. Most shipments are smuggledout of Colombia from the country's northern coastal region, theGuajira peninsula. Principal smuggling centers include the citiesof Santa Marta, Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Medellin. Inaddition, a significant percentage of processed cocaine leavesColombia from airstrips located near larger processing facilitiesin the jungles. Typically, Colombian organizations oversee each cocaineshipment from cultivation through wholesale transactions in theUnited States. Retail and street-level sales are handled by avariety of smaller groups and individuals in this country. The money generated by the wholesale cocaine transaction ismaintained for the organization by financial experts familiarwith international banking, who are responsible for laundering,banking and investing drug profits, and for assuring that aportion of the drug profit is returned to Colombia forreinvestment in the organization's cocaine enterprise. Thecartel's own financial experts are supported by a complement ofbankers, lawyers and other professionals in the United States,who play a crucial role in facilitating these transactions. Colombian trafficking organizations, like other organizedcrime groups, rely on "enforcement" through violenceand intimidation to protect their inventory and profits."Enforcement" occurs both in Colombia and in the UnitedStates and includes the collection of debts owed to theorganization and the elimination of interference fromcompetitors, informants and law enforcement officials. Pilots: The American Affiliates Cocaine is ordinarily smuggled from South America to theUnited States for major trafficking organizations by Americancitizens acting as mercenary pilots. Recruits includeex-military, commercial and private pilots, and in some cases,unlicensed aviators. The speed, mobility and evasive capabilitiesof air transport have made it the preferred node of shipmentamong Colombian traffickers, and many have built airstrips eithernear their processing centers or along the coastlines to permitthe fast direct export of cocaine. On Colombia's north coastalone, over 150 clandestine landing strips and threeinternational airports facilitate smuggling activities. Individual pilots are generally responsible for purchasing orleasing transportation vehicles and hiring flight crews.Obtaining a plane for purchase seldom presents any difficulty,since many aircraft are regularly advertised for sale in a numberof trade periodicals. One popular journal, Trade-a-Plane, ispublished three times each month and advertises thousands ofaircraft available for sale in each issue. Planes are alsoavailable for purchase at numerous government auctions of seizedproperties. These events often allow traffickers to repurchaseaircraft, which they were previously forced to forfeit. Because traffickers attempt to ship the largest possiblequantities of cocaine to the widest range of destinations in theUnited States, the aircraft selected for smuggling generallyrepresent the optimum balance between range and cargo capacity.The most popular of these are conventional light twin engineplanes, such as the Piper Aztec, Piper Navajo and the Cessna 400series. Most such planes can transport about a ton of cocaineover a range of about 1,800 miles and can stay airborne for 11and one hours with standard fuel systems. Larger airplanes suchas DC-3 aircraft are common on shuttle flights between the UnitedStates and various transshipment points; the fastest aircraft arealways preferred when available. To maximize range and capability, smuggling planes are oftenoutfitted with auxiliary fuel systems. These auxiliary systemsmay be attached to the outside body of the aircraft or the wing,but must be inspected and approved by the Federal AviationAdministration each time the outfitted aircraft prepares forflight. A favored auxiliary system for cocaine traffickers is thecollapsible rubber fuel "bladder," which may be placedin the plane's fuselage, and simply folded up or thrown awayafter the fuel contained within is used. The space occupied bythe bladder on the trip to Colombia can be utilized for cocainetransport on the return journey. Bladders are, under allcircumstances, prohibited by Federal law. Although the legitimate need for auxiliary fuel systems isvery limited, the systems are well-advertised and readilyavailable. One trafficker told the Commission he purchasedbladders and other long-range fuel systems regularly, alwayspaying the seller with "suitcases full of cash." Heclaims his cash was never questioned or refused. Traffic From Colombia to the United States: The Hydra's Head Smugglers use a vast number of both air and sea traffickingroutes to transport cocaine from South America to the UnitedStates. The most commonly travelled routes are through theWindward Passage between Cuba and Haiti, through the YucatanChannel between Mexico and Cuba, and through the Mona Passage,bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Traditionally, 90 percent of the cocaine shipped by theseroutes has entered the United States at points along the Floridacoast; traffickers now, however, more frequently delivershipments to all the States along the Gulf Coast and elsewherethroughout this country. Cocaine traffic also now runs directlyfrom Colombia's west coast to California and other westernstates. These shifts are perceived as a response by traffickersto increased law enforcement pressure in South Florida,specifically to the intensified efforts of the SouthFlorida/Caribbean Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.The theme is a common one: as law enforcement closes off onepoint of entry to drug traffickers, traffickers develop many newpoints of entry as replacements. Air Shipment Nearly two-thirds of the cocaine exported from South Americato the United State is transported by general aviation aircraft.Planes of all sizes, ranging from small turbo-prop craft to largeC-123 cargo transport planes, are used for drug shipment. Smallaircraft, which cannot carry adequate fuel to allow direct flightfrom Colombia to the United States, must refuel at transshipmentpoints between the two countries. These contact points areindispensable, and are located throughout Central America, theDominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.Transshipment points may be simply refueling stations, or may bebases or stations equipped to allow cocaine off-loading andrepackaging. From the transshipment points, cocaine is generallyferried to the United States by small planes or boats. Mexico has gained popularity as a transshipment point since1980. Although coca cultivation has not been observed in Mexico,an estimated 10 to 20 percent of the cocaine exported to theUnited States currently transits that country. Three Mexicantransshipment patterns are typical. First, Mexican traffickersobtain cocaine in South America, transport it to Mexico, thentraffic the drug overland into the United States. Second,Colombian or American couriers travel by commercial aircraft fromSouth America to Mexico, then cross the border into this country.Finally, Colombian or North American traffickers use Mexico'snumerous clandestine airstrips, especially in Yucatan, forrefueling and for loading purposes; the smuggling plane in usemay continue directly into the United States, or the shipment maybe broken into smaller loads, then trafficked overland by Mexicanorganizations. The majority of cocaine shipped through Mexico istransported to the United States by car, truck or bus, but asignificant amount is smuggled aboard small aircraft. The Mexicangroups, formerly limited primarily to trafficking heroin andmarijuana, have eagerly expanded their role as middlemen betweenColombian traffickers and American consumers. Maritime Shipment An estimated 18 percent (15 tons in 1984) of the cocainetrafficked into the United States is exported from South Americaby sea vessel. All types of ships are used for smuggling, fromsmall high-speed cigarette boats to large commercial cargocarriers. Colombians dominate maritime cocaine smuggling, andmost shipments depart that country's north coastline, whichfeatures three major seaports and countless debarkation ports forsmaller craft. Approximately one-half of the cocaine exported bysea is concealed in commercial vessels, and a smaller percentageis shipped in private boats which are frequently outfitted withspecial compartments designed for drug storage. Small amounts ofcocaine are also often shipped on with marijuana onnon-commercial smuggling vessels. Maritime trafficking routes have shifted significantly in thepast five years, primarily in response to increased lawenforcement surveillance. While a major portion of the maritimetraffic formerly flowed directly into South Florida, traffickersnow increasingly use the longer eastern routes through theCaribbean to the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts, as well asdirect routes to the U.S. west coast. These routes make smugglingmore expensive for traffickers, since they require largervessels, larger crews and more sophisticated electronicequipment. Case Study: Devoe Airlines Devoe Airlines was a scheduled commuter air service operatingbetween Miami and smaller Florida cities during the early 1980's.Owned by Miami pilot Jack Devoe, the business was essentially afront for a Colombian drug trafficking operation, which includedregular large quantity marijuana and cocaine smuggling. In total,8 to 10 contract pilots employed by Devoe were involved in over100 trafficking flights over a five year period and carriedroughly 7,000 pounds of cocaine from South America to the UnitedStates. Jack Devoe estimates that his flying organization grossedmillions of dollars each month during peak smuggling periods. Devoe's trafficking pilots initially travelled non-stop routesbetween the United States and Colombia, but developed atransshipment point on Little Derby Island in the Bahamas forpurposes of "security . . . [and] police protection" inthe 1980's. Devoe hired six to eight employees to work as neededat the island base to unload and repackage drug shipments. Therewas no interference from Bahamian law enforcement at the LittleDarby base "as long as the payments [to officials] were ontime." Typically operating mid-size turbo-prop aircraft, Devoe pilotsdeparted for Colombia either from the base at Little Derby Islandor from Florida airports. Their route took them through theWindward Passage generally to Colombian locations about 60 milessouth of the equator. In the early stages of the operation,landings were made at official Colombian airports including theairfields at Santa Marta and Riohacha. In at least one instance,cocaine was openly loaded onto the smuggling aircraft at Riohachaairport. In the early 1980's Devoe shifted landings toclandestine jungle airstrips maintained by the organization'scocaine supplier, Pepe Cabrera. This system streamlined thetrafficking process by eliminating transport of the cocaine to anairport. The cocaine shipment was loaded directly onto theaircraft near the strip, where the plane was simultaneouslyprepared for the return flight. Generally, Devoe pilots returned to the United States withinone day. Their preferred return route extended along theColombia/Venezuela border, over Haiti, and to the Bahamian baseon Little Derby Island. There, cocaine was sealed into the wingfuel tanks of a small aircraft and flown directly into SouthFlorida for delivery to the cartel's representative there. The Devoe organization's methods for avoiding interdictionbetween South America and the United States were relativelysimple and typical of such smuggling operations. A Devoe pilotlearned the frequencies of DEA surveillance aircraft on oneoccasion by "acting like a helicopter buff" inspectinga DEA Cobra pursuit helicopter parked near the Devoe hangar.Inside the helicopter the pilot copied the frequencies from aclipboard hanging on the instrument panel. As the pilot explainedto the Commission: By [subsequently] using our scanner and our knowledge of thefrequencies in use, we could monitor the activities of DEA planes. . . we could learn not only the activities of the planes, butalso go up and check the plane out. By learning what types ofaircraft DEA was using we could plan our own strategy moreeffectively . . . Devoe also regularly sent "cover-flight" aircraftahead of the smuggling planes along the trafficking route tomonitor DEA and Customs Service surveillance patrols by radio.These planes, which carried no drug cargo, were also used todecoy pursuit aircraft. Once in the United States, Devoe strategyfor clearing Customs inspection was to: ". . . act normally and file a flight plan, come in andland, and let them inspect the airplane . . . Customs inspectorswere far less interested in a lengthy examination of my plane ifI came in on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of the televisedfootball game. If the Dolphins were playing, that was evenbetter." Using these tactics, Devoe Airlines was able to complete over100 trafficking flights from Colombia without interference fromlaw enforcement authorities. Case Study: Barry Seal Adler Berriman Seal, a former TWA 747 captain, flew cocainefrom Colombia to the United States for over seven years duringthe late 1970's and early 1980's. Seal was recruited as atrafficking pilot by a personal friend who worked for theColombian cocaine trafficking organization headed by Jorge Ochoa,and eventually worked directly with that organization'sleadership. Initially, Seal flew direct trafficking flights betweenLouisiana, and Colombia. He piloted a number of differentsmuggling aircraft, the largest of which was a Vietnam-vintageC-123 capable of holding tons of packaged cocaine. Seal alwaysdeparted and returned to his Louisiana base at night to reducechances of interdiction. His typical route took him over theYucatan Peninsula (not over the more heavily patrolled Yucatanchannel) and directly over Central America to the eastern tip ofHonduras, then south to any one of a number of airstrips andairports in north central Colombia. According to Seal, the Ochoa organization paid Colombianofficials bribes of $10,000 to $25,000, per flight for a"window," i.e., a specific time, position and altitudedesignated for the smuggling flight's penetration of theColombian air space. If this payment was not made, the aircraftwas susceptible to interception by Colombian authorities. Sealgenerally arrived in Colombia at dawn. His aircraft was loadedwith cocaine and refueled within an hour, sometimes withinfifteen minutes; and he returned immediately to the UnitedStates. Seal used two fairly simple techniques to avoid interdictionon his return trip to the United States: both were effectivebecause of the heavy helicopter traffic running between the GulfCoast States and the hundreds of oil rigs located off shore.First, when he reached the middle of the Gulf on his return trip,Seal slowed his aircraft to 110-120 knots and was thus perceivedby monitoring radar as a helicopter, not a plane. Secondly, at adistance of about 50 miles off the United States coast, hedropped the aircraft to an altitude of 500-1000 feet in order toco-mingle with the helicopter traffic, and thereby arouse evenless suspicion. Once in United States airspace, Seal proceeded to prearrangedpoints 40 to 50 miles inland. The points were mapped out inadvance with Loran C, a long-range navigational instrument.Further inland, he was generally joined by a helicopter. The twoaircraft proceeded to a drop zone, where the helicopter hoveredclose to the ground. Seal then dropped the load of cocaine fromthe airplane on a parachute; the helicopter picked up the loadfrom the drop zone and delivered it to waiting automobiles, whicheventually moved the cocaine to Miami. Seal proceeded to land hisdrug-free aircraft at any nearby airport. Seal was well paid for his services. He claims his top fee forsmuggling a kilogram of cocaine was $5,000; an average load was300 kilograms. His most profitable single load netted him $1.5million. He was never apprehended in connection with thisoperation. Specialized Electronics: The Smuggler's Edge Like many trafficking pilots today, both Seal and Devoe reliedon sophisticated electronic equipment to maintain and securecommunications within their organization and to monitor lawenforcement surveillance efforts. Most devices used, whileexpensive, are readily available in the United States, andtrafficking organizations, of course, fund the purchase of anyequipment that will facilitate their operations. Seal, forexample, once spent over $200,000 cash on communication andsurveillance equipment for the Ochoa cocaine traffickingorganization here in the United States in a two-day period.Payments for this type of equipment are almost always made incash - sometimes suitcases full of cash - and are rarely refused. The communication devices most commonly used by traffickersinclude state of the art radio equipment, communicationscramblers, pocket pagers and encrypting devices. The equipmentis used to prevent law enforcement interception of communicationbetween traffickers. A scrambler, for example, attaches to anordinary radio, and "scrambles" the normal radiofrequency with a number of different codes. Only someone with areceiver coded to the particular scrambler frequency can decipherthe transmitted message; the transmission is unintelligible toall other receivers. Digital encryption devices are used to sendmessages in code, and are often secured so that they can beaccessed only after a security number is punched directly intothe device. The security feature allows only members of thetrafficking organization, who know the access code, to send ordecipher coded messages. The speed with which a digital messageis transmitted precludes radio tracking, at least by traditionaltriangulation. Among the other specialized devices used by traffickers todetect and avoid law enforcement surveillance are radaraltimeters, beacon-interrogating digital radar, position trackingequipment and long-range navigation instruments. Latestgeneration night vision goggles are also frequently used bytraffickers flying at low altitudes in darkness. The strap-ongoggles intensify any available light by a factor of 50,000 andgreatly reduce a smuggler's risk of interdiction by allowing himto fly his aircraft without lights. The Combined Effort A number of independent Colombian trafficking organizations,among them the largest and most powerful operations, work incollaboration on individual smuggling ventures. As described byDEA special agent Michael Fredericks, the resulting organizationis fluid: There is a level of organization that may involve . . . ahandful of people at the top. . . Below that level . . . thereare many workers who move between one organization and another. .. It seems that in the Colombian organizations, a laboratoryoperator may work for 1 [specific] trafficker . . . and not evenbe aware of it simple because of the levels of insulation. At the time of the preparation of this report, three men,Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasques, andCarlos Enrique Lehder-Rivas, were reported to control the mostsignificant trafficking organizations in Colombia. Known as"Los Grandes Mafiosos" in the Colombian press, eachdirects a separate organization, but the organizations work inconcert and exchange personnel and equipment in various instancesto maximize efficiency and profit. The resulting cartel systemaffords these traffickers numerous advantages, among them controlover the price and the quality of Colombian cocaine, greateraccess to smuggling and processing equipment, and a wide varietyof methods by which to avoid law enforcement. A chart detailing a temporary cooperative venture based inMedellin, Colombia, between the Pablo Escobar organization andthe Jorge Ochoa organization was confiscated from a mid-leveltrafficker involved in the operation, and was provided to theCommission by the Drug Enforcement Administration (Figure 2). Asdiagrammed, the Escobar and Ochoa organizations combined anddivided the trafficking responsibilities typically completed by asingle organization. The same component parts - labor,processing, transportation, finance and enforcement - werecarried over from the individual organizations, with the Escobargroup taking responsibility for production activities, and theOchoa group handling enforcement and finances. Colombia Cracks Down Through the 1970's cocaine traffickers operated throughoutColombia with little interference, and in fact with considerablesupport from the Colombian government. The situation changed inApril 1984 when drug traffickers assassinated Colombia's Ministerof Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Lara's assassination came twomonths after he authorized a raid on a major cocaine processingplant known as Tranquilandia in Southeastern Colombia's Llanosregion, which resulted in the destruction of over $1 billionworth of cocaine. Following Lara's assassination, ColombianPresident Belisario Betancur Cuartas declared a "war withoutquarter" on all drug smugglers and signed extradition ordersfor a number of known major traffickers. President Betancur alsoshifted trafficking trials to Colombia's military courts,increased eradication and interdiction efforts within hiscountry, and increased regulation of those chemicals necessaryfor processing coca base into cocaine. President Betancur's actions have had important ramificationsboth for traffickers and for other South and Central Americangovernments. When the intensified Colombian programs becameeffective, a number of major traffickers, among them Escobar,Lehder and Ochoa, went into hiding and moved their processingoperations to neighboring countries. In 1984 processinglaboratories as well as stockpiles of essential conversionchemicals were discovered and destroyed in Panama, Venezuela,Mexico and Canada. Evidence suggests that significant processingactivity is now also taking place in Nicaragua and Brazil. TheColombian regulation of ether and other essential precursorchemicals has resulted in an increase in cocaine processingactivity in the United States: 21 processing laboratories werediscovered and destroyed in South Florida in 1984 as opposed to11 in 1983. In March 1985 despite his status as a fugitive, Carlos Lehderappeared on Colombian television, filmed live from a jungleclearing by a Spanish film crew. Lehder used the televisionopportunity, which he had arranged, to appeal to the Colombianrevolutionary organizations to participate in the "cocainebonanza . . . the arm of the struggle against America." Healso characterized cocaine as the "Achilles heel of Americanimperialism." Lehder disappeared into the jungle after theinterview and remains at large, presumably in the remote junglesof Colombia. Heroin Trafficking Traditional Organized Crime: La Cosa Nostra and the FrenchConnection Heroin trafficking in this country first became big businessin the 1920's, when organized criminals based in New York City'sJewish community began to control the importation anddistribution of the drug. By the late 1930's, La Cosa Nostrajoined the Jewish groups in the heroin enterprise, importing thedrug from France, Asia and the Mideast. When these sources becameinaccessible during World War II, Mexico became the major U.S.heroin supplier. After the war, La Cosa Nostra took control of America's heroinmarket, this time importing most of its drug supply from Italianrefineries. When the Italian government banned the manufacture ofheroin in the early 1950's, La Cosa Nostra traffickers wereforced to look to other sources. A new system was quicklydevised, by which Turkish morphine base was refined to heroin inMarseilles, then shipped to Montreal or Sicily. Organized crimegroups located in these transshipment points then sent the heroindirectly to the United States. This arrangement, popularly knownas the "French Connection," allowed La Cosa Nostra tomonopolize the heroin trade from the 1980's through the early1970's. During the peak French Connection years, the LCNcontrolled an estimated 95 percent of all of the heroin enteringNew York City, as well as most of the heroin distributedthroughout the United States. The La Cosa Nostra heroin monopoly lasted until 1972, whenunder diplomatic pressure from the United States, Turkey bannedopium production and the French Connection collapsed. Amsterdamreplaced Marseilles as the center of European heroin traffic, andChicago, Los Angeles and Miami joined New York City as major U.S.distribution centers. Other trafficking groups rose to competewith the LCN for heroin dollars in New York City and throughoutthe country. Source Country Traffickers: Mexico In the five years after the collapse of the French Connection,Mexico became the major source of U.S. heroin. Mexico's rise waslogical: the country contains extensive regions suitable for bothopium cultivation and refining and shares a lightly guarded 2,000mile border with the United States. Mexicans could manufactureheroin and smuggle it into the United States with little risk ofdetection. This simplified trafficking system resulted inincreased Mexican heroin availability in the United States. For generations, opium has been grown in remote areas ofMexico's Sierra Madre Mountain states of Durango, Sinaloa andChihuahua. Culiacan, on the western side of the Sierra Madre, andDurango to the east, developed in the 1970's as major productioncenters for heroin destined for U.S. distribution. Traffickingorganizations are now entrenched in these areas, and are involvedin all phases of the heroin manufacture and distribution process.Opium gum is collected by peasants in isolated mountain areas andis transported by mule or carried by hand to nearby mountainvillages. Typically, village middlemen sell the opium to a drugtrafficking organization boss, who moves drugs to anorganization-held laboratory for processing to heroin. Mexicancouriers then transport the heroin to the members of thetrafficking organization in the United States. The major Mexicanheroin trafficking organizations supplying heroin to America aregenerally extended familial organizations, but loyal workerssometimes are given status as "quasi-family" members ofthe groups. The organizations work to eliminate competition andto control as completely as possible all aspects of the herointrade. Members act as opium cultivators, village middlemen, andheroin brokers and distributors. In the United States, theorganization typically controls distribution from the wholesalerto the retail distributor, but has little or no involvement instreet distribution. This is seen as an unnecessarily risky andlow-profit aspect of the business, and is left to outsiders. Violence is an integral part of Mexican trafficking.Organization members provide cultivators with semi-automatic andautomatic weapons to protect their crops; weapons are usedthroughout the trafficking system to eliminate informants, and tointimidate competitors and law enforcement officials. Corruptionof Mexican police officials is well-documented and is essentialto the smooth operation of the Mexican trafficking organizations. In 1984, Mexican traffickers provided 32 percent share of theheroin consumed in the United States. The figure is expected torise over the next several years due to the continued devaluationof the peso and improved agricultural technology. Case Study: The Herrera Family Since the early 1970's the Jamie Herrera-Navarres organizationhas been a major heroin smuggling power operative between Mexicoand the United States. The Herrera organization is aconfederation of families related by blood and marriage, althoughsome non-family members have been accepted into the group overtime. Older family members process opium and morphine base,younger members handle the drug sales and shipments in Mexico andin the United States. The Herrera organization is now estimatedto have 3,000 to 5,000 members, a significant portion of whom arenaturalized American citizens and illegal aliens residing in thiscountry. Despite the 1978 conviction and incarceration of JamieHerrera, and several key family members, the organization remainsactive. In July 1985, 135 persons in the United States,comprising eight separate Herrera-related distribution rings,were indicted in Chicago on drug trafficking charges. TheseHerrera groups allegedly trafficked heroin and marijuana fromMexico through El Paso to a middleman in Texas. From Texas, thedrugs were shipped to Chicago, then distributed throughout thecountry. This Herrera enterprise, only a small fragment of thetotal organization, is estimated to have had gross annual profitsof over $200 million. The arrests are expected to have asignificant effect on the Herrera organization, if only on atemporary basis. Source Country Traffickers: Southeast Asia Mexican heroin production decreased in the late 1970's due toenforcement, eradication and poor weather conditions. By 1980,Mexico provided only 25 percent of the heroin consumed in theUnited Stated, down from a peak level of 80 percent in 1975. Atthe same time, heroin production in Southeast Asia accelerateddramatically. By 1976, the "Golden Triangle" of Burma,Thailand and Laos supplied more than a third of the heroinconsumed in the United States; Mexico supplied the remainder.Golden Triangle heroin first gained popularity with Americanservicemen stationed in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam Warbecause it was readily available, inexpensive, and considerablymore pure than Mexican heroin. After the war, Golden Triangleheroin was exported to the United States in increasing amounts. Nearly 90 percent of the Golden Triangle opium is currentlyproduced in Burma. Two-thirds of this crop is produced in thenortheast area of the country, where control is shared by theBurmese Communist Party (BCP) and the Shan United Army (SUA).Both groups were at one time political insurgent organizationsbut are now almost entirely devoted to obtaining profit for theproduction, smuggling and sale of heroin base. They deriveconsiderable income from "taxes" and fees they levy onopium growers and heroin producers and traffickers. This incomeis used to purchase weapons, to be utilized not in furtherance ofpolitical goals, but for protection of each group's narcoticsenterprise. Traditionally, the two groups have coexistedpeacefully: the BCP has acted as the major opium supplier inSoutheast Asia and the SUA has been the area's major refiner andtrafficker. The BCP has recently become involved in refining anddistribution activities, and the organizations are currently inconflict. Opium and morphine base produced in northeastern Burmatransported by horse and donkey caravans to refineries along theThailand-Burma border for conversion to heroin and heroin base.Most of the finished products are shipped across the border intovarious towns in North Thailand and down to Bangkok for furtherdistribution to international markets. In the past major ethnicChinese traffickers in Bangkok have controlled much of theforeign sales and movement of Southeast Asian heroin fromThailand, but a combination of law enforcement pressure,publicity and a regional drought has significantly reduced theirrole. As a consequence, many less-predominant traffickers inBangkok and other parts of Thailand now control smallerquantities of the heroin going to international markets. Although Thailand is the primary transit center for SoutheastAsian heroin destined for international markets, alternatetrafficking routes are increasingly utilized as a result ofThailand's sustained enforcement actions. Some opium, morphinebase, and heroin base are moved South through Burma to southernThailand and Malaysia for conversion to heroin in laboratoriesalong the Thailand/Malaysia border. Refined heroin is alsotrafficked from Burma to India, then to the West. Heroin from Southeast Asia is most frequently brought to theUnited States by couriers, typically Thai and U.S. nationals andHong Kong Chinese, traveling on commercial airlines. Californiaand Hawaii are the primary U.S. entry points for Golden Triangleheroin, but small percentages of the drug are trafficked into NewYork City and Washington D.C. While Southeast Asian groups havehad success in trafficking heroin to the United States, theyinitially had difficulty arranging street level distribution.However, with the incarceration of Asian traffickers in Americanprisons during the 1970's, contacts between Asian and Americanprisoners developed. These contacts have allowed Southeast Asiantraffickers access to individuals and organizations distributingheroin at the retail level. Chinese organized crime groups, known as Triads, locatedprimarily in Hong Kong, and their U.S. counterparts, Tongs, arepositioned to participate in Southeast Asian heroin traffic, butthe extent of their activity in these enterprises is not known atthe present time. These organizations provide Asians directaccess to criminal groups in the United States, and couldpotentially assume a significant role in U.S. heroin traffickingactivities. Currently, there are major Triad organizations in NewYork, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, and Toronto. Source Country Traffickers: Southwest Asia Opium production in Southeast Asia was significantly reducedin the late 1970's and early 1980's due to a prolonged drought.This decrease, along with the unstable political climate in theregion caused by the fall of the ruling governments in SouthVietnam and Laos, resulted in a reduction of Southeast Asianheroin exports to the United States. During this period, opiumproduction in the Golden Crescent area of Southwest Asia,comprising the common border regions of Pakistan, Afghanistan andIran, markedly increased. In 1979 the Golden Crescent became theprimary U.S. heroin source. Southwest Asia continues to be thiscountry's major supplier: over one-half of the heroin enteringthe United States in 1984 originated as opium in the GoldenCrescent. The surge in Golden Crescent heroin exports to the UnitedStates can be attributed to a number of factors. Opium has alwaysbeen grown in the region, but traditionally, opium grown inAfghanistan and Pakistan was shipped directly to Iran to supplythat country's one million opium addicts. The situation changeddramatically after the 1980 fundamentalist revolution in Iran, aspolitical and social instability allowed greatly increaseddomestic opium production and curtailed the demand for opium fromPakistan and Afghanistan. The Iranian market was further closedto outsiders by the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, whichblocked several of the traditional smuggling routes into Iran. Concurrent with the reduction in Iranian demand fornon-domestic opium, growers in Afghanistan and Pakistan harvestedrecord crops. The opium crop in Pakistan alone increased by 400percent between 1974-1979, from 200 to 800 metric tons.Consequently Pakistani and Afghan traffickers learned to refinetheir opium into heroin, and sought new markets for theirproduct, mainly in Western Europe and the and the United States. Southwest Asian opium is grown in remote mountain areas andgenerally is transported to crude laboratories in thePakistan/Afghanistan border areas. Most of the refineries arelocated in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province orAfghanistan's Nangarhai Province; many are clustered in the areaof the Khyber Pass. Refined heroin leaves Pakistan via severalroutes: through Baluchistan to Iran and beyond; by sea throughKarachi to Bombay and on to the Arabian Gulf States or Europe;overland through the Lahore area enroute to transit points inIndia; or by air through Islamabad or Karachi. Southwest Asian heroin is typically smuggled into the UnitedStates concealed in legitimate shipments of air and sea cargo,such as textiles or sports equipment manufactured by Pakistanicompanies, or it is carried by air couriers. Couriers generallytravel on commercial carriers, and many have connections withairline crews and station managers. The international postalsystem is also commonly used to ship heroin from Pakistandirectly to the United States in sealed newspapers andperiodicals. Golden Crescent heroin is trafficked into the United States bya variety of narcotics organizations. The following is anoverview of some of the more significant groups involved in theSouthwest Asian heroin trade. Pakistani Traffickers Pakistani nationals are responsible for trafficking asignificant percentage of Golden Crescent heroin in the UnitedStates, especially in the Northeast. The Pakistanis do not have asophisticated retail sales network in the United States andtypically rely on family or Pakistani friends in this country todistribute drugs. They also have relied on black traffickingorganizations in Los Angeles, Detroit and New York, and withItalian organized crime in New York City. One Pakistanidistribution system was described in testimony before thisCommission by a Pakistani national who was incarcerated for hisinvolvement in a distribution network. The Commission witness hasrelatives living both in Lahore, Pakistan, and in the UnitedStates; he was a resident of Houston, Texas and was employed asan engineer while involved in heroin trafficking. In the heroinoperation, a family member in Lahore sent couriers to JFK airportin New York with heroin concealed in false-bottom luggage. FromJFK, the couriers traveled "in transit" to La Guardia,then on to Toronto. Because of their "in transit"status, Customs Service officials did not search the travelers inthe United States, and Canadian Customs inspection was notdifficult to clear. In Canada, traffickers often held a particular heroin shipmentfor three to six months, until appropriate distribution contactswere established and it was certain that law enforcementofficials were not aware of the shipment. At that time,distribution contacts traveled by automobile to Toronto, pickedup a portion or all of the heroin shipment, and drove the heroininto the United States without Customs interdiction. Thisparticular network supplied heroin to Seattle, Houston, SanFrancisco, New York and Las Vegas. The contacts were all relatedby blood or marriage. Pakistanis also rely on the international postal system tomove drugs from Southwest Asia to the United States. In July1983, for example, U.S. Customs officials at JFK Airport seizedone kilogram of heroin concealed in rolled newspapers destinedfor Pakistani nationals residing in New York. The package hadbeen sent from the United Arab Emirates. Two other packages, eachcontaining one-half kilogram of heroin, were mailed to Berkeley,California from the same source. Rolled newspapers and magazinescan conceal up to one kilogram of heroin and are generally sealedin plastic. Drugs are also sent through the mail concealed inshipments of textiles, clothing and other durable goods. Lebanese Traffickers A portion of Golden Crescent heroin passes through Lebanon enroute to the United States, thus affording Lebanese nationals anopportunity to become involved in the trafficking activity. Asignificant percentage of the heroin exported from Lebanon leavesvia Damascus International Airport. In the United States, trafficking by Lebanese nationals isespecially prevalent in the Northeast. In one network,non-Lebanese couriers primarily from Canada traveled to Damascusand Beirut to pick up heroin which they then transported toHouston, Detroit and New York via commercial carrier. Heroin wasconcealed in false-bottom luggage and inside photo albums. Theheroin was transferred to Lebanese nationals living in Torontoand Ontario, Canada, and in various cities in the United States.Some of the money generated from the sale of this heroin waslaundered in banks in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. India A proportion of the heroin traditionally distributed abroadthrough the Pakistan cities of Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta isnow being shipped through Bombay and New Dehli. Traffickerssmuggle Southwest Asian heroin into India along the Indo-Pakistanborder and transport it overland to the Indian cities; SoutheastAsian heroin is brought into Bombay and Calcutta by sea andoverland routes. Bombay, Calcutta and New Dehli are now majorstaging, shipping and trafficking centers for heroin smuggled tothe West. Trafficking activity is frequent at Perlane Airport inDehli and at Bombay's Sahar International Airport, and Indianharbors and airports are used by Pakistani, Afghan and Indiantraffickers as points of embarkation to Western destinations. West Africa. In the past three years, West African countries, especiallyNigeria, have been documented as transshipments centers forGolden Crescent heroin. Nigerian couriers based in Lagos travelto Pakistan to obtain heroin, then continue on commercial flightsto their final destinations, or return to Nigeria to repackagethe narcotics into smaller amounts for smuggling to the West. A number of loosely associated Nigerian heroin traffickingorganizations have connections both with suppliers in Pakistanand with retailers in Western Europe and the United States.Typically, Nigerian couriers travel directly to Karachi oncommercial aircraft and purchase heroin in that city, but somecouriers continue to Peshawar to make their purchases. Couriersreturn to Nigeria transiting other countries in Africa andEurope. A different group of couriers, usually students or poorresidents of Lagos, traffic the drugs to Europe or the UnitedStates. Couriers typically enter the United States directly throughJFK airport in New York although in some cases, they come to thiscountry via cities in Europe and Canada. Drugs are concealed inbody cavities, and in false-bottom suitcases. After the heroin arrives in the United States, it is sold onlyto one or two American distributors in a given area. Distributionnetworks are most active in New York City and Washington, D.C.and are operative in Los Angeles, Houston and Boston. DEA reportsthat individuals in nearly every community of Nigerian nationalsin the United States has some link to heroin traffickers andcouriers. Profits from heroin sales are laundered through banksin the United States in Britain. The Post-French Connection LCN Traditional organized crime continues to play a significantrole in this country's heroin trade through the 1980's. The LCN'slong established connections with criminal organizations inSicily facilitate the movement of heroin from Europe to theUnited States, and while Sicily is no longer a major refinery forheroin, the country is a major transshipment center for Southwestand Southeast Asian heroin. Sicilian organizations supply LCNaffiliates with heroin; LCN networks either distribute the drugthemselves or sell it in large quantities to major distributors. The LCN As A Supplier: The Nicky Barnes Operation Black criminal groups have controlled some percentage ofheroin traffic in New York City since the 1940's. Their influenceincreased significantly in the early 1970's, after the FrenchConnection. The first major independent black traffickingorganization, a group of over one hundred distributors andcouriers, was headed by Charles Green. The Green organizationimported heroin and cocaine from South America and distributedthe drugs throughout New York City during the late 1960's. Greenwas arrested in 1970, control of this heroin network passed toFrank Matthews. Matthews was brought in to the heroin business byLouis Cirillo, a major LCN associate, and was continuallysupplied with LCN heroin. Leroy "Nicky" Barnes succeeded Matthews in 1971.Under his leadership, the organization controlled heroin salesand manufacture throughout New York State into Canada andPennsylvania. The Barnes operation was well-organized andlucrative. By 1976, Barnes had at least seven major lieutenantsunder his direction; each of them controlled a dozen mid-leveldistributors, who in turn supplied up to forty street-levelretailers. Barnes at all times remained well insulated from thedaily trafficking activities, and maintained a wealthy lifestyle.He owned five homes, a Mercedes, a Maserati, several Lincolns,Cadillacs and Thunderbirds, and hundreds of suits and coats. Heestimates that his total trafficking income was at least severalmillion dollars. Barnes joined with six other major New York dealers to form aheroin cartel called the "Council" in the mid 1970's.Members of the Council pooled funds to purchase multi-kiloamounts of heroin, worked to ensure a consistent supply of thedrug in their distribution area, combined their"cutting" and distribution networks in certain cases,and often used a common sources for diluents, weapons,automobiles and other resources. The Council had specific"departments" which arranged legal services, securityand enforcement, and financial services including moneylaundering. Barnes' most significant source of heroin, to whom he directedother Council members, was LCN associate "Natty"Madonna. Despite Barnes' assertion and belief that the Councilworked completely independently of the Mafia, through the Madonnaconnection, LCN heroin was prevalent in Harlem traffic from 1972to 1976. The Asian-LCN Links La Cosa Nostra actively seeks out Asian nationals asconnections to heroin sources in Southeast Asia. In testimonybefore the President's Commission on organized crime, FranklinLiu, a veteran Hong Kong clothier, explained how he was recruitedas a courier for a New York La Cosa Nostra family involved inheroin trafficking. Liu, who held a legitimate four year businessvisa which allowed him to travel without restriction, was firstcontacted by Antonio Turano, a reputed member of the SicilianMafia, in connection with Turano's money laundering operations.In one instance, Turano brought Liu a suitcase filled with$400,000 cash, and requested that Liu wire the money to a bank inZurich. Turano met with Liu in Milan in the course of theoperation to make certain that the money had been wired withoutincident. At a later date, after Liu had successfully participated in anumber of money laundering operations, Turano asked Liu if he hadany connections to drug traffickers in the Far East; Liu did not.Turano arranged a connection, and agreed to pay Liu $5,000 forevery kilo of heroin he trafficked into the United States. Liuwas subsequently contacted by Turano's agent, a Thai woman, andarranged to meet her at a hotel in New York City. When they met,each held half of a one dollar bill given to them by Turano asidentification. Liu gave the woman his car keys; the next day shereturned the car with heroin in the trunk and requested a paymentof $40,000 in cash and a $60,000 bank check. When Liu went tocollect the money from Turano, he found that Turano had beenarrested. Liu was subsequently arrested and convicted on chargesof conspiracy to import heroin in connection with this case. The Pizza Connection During the late 1970's and early 1980's members of La CosaNostra in the United States allegedly cooperated with theSicilian Mafia in a drug trafficking conspiracy which resulted inthe importation of heroin worth over $1.6 billion into the UnitedStates. In April, 1984, 38 individuals were indicted on chargesrelated to the trafficking operation, popularly known as the"Pizza Connection." The network that developed tofacilitate the traffic in this enterprise was reputedly one ofthe largest heroin importation operations in history, and usedpizza parlors throughout this country to distribute heroinsmuggled from Southeast and Southwest Asia via Sicily to theUnited States. Additional heroin that was trafficked through thissystem was produced in laboratories operating in Sicily. According to the indictment in the case, the "PizzaConnection" heroin network relied upon a faction of the NewYork Bonanno organized crime family headed by Salvatore Catalanoto distribute the heroin in this country. In turn, the heroinbusiness of this Bonanno crime faction was tied directly toorganized criminal groups in Sicily, the rest of Italy,Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil. Direct evidence of the existenceof the network was first obtained in 1980 when couriers wereobserved transferring enormous amounts of cash through investmenthouses and banks in New York city to Italy and Switzerland. Tensof millions of dollars derived from heroin sales in this countrywere transferred overseas in this fashion, apparently inviolation of the Bank Secrecy Act. Investigations related to the "Pizza Connection"case have revealed that factions of the Sicilian Mafia operate inthe United States independently of the American La Cosa Nostra.While the two groups apparently cooperate on certain venturessuch as the "Pizza Connection" heroin importationoperations, they appear to be distinct and separate organizationsunder different leadership.

The volume of demand for marijuanaprecludes domination of the market by any group of traffickersand allows a constant influx of small-scale and mid-sizeoperators as limited suppliers. These smaller groups are in largepart able to enter the market because of marijuana'scomparatively low wholesale cost. While an investment of tens ofthousands of dollars is required for entry into the U.S. heroinor cocaine traffic, a capital investment of less than $10,000 isgenerally sufficient in the marijuana trade. Finally, althoughmarijuana is supplied to U.S. consumers by growers in Colombia,Mexico and Jamaica, nearly one-sixth of the U.S. supply isdomestically grown. Because significant amounts of the drug arecultivated in all 50 States, American traffickers need not travelto a foreign source country for a marijuana supply. While the barriers to entry in the U.S. marijuana traffic arerelatively low, marijuana sales generate a small profit incomparison to other illicit drugs. This is primarily becausemarijuana, unlike heroin or cocaine, in not diluted or"cut" in the intermediate phases of trafficking, but issold in much the same form at the wholesale and retail levels.Marijuana is bulky and difficult to transport in high-profitquantity: the profit generated from the retail sale of 700 poundsof commercial Colombian marijuana could most probably be equalledfrom the retail sale of one kilogram of diluted cocaine. Finally,trafficking marijuana implies increased risks of interdictionbecause the bulk of the drug makes it most visible to lawenforcement authorities. Despite the relative ease with which small-scale traffickerscan enter the marijuana market, only large criminal organizationshave the resources and connections necessary to generate largeprofits from marijuana trafficking. Many of these groups deal inother drugs in addition to marijuana, and are organized tofacilitate the movement of any drug to the United States withminimal interference from law enforcement authorities. Their sizeallows group control of all aspects of a trafficking venture fromcultivation through the wholesale transaction, thus eliminatingmiddlemen, decreasing costs and maximizing profit. Unlike smalleroperations, the major trafficking groups have the capitalrequired to purchase the large vessels, trucks, or planesnecessary for smuggling high profit multi-ton quantities ofmarijuana. A final advantage is their willingness to use violenceand corruption, the tools traditionally associated with organizedcrime, to ensure the success of smuggling ventures. Historical Context From the 1930's through the mid-1970's, Mexican growers andtraffickers supplied nearly all of the marijuana consumed in theUnited States. Most shipments of the drug were smuggled into thiscountry by car or truck; a small percentage was transported byair. The Mexican monopoly ended in 1975, when in a joint venture,U.S. and Mexican authorities increased marijuana interdiction anderadication efforts in major Mexican cultivation regions andalong the U.S. borders. Paraquat, a potent herbicide toxic tohumans, was used widely in the eradication program, andcontaminated much of the Mexican crop. Despite the interdictionefforts, a portion of the tainted marijuana was successfullysmuggled into the United States, and many Americans who smokedthe drug subsequently suffered adverse health consequences.Eradication and interdiction of the Mexican crop, compounded bythe American marijuana smokers' reluctance to purchase apotentially paraquat-tainted drug, resulted in a simultaneousdecrease in the availability of and the demand for Mexicanmarijuana. By 1979 Mexico supplied only an estimated 11 percentof the marijuana available in the United States and by 1981 thatfigure dropped to 4 percent. Concurrent with the commitment of more manpower and resourcesto marijuana eradication and interdiction efforts in Mexico,authorities in Jamaica, which was the source of the 10 percent ofthe American supply not originating in Mexico, mounted a similarcampaign. The Jamaican initiatives significantly reducedmarijuana production and trafficking in that country, andvirtually eliminated Jamaica from the American marijuana tradefor a number of years. During the mid-1970's America's two marijuana supply sources,traffickers in Mexico and Jamaica, had only small amounts of thedrug available for export. The resulting vacuum was swiftlyfilled by Colombian criminal groups, who for years had beeninvolved in smuggling all manner of contraband. Through the late1960's these groups increased cultivation of marijuana in remoteregions of the Guajira Peninsula and began to develop systems tofacilitate the transport of multi-ton quantities of the drug tothe United States. At the same time, many Colombian groups wereestablishing themselves as major operators in the cocaine trade:the organizational structures, trafficking routes and corruptedofficials necessary for cocaine ventures often proved equallyuseful for marijuana trafficking. Once the Colombians established a position as marijuanatraffickers, their role in the traffic expanded rapidly. By 1975airstrips capable of handling heavy 4-engine planes with thecapacity to hold one ton of marijuana were common along theGuajira Peninsula. Loading facilities for"motherships," large vessels capable of transportingtons of marijuana, dotted the coast. By the early 1980's aCongressional committee estimated that between 15 and 60 thousandtons of marijuana were exported from that country to the UnitedStates each year. In 1985 Colombia remains the major supplier of U.S. marijuana,but the Colombian share of the market has declined significantlysince 1980. This decrease is attributed to increased eradicationin Colombia and to accelerated interdiction along majortrafficking routes. Colombia's reduced production has been offsetby increased cultivation and trafficking both in Mexico andJamaica. Mexico, now ranked second in world marijuana production,could become the leading producer in 1986, given a Mexican bumperharvest and continuing eradication in Colombia. This short history of marijuana trafficking demonstrates thatlaw enforcement pressure in a particular cultivation area iscompensated by production and trafficking increases elsewhere.Trafficking organizations are positioned in all major sourcecountries to handle increased volume when opportunities present. Trafficking Today: Colombia Colombia supplied 42 percent of the marijuana consumed in theUnited States in 1984. The major percentage of this traffic wascontrolled by large Colombian criminal organizations. Although the Colombian marijuana crop is cultivated in severalregions of the country, the largest production occurs along theGuijara Peninsula. Colombian traffickers purchase marijuana fromgrowers, and sometimes provide protection and additionalfinancing for cultivation. Crops are harvested twice each year,with the largest harvest occurring in the fall. The harvestpattern directly affects the level of marijuana traffickingactivity between Colombia and the United States; trafficking isnaturally heaviest after the fall harvest. Nearly 90 percent of the marijuana exported from Colombia isshipped to the United States by sea; almost all the remainder istransported on general aviation aircraft. Both maritime and airtraffic are primarily concentrated along Colombia's north coast,although some percentage of the traffic is centered along thecountry's Pacific coast. The major portion of Colombian marijuana is shipped to theUnited States on large motherships. These ships are typicallyfishing vessels or freighters and can hold tons of marijuana; a100-foot mothership can transport SO tons and a 400 footmothership can ship over 100 tons of the drug. These ships,generally owned or at least controlled by Colombian traffickingorganizations, remain at sea or in selected Colombian ports untila shipment is prepared for export and transported to a beach sitealong the Colombian coast. There are more than 100 such sitesalong the north coast from Barranquilla to Portete, all which arelinked by a network of roads, trails and airstrips to the majorgrowing areas. When preparations are complete on shore, themothership moves into a prearranged loading point typicallyone-half to 3 miles offshore. Small boats then ferry bales ofmarijuana from shore to the mothership; loading of many tons maybe accomplished within an hour. Motherships are nearly alwaysloaded at night to decrease risks of detection. The loaded motherships generally either sail from the Guajiracoast directly to the southeastern United States or to Caribbeantransshipment points, where cargo is off-loaded for futurepickup. Traffickers use the same maritime routes popular withcocaine traffickers; the Windward Passage between Cuba and Haiti,the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba, and the MonaPassage, bordered by the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, aremost frequently traveled. From these routes American ports alongthe Gulf of Mexico and the east coast are accessible tosmugglers. In addition, a small percentage of Colombian ships nowsail directly to the U.S. west coast. Those motherships that approach the U.S. coast typically hover50-100 miles offshore in international waters. There, they aremet by small ships, typically purchased or rented shrimp boats,which off-load and ferry the drug shipment to shore. Whiletraffickers traditionally made no attempt to conceal bales ofmarijuana, either on motherships or on off-loading vessels,increased law enforcement surveillance has recently promptedsmugglers to hide their drugs in secret compartments or in emptyor false fuel tanks. The Colombian trafficking organization normally oversees thecultivation and export of marijuana only through the off-loadingprocedure. Off-loading is accomplished by "serviceproviders" who never actually own the marijuana, but whomerely collect a fee for its safe transfer. Once on the U.S.shore, the drug shipment is delivered to a distributor, who inturn supplies lower level dealers. The traffic below thewholesale distributor level is vast and not well-understood. Motherships that do not travel to the United States generallytransit the Bahamas and/or the Caribbean. In both regionsmarijuana traffickers can either transfer shipments frommotherships to smaller crafts, which sail to the United States,or they can unload and store shipments at island storage bases.Use of island transshipment points has increased as lawenforcement efforts have intensified along the southeastern U.S.coast. Rampant official corruption in a number of island nationsfacilitates this traffic. An estimated 3 percent of the marijuana shipped from Colombiato the United States by sea is transported on commercial vessels.Typically, marijuana is concealed in containerized cargo, but insome instances crewmen or cruise ship passengers have beendirectly implicated in trafficking the drug. In terms ofquantity, cargo shipment provides great opportunities fortraffickers and presents a decreased risk of interdiction. Air Shipment An estimated 10 percent of the marijuana smuggled fromColombia to the United States reaches this country via generalaviation aircraft or commercial air shipment. Non-commercial airshipment of marijuana parallels the Colombian air traffickingpatterns common in cocaine smuggling. Many of the same air routesand transshipment points are used; the same airstrips areaccessible along the north coast of the country, and the samemethods used to avoid law enforcement interference areapplicable. Smugglers use both smaller twin engine aircraft andlarger four-engine planes for marijuana transport. When airtransport allows faster shipment, it limits export quantities andincreases the likelihood of interdiction. A small portion of the marijuana exported from Colombia isshipped by aircraft, then air-dropped over sea or land for pickupand further shipment to the United States. Most airdrop activityoccurs in the Bahamas, but an increasing number of drops havebeen intercepted in the Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica, Haiti, theDominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Medium-size to large twinengine aircraft are typically used for air-drop operations. In addition to trafficking marijuana to the United States ortransshipment points, Colombian organizations sell marijuanadirectly to non-Colombian traffickers, who assume responsibilityfor the shipment in Colombia. The buyers then traffic the druginto the United States using maritime and air shipment systemssimilar to the Colombian methods. Mexico Mexican marijuana production nearly doubled from 1983 to 1984,positioning Mexico as the second leading supplier of the drug tothe United States. An estimated 20 percent of the marijuanaavailable for consumption in the United States originates in ortransits Mexico, and that figure is expected to increase with abumper harvest in 1985. PEA analysts predict that this increasedproduction, with concomitant eradication and interdictionsuccesses in Colombia, could make Mexico the top Americanmarijuana source in 1985. Although marijuana is grown in nearly every state in Mexico,heaviest cultivation occurs in the northern and western states ofSonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Oaxaca and Cuerra. As in Colombia,crops are harvested twice each year, with the largest harvest inthe fall. Cultivation occurs both in small open fields and inwell-maintained, hundred-acre sites. Growers are typicallyoverseen and financed by larger trafficking organizations. Harvested marijuana is prepared for shipment near thecultivation fields. Mexican marijuana is transported to theUnited States by primarily overland methods, although aircraftare also used to smuggle drugs across the border. Overlandshipments are typically concealed in automobile trucks, falsetruck beds, camper tops and tanker trunks. The larger truckscommonly haul multi-ton quantities: U.S. officials at El Paso,Texas, seized nearly 6.5 tons of marijuana from a tanker truck inFebruary 1984, and nearly 30 tons from a cargo truck in March ofthat year. In addition, suitcases of marijuana are oftenforwarded on commercial bus lines to destinations beyond bordercheckpoints for subsequent pick-up. Air shipments generally run between private Mexican airstripsand clandestine runways or drop spots in the southwestern UnitedStates. Single engine aircraft are popular with Mexican smugglersbecause they can land on open fields, roadways and rough landingstrips common on both sides of the border, and typically carryabout 1,500 pounds of marijuana. While few details are availableconcerning marijuana air shipment, the great assortment ofairstrips on both sides of the border suggests a significantvolume of air traffic. A 1977 survey, for example, detectednearly 3,000 airstrips in Mexico; one-half of them wereconcentrated in ten major clusters. About 600 strips lie alongthe United States border and are ideally positioned to serveeither as launching sites for flights into the United States oras refueling stops for flights en route to this country fromsouthern Mexico. Strips in the other clusters most likely serveas refueling and transshipment points for aircraft travelingbetween South America and the United States. A large number ofairstrips in the southeastern United States serve as landingsites for the Mexican flights. Larger Mexican criminal organizations appear to control asignificant portion of the marijuana traffic between Mexico andthe United States. Many groups are active in both cocaine andheroin smuggling as well as marijuana trafficking. The centralorganizations are generally controlled by members of one extendedfamily, but often include non-family members in lower positions.Like other trafficking groups, the Mexicans rely consistently onan essential criminal support of attorneys, bankers and otherprofessionals, both in Mexico and in the United States. Prominent among the larger Mexican organizations are thegroups headed by Jamie Herrera Navarres, Rafael Caro Quintero,Ernesto Fonesca and Miguel Felix Gallardo. These groupscollaborate in smuggling ventures, much as the major Colombiancocaine trafficking organizations work in concert to maximizeresources and profits. In one recent instance, for example, aconsortium of traffickers led by Caro Quintero cultivatedhundreds of hectares of marijuana at five separate large-scalesites throughout the state of Chihuahua. All fields werelandscaped, fertilized and well-irrigated, demonstrating theMexican traffickers' knowledge of high-tech agriculturaltechniques. The cultivation sites, along with eight associatedprocessing camps, were seized by Mexican authorities in November1984. The seizures netted 10,000 metric tons of whole marijuana,or an estimated 1,900 to 2,400 tons of net marketable marijuana.In this single operation, officials confiscated 8 times moremarijuana than Mexican and American authorities at the timebelieved was produced annually throughout Mexico. The seizureraised serious questions both about the magnitude of drug trafficbetween Mexico and the United States and about continuingofficial corruption throughout Mexico. It seems highly unlikelythat an operation the size of the Chihuahua system could developor function without earlier detection by authorities. Jamaica Jamaica, from 1980 to 1984 this country's second leadingmarijuana supplier, provided 14 percent of the United Statesmarket share in 1984, trailing Colombia's 42 percent and Mexico's20 percent contributions. Jamaican traffickers, much less highlyorganized than their counterparts in Colombia and Mexico,supplied about 1800 metric tons of marijuana, as well as smalleramounts of sinsemilla and hashish oil to United States consumersin 1984. The greatest portion of Jamaican marijuana is transported tothe United States by general aviation aircraft, although somemaritime shipment also occurs. Over 70 island airstrips, one-halfof which are clandestine, facilitate the air traffic, whichcommonly includes shipment by single engine and light to heavytwin engine aircraft. Jamaican marijuana shipments are typicallyeither flown directly to United States landing sites or areair-dropped to small pleasure craft in waters near the Bahamas. Multi-ton marijuana shipments are occasionally transported tothe United States on small motherships, pleasure craft and cruiseships. A small percentage of Jamaican marijuana exported to theUnited States is concealed in containerized cargo on commercialmaritime vessels. The United States Crop The United States is currently a significant marijuana sourcecountry: about 12 percent of the marijuana consumed in the UnitedStates in 1984 was domestically cultivated. The largest crops aregrown in Hawaii, California, and Oklahoma, but there is now someproduction in every State. Growers can be landowners, but aretypically squatters who operate independently or in small groups.They cultivate their crops in Federal fields, forested land,private clandestine plots or greenhouses, scattering plants nextto trees or amid legitimate crops to avoid detection. Planting onFederal land offers growers the advantage of anonymity andshields them from recently enacted laws which authorize seizureof their property or other assets. Many plots, including those onFederal parkland are wired with devices, such as punji sticks,fish hooks hung at eye level, and trip wires attached to guns andboulders, designed to ensure the security of the crop. Growersare often armed and violent. There is presently no evidence of a highly developeddistribution system for the domestic marijuana crop in the UnitedStates. It appears that numerous smaller organizations trafficthe drug between states and that some individual growers supplylarger criminal organizations in major cities nationwide. Theseorganizations, which include both La Cosa Nostra groups andtrafficking specific groups, distribute domestic and importedmarijuana to brokers, retailers, and street-level dealers. Theextent of their control of the U.S. market is uncertain butestimated to be significant. The Role of the LCN In 1967 Federal officials reported that the LCN was notsignificantly involved In trafficking marijuana. Low profit wasthought to be the primary disincentive to La Cosa Nostrainvolvement; in addition, the large and loosely structured marketwas thought to be unattractive and uncontrollable. In the late1960's the United States marijuana supply was exported almostexclusively from Mexico. Entry into the trafficking businessrequired little capital and a simple border crossing, and thusattracted many small and independent operators. When Colombiabecame the major United States marijuana supplier in the early1970's, however, the LCN was provided with a more controllablesource. Concurrent with this production shift, the United Statesdemand for marijuana and the retail price level for the drugsteadily escalated, prompting some LCN families to becomeinvolved in trafficking marijuana. For a short period, thisactivity proved to be a high profit/low risk enterprise fortraditional organized crime. Additionally, trafficking marijuanacarried little of the social stigma associated with traffickingheroin or cocaine. As the following case study demonstrates, marijuanatrafficking has increased the vulnerability of some organizedcrime families and has led to a number of significant LCNarrests. Case Study: The Cleveland Connection In the mid-1970's, Carmen Zagaria, a Cleveland drug dealer,began to buy wholesale marijuana by the pound and sell it atretail in one ounce bags. He rapidly expanded his business in thecourse of a few years and developed a network of suppliers,couriers and distributors. Although the business prosperedgenerally, Zagaria lost a substantial investment in one foileddrug transaction in 1979 and borrowed money from Angelo Lonardo,the reputed underboss of the Cleveland LCN Licavoli family. Inreturn for the loan, the Licavoli family assumed control of theZagaria operation. Under Lonardo's oversight, the Zagaria enterprise expandedrapidly. By 1980 the organization was buying 400-800 pounds ofmarijuana per week and had incorporated over 20 couriers. PCP,LSD, cocaine and hashish were added to the traffic. The methods used by Zagaria were simple. His couriers flew tothe southeastern United States, usually to Florida via commercialairline, and established contact there with a Zagaria supplier.Suppliers included both LCN affiliates and non-LCN dealers.Couriers picked up large marijuana shipments, paid for them incash, and drove the drugs back to Cleveland in rental cars. InCleveland the shipments were stored in stash houses, thendistributed to a network of wholesalers and retailers. TheZagaria enterprise was a high-volume multimillion dollaroperation; in a single 10-day period in 1980 the group brought3,000 pounds of marijuana to Cleveland from Atlanta. In the course of his trafficking business Zagaria was involvedin numerous crimes, including murder. In 1982 he was convicted ofselling seven pounds of marijuana and 21 grams of cocaine and wassentenced to 10-30 years in prison. Zagaria became a Federalinformant and though never a member of the Licavoli familyhimself, provided sufficient testimony about family activities tobring the leadership before a grand jury. In 1983 Angelo Lonardoand five other Licavoli associates were convicted andincarcerated without possibility of parole for numerous crimes,including conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Other Drugs Millions of Americans abuse a number of licit and illicitdrugs other than heroin, cocaine and marijuana; these includestimulants, synthetic narcotics, hallucinogens, and depressants.Most popular among these dangerous drugs are diazepam (Valium),methamphetamine and PCP. In addition, controlled substanceanalogs known commonly as "designer drugs," have gainedpopularity with users since 1980. Dangerous drugs are available to the consumer from three majorsources. Many of the drugs are approved for medical use in theUnited States, and reach the illicit market through a variety ofdiversion methods. A significant portion of the United Statessupply of certain drugs, notably amphetamines and diazepam, isdiverted from licit channels in foreign countries and smuggledinto the United States. Finally, it is estimated that all the PCPand chemical analogs, nearly all the methamphetamine and about 80percent of the injectable amphetamine available on the illicitmarket in 1984 were produced in clandestine United Stateslaboratories. Only certain areas of the traffic in dangerous drugs clearlyreflect organized crime involvement. Most notably, the trafficappears to be dominated nationwide by outlaw motorcycle gangs.According to the Commission's survey of local law enforcementofficials, these gangs control nearly 40 percent of the"dangerous drug" traffic in the United States. Whilethese gangs have traditionally been active in trafficking a widevariety of illicit drugs, they have developed the technology tomanufacture methamphetamine and PCP, and have been a major forcein the wholesale and resale distribution of these two drugsnationwide. The major outlaw motorcycle gangs traffic dangerous drugswithin separate territorial boundaries: the Hell's Angels controlthe West Coast trade, the Outlaws dominate the Midwest and partsof the east coast, the Bandidos control the Southwest, andEastern Seaboard States are dominated by the Pagans. Officialsare uncertain of the total membership of the four groups, butestimate that nearly all the U.S. traffic in PCP, and up tothree-fourths of the illicit methamphetamine traffic falls undertheir control. The Hell's Angels, the oldest of the four groups, first becameinvolved in drug distribution in the late 1960's. Initially, thegroup trafficked marijuana, heroin, cocaine, seconal, PCP,amphetamines and methamphetamines. In the early 1970's theorganization recruited a chemist to manufacture methamphetamineand to instruct other organization members in the procedure.Hell's Angels' activity shifted as their production ofmethamphetamine increased and within a short period of time, theorganization dominated west coast methamphetamine manufacture anddistribution. In the eastern United States, the Pagan's gang leadership alsorecruited chemists and gained control of the methamphetamine andPCP markets from Florida to New England. Pagan drug activity iscentered in the Philadelphia/ South New Jersey area; severalPagan-controlled processing centers and small laboratories arelocated in the region. It is known by law enforcement officialsthat Pagan gang members have frequently cooperated in jointventures with the Philadelphia Bruno organized crime family,especially in methamphetamine and PCP manufacture anddistribution. Officials believe that the Bruno leadershipregularly finances a portion of Pagan drug activities in returnfor a percentage of the drug profits and enforcement andprotection services. In addition, it appears that the Pagans andthe Bruno family have arranged to divide control of themethamphetamine and PCP markets in certain territories and thatthe two groups coexist and cooperate in these regions. Case Study: The Pagan/Bruno Relationship. Between 1977 and 1981 both the Pagan motorcycle gang and theBruno organized crime family were active and competitivedistributors of methamphetamine throughout the mid-Atlanticstates. Both groups obtained P2P, an essential chemical inmethamphetamine production, from Ronald Raiton, the majorsupplier of the chemical in the eastern United States. Raitonsupplied P2P directly to Ronald Kownacki, a businessman closelyaligned with the Pagan leadership, and to Ronald Martorano, aBruno family associate. Though Kownacki and Martorano bothoperated in the Philadelphia area, their laboratories andclientele were distinct. Kownacki paid the Bruno family a $10,000 fee for every gallonof P2P he purchased from Raiton. He sold the methamphetamine heproduced to Pagan Walter "Buckets" Jozwiak, who cut thedrug and distributed it to Pagan mother club members in NewJersey, Delaware and Philadelphia. Martorano distributed hismethamphetamine through Bruno family channels. In 1980 Kownacki was assaulted and robbed by two Brunoassociates, who claimed they were collecting a debt owed to theBruno family. They stole a significant amount of gold fromKownacki, which he maintained belonged to the Pagans. In February1981 a number of Pagans confronted members of the Bruno familyand demanded that the gold be returned. The Bruno associatesrefused, but agreed to meet with the Pagans to negotiatedpossible joint ventures in trafficking methamphetamine and PCP.Finally in 1982 the Pagans and the Bruno family agreed that eachgroup would control methamphetamine and PCP markets in separateterritories and that competition between them in these areaswould cease. In 1983 after the agreement, the estimated streetvalue of the Pagan PCP and methamphetamine operations was $15.5million. Organized crime involvement in trafficking dangerous drugsother than methamphetamine and PCP in the United States is notwell-documented. La Cosa Nostra appears to be active intrafficking methaqualone from Colombia through Florida to majorUnited States cities, but the scope of their interest in thismarket is not known. Mexican traffickers have smuggledsignificant quantities of diazepam, methaqualone and amphetamineinto this country for at least ten years. A major portion of theillicit methaqualone traditionally available in this country wastrafficked to the United States by Colombian organized crimegroups; however, international controls adopted by virtually allmajor producing and exporting countries have led to worldwideshortage of the drug. The DEA currently reports that organized crime is not nowinvolved in the production or distribution of controlledsubstance analogs, "designer drugs." Given the enormousprofit potential of these substances, however, and the relativelysimple manufacturing processes required in their production, theformulation and distribution of controlled substance analogswould seem to be an endeavor perfectly suited to organized crime. Drug Trafficking, Terrorism, and Insurgency Drug trafficking organizations in many areas of the worldcoexist and cooperate with political insurgent groups andterrorists. Their typical relationship is mutually beneficial:traffickers supply terrorists with American currency and weaponsin return for protection and assistance in smuggling activities.While terrorists and insurgents do not currently controlsignificant portions of the drug trade, the profit potentiallyrealized from even isolated drug transactions could providesizable revenues for a militant cause. Terrorists and insurgentsfunded through drug trafficking could very conceivably becomepowerful enough to disrupt governments in a number of countriespresently allied with the United States, and thus pose a seriousthreat to this country's national security. The role of terrorists and insurgents in drug trafficking hasexpanded greatly since the early 1970's as drug trafficking hasspread across the world. At that time, heroin traffic wascontrolled by North American organized crime groups working withSicilian suppliers in the French Connection, marijuana wassupplied to the United States almost exclusively by Mexicantrafficking organizations, and cocaine traffic in this countrywas insignificant. Heroin now reaches North America from Europe,the Middle East, Mexico and Southeast Asia. Marijuana istrafficked to the United States by Colombian and Caribbean basedgroups as well as by Mexicans, and cocaine from nearly everycountry in South America satisfies a still-increasing demand forthe drug throughout this country. At the same time, the expanded United States market forillicit drugs has swelled the profit from trafficking to enormousproportions, and attracted terrorist and insurgent groups to thisactivity. In addition, this source of funding serves theideological purposes of many groups. As explained by terrorismexpert Michael Ledeen: Running drugs is one sure way to make big money in a hurry.Moreover, the directions of the flow are ideologicallyattractive. Drugs go to the bourgeois countries, where theycorrupt and where they kill, while the arms go to pro-Communistterrorist groups in the Third World. The links between terrorist and insurgent groups andtraffickers are most substantial in drug source countries,including Colombia, Peru, Burma and Thailand. In Colombia, fourmajor insurgent organizations work in collaboration with cocainetraffickers. The oldest, largest, and best-equipped of thesegroups is the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia (FARC), whichis the armed wing of the Colombian Communist Party (PCC) andclaims over 5,000 active members and supporters. The FARC forcesconsist of between 23 and 28 "fronts," essentiallyindependent company-level forces, nearly all of which are locatedin Colombia's rural areas. Over one-half of the fronts operate incoca and marijuana growing regions. FARC forces cultivate somecoca, but derive more profit by collecting protection paymentsfrom coca growers in their operating territory, often demanding a10 percent share of the drug profits. One FARC front reportedlyobtained over $3.8 million per month by assessing this protectiontax. Collected monies are used to buy weapons and supplies whichare often shipped into Colombia on return drug flights. Two FARCfronts have had documented direct dealings with cocainetraffickers to obtain arms and ammunition. In exchange for the levied fee, the FARC forces protectgrowing and trafficking areas, including air fields, and warntraffickers of nearby anti-narcotics police or military patrols.In certain areas of Colombia FARC fronts control enough strategicpoints to make police travel difficult or impossible. FARC encampments have recently been discovered in closeproximity to several major cocaine processing centers. Forexample, on April 6, 1984, during a raid of a fully operationalprocessing center in Southeast Colombia known as "LaLoma," officials discovered and subsequently destroyed aFARC guerrilla base camp. The FARC camp, complete with airstripsand large stockpiles of food and medical supplies, that group'sdirect involvement in providing protection for the cocainetraffickers. A month prior to the La Loma raid, when authoritiesraided another processing center nearby known as Tranquilandia,they were met by approximately 30 armed resistors in fatigueuniforms believed to be FARC members. A number of other militant organizations in Colombia have alsobeen associated with the drug trade. The leftist 19th of Aprilmovement (M-19) has been most notable for its October 1985takeover of the Colombian Palace of Justice in which 11 of thatcountry's Supreme Court Justices were murdered. Although M-19 wasonce hostile to traffickers, and on several occasions kidnappedrelatives of prominent drug smugglers, some officials maintainthat the October incident was related to drug trafficking. It isalleged that the attack was motivated by the M-19's desire todestroy records that might lead to the extradition a number ofmajor Colombian cocaine traffickers, and to intimidateauthorities in Colombia to force them to rescind the extraditiontreaty in effect between that country and the United States. M-19also at least once traded drugs for arms from Cuba throughColombian trafficker Jaime Guillot-Lara. In the early 1970's to1982 Guillot supplied M-19 with weapons in return for theirassistance in his drug smuggling activities through high-rankingCuban officials. The Cubans provided a safe haven for Guillot'sdrug smuggling vessels en route to the United States fromColombia in return for payments. M-19 received periodic weaponsshipments for facilitating the arrangement on Guillot Lara'sreturn trips to Colombia from the United States. In Peru, where an estimated 40 percent of the world coca cropis grown, insurgents and traffickers share much the samerelationship evidenced by the Colombians. Insurgents and growerswork in the same remote areas, primarily in the upper HuallagaValley, but operate separately. Smugglers supply arms and moneyare supplied in return for militant protection. The two groups donot maintain a structured relationship or pursue common goals;their collaboration is one of convenience. The most prominent insurgent group currently operating in Peruis the Maoist Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), which seeks arural-based revolution to rid the predominantly peasantpopulation of the "imperialistic" influences of theUnited States and other foreign governments. While existingevidence is insufficient to link the Shining Path to the drugtrade, the group has incited peasants, many of whom make theirliving from coca cultivation, to rebel against anti-coca projectsin major growing areas. During 1984 several anti-coca projects,including a United States-supported crop substitution program,were attacked by armed mobs, resulting in many injuries anddeaths. In Southeast Asia a number of political insurgent groups relyprincipally on heroin smuggling to finance their activities. Theycontrol or influence the main areas of opium production innortheastern Burma, where the Burmese government does not exertauthority. The insurgents range from ideological revolutionarieslike the Burmese Communist Party (BCP), to ethnic separatists,such as the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), and opiumwarlords, like the Shan United Army (SUA). All of these groups,whatever their professed objectives, are heavily involved in theproduction, transport or sale of heroin. In Burma, where 90 percent of the southeast Asian opium cropis grown, the BCP controls an estimated two-thirds of the majoropium production areas and levies a protection tax oncultivators. While the BCP has traditionally controlled opiumcultivation and the SUA has exclusively dominated associatedrefining and trafficking activities, the BCP has recently begunto engage in processing and sales, and the groups have come intoconflict. The BCP remains an active political insurgency whilethe SUA now concentrates its resources almost entirely on thedrug trade. In Thailand the link between insurgency and drug traffickingis much weaker. Although Burmese groups operated with relativeimpunity on both sides of the Burma/Thailand border in the early1980's, government initiatives in Thailand have severelydisrupted their activities. The only indigenous Thai insurgentgroup of any consequence, the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT),is reportedly ready to engage in drug trafficking, but has beenkept under control by Thai security forces. In the Middle East, nearly all the militant groups engage instruggle in Lebanon - Palestinians, Phalangists, Druze andShiites - reportedly are financed in some part by the drug trade.Lebanon's Bekaa Valley is the site of significant hashishproduction; heroin laboratories are also believed to exist in thearea. Terrorists throughout that area can and do enter the drugtrade, either directly or by protecting drugs transshippedthrough regions they control. Armenian terrorists are also active in Lebanon, especially inBeirut, where Armenian nationals are heavily involved in drugtrafficking. In 1980 Noubar Sofoyan, an Armenian heroin andhashish trafficker connected with the right-wing JusticeCommandos of the Armenian Genocide, was indicted in the U.S. forheroin smuggling. Sofoyan allegedly helped fund the 1976 bombingof a Turkish installation in Zurich. He was arrested in Greece ondrug charges in 1981 and was subsequently extradited to Lebanonand released; he remains a fugitive today. Traffickers as Terrorists While drug traffickers are not by definition terrorists orinsurgents, they rely heavily on terrorist tactics to obtainlimited political objectives. The use of threats, violence,assassination and kidnapping by trafficking organizations toprevent vigorous enforcement of drug laws can only be categorizedas terroristic in nature. The use of terrorist tactics is most evident among traffickersin Colombia, Peru and Mexico. In Colombia much of the violencecenters on the issue of the extradition of reputed Colombian drugtraffickers to the United States for trial. The extradition issuehas become prominent in the past two years under ColombianPresident Belisario Betancur, and has prompted unprecedentedlevels of terrorism by traffickers. Two key members of theColombian government, Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara-Bonillaand Justice Ministry Assistant Eduardo Gonzalez, both outspokensupporters of the implementation of the United States/Colombiaextradition treaty, were murdered reportedly by traffickers in1984. The Colombian judiciary, the body responsible both for theinvestigation of drug cases and the disposition of extraditionrequests, has been targeted by traffickers. Twenty-four judges,among them the judge investigating the Lara assassination, havebeen murdered in the past two years. Americans have also beensingled out: Colombian traffickers have reportedly offered a$350,000 bounty for the murder of any top DEA official in theUnited States or in Colombia, and have threatened to kill fiveAmericans for every reputed Colombian drug trafficker extraditedto the United States. In Peru drug-related violence has been increasing since 1983,and has specifically targeted anti-drug efforts in the UpperHuallaga Valley. A series of violent attacks by traffickers onpolice units and eradication workers in that area led to theNovember 1984 torture and murder of 19 members of a UnitedStates-financed coca-eradication team, and subsequently to thebrutal murder of 17 United States financed eradicators by about50 traffickers armed with submachine guns less than one yearlater. Dozens of people in Peru, including policemen, mayors andfarmers have been reported killed in the past year in attacksattributed to cocaine traffickers. In Mexico trafficking violence culminated in the Februarykidnapping, torture and murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camerena anda Mexican pilot. Camerena's abduction occurred shortly afterMexican police, alerted by DEA, raided the largest marijuanaplantation ever discovered in that country and seized anestimated 8,500 tons of marijuana. In the course of the searchfor Camerena, five persons, including a police officer, werekilled. Mexican trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero is being held byMexican authorities in connection with the Camerena murder. Thetrafficking-related violence in Mexico escalated further inNovember 1985, when 17 police officers and other members of ananti-drug team working in southern Mexico were lured into anambush, tortured, and killed by a large group of drug traffickersarmed with automatic weapons. Government Complicity A number of hostile foreign governments, motivated either by aneed for hard American currency, or by a more ideological desireto undermine governments in Europe and the United States,actively facilitate drug trafficking activities. Cuban andNicaragua blatantly aid traffickers smuggling drugs from Colombiato the United States; the Bulgarian government assiststraffickers transporting drug shipments from Southwest Asia toWestern Europe. All three countries are geographicallywell-positioned to serve as transshipment points for drugs enroute to Europe or the United States, and all allow traffickingroutes to cross through their sovereign territory, thus providinga way for traffickers to circumvent drug-interdictionauthorities. Cuba Reports of Cuban government involvement in drug traffickingfirst surfaced in the early 1960's, but were in large measureunsubstantiated. A series of reports in the 1970's subsequentlysuggested Cuban Government involvement, but did not provide solidevidence of such activity. In the early 1980's, however, the linkbetween the Cuban government and Colombian drug traffickers wasdocumented. In November 1982, the United States District Courtindicted four major Cuban officials on charges of conspiracy tosmuggle drugs; those indicted included the former CubanAmbassador to Colombia, two officials of the Cuban CommunistParty, and the Vice Admiral of the Cuban Navy. All four officialswere involved in facilitating the trafficking activities ofColombian Jaime Guillot-Lara, reputedly a major marijuana,cocaine and methaqualone trafficker. The Cuban officials,according to the indictment, agreed to allow Cuba to be used as asupply and loading center for Lara's ships transporting drugs tothe United States, and permitted him to navigate drug vesselsthrough Cuban waters to evade United States interdictionauthorities. The Cuban Government reportedly expected largepayments for their role in this traffic; on one occasion, thegovernment was to receive approximately $800,000 from the sale of10 million methaqualone pills and approximately 23,000 pounds ofmarijuana. In addition to facilitating maritime trafficking, recentreports indicate that drug traffickers regularly fly throughotherwise tightly controlled Cuban airspace. Traffickersapparently have an assigned corridor which they can transitwithout challenge from Cuban air defenders. Cuba also reportedlyallows Colombian traffickers to off-load drugs to other carriersfor the final journey to the United States. It is often difficult in drug trafficking cases to make adistinction between corrupt high-ranking government officials andgovernment-sanctioned involvement in the drug trade. Given,however, the tight controls exerted by the Castro government'ssecurity apparatus over foreign travel and communications, thedrug-related activities which have occurred in Cuba in recentyears almost certainly were known and approved by that country'shighest ranking officials. According to the Department of State: . . . the evidence clearly indicates more than a case ofcorruption by local or mid-level security officials in Cuba . . .Narcotics trafficking has apparently been sanctioned by Cuba as ameans to finance subversion in Latin America. Nicaragua Since 1981, the United States has received a steady stream ofintelligence indicating that Nicaragua is used by drugtraffickers as a transshipment point between Colombia and theUnited States, and that officials of the revolutionary governmentthere, the Sandinista Directorate, are involved in the drugtrade. Evidence further suggests that enforcement measuresimplemented by Colombian President Betancur have promptedColombian traffickers, notably Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar, torelocate their cocaine processing facilities to Nicaragua. The best evidence to date of the link between the Nicaraguangovernment and Colombian drug traffickers came to light in 1984.In that year, pilot Adler Barriman Seal, a former Ochoa cocainetrafficking pilot working then with the DEA in an undercovercapacity, reported that Escobar and Ochoa had agreed in April1984 to use Nicaragua as a cocaine smuggling base. At Ochoa'srequest, Seal flew 750 kilos of cocaine in June, 1984 fromColombia to an airfield just northwest of Managua. The airfieldwas used generally as a joint facility by the Nicaraguan armedforces and the Ministry of the Interior. Seal's aircraft wasdamaged in the landing, and according to Seal, Frederico Vaughn,a personal assistant to Interior Minister Thomas Borge, arrangedfor him to return to the United States in another plane. Laterthat June, Seal returned to the airfield in a C-123 aircraft,equipped with a hidden camera, to retrieve the drugs. Both Vaughnand Escobar, escorted by Nicaraguans in uniform and recorded onvideotape, personally helped Seal load the cocaine into theaircraft. Vaughn was paid $1.5 million for providing theColombian traffickers "secure facilities." In July 1984, Seal made another trip to Nicaragua from theUnited States to bring supplies for a new cocaine processingcomplex under construction there. In a subsequent tapedconversation with Seal, Frederico Vaughn stated that theprocessing center was ready for use. Eleven persons, including Vaughn, were indicted by a Federalgrand jury on charges stemming from this trafficking arrangement.All remain at large. It is highly unlikely that these traffickingactivities occurred without the knowledge and consent of theSandinista government. Bulgaria Since the late 1970's, reports that many drug dealers,especially Turkish nationals, operate out of semi-permanent basesin Bulgaria have been in circulation. The allegations againstBulgaria include charges that the Bulgarians, primarily throughan official government trading firm, Kintex, officially sanctionthe sale of illicit drugs to Western Europe and use the proceedsfrom those sales to finance illegal arms transactions and tobankroll terrorist groups. There are consistent reports thattop-ranking members of the Bulgarian Security Service orex-Bulgarian ministers comprise the directorate of Kintex. Certain smugglers are reportedly permitted to conductactivities within Bulgaria. In effect, Bulgarian officials,though Kintex, assign representatives to establish feearrangements with smugglers for bartered contraband. Smugglerstrafficking through Bulgaria are primarily Turkish nationals ofKurdish background, but include Syrian, Jordanian, Lebanese andEuropean nationals. Corruption The Role of the Corrupt Official The corrupt official is the sine qua non of drug trafficking.By the corruption of his office, he protects the interest oftraffickers in all phases of growing, processing and smugglingillicit drugs. Officials "from the lowly constable onup" are bribed and subverted by traffickers. Mexico While United States officials and investigators commonlyacknowledge that corruption among the ranks of both the MexicanFederal Judicial Police and the Directorate of Securityfacilitates drug trafficking in and through that country, theyare hesitant to make open accusations concerning the relationshipbetween corrupt officials and traffickers. Their reasoning ispersuasive: Mexico is a neighbor and an ally, a politically andeconomically unstable one at that. The government of PresidentMiguel de la Madrid appears sincere in its efforts to improve thequality of drug law enforcement throughout the country.Nonetheless, mounting evidence prompted the Department of Stateto assert in its 1985 mid-year report to Congress that: There are strong indications that the Mexican [drug] programhas been less effective over the past two years, and thatcorruption is playing a major role in this decline. Drug-related corruption among members of Mexico's Federalpolice force, which was widespread and well-publicized in the1970's, continues to undermine anti-drug efforts in that country.Allegations of corruption surfaced in March 1985, after DEA agentEnrique Camarena Salazar and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelarwere kidnapped and murdered in Guadalajara. Six Mexican policeofficers were indicted on charges related to the Camarena murder;they were charged with assisting drug traffickers through"protection of personnel and goods, custody of drugs intransit, as well as continuing services of information." Thearrested officers have reportedly confessed that drug traffickersoffered them between $200 to $6,250 a month for officialprotection. In connection with the Camarena case, DEA officials maintainthat Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes, the First Commandante of theMexican Federal Judicial Police, who directed the investigationinto the Camarena murder, accepted a bribe from the traffickersuspect in the killing, Rafael Caro Quintero, and in returnallowed Caro to leave Guadalajara. Later apprehended in CostaRica, Caro claimed in a confession that he paid Pavon Reyes$265,000 to avoid arrest at the Guadalajara airport. Despite hisdenials of the charges, Pavon Reyes was indicted for the crime inMexico in April 1985. United States pressure after the Camerena murder andsubsequent revelations of corruption prompted a number of quickresponses from the Mexican Government. President de la Madridannounced a major reorganization and consolidation of the policeforces under stronger Federal control; the governor of oneMexican state dismissed that state's entire judicial system,including the state attorney general, police and administrativepersonnel; and a reported 100 agents of the Federal SecurityDirectorate, a political police force and counterintelligenceunit run by the Interior Ministry, resigned in the face ofcorruption allegations. Corruption in at least some Mexicaninstitutions, however, appears to be deeply embedded and notlikely to be eliminated quickly or easily. At the end ofSeptember, 1985, six months after the Camerena murder, evidenceof Mexican corruption continued to surface as the members of theUnited States Fraternal Order of Border Patrol Agents chargedthat: Mexican federal agents, using the latest in radio andscanner-equipped cars and armed with automatic weapons, have beenproviding transit security for huge loads of domesticallyproduced marijuana and heroin and in-transit cocaine. Bahamas and Caribbean The Bahamas and a number of Caribbean countries serve as amajor refueling transshipment points for traffickers transportingillicit drugs from Mexico and South America to the United States.Corruption among officials at all levels throughout thesecountries appears to be widespread. Drug-related corruption has reached the highest offices ofgovernment in the British-held Turks and Caicos Islands, where inMarch 1985, that country's Chief Minister, Norman Saunders, wasconvicted of conspiracy to travel in furtherance of a drug plotand on five counts of traveling in furtherance of in illicit drugtransaction. Saunders, the first foreign head of state to beconvicted on drug charges, was found not guilty of more seriouscharges of conspiracy to smuggle marijuana and cocaine. Trialwitnesses testified that Saunders accepted a total of $50,000 toallow drugs to move freely through his island chain. He plannedto use the islands as a "safe-haven" for traffickerssmuggling illicit drugs from Colombia to the United States.Stafford Missick, Minister of Commerce and Development in theSaunders government, was convicted of conspiracy to importcocaine and marijuana in the case; a third indicted Turks andCaicos official, Aulden Smith, has not yet been tried. In the Bahamas, a 1984 Commission of Inquiry investigatingdrug trafficking through the Islands reported that Bahamianofficials "from policemen to cabinet minister" allowedthe Islands to be used as a transshipment point for illicit drugsin return for sizeable bribes. A majority of the three-manCommission concluded that no credible evidence directly tiedBahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling to the drug-relatedcorruption, but noted that Pindling's bank accounts reflecteddeposits of $3.5 million in excess of his salary between 1977 and1983. The Commission of Inquiry noted that a number of the FamilyIsland Commissioners, the representatives of the centralgovernment on nearly all the Bahamian Islands: claimed they either had no direct knowledge of drugtrafficking or had never received any complaints regarding suchactivity . . . We find that to be quite remarkable and we do notbelieve that they were being candid with us . . . they could nothelp but know what was going on in relation to drug trafficking.We have concluded that there must have been a degree ofacquiescence on their part . . . The Commission report also charged that Colombian cocainetrafficker Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas operated an extensivecocaine enterprise in the Bahamian Island of Norman's Cay from1978 until 1982, and the Lehder paid "substantialbribes" to various ranks of policemen and customs officialsto facilitate his illicit drug activities. Former trafficker Luis Carcia, who transshipped marijuana andcocaine through the Bahamas on a regular basis in the late 1970'sand early 1980's testified before the President's Commission onOrganized Crime that he had: . . . never seen corruption such as there is in the Bahamas.The policemen used to plead with me to use airstrips in theirterritory so they could received the pay-off . . . sometimesoff-duty police unloaded the stuff from the plane and into theboats for me . . . we always operated out of the Bahamas becauseof the total corruption there. South America Official corruption has seriously hindered anti-drug effortsthroughout South America, especially in Bolivia and Peru.Throughout Bolivia during the 1980's regime of General GarciaMeza, corruption among high-level officials charged with drugenforcement was so rampant that "the government itselfbecame an international drug trafficker." Despite thesubsequent efforts the current Bolivian government to moreeffectively enforce drug control laws, corruption at all levelsof the Bolivian government remains a major problem. In 1983, forexample, Bolivian authorities arrested two suspected traffickerswith a small amount of cocaine and confiscated a 14,000 acreranch and two airplanes belonging to them. Two weeks later, themen were transferred to the authority of a local prosecutor whosubsequently released them and returned their possessions.According the reports, at least $250,000 in bribes were paid toBolivian police and government officials for the release of thetwo traffickers. In August 1985, officials in Peru began a drug corruptioninvestigation that country's entire Interior Ministry afterauthorities discovered direct telephone lines linking reputedcocaine trafficker Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopes to officials at theMexican Consulate in Peru. Officials also found a government carbelonging to a top aid of former Interior Minister and PrimeMinister Luis Percovich parked in front of Lopes' home. These are a few among many examples. Corruption linked to drugtrafficking is a widespread phenomenon among political andmilitary leaders, police and other authorities in virtually everycountry touched by the drug trade. The easily available andenormous amounts of money generated through drug transactionpresent a temptation too great for many in positions of authorityto resist.

In this chapter, there is only apassing reference to an opium law restricting trade by theChinese.

Chapter IV Part 1: Federal Drug Strategy... Federal Drug Strategy: Origins, Evolution, and Current Status Introduction The Federal response to the national problems of drug abuseand drug trafficking over the years has been both dynamic andcharacterized by frustration. Drug use and its concomitantorganized crime effects continue to challenge the Nation todevelop a more effective and sophisticated response. Typically, aparticular Federal enforcement reaction to drug abuse and drugtrafficking has prompted drug traffickers and drug abusers totake defensive actions, which in turn have required new ordifferent governmental responses. This reactive process has beenparticularly characteristic of the Federal effort over the lasttwo decades. The history of Federal drug policy that follows demonstratesthat approaches to reduce supply have been the preferred anddominant Federal response over the last 75 years. It is onlyrelatively recently that the nature of the drug supply-demanddynamic has become widely understood, leading to an increasedappreciation for and emphasis on programs to reduce demand, andthat there is still no consensus on what the role of the Federalgovernment in the national campaign against drug trafficking anddrug abuse should be. The Early Years Although use of drugs has been viewed by many Americans as amedical problem or a personal moral shortcoming throughout thiscountry's history, laws regulating or proscribing such use are ofrelatively recent vintage. The first significant piece ofprohibitory legislation relating to drugs in the United Stateswas an ordinance enacted in 1875 by the city of San Franciscoprohibiting the operation of opium dens, commercialestablishments in which the smoking of opium occurred. Onewestern state after another followed San Francisco's lead andenacted legislation prohibiting opium smoking. Within eight yearsof the passage of the San Francisco ordinance, Congress raisedthe tariff on smoking opium, which was a relatively mild form ofopium, from $6 to $10 a pound; the tariff on opium had first beenimposed in 1842. In 1887, apparently in response to obligationsimposed upon the United States by a Chinese-American commercialtreaty negotiated in 1880, Congress prohibited the importation ofsmoking opium by Chinese subjects. Despite these firstlegislative efforts, the incidence of drug use and addictionincreased, as did societal concern and illegal drug smuggling. Although estimates concerning the number of drug addictsduring the 50 years prior to the passage of drug legislation in1914 are inherently suspect, the available information suggeststhat drug abuse during that period was a "majormedico-social problem." In fact, by 1909, the United Stateswas confronted with a significant and growing drug problem. Theincreased opiate use and addiction in the United Statessubsequent to the Civil War has been attributed to severalfactors, including the indiscriminate use of morphine to treatbattlefield casualties during the Civil War. The increase inmorphine addiction was such that the phrase "armydisease" was used to describe the drug use amongex-soldiers. The widespread administration of morphine byhypodermic syringe also contributed to the increase in opiateabuse. Other circumstances, which exacerbated the situationduring the period of 1865-1914, included the spread of opiumsmoking from Chinese immigrants to American citizens, the use ofopium and its derivatives by the American patent medicineindustry, and the marketing of heroin beginning in 1898 as asafe, powerful, and non-addictive substitute for the opiumderivatives morphine and codeine. The American Opium Commission, established by an Act ofCongress in early 1908, investigated domestic opium use duringthat year. In response to the results of this investigation,Congress passed "An Act to Prohibit the Importation and Useof Opium for Other Than Medicinal Purposes" in 1909, whichamong other things, permitted the importation of opium formedicinal purposes but only to 12 ports of entry. However, it didnot regulate domestic opium production and manufacture or theinterstate shipment of opium products: Opium products were still available without a physician'sprescription and were being marketed throughout the countrythrough retail outlets and a growing mail order trade. Another motivation for the passage of the 1909 Act was therealization that the United States could not continue to advocatemeasures to ameliorate the opium problem in the Far East withouttaking serious steps to deal with its own "homeproblem." Although considered a necessary first step, the1909 Act was subsequently adjudged to be seriously defective inthat it "contain[ed] no provision against the possibleintrastate manufacture of smoking opium. It [did] no more thanexclude this form of the drug from the United States."Because few States had effective laws against the manufacture ofsmoking opium in addition to the proscriptions on its sale anduse, that gap could frustrate the objectives of Federal and Statelaws. Shortly before the enactment of the Act of 1909 anInternational Opium Commission, consisting of the representativesof 13 nations was convened in Shanghai at the initiative of theUnited States. The Shanghai Commission has been described as the"first international effort at the solution of the opiumproblem." Although originally conceived of as anorganization for investigating Far East opium use andtrafficking, the Shanghai Commission was transformed into a bodyfor examining worldwide opium use and trafficking because opiumaddiction had spread to other parts of the world, especially tothe United States, and because producer countries were notrestricted to the Far East. The Shanghai Convention unanimouslyadopted several resolutions for consideration by the governmentsof the participating nations, including the following three: (1) Consider the desirability of reviewing each country'ssystem of regulation of the use of opium in light of thediscrepancies among countries' regulatory systems; (2) Adopt measures to prevent the exporting of opium and itsderivatives to countries which prohibit the importation of suchitems; and (3) Take measures for the gradual suppression of opium smokingin each country's own territories and possessions. Because of the unanimity achieved by the Shanghai Commission,the United States on September 1, 1909, proposed to the otherparticipating countries that an international conference be heldto "conventionalize the resolutions adopted at Shanghai andtheir necessary consequences." The conference, which washeld at The Hague, began on December 1, 1911, and resulted in thesigning of the International Opium Convention on January 23,1912. The Convention was ratified by the United States Senate onOctober 18, 1913. The International Opium Convention committedits signatories to the enactment of laws designed to suppress the"abuse of opium, morphine, cocaine as well as drugs preparedor derived from these substances . . . In response to thisinternational obligation and to domestic considerations, theUnited States passed the Harrison Act on December 17, 1914 (Ch.1, 38 Stat. 785) , which "became the cornerstone of domesticnarcotics policy" for nearly 65 years. The Harrison Act: 1914-1936, Early Years of Enforcement Section 1 of the Harrison Act provided that any person who wasin the business of dealing in the covered drugs was required toregister annually and to pay a special annual tax of one dollar.Section 2 made it illegal for any person to sell or in any way togive away any of the covered drugs, except pursuant to thewritten order of the person to whom the drug was being sold orgiven; the written order was required to be on a form issued bythe Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Section 4 made it unlawfulfor anyone who had not previously registered and paid the specialtax, required by Section 1 of the Act, to engage in interstatetrafficking in the drugs listed. With the exception of employeesof registrants and patients of physicians and dentists, Section 8prohibited the possession of any of the drugs covered by the Actby any person who had not registered and paid the special taximposed by Section I. Section 9 provided that the punishment forany violation of the Act was to be not more than $2,000 or notmore than 5 years in prison or both. Finally, Section 10 gave theCommissioner of Internal Revenue, subject to the approval of theSecretary of the Treasury, the responsibility for enforcing theAct. The history of enforcement under the Harrison Act wastremendously affected by Congress' chosen source of authority forthe legislation, its constitutional power to lay and collecttaxes. The principle of Federalism and the related concept of theStates' police power were effective constraints on the scope ofthe Federal government's powers at the time of the Harrison Act,hence the use of the constitutional authority to tax to regulatedrug-related activity. Because the Harrison Act was superficially a measure designedto raise revenue, its stated purpose dictated that theenforcement of the Statute be the responsibility of the TreasuryDepartment and, by the statute's own terms, of the Commissionerof Internal Revenue. Despite its revenue-raising veneer, itsregulatory purpose was acknowledged from the beginning: Certain individuals viewed the Harrison Act as a rational wayto limit addiction and drug abuse through taxation andregulation. It was a regulatory device which, according to theAmerican opium Commission, "would bring the whole trafficand use of these drugs into the light of day and, therefore,create a public opinion against the use of them that would bemore important, perhaps, than the Act itself" (Dr. HamiltonWright, American Opium Commission). The Act was heralded as amethod of drug abuse control and as a public awareness tool. The history of early enforcement efforts under the HarrisonAct, and of the nation's drug abuse problem and policy generally,was affected in no small degree by a series of Supreme Courtdecisions that were handed down during the decade immediatelyfollowing passage of the Act. The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of theHarrison Act in United States v. Doremus. In deciding the issuesraised by the Government's appeal of the dismissal of theindictment against a physician who had been registered under theAct, the Supreme Court set forth general principles that governedits resolution of the issues: If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to theexercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution,it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives whichinduced it. * * * The Act may not be declared unconstitutional because itseffect may be to accomplish another purpose as well as theraising of revenue. If the legislation is within the taxingauthority of Congress - that is sufficient to sustain it. The Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of Section 2of the Act on the ground that it did relate to the raising ofrevenue. On the same day that the Supreme Court decided Doremus, italso answered in Webb v. United States the following question inthe negative: whether an order for morphine, which is issued by aphysician to a habitual user who is not under his professionalcare and which is issued not for the purpose of curing the habitbut for maintenance, is a "prescription." It did sobecause it concluded that "to call such an order . . . aphysician's prescription would be so plain a perversion ofmeaning that no discussion of the subject is required." The Court extended its Webb Ruling in United States v. Behrmanby holding that an order issued by a physician for large doses ofproscribed drugs, which were not prescribed for the purpose oftreating a condition other than the addiction itself and whichwere to be self-administered by the addict, to a person, who wasaddicted and who was under the physician's personal care,constituted a violation of the Harrison Act. In doing so, theCourt implicitly agreed with the district judge that"prescriptions in the regular course of practice did notinclude the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in suchquantity to addicts as charged in the indictments." The Harrison Act, as construed by the Supreme Court, was thestatutory framework within which Federal drug strategies weredevised and implemented over the next half-century. However,early enforcement efforts and priorities under the Harrison Actdid have somewhat unintended and undesirable consequences. As noted previously, the responsibility for enforcement of theHarrison Act was given initially to the Commissioner of Revenue,subject to review by the Secretary of the Treasury. In 1915, 162collectors and agents in the Miscellaneous Division of theInternal Revenue Service were given the responsibility under theHarrison Act for restricting the sale of proscribed drugs.Meanwhile, the administration and enforcement of the NationalProhibition or the Volstead Act, which was adopted to enforce theEighteenth Amendment, was committed to the Commissioner ofInternal Revenue who created a prohibition unit. Because itseemed logical to place responsibility for enforcement of theHarrison Act within this Prohibition Unit, a Narcotics Divisionwas created in that unit in 1919 with a staff of 170 agents andan appropriation of $270,000. This organizational unit for theenforcement of the Harrison Act existed until April 1, 1927, whenlegislation creating a Bureau of Prohibition and a Bureau ofCustoms, to be headed by Commissioners, within the Department ofTreasury, was enacted. The 1927 legislation also transferred tothe Secretary of the Treasury all powers and duties that had beenconferred by the revenue and prohibition laws upon theCommissioner of Revenue relating to intoxicating liquors andnarcotics. In addition, the Secretary was authorized to delegatesuch powers and duties to the Commissioners of Prohibition andInternal Revenue. The enforcement of the narcotics lawssubsequently was delegated to a narcotics unit under thedirection of the Deputy Commissioner of Prohibition. Enforcement efforts under the Harrison Act from 1914 through1929 were controversial. Following the expansive constructions ofthe Harrison Act by the Supreme Court in Doremus, Webb, andBehrman, thousands of additional prosecutions were undertaken asa result of investigations conducted by agents of the NarcoticsDivision of the Prohibition Unit. It has been estimated that over50,000 individuals, including many physicians and others who wererequired to register under the Act, were charged with violatingthe Act during the period of 1914-1922. After this initial burstof arrest activity directed against registrants, the NarcoticsDivision turned its attention to closing clinics that had beenestablished to conduct research and treat large numbers ofaddicts who could not afford private care. Because of pressure bythe American Medical Association, which had initially welcomedthe Harrison Act but which later came to view the actions of theNarcotics Division as harassment and an improper Federalintrusion into the practice of medicine, the Department of theTreasury encouraged its agents to focus on the "blatantlyillegal importation and sale of narcotics." Despite this change in enforcement direction, the earlierenforcement focus had a damaging, long-term impact. Because ofthe mere threat of prosecution under the Act, the "interestof physicians in these cases [of narcotic addiction]"declined and "they even began to refuse to prescribe."In closing the clinics, which had been established to treat thosewho were unable to afford private care, the Federal governmentmay have impeded - albeit unintentionally - research intonarcotic effects, use and addiction and as a result interferedwith the development of efficacious medical treatment. Finally,the Federal government's early success in decreasing the supplyof narcotic drugs from licit sources, i.e., registrants, to drugusers forced those users to seek out illicit sources of supply. The history of enforcement of the Harrison Act during thefifteen years following its enactment illustrates the operationof a principle that has been validated repeatedly since thattine: drug demand will result in the creation of supply channelsto satisfy the demand. An effective drug abuse policy requires asystematic and long-term demand reduction component;unfortunately, there was no such component of the Federal policyin the more than 50 years following the enactment of the HarrisonAct. Enforcement efforts were burdened, however, by publicdissatisfaction with the activities of the Narcotics Division,which was tainted by its association with the country'santi-liquor laws. The public dissatisfaction intensified becauseof a scandal involving falsification of arrest records andcharges relating to payoffs by, and collusion with, drug dealers.In response, Congress removed the responsibility for enforcingthe Federal drug laws from the Bureau of Prohibition, which wasitself incorporated into the Department of Justice. Drugenforcement was transferred in 1930 to a newly created FederalBureau of Narcotics (FBN) within the Department of the Treasury,which was headed by a Commissioner of Narcotics. Although the FBNwas primarily responsible for the enforcement of the Harrison Actand related drug laws, the task of preventing and interdictingthe illegal importation and smuggling of drugs remained with theBureau of Customs. With one major exception to be discussed atthe beginning of the next section, the Federal statutory andorganizational structure relating to narcotics that existed onJuly 1, 1930, remained in place for the next 35 years. 1937-1969: Intensification of Pressure for Change in FederalDrug Policy Marijuana was not made subject to the Harrison Act or to theNarcotic Drugs Import and Export Act (the Jones-Miller Act)because it was not viewed as a particularly dangerous drug. Inaddition, because of its use in the making of rope, twine,veterinary medicines, and other products, marijuana's commercialvalue was thought to outweigh any deleterious effects from itsabuse. However, as marijuana use became widespread in America,concern about its use also spread. Due to the efforts of a"small but vocal group of crusaders," the States beganto pass legislation to prohibit all marijuana-related activity.By 1931, "all but two states West of the Mississippi andseveral more in the East had enacted prohibitory legislationmaking it a criminal offense to possess or use the drug."The FBN initially minimized the dangers of marijuana use, and inits 1932 annual report, it instead urged the States to adopt aUniform State Narcotics Law. Such a law was drafted in 1932, andit included an optional marijuana provision. By 1937 every state had prohibited marijuana use. However,faced with continuing intensive lobbying efforts, the FBN didbecome an "ardent supporter" of marijuana legislation,which finally was embodied in the Marihuana Tax Act 1937. The Marihuana Tax Act was nominally a revenue measurepatterned after the Harrison Narcotic Act. It required that anyperson whose business related to marijuana to register and pay aspecial tax. In addition, the transference of marijuana had to bepursuant to a written order on a form issued by the Secretary ofthe Treasury and the transferee was required to pay a tax of$1.00/ounce if he had registered and $100.00/ounce if he had not.Finally, the Act made the transferor liable for the transfer taxif a transfer were made without an order form and without paymentof the tax by the transferee. From the late 1930's through the 1950's, the FBN's enforcementefforts were directed almost exclusively at disrupting theillegal importation of drugs into this country and to makingcases against distributors and dealers. Indeed, in 1942 the FBNrecognized that it was necessary to eradicate crops in Mexico ifits interdiction efforts were to achieve greater success. In thatsame year Congress enacted the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942,which, among other things, prohibited the domestic production ofthe poppy without FBN permission. During a great part of this period the FBN was handicapped tosome degree by a shortage of agents and inadequate budgets. Inthe Spring of 1956, a Congressional Committee found that: [FBN] is one of the few Federal agencies whose personnel andfunds have not been increased to reflect population growth andgreater responsibility. Over a period of 25 years, the Federalnarcotic laws have been enforced with a force of approximately227 agents and an average budget of less than $2 million. Thisrestriction on manpower and operating funds has seriouslycurtailed investigations of the illicit traffic in the UnitedStates and of sources of supply in foreign countries. Because of budget limitations, the present force of 250Federal narcotic agents is 25 short of the number authorized bythe Congress. By way of comparison, New York City hasapproximately 200 police officers assigned specifically tonarcotic enforcement. These statistics suggest that, during this time, drug abuseand trafficking were not the Federal priorities that they aretoday. Despite the handicaps that the FBN operated under during thisperiod, it nevertheless enjoyed a degree of success. According toLCN informer Joseph Valachi, the tactics used by the FBN toinfiltrate and disrupt trafficking organizations caused some LCNchieftains to rethink the advisability of their continuedparticipation in the drug trade. According to Valachi, FrankCostello, then acting boss of the Luciano Family, ordered itsmembers to stop trafficking in drugs in 1948. One of theprincipal reasons for the edict was explained as follows: Much more important . . . was the dogged harassment of theBureau of Narcotics. The Cosa Nostra despised - and feared - [theFBN] . . . . The Narcotics Bureau, unlike the FBI, which tends to look downits nose at it, does not depend on the informant system for muchof its intelligence but regularly engages its agents in dangerousundercover work; they are, as a result, . . . highly motivated,less disciplined, generally more daring and innovational,occasionally corruptible. Above all else, the [FBN] was the firstto recognize the existence of an organization like the CosaNostra, and no other arm of the law has put more of a crimp inits operation. Although continuing to warn of the dangers of drug use, theFBN, especially during the earlier part of the period,"adopted a more moderate approach in its dealings withCongress as well as the American people." The Bureau'sapproach reflected the attitude of the American public, whichappeared to consider the drug problem to be restricted to smallgroups at the periphery of society, with no great societalimpact. In the 1950's the rather complacent attitude toward the drugproblem began to change. The first indication of greater concernwas reflected in the enactment of the Boggs Act on November 2,1951, which generally increased the penalties for violations ofthe narcotic and marijuana laws. The primary motivations for thepassage of the Boggs Act were the inadequacy of penalties underthe existing law as deterrents and an increase in drug addiction.With respect to the former, Congress relied on statistics showingthat the rate of recidivism among drug violators had increasedsubstantially over a 15- year period of time; in 1935, 40 percentof those convicted of narcotics violations had prior drugconvictions, while 63.6 percent of those convicted and sentencedduring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1950 were recidivists.Congress concluded that drug addiction was increasing on thebasis of statistics showing that between 1946 and 1950 there hadbeen a 100 percent increase in the number of narcoticlaws-related arrests and that the average age of personscommitted to a Public Health Service Hospital had declined from37.5 to 26.7 years, over a five year period. Encouraged by the purported success of the Boggs Act, Congresspassed the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, which further increasedthe penalties for drug violations. Among other things, this 1956Act raised the permissive maximum sentences for violations of thenarcotic possession statutes; imposed new mandatory minimumsentences and increased the permissive maximums for traffickingviolations; eliminated probation, suspension of service, orparole for all cases except those involving a first offenderpossessor; authorized FBN and Customs agents to carry firearmsand to execute and serve search and arrest warrants; made thesale of heroin to individuals under 18 years of age a capitaloffense, although the death penalty was not made mandatory butcould be imposed only if the jury specifically so directed; andmade the smuggling of marijuana a violation of the Narcotic DrugsImport and Export Act. The severe penalties imposed by the Narcotic Control Act of1956 were adopted even though Congress found that, as a result ofthe Boggs Act, "narcotic addiction and the illicit narcotictraffic [were] generally on the decline in the UnitedStates." Because the stringent penalties imposed by theBoggs Act were thought to be successful in decreasing drugaddiction, the 84th Congress concluded that the imposition ofeven more severe penalties would "be the strongest and mosteffective deterrent to narcotic addiction and illicit drugtraffic." Finally, Congress was of the view in enacting theNarcotic Control Act of 1956 that "suppression of theillicit drug traffic" would be the most importantcontribution that the Federal Government could make to thesuccessful and permanent rehabilitation of drug addicts. Congressthus sought to reduce the demand for drugs through reducing theirsupply. Public concern over the problem of drug abuse, which had beenrelatively dormant during the 1940's and 1950's, flared duringthe 1960's. The intensification of the national concern resultedin increasing pressure for Federal initiatives in the area. Inresponse to this development, a White House Conference onNarcotics and Drug Abuse was convened in 1962, which resulted inthe establishment of the President's Advisory Commission onNarcotics and Drug Abuse (Prettyman Commission) on January 15,1963. The Prettyman Commission's final report, submitted toPresident Kennedy in November 1963, included 25 recommendations,the substance of several of which were: (1) Transfer the enforcement and investigative functions ofthe FBN relating to illicit transactions in narcotic drugs andmarijuana from the Department of Treasury to the Department ofJustice; (2) Transfer the responsibilities of the FBN relating to theregulation of the legitimate traffic in narcotic drugs andmarijuana from the Department of the Treasury to the Departmentof Health, Education and Welfare; (3) Substantially increase the number of Federal agentsassigned to the investigation of the illicit importation of andtrafficking in narcotic drugs, marijuana, and dangerous drugs; (4) Transfer the responsibility for investigating the illicittraffic in dangerous drugs from the Department of Health,Education and Welfare to the Department of Justice; and (5) Strictly control, by Federal statute, all non-narcoticdrugs capable of producing serious psychotoxic effects whenabused. Within 18 months of the issuance of the Commission's finalreport, Congress adopted the recommendation regarding thediversion of "dangerous drugs" from legal channels. Theresulting Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 mandated, amongother things, record-keeping and inspection requirements fordepressant and stimulant drugs, and specifically for barbituratesand amphetamines, "throughout the chain of distribution,from the basic manufacturer to (but not including) the ultimateconsumer." The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 werepassed because of perceived serious problems associated with thediversion of depressant and stimulant drugs from licit channels: [T]estimony showed that over 9 billion barbiturate andamphetamine tablets are produced annually in the United States.It is estimated that over 50 percent, or 4 1/2 billion tablets,are distributed through illicit channels. The human toll of drugabuse cannot be measured for it affects not only the abuser buthis family and the community around him. Drug abuse is closelybound up with juvenile delinquency. It also contributes to therising crime rate in the United States. To carry out the new enforcement obligations imposed by theDrug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 another agency was created;a Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (BDAC) was established within theDepartment's Food and Drug Administration. The Bureau of Customs,however, retained responsibility for the enforcement of lawsrelating to the importing and exporting of depressant andstimulants drugs. With the establishment of the BDAC on February1, 1966, the Department of the Treasury's virtual monopoly of theenforcement of Federal drug laws ended. Within 16 months of the enactment of the Drug Abuse ControlAmendments of 1965 Congress passed an enlightened piece oflegislation: The Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966. ThisAct did many things, including: authorizing a district court toorder the civil commitment of an individual, who was an addict,who had been charged with certain offenses against the UnitedStates, and who elected to do so, to the Surgeon General fortreatment of his addiction and rehabilitation, in lieu ofprosecution; requiring a district court to commit an individualwho had been convicted of certain offenses against the UnitedStates and who was an addict to the custody of the AttorneyGeneral for treatment and rehabilitation; permitting any narcoticaddict to file a petition with a United States Attorneyrequesting that he be admitted to a Public Health Servicehospital for treatment and rehabilitation; and authorizing theSurgeon General to establish rehabilitation andpost-hospitalization care programs for narcotic addicts and toprovide financial assistance to the States to establish similarprograms. As the House Committee on Judiciary, one of the Congressionalcommittees which reported on the proposed bill, observed, theNarcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966: . . . mark[e]d a fundamental reorientation toward the problemof narcotics addiction. The Attorney General in his testimonybefore the Committee stated that for too long the law hadstressed punitive solutions and neglected medical andrehabilitative measures. The 1966 Act embodied a proposition that had tended to beoverlooked in the past: successful treatment and permanentrehabilitation of drug users, i.e., reduction of demand fordrugs, must be an essential component of Federal law enforcementefforts. A detailed evaluation of the Federal drug strategy that wasreleased in 1979 accurately summarized what the Federal approachhad been prior to the late 1960's: Early efforts to deal with the problem primarily focused onreducing the supply of drugs, first through taxation, then byprohibition and strict legal control. The basic assumption . . .was that reducing supply and availability of drugs would lead toreduction in their use by encouraging drug-dependent individualsto detoxify, and by keeping drugs out of the hands of users. By the end of the 1950's there was a general agreement on thepart of both the public and legislators that the Federal policyof strict supply reduction by itself was not enough. During the1960's and early 1970's, as drug abuse increased and spread tonew markets, the almost exclusive emphasis on supply reductionand stiff penalties was challenged with growing frequency,leading to increased research and experimentation with treatmentfor drug abusers. Beginning in 1968, in response to rising . . . concern . . .,a variety of changes occurred in an attempt to curtail drugabuse. Despite the work of the Prettyman Commission and the enactmentof the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, public agitationconcerning crime in general, and drug abuse in particular,intensified. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson establishedthe President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administrationof Justice (Katzenbach Commission) in 1966 to undertake a"comprehensive study of the nation's crime problem and toprovid[e] recommendations to coordinate its eradication on allfronts." The Katzenbach Commission issued a report in 1967,which included a chapter on drug abuse. The substance of severalof the Katzenbach Commission's recommendations addressed both thedemand and supply of drugs: (1) Substantially increase the enforcement staffs of FBN andthe Bureau of Customs; (2) Permit courts and correctional authorities to dealflexibly with violators of the drug laws; (3) Undertake research to develop a sound and effectiveframework of regulatory and criminal laws relating to dangerousdrugs; and (4) The National Institute of Mental Health should develop acore of educational and informational materials relating todrugs. Drawing on the recommendations of the Prettyman Commission,President Johnson sent a reorganization plan restructuring theFederal drug law enforcement effort to Congress for itsconsideration on February 7, 1968. In terms that have beenrepeated often since that time, President Johnson explained thereason for the proposed consolidation of drug enforcementresponsibilities: Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcoticslaws are fragmented. * * * Neither [the FBN nor the BADC] is in the agency which isprimarily concerned with Federal law enforcement - the Departmentof Justice. This separation of responsibilities . . . has complicated andhindered our response to a national menace. Among the most significant provisions of the plan, whichbecame effective on April 7, 1968, were the following: theDepartment of Justice was given a major responsibility for theenforcement of the Federal drug laws for the first time inhistory by the creation within it of a Bureau of Narcotics andDangerous Drugs (BNDD); the FBN was abolished, and its drugenforcement duties and responsibilities were shifted to BNDD; andBDAC was also abolished, and its drug enforcement duties andresponsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice. The 1968 reorganization did not significantly affect therevenue collection functions exercised by IRS under the Harrisonand Marijuana Tax Acts or the responsibility of the Bureau ofCustoms for interdicting the smuggling of narcotics andmarijuana. The Plan that was intended to eliminate fragmentationin Federal drug law enforcement thus did not eliminate itentirely. Although neither House of Congress blocked the 1968reorganization plan, criticism of it did develop. While inagreement that merger of the FBN and BDAC would eliminatefriction and duplication of effort, Congressional opponentsexpressed skepticism that law enforcement relating to drugs andorganized crime would be in any way improved by transferring themerged entity to the Department of Justice. BecauseAdministration spokesmen had acknowledged that BDAC and the FBNhad been effective law enforcement agencies, the opponents of theplan recommended that the merged entity should instead be locatedwithin the Department of the Treasury, where coordination withIRS and Customs, both of which had drug law enforcementresponsibilities, could be better assured. That the BNDD wasapparently not to be placed within the FBI was one factor leadingthe dissenters to conclude that "greater overall efficiencyin crime enforcement" would not be achieved by the placementof the merged entity into Justice. Federal Drug Law Enforcement: From Implementation of the 1968Reorganization Plan to October 27, 1970. Two major issues during the 1968 Presidential campaign werecrime and drugs. Shortly after his inauguration, PresidentRichard M. Nixon declared war on both and formed Task Force Onein the spring of 1969 to "design programs that would have animmediate effect on the importation of heroin and other illegaldrugs." Task Force One developed and implemented OperationIntercept, the "first major interagency attempt at borderinterdiction," which involved more than 2,000 Customs, INSBorder Patrol, and BNDD agents. Because the amount of illegaldrugs seized as a result of Operation Intercept wasdisappointingly small and because the venture seriously strainedrelations between Mexico and the United States, JusticeDepartment officials concluded that successful interdictionprograms required the cooperation of source countries. As aresult, in the fall of 1969, Operation Intercept was transformedinto Operation Cooperation, which in part provided U.S. financialaid to the Mexican Government to purchase aircraft and to trainagents to interdict the flow of drugs before they reached theUnited States borders. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of1970 The year 1970 was an important one in the history of thisNation's war against drug trafficking and drug abuse. In Februaryof that year, President Nixon clarified the responsibilities ofthe various Federal agencies involved in the effort against drugtrafficking by issuing a directive announcing that BNDD"controls all investigations involving violations of thelaws of the United States relating to narcotics, marijuana anddangerous drugs, both within the United States and beyond itsborders. Several months later, the President approved guidelines,developed by the Attorney General and the Secretary of theTreasury, which increased the investigatory responsibility ofCustoms at ports and borders. However, the most significant eventin 1970 was the enactment of the Comprehensive Drug AbusePrevention and Control Act of 1970 (1970 Comprehensive Act). As of 1970, numerous Federal statutes dealt with variousfacets of the Nation's drug trafficking and abuse problems. Theselaws overlapped, were sometimes inconsistent, and required morethan a dozen Federal agencies to enforce them. In response, the1970 Comprehensive Act was passed to collect and conform"diverse laws in one piece of legislation based upon newscientific information, the restructured Federal law enforcementefforts under Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1968, and greaterinformation concerning the scope of the problem." The 1970 Act comprised four titles: Title I authorized theDepartment of Health, Education, and Welfare to increase itsefforts in drug rehabilitation, drug treatment and the preventionof drug abuse. Specifically, Title I authorized the appropriationof funds for drug abuse prevention and education programs and forspecial project grants to programs designed to treat andrehabilitate narcotic addicts or drug dependent persons. As aresult of these steps, Congress provided for a "greatlyincreased Federal effort in the fields of prevention andrehabilitation" and made the National Institute of MentalHealth the agency primarily responsible for drug education andprevention activities in the Federal government. Title II of the 1970 Act, the "Controlled SubstancesAct," along with Title III, comprehensively addressed thelaw enforcement aspects of the attack on drug abuse. Among otherthings, Title II established five schedules into which controlledsubstances were and could be placed, required the registrationof, and record-keeping by, manufacturers, distributors anddispensers of controlled substances, imposed penalties forviolations of the Act, established a Commission on Marihuana andDrug Abuse, and authorized BNDD to add 300 agents to its staffduring FY 1971. Finally, Title III, the Controlled Substances Import andExport Act, governed the importation and exportation ofcontrolled substances. The Attorney General was given theresponsibility for maintaining the integrity of the import/exportregistration system that the Act created. Although primarily an effort to consolidate the myriad of lawsdealing with drug trafficking and abuse that had been adoptedover the years, Congress's authority for enacting the 1970 Actwas predicated upon its interstate commerce power and not, aswith previous narcotics laws, on the constitutional power to tax.This shift had enormous implications for the way that the Federalgovernment would and did approach drug enforcement in the future: [The Controlled Substances Act] set the stage for aninnovation in Federal drug enforcement techniques. Thatinnovation was assigning large numbers of Federal narcoticsagents to work in local communities. No longer was it necessaryto demonstrate interstate traffic to justify Federalparticipation in combating illegal drug use. Constitutional challenges to the 1970 Act that were predicatedupon the intrastate nature of the conduct prosecuted wererejected. Federal Drug Abuse Policy: 1970-1980 The decade of the 1970's was an extremely significant one forthe development of Federal drug abuse policy in terms of newlaws, organizational and operational reforms, and a growingrecognition that the reduction of the demand for drugs must begiven a greater emphasis. On the debit side the extent of theNation's drug abuse problem at the end of 1980 was as great as,if not greater than, the problem in 1970. To some extent, thesituation in 1980 was attributable to the continuing andunresolved debate concerning the appropriate Federal role in thenational struggle against drug abuse and trafficking. New legislative initiatives, organizations, and operationalreforms relating to the Nation's drug abuse problem were adoptedand implemented within a relatively short period after theenactment of the 1970 Comprehensive Act. One of the mostimportant and innovative of these reforms was the establishment,by executive order, of the Special Action Office for Drug AbusePrevention (SAODAP) within the Executive Office of the Presidenton June 17, 1971. The President made the Director of SAODAP hisspecial representative with respect to all Federal drug abusetraining, education, rehabilitation, research, treatment, andprevention programs and activities (exclusive of law enforcementactivities and legal proceedings). In this capacity, the SAODAPDirector's duties included prescribing "policies,guidelines, standards, and criteria for the maximum achievementof the goals and objectives" of Federal demand reductionprograms and coordinating and evaluating all Federal drug abuseprograms. President Nixon did not neglect the supply reduction componentof the Federal drug policy. Presidential initiatives in this areain 1971 included the establishment of the Cabinet Committee onInternational Narcotics Control (CCINC) and of the NarcoticsTraffickers Program (NTP) within IRS. The CCINC, chaired by theSecretary of State, was given the responsibility for"developing a strategy to check the illegal flow ofnarcotics to the United States and coordinating the effortsundertaken abroad by involved Federal departments and agencies toimplement that strategy." The NTP was designed to function as a mechanism for disruptingdrug trafficking by having the IRS intensively investigatetop-echelon drug dealers. The IRS effectively ended the NTPsometime in 1975, both because it had a relatively low revenueyield and because IRS officials felt uncomfortable in operating aprogram whose primary objective was not tax-related. On January 28, 1972, President Nixon took another step,designed to improve the Federal government's drug law enforcementefforts by establishing an Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement(ODALE) within the Department of Justice. This office was to beheaded by a Director who would be a Special Assistant AttorneyGeneral and who would serve as a Special Consultant to thePresident concerning drug law enforcement. In this role the ODALEDirector was responsible for advising the President on improvingthe effectiveness of Federal drug enforcement and on assistingthe States and local governments in strengthening their own druglaw enforcement. The Director was also required to develop andimplement a "concentrated program" for enforcingFederal laws concerning drug abuse prevention and for cooperatingwith State and local governments in the enforcement of their drugabuse laws. Finally, to ensure that all steps permitted by lawwere taken by Federal, State and local governments and by theprivate sector to prevent drug abuse, the Director of ODALE wasinstructed to consult regularly with the SAODAP Director. Withthe establishment of ODALE and SAODAP, and the presidentialinstruction that their Directors consult, cooperate, andcoordinate, a mechanism was created within the Federal Governmentthat, at least theoretically, could have integrated Federalstrategies to reduce drug supply and demand to achieve maximumresults. That ODALE was created in early 1972, so relatively soon afterthe implementation of the 1968 reorganization plan, bespoke alack of confidence in the structure and operation of the drug lawenforcement system created by that plan. Indeed, ODALE wasestablished because of the "Administration's concern thatBNDD and Customs could not act with the swiftness and precisionthat a single agency vested with authority and power could."In performing its duties and responsibilities ODALE "wasempowered to take the lead in the Administration's 'war onheroin,' with a particular emphasis on street-leveltrafficking." Several months after the creation of ODALE, another unit, theOffice of National Narcotic Intelligence (ONNI), was establishedwithin the Department of Justice to function as a ClearinghouseOf information that would be useful in the Administration'scampaign against drug trafficking. The Director of ONNI wasinstructed to collect and provide narcotics intelligence to anyFederal, State, or local official determined to have a"legitimate official need" for the intelligence. TheONNI Director was also instructed to cooperate with the Directorof ODALE to assist the latter in insuring that all feasible stepswere taken to prevent drug abuse in the Nation. Although itsmandate did not include the independent development of narcoticsintelligence, the establishment of ONNI was the first concreterecognition by officials at the highest levels of the Federalgovernment of the crucial role that intelligence had to play insupply reduction strategies. Congress eventually responded positively to President Nixon'srequest that it enact legislation confirming his creation ofSAODAP by passing the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972(1972 Drug Abuse Office Act). This legislation was an importantevent in the history of Federal drug abuse policy: With the enactment of the [Act] Federal policy clearly calledfor a balanced response to the problem of drug abuse by adding avigorous prevention and treatment component to the existing lawenforcement effort. Although commitments to the "balanced response"enshrined in the 1972 Drug Abuse office Act have been proclaimedrepeatedly ever since, they have not generally been translatedinto action, as measured by budget authorizations andexpenditures. Congress was persuaded to enact the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Actbecause the witnesses who testified before its committees were"unanimously agreed that drug abuse in America had reachedepidemic proportions." Most of the witnesses were"generally agreed that greater emphasis on the so-calleddemand side of the problem is required, that is, on treatment,rehabilitation, research, education and training." Congressalso found that the Federal government's activities with respectto the "demand side of the drug abuse field have beencarried on by at least nine different agencies anddepartments" and that the legislation under considerationwas needed to "provide for and insure a centralcomprehensive coordination of the federal effort." Inpassing the Act, Congress concluded that the "emphasis must,indeed, be changed [to strategies to reduce demand] if there isto be meaningful progress in the effort against drug abuse." The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act did many things, includingestablishing SAODAP in the Executive Office of the President;making the Director of SAODAP responsible for, among otherthings, providing overall planning and policy, and establishingobjectives and priorities, for all federal drug abuse preventionfunctions, making recommendations to the President concerning anyFederal drug traffic prevention function, making findings andrecommendations to the President concerning the resolution ofconflicts involving drug abuse prevention or drug trafficprevention functions, and coordinating Federal drug abuseprevention functions with those of the State and localgovernments; directing the President to require development of acomprehensive, coordinated long-term Federal strategy for alldrug abuse and drug traffic prevention functions; directing theSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants toStates submitting plans for establishing, conducting andcoordinating projects for the development of more effective drugabuse prevention functions and to make special project grants to,and contracts with, public and private entities and individualsto develop drug abuse prevention programs; and establishing aNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to administer theprograms of the Secretary of HEW relating to drug abuseprevention functions. The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act was necessary and usefullegislation, but it was based on the mistaken premise that thenation's drug abuse problem could be dealt with in a relativelyshort period of time: [I]t is the policy of the United States and the purpose ofthis Act to focus the comprehensive resources of the FederalGovernment and bring them to bear on drug abuse with theimmediate objective of significantly reducing the incidence ofdrug abuse in the United States within the shortest possibleperiod of time . . . . Consistent with this premise, Congress provided that SAODAPwas to be abolished on June 30, 1975. There appears to have been an expectation at the time that the1972 Drug Abuse office Act became effective that NIDA wouldassume many of the programmatic functions of SAODAP on or beforeJune 30, 1975, after the war against drug abuse had been won andonly "mopping-up" operations remained. This expectationno doubt was encouraged by statements made subsequent to thepassage of the 1972 Act, such as that of President Nixon inSeptember of 1973 that "[w]e have turned the corner on drugaddiction in the United States." As the historical recorddemonstrates, the expectation of quick success was unrealisticbecause of the nature of the drug problem. The 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act reflected the realization thatan exclusive reliance on strategies to reduce supply will fail toachieve the ultimate objective. Such an approach disregards thefundamental economic principle, that where a demand for a serviceor commodity exists, some entrepreneur, for the right price, willattempt to supply it. There is an optimal mix of approaches toreduce demand and supply that will obtain maximum results andthus achieve the goal of that policy, i.e., the elimination ofdrug abuse. The Federal government necessarily has a paramountand continuing role in that policy, in terms of providingleadership, resources, and support to the other participants.Experience immediately following the enactment of the 1972 DrugAbuse Office Act demonstrates that although the Nation's drugabuse problem may never be eliminated, it can be reducedsubstantially if a long-term commitment of sufficient resourcesis made and unreasonable impatience for results is checked. Despite the comprehensive restructuring of the Federalnarcotics laws that had occurred in 1970, related legislativeinitiatives, and the innovations in Federal drug law enforcementrepresented by ODALE and ONNI, the Nixon Administration concludedthat Federal drug law enforcement continued to be hampered byinteragency rivalries and jurisdictional overlaps and disputes.In response, another major restructuring of the Federal drug lawenforcement machinery was announced on March 28, 1973. The NixonAdministration trumpeted the 1973 reorganization plan, which wasimplemented on July 1, 1973, as doing for the supply side of thedrug abuse problem what the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act had donefor the demand side: create an organization with the necessaryresources, breadth, and leadership capacity to act decisively. The Federal drug law enforcement structure in March of 1973was complex, as reflected in Appendix C, with no singleindividual or agency responsible for supervision of the overalleffort. The 1973 reorganization plan was designed to overcomeperceived deficiencies in existing law enforcement. The 1973 reorganization plan was motivated primarily by thebeliefs of Administration officials that the aggregation ofFederal drug law enforcement activities had "seriousoperational and organizational shortcomings" and that"enforcement work could benefit significantly . . . fromconsolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unifiedcommand." The most important innovation adopted by the planwas the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)within the Department of Justice as the "single,comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice tolead the war against illicit drug traffic." The DEA, to beheaded by an Administrator who would report directly to theAttorney General, was to be responsible for the anti-drugfunctions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgetsof BNDD, ODALE, and ONNI and those of the Bureau of Customs withrespect to drug investigations and intelligence. The plan alsoprovided that drug law enforcement research that had beenhitherto funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administrationwould be transferred to DEA. While the 1973 reorganization plan reaffirmed the jurisdictionof the Bureau of Customs to conduct investigative, intelligence,and law enforcement functions relating to the suppression of drugtrafficking at ports of entry and borders, it prohibited Customsfrom exercising those functions, as it had been previouslyauthorized to do, at locations away from ports of entry orborders. In addition, drugs, evidence, and persons seized bycustoms agents at ports of entry or borders were to be turnedover to representatives of the Attorney General. The planexplicitly provided that the Department of Justice, in additionto Customs, could perform law enforcement functions, includingthose relating to illicit drug trafficking, at the Nation's portsof entry and borders. Finally, the plan required the AttorneyGeneral to assure the maximum cooperation between and among DEA,the FBI, and other units of the Justice Department to achievecoordination of all of his drug law enforcement functions. Once established, DEA played an "increasingly crucialrole in the coordination of Federal drug law enforcement; andduring the 1970's a number of interagency efforts werelaunched." Among the coordination efforts undertaken by DEAwas the development of mechanisms to provide timely and accuratenarcotics intelligence to drug law enforcement personnel at theFederal, State and local levels. Steps taken by DEA in this areaincluded the establishment of: (1) An Office of Intelligence at DEA headquarters which,organizationally, was at the same level as its Office ofEnforcement; (2) Regional Intelligence Units (RIUs) in each of the DEAregions; (3) The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) in 1974 as a borderintelligence unit, which soon grew into a"twenty-four-hour-a-day intelligence center, with worldwidecapabilities to collect, process, and disseminate informationconcerning illicit drug trafficking as the smuggling of aliensand weapons; EPIC is staffed by personnel from DFA, INS, Customs,the Coast Guard, BATF, FAA, the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI andIRS; (4) The Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System(NADDIS) and the System to Retrieve Information from DrugEvidence (STRIDE) to provide access to numerous investigativerecords of PEA and other Federal, State and local drugenforcement records; (5) In April of 1978, the National Narcotics IntelligenceConsumers Committee (NNICC), chaired by the DEA Deputy AssistantAdministrator for Intelligence and including representatives fromthe Departments of Defense, Treasury and State, and theircomponent agencies in the field, including Customs, the CoastGuard, FBI, INS, IRS, and NIDA to coordinate the collection,analysis, dissemination and evaluation of drug-relatedintelligence, both foreign and domestic, and to publish annuallya "National Intelligence Estimate on the Supply of Drugs tothe U.S. Illicit Market from Foreign and Domestic Sources." In addition to trying to improve the intelligence gatheringand dissemination functions of Federal drug law enforcement, PEAattempted to improve the task force concept in drug lawenforcement which it had inherited from ODALE. In 1974 DEAadopted the Central Tactical Units (CENTAC) program to focusenforcement resources on conspiracy investigations of high-leveldrug trafficking targets. Unfettered by normal DEA regionaloperations, centrally administered, specially funded, staffed bypersonnel from DEA, IRS, Customs, and State and local agencies,and charged with pursuing conspiracy cases under the ContinuingCriminal Enterprise (CCE) and RICO statutes, the CENTAC programdid produce relatively high arrest and conviction rates of highlevel traffickers, and accounted for 12 percent of DEA arrestsfrom 1976 to 1979 while using less than three percent of DEApersonnel. Although criticizing the CENTAC Program for notexploiting the Federal forfeiture statutes to seize the assets ofconvicted traffickers, the General Accounting office (GAO)nevertheless concluded that: Given the success of the Central Tactical units and the needfor more multi-regional conspiracy investigations, the expansionof the [CENTAC] program is warranted. GAO recommended expansion of the CENTAC program despite anearlier conclusion that the CENTAC efforts had not"achieve[d] the overall objective - complete immobilizationof the targeted trafficking organizations." The 1980 GAOreport also conflicted with: DEA officials who said the current size of the CENTAC programis optimum given existing enforcement resources, requiredcommitments, and their preference for regionally controlledinvestigations . . . . Another effort at interagency operational cooperation duringthe decade of the 1970's was the creation of three FBI-DEA forcesin Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles to "test thefeasibility of joint operations." These task forces weredesigned to combine the FBI's organized crime and conspiracycases expertise with DEA's experience in narcoticsinvestigations. This effort was probably doomed from the startbecause, although each agency was supposed to coordinate with theother, each used its own investigative techniques, personnel, andinformation sources and each maintained jurisdictional autonomy.After two years, the program was in effect disbanded, andevaluations by GAO and others attributed the failure todisagreements over investigative techniques and to restrictionson case selection. The creation of DEA by the 1973 reorganization plan and DEA'ssubsequent development of new supply reduction approaches werenot the only steps undertaken and designed during the 1970's torespond to what many had come to view as the almost intractablenational drug problem. For example, Congress passed the NarcoticAddict Treatment Act of 1974, which amended the 1970 ControlledSubstances Act to require annual registration by practitionersdispensing narcotic drugs, including methadone, for maintenanceor detoxification purposes. This legislation, which imposedstandards for the legal dispensing of drugs, was deemed necessarybecause of the increased diversion of methadone for illegal saleand use. That year also saw the passage of the Alcohol and Drug AbuseEducation Act Amendments of 1974, which extended the grant andcontract authorities of the Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 forthree years and authorized the expenditure of $90 million overthose three years. The Act placed greater emphasis on the needfor prevention and early intervention programs, recognizing thecrucial role of family, peer group, school, church and othercommunity institutions in influencing young people's behavior. In enacting the 1974 Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education ActAmendments, Congress noted that most of the previously adoptedFederal programs to reduce demand had "inevitably beendirected primarily toward the person who is already in serioustrouble with alcohol and/or drugs," but that the focus ofthe Drug Abuse Education Act of 1970 had been different in thatit was directed to those who had not yet experimented with drugsor to those who had just begun to do so. In passing the 1974amendments Congress applauded the focus on prevention,reaffirming the philosophy that had suffused the 1970 EducationAct: [R]eal progress in the struggle against alcohol and drug abusewill require an intensified effort to reach that far morenumerous group, those millions of young people who may be temptedto experiment with dangerous drugs or who may have already doneso. Although committed to the continuation of Federal support forlocal drug education programs, Congress was nevertheless criticalof those educational programs that were based upon informationthat was incomplete, erroneous, or designed to frighten, andthose based on accurate information that had the tendency toarouse interest in drugs and to lead to experimentation, Beforepassing the 1974 Amendments Congress received assurances from theOffice of Education within the Department of HEW that it wouldmake every effort to support only those programs which would"incorporate factual material about drugs into programswhich focus on the causes of drug use and emphasize thedevelopment of appropriate attitudes and values," ratherthan merely inform and arouse interest. The Nixon Administration opposed passage of the bill thateventually became the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Education ActAmendments of 1974 because it believed that "alcohol anddrug abuse education [should] be included among the specialprojects to be funded under other education legislation and thatalcoholism and drug abuse formula grant funds to the states[should] be considered the major source of funds for localalcohol and drug abuse education programs." Congressdisagreed with the Administration's position concerningcategorical legislation relating to prevention and earlyintervention educational programs, stating that: Failure to renew a clear legislative mandate to the Office ofEducation would destroy the identity of the program at both theFederal and the State level and would cast the alcohol and drugeducation programs in the role of supplicants to those agencieswhose primary concern is not education and who are alreadybesieged by the demands of treatment programs. The ultimate result would be either the disappearance ofcommunity drug and alcohol education programs or a reversion tosome of the futile and dangerous efforts of the past. . . As noted earlier, the 1972 Drug Abuse Office Act provided thatSAODAP would be abolished on June 30, 1975, with no assignment ofits policy-making and coordinative functions to any other Federalagency. On March 19, 1976, however, legislation was approved thatin effect continued SAODAP, but under the slightly different nameof "Office of Drug Abuse Policy" (ODAP). Congresscreated ODAP because: [T]here is current evidence that whatever improvement in theproblem occurred in 1973 was temporary and that the presentproblem is at least as great as at the time the original act waspassed. In approving the continuation of an executive level drugadvisor, Congress found that "drug abuse was not a crisiswhich could be rapidly solved but rather a continuing problemcalling for a continued Federal responsibility." Congressalso concluded that Federal expenditures for drug abuseprevention efforts had peaked in 1974 and then declined, despitecontinuing serious problems, due to, among other things, theanticipated end of SAODAP: It would also appear that the existence of a high-level officein the executive branch is to some extent correlated with thefiscal emphasis provided to drug abuse prevention efforts. Congress was also somewhat concerned that "unless someactive direction is taken at some high level it is probable thatin the very near future funding for drug law enforcement willagain overbalance funding for drug abuse prevention." In creating ODAP Congress required its Director to makerecommendations to the President regarding the policies andpriorities for, and objectives of, all Federal "drug abusefunctions," a term which was defined to encompass both drugabuse prevention and drug traffic prevention functions, and tocoordinate the performance of such functions by Federaldepartments and agencies. This was a significant expansion of theauthority of ODAP's predecessor, SAODAP. Despite the Ford Administration's opposition to thecontinuation of an executive-level office relating to drug abuseprevention, President Ford did not veto the 1976 amendmentcreating ODAP. However, President Ford did not staff ODAP, eventhough a specific line-item authorization had been made for it.DAP did not come into being until President Carter issued amemorandum initiating the Office on March 14, 1977. Less than twomonths after the Senate confirmation of the ODAP Director,President Carter submitted a reorganization plan restructuringthe Executive Office of the President to Congress on July 15,1977. The 1977 reorganization plan altered the structure of theExecutive Office of the President, which at the time consisted ofthe immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office,OMB, and 14 other agencies, including ODAP and the DomesticCouncil. As proposed, the plan, among other things, abolished theDomestic Council and ODAP and redesignated the Domestic CouncilStaff as the Domestic Policy Staff. The functions of ODAP and itsDirector would be transferred to the President who could thendelegate such functions. Several members of Congress, recalling that it was the needfor a high-level policy and coordinating office to oversee theactivities of more than 20 Federal agencies with significant drugabuse responsibilities that had given birth to the SAODAP/ODAPprogram, expressed grave concern about the abolishment of ODAP.President Carter assured them that the ODAP's functions would becarried on within the Executive office of the President and thatthe Domestic Policy Staff, with several of its staff membersassigned exclusively to drug abuse issues, would handle ODAP'spolicy-making and coordinative functions. With Congressionalacquiescence, the 1977 Reorganization became effective on March26, 1978, at which time a core group of ODAP staff wastransferred to the Domestic Policy Staff. Although Congress did not block the provisions of the 1977reorganization plan, members of Congress nevertheless remainedunsure whether drug abuse policy-making and coordinativefunctions could be or would be adequately performed by theDomestic Policy Staff. This uncertainty was reflected in the DrugAbuse Prevention and Treatment Amendments of 1978, which extendedthe authorization for NIDA programs for only one year, instead ofthe previous multi-year reauthorizations, so that it couldevaluate the system created by the 1977 reorganization plan aftera relatively brief but adequate period of time. The Congressional evaluation of the operations of the drugabuse policy and coordinating system in the Executive Office ofthe President was embodied the next year in the Drug AbusePrevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Amendments of 1979.During the consideration of this legislation, President Carterassigned the Associate Director for Drug Policy of the DomesticPolicy Staff the responsibility for assisting the President inperforming the functions of ODAP, which had been transferred tothe President by the 1977 reorganization plan. President Cartertook this step because of Congressional concern that: [T]he continued coordination of drug abuse policy, required bythe 1972 Act and its subsequent amendments, became dependent uponthe continued interest . . . of the President and otherindividuals within the Executive Branch, rather than beingclearly structured by statute as had been the case prior to theimplementation of the Reorganization Plan. Because of the steps taken by the Carter Administrationincluding the revitalization of the Strategy Council, Congressresponded by legislating what the 1977 reorganization plan haddone. In addition to giving its imprimatur to the 1977reorganization plan, the 1979 legislation made authorizations forNIDA's state formula grants and special grant and contractprograms for drug education and prevention through September 30,1981. It did so because it found that the "growing extent ofdrug abuse indicates an urgent need for prevention andintervention programs designed to reach the generalpopulation." In providing for a two-year reauthorization forNIDA programs and activities, Congress rejected the CarterAdministration's proposal that state formula grants for drugabuse be consolidated with those for alcoholism and mental healthbecause: There is considerable history to suggest that earmarkedfunding for categorical programs should remain separate at theState level as well as at the national level. Within thetraditional health care delivery system, the drug and alcoholclient has not fared well. To force these systems to competeagain is to seriously jeopardize the major strides which havebeen made . . . . The Committee insists that a categoricalemphasis on drug abuse must be maintained at all levels ofgovernment. A loss of direct program emphasis would severely harmthe state focus on combatting drug abuse, and could seriouslyendanger the Nation's battle against drug abuse. The decade of the 1970's was an important one in the evolutionof the Federal drug abuse effort. It began with a comprehensiverestructuring of Federal laws relating to drugs and included amajor reorganization of Federal drug law enforcement agencies ina effort to reduce interagency rivalries and to promoteefficiency and leadership in the fight against drug trafficking.Equally important was the recognition that strategies to reducedemand must be an essential component of the overall drug abusepolicy and that the nation's drug abuse problem could not beregarded as a crisis susceptible to quick resolution. Inaddition, new laws were passed to respond to particular aspectsof the drug problem, and new enforcement approaches were tried inan effort to disrupt drug trafficking more effectively. On a less positive note, disagreements over certainfundamental issues remained unresolved at the end of the 1970's.Among these were the role of the Federal Government in drugpolicy and the appropriate balance between strategies to reducedemand and supply. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, despitelegislation, massive reorganizations, new enforcement techniques,and necessary attitudinal changes, the problems of drug abuse andtrafficking continued at high levels at the end of the decade.

The Reagan Administrationhas taken many steps designed to improve the effectiveness of theU.S. overall drug abuse policy. Reorganization/Coordination On January 21, 1982, in a major policy shift, the FBI wasgiven concurrent jurisdiction with DEA for drug law enforcementand investigation. In addition, the Administrator of DEA wasrequired to report to the Director of the FBI who was given theresponsibility for supervising generally drug law enforcementefforts and policies. In giving the FBI concurrent jurisdiction for enforcement ofU.S. drug laws, the Attorney General followed the recommendationof a committee that he had established to study the need forincreased coordination of DEA and the FBI in the drug field. Thiscommittee was headed by then Associate Attorney General RudolphW. Giuliani. According to Giuliani, the Attorney General'scommittee recommended concurrent jurisdiction because: [W]e believe we can more effectively deal with the large-scaletrafficking groups by coordinating DEA's street-level, undercoverexpertise with the FBI's ability to combat large criminalenterprises. The FBI's 20-year experience in combatting organizedcrime will also prove critical to drug enforcement. Although FBI expertise in organized crime and financialinvestigations would be available in drug enforcement work as aresult of concurrent jurisdiction, DEA would continue to functionas a "single-mission narcotics enforcement agency" thatwould "give the drug problem the kind of focus itneeds." In another action relating to the coordination of Federal drugabuse efforts, President Reagan issued an executive order on June24, 1982, directing the office of Policy Development to assistthe President in performing his duties under the Drug AbusePrevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act; designating theDirector of the Drug Abuse Policy Office within the Office ofPolicy Development as primarily responsible for coordinating,overseeing, and policy-making for all Executive international anddomestic drug abuse functions; and making the Director directlyresponsible for the activities of a drug policy staff within theoffice of Policy Development. Despite President Reagan's stated commitment to theperformance of the functions imposed upon him by the Drug AbusePrevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act, Congress becameincreasingly dissatisfied with a perceived lack of coordinationof such functions. This dissatisfaction became embodied in anOmnibus Crime Bill (H.R. 3963) which included a provision toestablish an Office of Director of National and InternationalDrug Operations and Policy, which was described as follows: Similar in concept to SAODAP, the proposed agency would havebeen charged with the overall planning and coordination ofFederal efforts to control the supply of dangerous drugs. Unlike SAODAP, which had been directed by Congress tocoordinate Federal drug abuse prevention efforts, and unlikeODAP, which was enjoined to oversee all Federal drug abuseprograms, the proposed Office of Director of National andInternational Drug Operations and Policy was envisioned as amechanism for coordinating and directing Federal law enforcementoperations. While the President was considering the merits of H.R. 3963,an Administration spokesman criticized that portion of the billcreating the Office of Director of National and InternationalDrug Operations and Policy: If the czar . . . is to have the power to direct the drugenforcement operations of other Cabinet officers, the very natureof our Cabinet system of government would be drastically altered.If he is not to have such power, he could do little more thaninterfere with the existing mechanisms, which have been workingwell. Two days after this statement appeared, President Reaganpocket-vetoed H.R. 3963 and issued a memorandum of disapprovalexplaining his action: The creation of another layer of bureaucracy within theExecutive Branch would produce friction, disrupt effective lawenforcement, and could threaten the integrity of criminalinvestigations and prosecutions . . . . The seriousness of this threat is underscored by theoverwhelming opposition to this provision by the Federal lawenforcement community as well as by such groups as theInternational Association of Chiefs of Police and the NationalAssociation of Attorney's General. * * * The war on crime and drugs does not need more bureaucracy inWashington. It does need more action in the field, and that iswhere my Administration will focus its efforts. Members of Congress were not easily dissuaded from theirefforts to achieve a greater degree of coordination of theFederal drug abuse efforts. On February 7, 1984, the Senatepassed a proposed National Narcotics Act of 1984 (S. 1787),which, among other things, would have established a cabinet-leveloffice of National and International Drug Operation and Policy.Under the bill the Director of the Office was authorized to:develop, review, implement, and enforce U.S. policy concerningillegal drugs; coordinate all U.S. efforts to halt drugtrafficking into and within the United States; develop, inconcert with the Federal entities concerned with drug control,budgetary priorities and allocations; and coordinate thecollection and disseminate of narcotics intelligence. In recommending that S. 1787 be passed, the Senate JudiciaryCommittee acknowledged that the Reagan Administration hadundertaken a number of "promising initiatives" in druglaw enforcement. However, the Committee concluded that an Officeof National and International Drug Operations and Policy wasnecessary because: [T]he Committee believes the Administration's anti-drug effortfalls short in one crucial respect: the lack of centraldirection. At least 15 Federal agencies play a role in the regulation ofcommerce in dangerous drugs or in the enforcement of otherrestrictions . . . . These agencies are located in six differentdepartments. Under such circumstances, it is inevitable thatdivergences as to priorities will arise and that there will beconflicting interpretations of national policy. Indeed, nationalpolicy in such an area as drug law enforcement must becontinually reevaluated and reformulated; a one-time annualreview and the publication of a broadly-worded strategy does notsuffice. The Committee also described in some detail the role itenvisioned for the proposed Office: SOADAP was the same kind of "overlord" agency as theone contemplated by S. 1787. However, it was flawed from thebeginning in that its effective jurisdiction was limited toactivities aimed at the control of drug demand; it was not givenauthority of any substance in the law enforcement field. * * * The Committee bill draws from the SAODAP concept, but focuseson the aspects of drug control that were excluded from the formeragency's purview, i.e., the government's efforts to control thesupply of abused drugs. It is in the area of supply control, beit in foreign or domestic programs, that the Committee perceivesthe greatest current need for central direction. In recommending the establishment of an office to which theReagan Administration appeared to be implacably opposed, theSenate Judiciary Committee took pains to observe that theDirector of the Drug Abuse Policy office was not capable ofperforming the necessary coordinative functions concerningFederal drug law enforcement efforts: [U]nder questioning by several Congressmen [of the HouseSubcommittee on Crime at a February 17, 1983, hearing on thecoordination of drug enforcement efforts] it became clear thatthe director does not have the authority or stature to overseethe implementation of the Federal strategy. Anxious to reassure the Administration about the proposedcabinet-level Office, the Committee made it clear that, inimplementing the legislation, the President would have a greatdeal of flexibility; for example, the Office would not have to beestablished in the Executive office of the President, and theAttorney General could be appointed the Director of the centraldrug agency. However, the Committee was insistent that theDirector have something like a cabinet-level status because suchstatus was deemed "necessary if the office is to have theinfluence needed to impose a truce on interagency feuding, toinsure maximum participation, and to allocate budgetary resourcesfor top efficiency and economy." Despite the Administration's opposition, the Senate passed S.1787. However, Congressional conferees compromised andsubstituted a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board for theOffice of National and International Drug Operations and Policyas the means for achieving greater coordination of Federal druglaw enforcement efforts. Both the House and Senate agreed to theConference Report, and Public Law No. 98-473 was thereafterapproved on October 12, 1984. Title II of this law was entitledthe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, and Chapter XIII ofthat title was designated the National Narcotics Act of 1984. Congress established the National Drug Enforcement PolicyBoard (Policy Board) because it found that drug trafficking wasestimated to be an $80 billion a year industry; only 5 to 15percent of the drugs imported into the country were interdicted;and controlling the supply of drugs was thought to be a key toreducing the drug-related crime epidemic. The Policy Board,chaired by the Attorney General, was and is charged withfacilitating coordination of U.S. operations and policyconcerning illegal law enforcement. As Chairman of the PolicyBoard, the Attorney General was given many duties, includingadvising the Policy Board concerning drug law enforcement andacting as primary advisor to the President and Congress onBoard-developed programs. The Act, however, declares that nothingtherein authorizes the Board or its Chairman to interfere withroutine law enforcement or intelligence decisions of any agency.Finally, the National Narcotics Act of 1984 amended the DrugAbuse Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act to declarethat one of the duties of the White House Office of Drug AbusePolicy Board was to insure coordination between the Policy Boardand health issues associated with drug abuse. The creation of the Policy Board in January 1985 representsonly the latest compromise between the President and Congress inthe ongoing search for more effective coordination of all facetsof the Federal drug abuse effort. It remains to be seen whetheran entity like the Policy Board can effectively oversee, police,and coordinate all Federal law enforcement efforts and whethersome other mechanism is needed to impose coordination of Federaldemand reduction and supply reduction strategies. Legislative Responses to the Drug Problem In addition to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984,other important legislative initiatives have been adopted inrecent years. For example, the Department of DefenseAuthorization Act of 1982 contained a provision, "MilitaryCooperation With Civilian Law Enforcement Officials," whichwas intended to codify the practices of cooperation that haddeveloped between military and civilian law enforcementauthorities. The Act was also designed to improve the level ofcooperation by delineating precisely that assistance whichmilitary commanders could provide and by permitting militarypersonnel to operate military equipment that had been lent tocivilian drug enforcement agencies. This legislation was deemednecessary for the following reasons: The rising tide of drugs being smuggled into the United Statesby land, sea, and air presents a grave threat to all Americans. * * * Only through the dedicated work of all of Federal, State, andlocal law enforcement agencies can we begin to stem this tide. Infighting this battle, it is important to maximize the degree ofcooperation between the military and civilian law enforcement. Atthe same time, we must recognize the need to maintain thetraditional balance of authority between civilians and themilitary. The most important and innovative part of the legislation wasSection 374, which permits the Secretary of Defense to assignDepartment personnel to operate and maintain military equipmentthat had been made available to an agency with jurisdiction toenforce the Controlled Substances Act. This relatively simplechange increased geometrically the potential interdictioncapability of Federal drug law enforcement agencies. The year 1984 was a prolific one for legislation dealing withdiscrete areas in drug law enforcement. The Controlled SubstanceRegistrant Protection Act of 1984 made it illegal, among otherthings, to steal any quantity of a controlled substance from aregistrant. Congress also directed the Attorney General,notwithstanding the scheduling provisions of the ControlledSubstances Act, to transfer methaqualone, commonly known by thebrand name Quaalude, from Schedule II to Schedule I, with theeffect of making the prescription of methaqualone unlawfulbecause it no longer had an approved medical use. While remainingcommitted to the proposition that scheduling of controlledsubstances ordinarily should be handled in accordance with theadministrative procedures mandated by the Controlled SubstancesAct, Congress took this legislative action after determining thatcircumstances required it to do so and that the adverse effectsof the diversion of methaqualone outweighed its therapeuticusefulness. Congress also passed the Aviation Drug-Trafficking ControlAct, which amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, to, amongother things, require the Administrator of the FAA to revokeairman certificates and aircraft registrations of those convictedof violating any Federal or State law relating to controlledsubstances, except where the violations involved possessionoffenses. The Act also made it illegal for any person to serve asan airman without an airman's certificate in connection with atransportation that constitutes a Federal or State drug felonyoffense. Although the Controlled Substance Registrant Protection Act of1984, the Aviation Drug-Trafficking Control Act, and theCongressional rescheduling of methaqualone were necessary laws,by far the most important drug law enforcement measures passed in1984 were contained in several provisions of the ComprehensiveCrime Control Act of 1984. The Act included: (i) Bail Reform Act of 1984: This Act comprises many sections,but the most important and most controversial was that codifiedin 18 U.S.C. Section 3142. Section 3142 provides that when aperson charged with an offense appears before a judicial officer,the judicial officer must order that, pending trial, the accusedbe released on personal recognizance or upon execution of anunsecured appearance bond; released upon certain listedconditions; temporarily detained to permit exclusion ordeportation if not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident;temporarily detained to permit revocation of a prior conditionalrelease; or detained. The preventive detention provision statesthat the judicial officer must hold a hearing in any caseinvolving a narcotics offense for which imprisonment for ten ormore years is prescribed to determine whether any conditions willassure the accused's appearance and the safety of any otherperson and of the community. In any such hearing the accused mustprove that there are conditions that will assure his appearanceor the community's safety, if the judicial officer finds thatthere is probable cause to believe that the person committed theoffense. (ii) Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984: This legislationmade extensive revisions to Federal civil and criminal forfeiturelaws and procedures, which had targeted the assets ofracketeering and drug trafficking organizations: Today few in the Congress or the law enforcement communityfail to recognize that the traditional criminal sanctions of fineand imprisonment are inadequate to deter or punish the enormouslyprofitable trade in dangerous drugs . . . . Clearly, if lawenforcement efforts to combat racketeering and drug traffickingare to be successful, they must include an attack on the economicaspects of these crimes. Forfeiture is the mechanism throughwhich such an attack may be made. This 1984 legislation was designed to eliminate limitationsand ambiguities that had "significantly impeded the fullrealization of forfeiture's potential as a powerful lawenforcement weapon." With respect to the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act, the 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act didseveral things, including confirming the Supreme Court's decisionin Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16(1983) that adefendant's ill-gotten profits from racketeering wereforfeitable; defining the property subject to forfeiture toinclude real property; making the relation back doctrine, i.e.,U.S. interest in forfeitable property arises at the time of thecommission of the act that gives rise to the forfeiture,applicable in criminal forfeiture proceedings; and expandingpost-indictment prior restraining order authority to preserve theavailability of forfeiture assets by making an indictmentsufficient to establish conclusively probable cause that theproperty will be forfeited. The Comprehensive Forfeiture Act also amended the 1970Comprehensive Act. With respect to criminal forfeiture, the 1984Act added a new provision to the 1970 act that is applicable toall felony drug offenses, including the Continuing CriminalEnterprise offense. In virtually all respects, the drug criminalforfeiture provisions are now identical to those of the amendedRICO statute. The new drug criminal forfeiture provision alsocreates a rebuttable presumption that any property of a personconvicted of a drug felony is subject to forfeiture if thegovernment establishes by a preponderance of the evidence thatthe defendant acquired the property during the period ofviolation, or within a reasonably short period thereafter, andthere was no likely source for the property other than theviolation. (iii) Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984.This legislation generally enhanced the penalties for violationsof the Controlled Substances Act. Specifically, it provided a20-year prison term and a $250,000 fine for violations involvingspecified large amounts of Schedule I and II narcotic drugs, PCPand LSD; raised the fine for violations involving all Schedule Ior II substances and enhanced the fines for violations involvingSchedule III, IV, and V substances. With respect to all doublingprovisions for recidivists in the Controlled Substances Act, the1984 legislation removed an ambiguity in the existing law byproviding that a State drug felony conviction would trigger theprovisions; it went further by providing that a Foreign drugfelony conviction would have the same effect. Finally, the 1984legislation provided that anyone who distributed controlledsubstances on or within 1,000 feet of school property could besubjected to a prison term or fine or both up to twice what isotherwise provided. (iv) Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of 1984. Thislegislation "represent[ed] the first major updating of theregulatory provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and theControlled Substances Import and Export Act since their enactmentin 1970." In doing so, the 1984 amendments focusedprincipally on diversion of drugs of legitimate origin into theillicit market and the manufacture and abuse of new drugs, suchas controlled substance analogs. With respect to the problem ofdiversion, which Congress had attempted to address in the 1970Comprehensive Act by creating a closed system, the legislativehistory states: Diversion of legally produced drugs into illicit channels is amajor part of the drug abuse problem in the United States. It isestimated that between 60 and 70 percent of all drug-relateddeaths and injuries involve drugs that were originally part ofthe legitimate drug production and distribution chain. Also,diversion of legally produced drugs often evidences the same sortof large-scale trafficking more commonly associated with thetrade in wholly illicit drugs. * * * Unfortunately, experience under the [CSA] over the past decadehas demonstrated that the strong regulatory authority to maintaina "closed" distribution chain does not exist at thepractitioner level. Yet, it is estimated that 80 to 90 percent ofall current diversion occurs at this level. In response to this diversion problem, Congress amended theControlled Substances Act to, among other things, permit theAttorney General to deny registration to practitioners if suchregistration would be inconsistent with the public interest,authorize the Attorney General to suspend or revoke aregistration upon the recommendation of a competent stateauthority or if the public interest requires it; and authorizethe Attorney General to make grants to State and localgovernments in connection with those governments' anti-diversionprograms. With respect to the problem of the manufacture and abuse ofnew drugs, Congress found that: [T]he procedural requirements for controlling a drug under 21U.S.C. 811 have proven sufficiently time consuming that theypreclude a swift response when an as yet uncontrolled drugrapidly enters the illicit market and creates a significanthealth problem. As a result of the Dangerous Drug Diversion Control Act of1984, Congress gave the Attorney General emergency schedulingauthority. Under that authority, the Attorney General ispermitted to schedule a drug in Schedule I on a temporary basis,for up to one year, if he determines that such action is"necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the publicsafety." In making this determination, the Attorney Generalneed only consider the history and current pattern of abuse, thescope, duration, and significance of abuse, and the nature of therisk, if any, to the public health. The temporary scheduling maybe extended for up to six months while a rule-making proceedingis conducted for the purpose of permanently scheduling the drug.Such a temporary scheduling order is not subject to judicialreview. (v) Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting ActAmendments: "Without the means to launder money, therebymaking cash generated by a criminal enterprise appear to comefrom a legitimate source, organized crime could not flourish asit now does." The 1984 amendments of the Currency andForeign Transactions Reporting Act were designed to "finetune the [then] current currency reporting law." One of thechanges adopted increased the civil penalty for violating therecords and reporting requirements of the Act from $1,000 to$10,000 for each violation and the criminal penalty from $1,000and 1 year in prison to $250,000 and 5 years imprisonment. Thesechanges were deemed necessary because: [I]t is important to recognize that [the requirements] areprimarily directed at persons who make a lucrative career in theillicit drug trade and organized crime. As such, the penaltiesare far too low to deter and punish such activity. Indeed, themodest penalties now applicable may simply be written off as acost of doing business. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 was intended to,and did in fact, provide Federal law enforcement agents withbetter tools for combatting drug traffickers. However, it isstill too early to evaluate how these tools have been used. Important legislation in the field of drug abuse since 1981has not been restricted only to matters relating to improvingdrug law enforcement. As noted previously, Congress in 1979rejected President Carter's proposal that NIDA's State formulagrants for drug abuse programs be consolidated with those foralcoholism and mental health. Instead it reauthorized the drugformula grants through September 30, 1981. In passing the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Congress reversed itself andfundamentally changed the role that the Federal Government playsin overseeing and funding of drug abuse prevention, treatment andrehabilitation programs by creating an Alcohol and Drug Abuse andMental Health Service Block Grant (ADMS Block Grant). The newprogram was designed to distribute the Federal money that hadpreviously been provided to the States through formula andproject grants and contracts. One of the principal motivations for adopting the block grantapproach was the belief that the States were in the best positionto determine the most efficacious use of Federal funds: The ADMS Block . . . [was] established in 1981 to provideState and local governments greater flexibility anddecision-making authority in focusing Federal, State, and localresources on needs and priorities they know best and in ways theybelieve are best suited to local conditions. Block grants werealso intended to eliminate duplication and overlapping ofservices and allow States to better integrate and coordinateservices funded by several levels of government. In addition to establishing the ADMS Block Grant, the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act specified how the States were to spendtheir allotment. Although requiring the States to file reportswith information permitting the Secretary of Health and HumanServices to determine whether the Federal funds provided wereexpended in conformity with the objectives of the block grant,the Act also directed the Secretary not to impose burdensomereporting requirements. The reporting requirements concerning theblock grant imposed by the Secretary were much less extensivethan those existing under the categorical programs that existedprior to the adoption of the block grant approach. The impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act has beenestimated: Since the establishment of the ADMS Block Grant, theamount of Federal money going to State drug abuse prevention andtreatment programs has declined by approximately 40 percent. Itis not possible, however, to determine what the impact of thisreduction has been because a portion, perhaps significant, of thereduction represents savings due to the elimination of overheadadministrative costs. Law Enforcement and Executive Responses to the Drug Problem. Recognizing that drug abuse and drug trafficking are seriousnational problems, which also pose a threat to national security,the Reagan Administration has taken steps since 1981 that havebeen designed to improve Federal law enforcement efforts againstdrug traffickers. Narcotics intelligence is essential to any drug lawenforcement program. In that regard, on December 4, 1981,President Reagan issued an executive order, entitled "UnitedStates Intelligence Activities," which was intended to"control and provide direction and guidance to theIntelligence Community." Among the executive order'sprovisions relating to drugs, one authorizes agencies within theU.S. Intelligence Community to participate in law enforcementactivities to investigate or prevent international narcoticsactivities and to render assistance and cooperation to lawenforcement authorities not otherwise precluded by law. Inaddition, agencies within the Intelligence Community areauthorized to collect, retain, or disseminate informationconcerning U.S. persons obtained during the course of a lawfulinternational narcotics investigation or incidentally obtainedinformation indicating involvement in activities that may violatefederal, state, local or foreign laws. Finally, the ExecutiveOrder directs that all departments and agencies involved in theU.S. intelligence effort shall cooperate to provide the Presidentand the National Security Council with information on which tobase decisions concerning the conduct and development of foreign,defense, and economic policy and the protection of U.S. nationalinterests. Whether the U.S. Intelligence Community has played or willplay the important role in the Nation's anti-drug effortenvisioned for it by Executive Order 12333 depends upon thecommitment of its constituent departments and agencies toeliminating this threat to national security. The Executive Orderwas an important event because it represented recognition at thehighest level of the Executive Branch that, without accurate andadequate strategic, operational, and tactical narcoticsintelligence, the Federal drug trafficking prevention effortwould be seriously crippled. During 1981 the deleterious effect of drug trafficking on thequality of life in Florida, and especially in South Florida, hadbecome so great that the State's citizens demanded prompt andeffective responses by government at all levels. At the Federallevel, President Reagan established on January 28, 1982, acabinet-level South Florida Task Force, also known as OperationFlorida, which was chaired by Vice President Bush, to"assist and coordinate Federal efforts with those of Stateand local authorities in order to reduce crime" and whichwas patterned after previous multi-agency efforts, such as theCENTAC program. The South Florida Task Force was intended to be a"broad, multifaceted anti-crime program," but its focuswas on interdiction and the arrest and prosecution of drugsmugglers. Assistance to the South Florida Task Force, whichbecame operational on March 15, 1982, was provided by DEA,Customs, FBI, BATF, the Marshals Service, the Coast Guard, andthe Department of Defense. One of the more significant features of the South Florida TaskForce was the creation of the South Florida Joint Task Group,which consisted of DEA and Customs personnel and which wascharged with conducting follow-up investigations of druginterdictions. In authorizing Customs agents to conduct suchinvestigations under the supervision of DEA on March 20, 1982,the Attorney General modified, albeit slightly, the structure ofFederal drug enforcement that had been established by PresidentNixon's 1973 reorganization plan. That plan had prohibitedCustoms agents from exercising investigative, intelligence, andlaw enforcement functions at locations away from ports of entryor borders. This action was in effect a recognition, longoverdue, that it was necessary, if law enforcement effortsagainst drug trafficking were to be improved, for Customs'intelligence and investigative functions to be expanded. Operations Greenback and Florida were successful in that theyforced traffickers to reduce their activities in Florida.However, the increased law enforcement pressure, as had happenedso many times in the past, resulted in the traffickers divertingdrug smuggling to Gulf and Eastern ports of entry and their moneylaundering activities to New York and the California-Mexico area.The successes achieved by the Florida multiagency operations thusexacerbated an already serious nationwide drug problem, but theyalso provided a model for responding to that problem. In 1982 theAttorney General appointed a committee to develop new approachesto the drug trafficking problem. The Committee concluded that"no single agency could cope with the problem" and that"many previous cooperative ventures, although limited inscope by comparison, provided the promise that agencies cancooperate and . . . only full-scale teamwork could meet thecrisis . . . ." The Committee's conclusions led to PresidentReagan's announcement on October 14, 1982, of the formation of 12regional Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, which wereauthorized in January 1983 and became operational during thespring of that year. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program(OCDETF Program) is modeled after the South Florida Task Force,but its objectives are quite different. While the primaryobjective of the South Florida Task Force is the interdiction ofdrugs, the focus of the OCDETF Program is the leaders of largeorganizations, which control drug importation and distributionnetworks, and the disruption of those networks. The participatingFederal agencies are the U.S. Attorney's offices, DEA, FBI,Customs, BATF, IRS, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. MarshalsService. The OCDETF Program differs from previous multi-agencylaw enforcement efforts in several respects: the task forces aredirectly controlled by the Attorney General; the initial fundingwas under the control of the Attorney General; and the taskforces are to focus on only one major segment of organizedcriminal activity, drug trafficking. Because the OCDE Task Forcesare not intended to replace existing Federal enforcement effortsagainst drugs and organized crime, the work of the organizedCrime Strike Forces and the South Florida Task Force continue, asdo the efforts of the FBI, DEA, Customs, and U.S. Attorneysdirected against organized crime groups involved in drugtrafficking. Shortly after the establishment of the OCDETF Program, theReagan Administration adopted another multi-agency approach toone facet of the Nation's supply reduction efforts, interdiction,by creating the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System(NNBIS) which was to be headed by Vice President Bush. NNBIS wasgiven the responsibility for informally coordinating theinterdiction efforts of other organizations; it could recommend,but not require, that the organizations take certain actions, andit itself was not authorized to interdict drugs. When it becameoperational, NNBIS took over the interdiction coordinationresponsibilities of the South Florida Task Force. Despite theestablishment of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board in1984, NNBIS continues to operate as an interdiction coordinatingbody.

A good indicatorof the present complexity of the Federal response is the factthat 32 Federal agencies are now involved in the multifacetedeffort to reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. In thischapter, the Commission describes the current anti-drug effortsof the principal Federal agencies and their roles in the nationalstrategy. The agencies are grouped by function, beginning withthose with central policy roles, followed by internationalefforts, interdiction, domestic enforcement, data gathering,intelligence, and United Nations efforts. Overall Policy The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board The National Narcotics Act of 1984 created the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board (the Board). This Cabinet-level Boardconsists of the Attorney General as Chairman and the Secretariesof State, Treasury, Defense, Transportation, and Health and HumanServices, as well as the Directors of Central Intelligence andthe Office of Management and Budget, as members. It is the latestmanifestation in the persistent effort to achieve singularity ofpurpose in the fight against drug abuse, despite the diversity ofFederal agencies involved. This fact is explicitly recognized inthe pertinent statutory language, found at 1302(b) of the Act, inwhich Congress expresses its intent to: (1) Maintain a national and international effort againstillegal drugs; (2) Coordinate fully the activities of the Federal agenciesinvolved; and (3) Charge a single, competent, and responsiblehigh-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by theAttorney General, with responsibility for coordinating UnitedStates policy with respect to national and international drug lawenforcement. This intent is based upon sweeping Congressional findings setforth in Section 1302(a) of the Act: (1) The flow of illegal narcotics into the United States is amajor and growing problem. (2) The problem of illegal drug activity falls across theentire spectrum of Federal activities both nationally andinternationally. (3) Illegal drug trafficking is estimated by the GeneralAccounting office to be an $80 billion per annum industry in theUnited States. (4) The annual consumption of drugs has reached epidemicproportions. (5) Despite the efforts of the United States Government andother nations, the mechanisms for smuggling opium and other harddrugs into the United States remain virtually intact, and UnitedStates agencies estimate that they are able to interdict no morethan 5 to 15 percent of all hard drugs flowing into the country. (6) Such significant indicators of the drug problem asdrug-related deaths, emergency room visits, hospital admissionsdue to drug-related incidents, and addiction rates are soaring. (7) Increased drug trafficking is strongly linked to violentaddiction-related crime, and recent studies have shown that over90 percent of heroin users rely upon criminal activity as a meansof income. (8) Much of the drug trafficking is handled by syndicates, asituation that results in increased violence and criminalactivity because of the competitive struggle for control of thedomestic drug market. (9) Controlling the supply of illicit drugs is a key toreducing the crime epidemic confronting every region of thecountry. (10) The magnitude and scope of the problem requires theestablishment of a National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,chaired by the Attorney General, to facilitate coordination ofall Federal efforts by relevant agencies. (11) Such a Board must have responsibility for coordinatingthe operations of Federal agencies involved in attacking theproblem through the development of policy and resources, so thata unified and efficient effort can be undertaken. To accomplish the statutory purpose, S. 1304 of the Actspecifically empowers the Board to improve policy development andcoordination among Federal agencies by: (1) reviewing, evaluating, and developing U.S. governmentpolicy, strategy, and resources with respect to drug lawenforcement efforts, including the setting of budgetarypriorities and development of a national and international drugenforcement strategy; (2) facilitating coordination of all U.S. government effortsto halt national and international trafficking in illegal drugs; (3) coordinating the collection and evaluation of informationnecessary to implement U.S. policy with respect to drug lawenforcement. In furtherance of these aims S. 1306 of the Act directs theDirector of the Drug Abuse Policy Office to serve as an advisorto the Board on matters related to health issues in the drugabuse field. As a principal figure in the area of interdiction,the Vice President is included as an ex officio member. Under this scheme the Attorney General as Board Chairman, inconsultation with the other members, supervises the preparationof initiatives for consideration by the Board. The Board, underthe direction of the Chairman, then determines which items toinclude on its agenda and what priority each is to receive. Suchitems are then referred to the Coordinating Group, chaired by theDeputy Attorney General and consisting of senior officials fromthe member agencies. The Coordinating Group in turn is to submit to the Boardpractical recommendations, based on consultation with theagencies involved, for resolving drug law enforcement issues anddeveloping appropriate Federal policy. Both the Board and theCoordinating Group are supported in their efforts by a full-timeprofessional staff charged with performing necessary research,analysis, and writing. This staff is composed of individualsdrawn from various principal agencies. The intent of thismulti-agency composition at all levels, Board, CoordinatingGroup, and staff, is a reflection of the Board's intent, asexpressed in its 1985 Interim Act to Congress: This structure reflects the need for interagency participationat every level of Policy Board activity. The underlying principleis that there is a practical advantage to resolving differencesat the lowest level possible. Disagreements on issues willinevitably occur among various agency participants, but if allpoints of view are represented at each level, many differencescan be worked out by the Staff or Coordinating Group rather thanbeing elevated to the Policy Board. Section 1304(a) of the Act specifically directs the Board tofocus its work on two parts of the five-point National Strategyon Drug Abuse: drug law enforcement and internationalcooperation. In the area of drug enforcement, the Board pursuesfour principal strategies: 1) illegal drugs are to be destroyedat their source; 2) drug contraband is to be intercepted andseized en route to or at the borders of the United States; 3)drug trafficking organizations are to be identified, investigatedand prosecuted, and drug related assets seized and forfeited; and4) regulatory means are to be exercised to stem diverted drugabuse. The Board commenced its activities on April 24, 1985, almost ayear after its creation. In its first meeting, it adopted theorganizational structure described above. In the months betweenApril 1985 and the end of that year, the Board met five times andthe Coordinating Group, five times. Issues referred to theCoordinating Group during that time include "designer"drugs, efforts to improve government-wide drug seizurestatistics, and drug crisis management. Its agenda includes areport in January 1986, required by the Narcotics Act of 1984, onthe Board's achievements and the effectiveness of its policies tocombat national and international drug trafficking. It is also topublish a 1986 strategy report. Items under consideration forinclusion in the Boards agenda are: Budget Review. The Government has increased substantially theamount of resources devoted to drug law enforcement. Because ofthe numerous agencies and departments now involved in combattingdrug trafficking, the Policy Board is an ideal forum forconsidering the Government's overall drug law enforcement budget.The Board may undertake budget reviews to determine whetherresources are appropriately allocated. Consideration will also begiven to insuring proper interagency balance and the optimal useof tax dollars and resources in the drug war. Memoranda of Understanding. The Board may review the numerousjurisdictional Memoranda of Understanding between Federalagencies to determine the effectiveness of these mechanisms forinteragency cooperation. Interdiction. The Board may examine all of the interdictionprograms currently in place. Since, in the last few years, theFederal Government has made an increased effort to preventillegal drugs from entering the United States, the Board maypropose to analyze the effectiveness of interdiction as anoverall law enforcement strategy. The Board will also considerthe experience gained from the 1981 exception to the PosseComitatus Act to determine whether additional legislative actionis needed. Eradication. The Board proposes to assess the efficacy of alleradication strategies and the cost-effectiveness of eradicationas a drug law enforcement strategy. In addition, it will addresshow eradication relates to other elements of our enforcementstrategy. Because domestic marijuana reduction involves a numberof agencies, this issue is well suited to a study by the PolicyBoard and its staff. Other Issues. The Board may also refer other issues foradditional staff analysis. These might include: money laundering;financial investigative techniques, including asset forfeiture;the relationship of supply and demand reduction strategies; andthe collection and sharing of drug intelligence. The Board's vision of its role is summed up in its InterimReport: The Board is assuming the task of coordinating all drugrelated programs. To do this, the Board may develop a planningand management process for policy development and evaluation ofthe nation's narcotics law enforcement programs. White House Drug Abuse Policy Office Created within the White House by Executive Order 12368, theDrug Policy Abuse Office was established to ensure that thePresident is provided with a center for coordination andoversight of both national and international drug abuse functionsof all executive branch agencies. The role of this office hasbeen expanded to include drug trafficking issues as well. Theoffice publishes a regular report on both drug abuse and drugtrafficking, the National Strategy, which provides policydirection for all agencies involved in anti-drug efforts. As partof the White House Office of Policy Development, the White HouseDrug Abuse Policy Office provides the President with a directadvisor on drug abuse policy matters. International Efforts Bureau of International Narcotics Matters As the Federal agency responsible for coordinating the UnitedStates' drug control efforts overseas, the Department of State'sBureau of International Narcotics Matters (BINM) is pivotal inimplementing U.S. anti-drug policy on the international level.BINM attempts to encourage foreign coordination for joint illicitdrug control activities; bilateral assistance for crop controland interdiction programs in the form of equipment, training andtechnical advisory services; participation in internationalorganizations to increase drug control efforts in licit andillicit drug production countries; training programs for foreignpersonnel in illicit drug control functions to strengtheninterdiction and enforcement efforts; guidance, coordination andsupport of the work abroad of all U.S. government agenciesinvolved in drug control; and technical assistance forinternational demand reduction. BINM currently provides supportfor drug eradication efforts in 14 countries and is in large partresponsible for much of the world's crop control and eradicationefforts, described elsewhere in this report. Agency for International Development Section 126 of the Foreign Assistance Act instructs the Agencyfor International Development (AID) to "give priorityconsideration to programs which would help reduce illicitnarcotics cultivation by stimulating broader developmentopportunities." Given this mandate, AID issued PolicyDetermination No. 1 on drugs in 1982, encouraging the design ofprojects that provide economic alternatives to farmers in druggrowing areas. Overseas, AID coordinates with the StateDepartment's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters. AID drug control efforts include finding a suitable mix ofsubstitute crops, assuring free market incentives, andencouraging appropriate host country pricing and marketingpolicies. AID attempts to develop and implement developmentprojects that facilitate the host government's enforcement ofexisting bans on drug production. Department of Agriculture The United States Department of Agriculture through theAgricultural Research Service (ARS) assists in the control ofillicit drug plants by providing technical information pertainingto eradication and substitute crops. Scientists in the ARSconduct research on the use of herbicides and other techniquesfor eradication, as well as the use of substitute crops forfarmers presently producing drugs. ARS scientists also provideexpert advice to the State Department and cooperating foreigncountries regarding proposed eradication programs. Potentialadverse environmental impacts are assessed prior to therecommendation of control measures, whether it be chemical,mechanical, fire, biological, or through genetic manipulation ora combination of two or more of these techniques. Scientists fromARS have been involved in drug research since 1972 and haveassisted control authorities in several drug producing countriesin the Americas and the Near and Far East. Interdiction National Narcotics Border Interdiction System The National Narcotics Border Interdiction System (NNBIS)attempts to accomplish comprehensive planning in the limited areaof interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders. NNBIS was createdby the President on March 23, 1983, and is directed by the VicePresident. NNBIS' mission is to improve border interdiction byaccomplishing a threefold goal: to continue to improveinteragency coordination among law enforcement agencies; tomaximize the participation of the military services and Federalagencies involved in drug interdiction; and to increase andprovide interaction for intelligence community involvement ininterdiction efforts. Participating agencies include the U.S.Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Drug EnforcementAdministration (of particular importance is the contribution ofDEA's El Paso Intelligence Center - EPIC) the Border Patrol, theDepartment of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, theFederal Aviation Administration, the National oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, the Federal CommunicationsCommission, and the Department of State. NNBIS itself consists ofa headquarters staff in Washington, D.C. and six regionaloffices: Miami, New Orleans, El Paso, New York, Chicago and LongBeach, California. Actual interdiction at or approaching U.S. borders isaccomplished by individual agencies during single agency ormulti-agency special operations. The role of NNBIS is to providenecessary equipment, intelligence, detection and trend analysissupport. Specific NNBIS contributions to drug seizures consist ofdirect support, such as the passing of "real-time"information, general information, or regional analysis. NNBISstaffs, consisting of agency-contributed personnel in bothWashington and the regional centers, coordinate with contributingagency staffs to lay the groundwork for special initiatives,which then can proceed in a timely fashion to enhance drug lawenforcement efforts. Of critical importance in understandingNNBIS' role is the fact that the activity has no funding of itsown. It is entirely dependent upon agency contributions ofmanpower and intelligence and does not have a direct operationalauthority. It can only inform and advise its constituent agenciesconcerning opportunities for coordinated or expanded operations.Thus, criticisms of NNBIS, alleging that many seizures would haveoccurred anyway, even if NNBIS did not exist, miss the point.Individual agencies are intended, indeed mandated, to carry outtheir missions, including contraband seizures. NNBIS is intendedto supplement, not replace, those efforts. It has a steadilyimproving record of doing so, a fact recognized even by somecritics. Operation Hat Trick I In the fall of 1984 Hat Trick I, the first major coordinationeffort attempted under the NNBIS management mechanism, wasundertaken. Hat Trick I was designed to disrupt the transshipmentof the fall harvest of marijuana from Colombia, whilesimultaneously intercepting any cocaine shipped during theoperation. During the 60-day operation, an intercept line of Coast Guardand Navy ships was formed in the Caribbean to halt smugglingvessels. The Department of Defense supplemented the operationwith electronic equipment capable of detecting both aircraftwhich flew over the ships and vessels which slipped through thenet. Additionally, the Customs Service and Border Patrolincreased their efforts at and between the ports of entry to theUnited States, and the intelligence community added previouslyunprecedented support to the effort. This multi-agency approachemphasized the critical need for compatible communicationscapabilities. This lesson is being carried forward in currentoperational planning. The anticipated reaction to this operation was an attempt bythe smugglers in Colombia to stockpile shipments. To counterthis, multi-agency teams, headed by the Department of State,visited Colombia and neighboring countries to brief officialsthere about the operation and to elicit their support. TheColombian government, which had declared a "war withoutquarter" against drugs the previous year, seized theopportunity to step up efforts to destroy the marijuana in thatcountry. Colombian officials were also placed aboard U.S. CoastGuard cutters, operating off the Colombian coast to coordinatewith Colombian enforcement units. Operation Hat Trick I proceeded as expected, with massivemaritime seizures, and a significant reduction of maritime drugshipments. According to NNBIS, over 600,000 pounds of marijuanaand 6,000 pounds of cocaine were seized by U.S. agencies duringthe operation. Simultaneously, the Colombian government, througheradication and destruction of stockpiled contraband, removedover 50 percent of the fall marijuana crop from possible export. Operation Hat Trick II Operation Hat Trick I has come to be viewed as a prototypeeffort in it initiated improvements in planning, communicationssecurity, in-country efforts, air operations, intelligence andresource support. Hat Trick II, a much more ambitious operationbegun in November 1985 and still under way, is the logicalfollow-on, drawing carefully on lessons learned from Hat Trick I. Coordinated by NNBIS and consisting of the combined forces ofU.S. civilian drug enforcement agencies and all branches of themilitary, Hat Trick II involves increased land and air patrols todisrupt drug traffic into the United States. The long-term goalof the operation is to affect the worldwide availability of drugsby increasing international pressure on traffickingorganizations. It is a complex operation that tightenssurveillance along our border with Mexico and along the known airand ocean supply routes from South America and other Caribbeancountries. The United States Navy and the Coast Guard, working together,provide the primary maritime surveillance and interdiction forcesfor Hat Trick II, while the U.S. Customs Service works as thelead agency with the Navy, Air Force, Army and Marines indirecting air operations. The Customs Service and the Immigrationand Naturalization Service Border Patrol are conductingintensified operations all along U.S. land and sea borders.Through Department of State and DEA initiatives, the U.S. isworking to provide the maximum coordination of anti-drug effortsin foreign countries. Hat Trick II employs military surveillance aircraft toidentify and track smugglers and to exploit the known routestraffickers use from their source countries to their ultimatedestination. If the smugglers attempt to hide and wait in asource or transit country, the drug enforcement authorities inthose countries are prepared to seize drugs and make arrests. Animportant key to Hat Trick II lies in the ability of source andtransit countries to take advantage of the disruption the UnitedStates has caused in normal drug trafficking. Colombia, Panama,Venezuela, Jamaica and other countries throughout the region arecooperating in this international effort. Hat Trick II has contributed significantly to institutionalchange among involved agencies. For example, as a result ofplanning initiatives for Hat Trick II, the U.S. Navy has changedits policies, and Navy ships have served as platforms for asignificantly increased number of Coast Guard interdictions.Further, military radars have become a much more significantfactor in aircraft seizures. The diversions in smuggling routesand methods caused by the operation have made drug trafficking amore costly enterprise for smugglers, and secure communicationsenhancements have kept operational information away from them.Major cocaine seizures have resulted from U.S. Bahamiancooperation. The intelligence community has greatly increased itscollection and dissemination of tactical intelligence. Each lawenforcement agency has, in essence, developed specializedintra-agency operations in support of the overall Hat Trick IIeffort. Operation Blue Lightning To test the effectiveness of conducting an operation withFederal, State and local participation, as well as exercising thegrowing U.S.-Bahamian partnership against drug smuggling, a majorspecial operation, entitled "Blue Lightning," wasdevised and coordinated from the NNBIS Regional Center in Miami. Blue Lightning concentrated on two geographical areas, theBahamian Archipelago and the area West of the Bahamas up to andincluding the coast of Florida. In the Bahamas islands weretargeted as "stash sites," or drug holding areas, andunannounced sweep teams were flown in to search for contraband.The sweep teams were composed of Bahamian Police, transported byU.S. military helicopters. Efforts were coordinated by the DEAand U.S. Embassy in Nassau. The effort outside the Bahamasincluded coordinated, augmented air and sea detection capabilityup to the Florida coast. As a primary participant in the NNBIScoordinated operation, the U.S. Customs Service was requested toassume lead agency status for the portion of the operationoutside the Bahamas. Overall Blue Lightning participants included16 State, county and city law enforcement agencies, the CustomsService, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National ParkService in addition to the DEA and the Government of the Bahamas.Additionally, Bahamian personnel were assigned to South Floridafor the duration of the operation to fly law enforcement missionswith U.S. Customs. The raids by Bahamian authorities forced smugglers to movetheir drugs to the U.S. immediately, where law enforcement unitswere positioned to intercept them. Over 6,000 pounds of cocaine,33,000 pounds of marijuana, and over $1.5 million worth ofvessels, aircraft, trailers and cash were seized. Additionally,interdiction techniques were tested and refined, heightening theability to conduct coordinated international and interagencyoperations. U.S. Coast Guard Responsible in large part for U.S. drug interdiction efforts,the Coast Guard's strategy has been mainly directed towardintercepting motherships as they transit the major passes of theCaribbean. To effect this "choke point" strategy, theCoast Guard conducts both continuous surface patrols and frequentsurveillance flights over the waters of interest, and boards andinspects suspect vessels at sea. In the past major Coast Guardresources have been concentrated in the "choke points"traditionally transversed by traffickers. Cutters now morefrequently patrol the Bahamas, the eastern passes of theCaribbean, and the Gulf, Atlantic and Pacific coastal areas. During the past several years the Coast Guard has increasedthe number of cutter patrol days and aircraft operating hoursdevoted to drug interdiction, increasing their ability to respondquickly to sightings and other intelligence. In addition, theCoast Guard is deploying leased Sea Based Aerostats (SBAs), whichare small tethered balloons equipped with surface search radar,tethered offshore at sufficient altitude to greatly increase itsrange. As part of a coordinated operation, surface targetinformation is paused to a command and control cutter forevaluation and deployment of other assigned units, both surfaceand air. Better intelligence remains an important factor in increasingthe Coast Guard's overall interdiction effectiveness. The mostcritical need is timely and accurate information on the number,identity, location and destination of vessels and aircraftcarrying contraband which are bound for the United States. Duringthe past two years improvements have been made in the collection,evaluation, and dissemination of intelligence. A new intelligencecoordination center in Washington, D.C. maintains a 24-hourall-source watch to exploit all intelligence systems available tothe Coast Guard, and produces intelligence tailored to the needsof operational commanders. The Coast Guard is also continuingliaison with the law enforcement community's intelligencenetwork. U.S. Customs Service The U.S. Customs Service participates in several multiagencyinvestigative programs, including the Florida Joint Task Groupand the President's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.The efforts of these two programs alone resulted in 1,194 arrestsand drug seizures of 35,702 pounds of cocaine, 132 pounds ofheroin, and 3,848,293 pounds of marijuana from FY 1952 to FY1985. Prompted by the increasing sophistication of violators ofcritical technology and trade laws, including individuals indrug-related activities, the Customs Service established anOffice of Intelligence in 1981. Customs-acquired intelligence ofnational security interest is, for the first time, actively beingdisseminated to community agencies, and the intelligencecommunity is currently developing information useful for drugenforcement. The development of secure communications facilitieswithin the Customs Service, currently underway, will furtherenhance this capability. The Customs Aviation and Marine Programs are consistentlychanged and upgraded to reflect new technologies and equipmentand improved tactics and strategy. Drug smugglers have respondedto these programs by adjusting their routes to elude theincreased effectiveness of enforcement officials. The Customs Service has developed teams of inspectors andcanine enforcement officers to more thoroughly examine persons,conveyances, and cargo determined to be high risk. These mobileteams, which use highly trained dogs to detect drugs, allowCustoms to release cargo and passengers deemed to be low riskwithout examination, thus speeding the entry of most people andcargo. The teams comprise 12 percent of the inspectionalworkforce, but have accounted for the greater proportion of thedrug seizures. During the first 9 months of FY 1985, they havebeen responsible for 66 percent (10,269 pounds) of the hashish,87 percent (876 pounds) of the cocaine, and 40 percent (243pounds) of the heroin that has been seized by inspectors. During the past three years, the Customs Service has attemptedto convince the commercial air and sea carriers of theirresponsibilities in the effort to halt drug trafficking. As partof this initiative Customs contacted the major carriers andsigned cooperative agreements with a number of them. These setout specific measures designed to prevent and detect the use ofcommercial vessels and aircraft that smuggle drugs and othercontraband. Customs works closely with carriers, to apprise themof their vulnerabilities through regular meetings; to provide atraining program on cargo, aircraft, and facility security; toperform security surveys; and to compile threat assessments. Thiscooperation between Customs and commercial carriers has led tothe detection of drugs and the transmittal of valuableintelligence to local customs officials. Department of Defense In 1981 Congress passed legislation clarifying statutoryrestrictions on the use of Department of Defense (DOD) resourcesfor law enforcement purposes. As a result, the Department ofDefense now has greater freedom to support Federal lawenforcement agencies. DOD resources play an important role in theFederal drug interdiction program by providing surveillance andsupport services, such as using aircraft to search for smugglersand Navy ships to tow or escort vessels seized by the Coast Guardto the nearest U.S. port. As of the end of September 1985, theDOD has been involved in 38 vessel seizures, and their assistancehas been invaluable during NNBIS-directed joint operations. DOD's increased involvement in drug law enforcement as aresult of amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act, has provedpivotal in many instances. In fact, the Joint Chiefs of Staffrecommended unanimously in early 1985 that the U.S. military beengaged to an unprecedented extent in fighting drug traffickingand production. It called for the implementation of a massive newprogram in which military forces would expand their presentsupportive role by becoming involved in drug interdiction, intraining Central American nation's anti-drug forces, and inproviding needed weapons and equipment. Domestic Enforcement Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program(OCDETF), comprised of 13 Task Forces nationwide, brings allFederal agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities togetherinto a coordinated effort against the largest and most importantnational and international drug trafficking rings. JusticeDepartment agencies involved in the effort include the FBI, theDEA, and the Marshals Service; Treasury Department agenciesinclude the U.S. Customs Service, the Bureau of Tobacco, Alcohol,and Firearms, and the International Revenue Service. The CoastGuard has a major role in the program as well, and the Departmentof Defense offers intelligence and information on sightings ofsuspected drug traffickers heading for the U.S. by sea and air. In slightly more than two and one-half years, the Task Forcehas produced 1,721 indictments against 6,545 defendants. The TaskForce emphasis is on prosecuting and imprisoning drug kingpins,money launderers, and financiers. There is also strong focus onseizing cash and drug-related assets. In fact, the assets seizedmay soon exceed the cost of the Task Force program. The Task force Program relies largely on the ContinuingCriminal Enterprise Statutory provision and the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. Theconviction rate in cases reaching disposition is approximately 95percent. State and local officers participate in nearly one-halfof the Task Force investigations. New international law enforcement cooperation also has beenachieved, since nearly one-half of Task Force cases targetorganizations international in scope. These efforts have receivedsubstantial support from foreign law enforcement agencies, asindicated by the fact that five percent of Task Force cases nowinvolve direct participation by foreign police. This has createda new focal point for international drug investigations. Drug Enforcement Administration As the lead Federal drug agency the Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA) is charged with enforcing the controlledsubstance laws and regulations of the United States. DEA alsoparticipates in non-enforcement programs to reduce the demand fordrugs. Part of the Department of Justice, DEA comprises 2,400special agents in 121 domestic field offices and 61 offices inover 40 foreign countries. DEA's primary objectives are: - To bring to bear all the Federal resources on the arrest,prosecution, and immobilization of major drug traffickingorganizations via continued coordination with other Federalagencies and the use of financial and legal tools, emergingtechnology, and sophisticated investigative techniques. - To reduce the supply of illicit drugs from source countries,thereby reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the UnitedStates and abroad via source country initiatives, assistance toforeign government, training for foreign law enforcementauthorities, and public support for successful foreign governmentendeavors. - To significantly reduce the diversion of controlledsubstances from the legitimate channels in which they aremanufactured, distributed, and dispensed through a vigorousprogram of investigations and State, local, and internationalcooperation. - To enlist the active participation of State and localgovernments and law enforcement agencies in the national drugeradication program, clandestine laboratory task forces, Stateand local task forces, and other multi-state coordinativeefforts. - To participate actively and aggressively in the Federal,State, and local effort to mobilize public support for the drugenforcement and abuse prevention program by implementingstrategies and educational programs that stimulate cooperationamong State and local criminal justice agencies, school,businesses, civic, and parent groups. - To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of DEAoperations through the implementation of specific programsdesigned to enhance employee performance. Domestic Eradication Programs The DEA's Domestic Eradication/Suppression Program hasexpanded significantly since the Drug Enforcement Administrationfirst provided eradication assistance to Hawaii in 1979, andcurrently all 50 States participate in this venture. DEAencourages State and local eradication and provides training,equipment, funding and investigative and aircraft resources. In1984, with 48 States participating, approximately 3.8 millionmarijuana plants were eradicated. The Secretary of the Interiorhas also been authorized by a recent Executive Order to conductan extensive eradication program targeting marijuana plants onFederal lands. Spraying commenced on October 6, 1985. El Paso Intelligence Center The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) is the Drug EnforcementAdministration's national drug information center, withintelligence systems located at DEA headquarters, and in DEA'sforeign and domestic offices. EPIC's strategic intelligenceprogram furnishes geographic assessments, estimates, and warningsof drug availability, production, trafficking trends and routes.It distributes information to foreign, Federal, State and localagencies through numerous publications. Its operationalintelligence program directly supports investigations underwayagainst top-level traffickers and supplies information onspecific organizations and their financial assets to supportinvestigations worldwide. As appropriate, this intelligence isshared with other Federal, State and local agencies to ensure itsmaximum utilization against drug traffickers. EPIC serves as aclearinghouse for drug information collected 24 hours a day. WithDEA as its lead agency, EPIC is staffed by special agents andintelligence analysts working with personnel from the FBI,Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Federal AviationAdministration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, CustomsService, Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,the Departments of Defense and State, and members of the Federalintelligence community. Today all States participate in EPICthrough chartered arrangements made between DEA and theindividual States. Federal Bureau of Investigation Although DEA is nominally the lead Drug Enforcement Agency,its Director reports to the Director of the FBI. In granting theFBI concurrent jurisdiction with DEA, the Attorney General hasmandated that the FBI assume a significant drug enforcement role.He has also directed that FBI expertise in such areas asorganized crime financial investigations and white-collar crimeinvestigations be fully used in drug enforcement work. Both DEA and the FBI place strong emphasis on majordistributors and organizations involved in the manufacturing,importing, distributing and financing of illicit controlledsubstances. Conspiracy investigations (particularly theContinuing Criminal Enterprise and Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Statutes) are the focal point ofinvestigation efforts. Internal Revenue Service Within the Department of the Treasury, the Internal RevenueService (IRS) plays a critical role in U.S. drug control effortsby targeting drug traffickers' profits. IRS FinancialInvestigative Task Forces rely on the reports of financialtransactions, filed by banks and other institutions, to identifyfinanciers of criminal activities and money launderingspecialists. These reports include Currency Transaction Reportsand Foreign Bank Accounts Reports. Through these Task Forcestrace the transferrals of large sums of cash and identify theproceeds of drug trafficking. Data Gathering National Institute on Drug Abuse The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is the principalsource for current information about the effects of drug abuse.NIDA was established in 1972 as part of the Department of Health,Education and Welfare, and for its first nine years, operatedunder a broad mandate that included providing direct financialassistance for drug abuse education, training, treatment, andrehabilitation, as well as conducting research programs. With thepassage of The Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health ServicesBlock Grant in 1981, full responsibility for carrying outtreatment and prevention service functions was transferred fromNIDA to the States. Now a part of the Department of Health and Human Service,NIDA's current role in reducing demand, as set forth both in theNational Strategy and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments of1983, is to develop and disseminate new knowledge about drugabuse, its prevention and treatment, and to exercise nationalleadership in encouraging and assisting the private sector, theStates, and local governments to implement and support drug abuseprevention and treatment programs in their communities. The NIDA research program has several important components.Through its epidemiological research program NIDA assesses thenature and extent of the nation's drug abuse problem and itstrends. NIDA supports two ongoing epidemiological surveys, theNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High SchoolSenior Survey. NIDA's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) monitorsinformation on the health consequences of drug use throughemergency room visit statistics and through medical examinerreports. In addition to these major efforts, NIDA provides grantsfor a number of special epidemiological studies. National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee The 11-agency National Narcotics Intelligence ConsumersCommittee consists of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs Service,the Departments of Defense, State and Treasury, Drug EnforcementAdministration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse, White House Drug Abuse Policy Office,Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service.This Committee was created as the primary vehicle at the nationallevel for review and dissemination of strategic intelligence. Itpublishes an annual report, the "Narcotics IntelligenceEstimate," which details the supply of drugs to the U.S.illicit market from foreign and domestic sources, and theirpatterns and rates of use. Intelligence Central Intelligence Agency Since the signing of Executive Order 12333 in December 1981,the Central Intelligence Agency has provided assistance to druglaw enforcement efforts through the collection, analysis, anddissemination of information regarding foreign narcoticsproduction. The CIA plans to upgrade its capabilities to gatherand assess drug-related intelligence over the next five years,and is currently coordinating research to develop technologieswhich can be used to better detect drug trafficking. United Nations United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control As the drug control arm of the United Nations, the UnitedNations for Drug Abuse Control was established in 1979 to assistgovernments by helping finance projects aimed at reducing theillicit supply of and demand for drugs. Projects undertaken bythe United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control include replacingillicit opium cultivation, treating and rehabilitating drugaddicts, strengthening control measures, or organizinginformation and education programs. The Fund relies entirely onvoluntary contributions, mainly from governments but also fromprivate sources. The United States has long been the primarycontributor to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control. Inearly 1983, however, the Fund obtained a $40 million pledge,extending over a five year period, from the government of Italyfor coca control projects in South America. In early 1984 majordonors to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control agreedthat development assistance to narcotics growing regions shouldbe linked to government commitments to control illicit drugproduction.

These strategies, suchas source country eradication, interdiction, and domesticenforcement, are frequently attacked as expensive, too slow inproducing perceptible results, and frequently dangerous for thepublic officials charged with carrying them out. Far too oftensuch criticism seems to be the result of isolated examinationwithout regard to the programs' proper long-term goal orrelationship to strategic approaches to reduce demand. This report attempts to avoid such pitfalls, and in thischapter, examines and analyzes in its proper context, each of ourFederal efforts to reduce supply. It makes recommendations toencourage a coordinated, comprehensive effort at restricting theflow of drugs to the maximum extent possible, while complementarydemand reduction programs take hold. Legalization of Illicit Drugs The debate over strategies to reduce supply has produced awide range of proposals, including at one extreme the suggestionthat currently illicit drugs be legalized. Profits in the drugtrade are enormous, primarily because drugs are in high demandand because traffickers charge prices high enough to justify therisks involved. Proponents of legalization argue that because ofthe clear connection between illegal drug trafficking andorganized crime, making drugs legal would remove the enormousprofits in the illicit drug industry a priority. On the surface, this argument appears to have some merit.However, it omits any consideration of the health costs of drugabuse to the individual and to society, a dimension thisCommission views as fundamental. The drugs discussed in thisreport are inherently destructive to mind and body."Legalized" drugs would still alter behavior, impairproductivity and educational potential, damage vital organs, andkill. Moreover, legalization would almost certainly increasedemand, and therefore spread this destruction. Finally, thisCommission is not persuaded that legalization would result inorganized crime's abandonment of the drug business. While demandfor drugs in the United States represents a significant share ofglobal drug consumption, many other countries have a considerabledemand for drugs that would continue to be met by some or thesame organized crime groups now confronting this country. It is the position of this Commission that legalizingsubstances, which by their very nature destroy rather thanbenefit the individual and society, will not solve the problem ofdrug trafficking and is therefore not a viable option. ThisCommission is emphatic in its position that legalization of druguse is not a viable option. National Drug Enforcement Policy Board The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board ("theBoard"), presents a rare, possibly even unique, opportunityto bring focus and singularity of purpose to the Federalanti-drug effort. That fact is explicitly recognized in thelegislation creating the Board, wherein Congress acknowledgesthat for the first time, a single, competent, and responsiblehigh-level Board of the United States Government, chaired by theAttorney General, will be charged with this responsibility ofcoordinating United States policy with respect to national andinternational drug law enforcement. The sentiment is echoed by the Justice Department's ownhandbook discussing the National Narcotics Act of 1984, whichidentifies the Act as "a substantially revised version ofearlier 'Drug Czar' proposals." This Commission recognizes and has pointed out repeatedly inthis report that drug abuse, a term including all of the medical,social, and legal costs imposed on the American people by illegaldrugs, is a problem of proportions unmatched in any other area oflaw enforcement. A problem of such dimensions demands acoordinated response by the Federal government. The creation ofthe Board is a major step toward a truly unified, coordinatedenforcement effort. The performance of the Board to date has been somewhatambiguous. On the positive side, the Board has begun to meet, hasadopted an effective and comprehensive membership list for itsCoordinating Group, and has assembled a professional staff,composed of experienced and able agency representatives. It is troubling to note, however, that in light of theacknowledged urgency of the drug abuse situation, characterizedby Congress as an "epidemic," marked by"soaring" death rates and a "key to reducing thecrime epidemic confronting every region of the country," theBoard has yet to assert a clear leadership role. Instead, it hasadopted a more relaxed and collegial approach, waiting threemonths after the effective date of the Act to hold its firstmeeting. The Board began its work with a suggestion from theJustice Department that the Board's mandate is ". . . quitebroad and allows a range of possible roles - from an essentiallypassive research and analysis to active implementation of drugpolicies." This Commission notes with alarm that thiscontemplative expression does not even extend to policyformulation, which is the core of the Act's mandate. This concernis heightened by the Board's initial choice of agenda items:"designer drugs," drug seizure statistics, and drugmanagement. These topics are certainly important, but only one,seizure statistics, would have an impact on the formulation of acoordinated drug enforcement policy. Even that connection isremote. Uniform statistics are an important step towardcompilation of the reliable data base necessary to formulatepolicy and measure its effectiveness, but that is all they are.It is also troubling that the Board's first Interim Report toCongress consists almost entirely of a verbatim recitation ofportions of the 1984 National Strategy. An urgent but rational approach to the problem of drug abuseis needed. This must begin with the statement of a goal. What isthe ultimate objective of the policy Board and of our drugenforcement effort generally? This Commission is of the opinionthat the success of a national drug enforcement effort shouldultimately be measured in terms of reduced usage. The poisoningof minds and bodies is the evil we are combatting. All othertargets - manufacture or cultivation, processing, smuggling,distribution, and so on - would be of no consequence were it notfor the terrible destructive force of the use of illegal drugs.Eliminating drug use, then, must be the cornerstone of a nationalpolicy, and our national operational design - our strategy -should flow from it. It is at this fundamental level that theBoard's deliberations should begin, difficult as the dialogue maybe. A key to achieving the Board's essential singularity ofpurpose is the commitment of each Board member, on behalf of hisentire Department, to the goal of reducing drug consumption,accompanied by a resolve that no opportunity for action,particularly coordinated, multi-agency approaches, will beignored on the basis of parochial concerns. However, the use of acommittee in place of a single figure of authority runs theinherent risk of preserving interagency competition. It isencouraging to note that the Board has included as"potential items" for review total budgetary planningand administrative operations. This Commission submits thatvigorous review of the latter is urgently needed, with specialattention to what is not included in such memoranda and thereasons for such omissions. A combined and coordinated effort among the dozens of Federalagencies and offices, measured by a single standard of success,is certain to require program dislocations, reordering ofDepartmental priorities, and subordination of Departmental plansto Board direction. It will mean abandoning the "NotInvented Here" veto, which has far too often blockedinter-Departmental efforts. Cooperation is the heart of a trulycoordinated national attack on drug abuse. It will require notjust review, analysis and coordination, but initiative by theBoard to overcome unnecessary obstacles, outmoded concepts, andself-protective agency narrowness. Success will also depend uponcareful attention to long-term coordination between Federalagency operations and with State and local components, for ifexperience has shown anything in the effort against drugtrafficking, it is the resourcefulness and adaptability of thetraffickers. Successful interdiction or enforcement in one areais virtually certain to result in a relocation to a new area ofoperations. Long range planning is critical if our resources areto be used in a fashion which anticipates such movement, ratherthan reacts to it. It is neither possible nor desirable under our system of lawto invest a Board Chairman or any other "Czar" withdictatorial power to command other Cabinet members to conduct theaffairs of their respective Departments in a particular fashion.This fact is reflected in the tone of the Act, which empowers theChairman only to "advise, recommend, correlate andevaluate" and to direct action only with "theconcurrence of the head of the agency" involved. Such terms,intended to recognize the independence of the variousCabinet-level agencies, also spread among them a commonresponsibility for the success or failure of this vital task. Intelligence Accurate, timely, and complete intelligence is vital to theefficiency of United States anti-drug efforts. Strategies toreduce the supply of drugs, such as eradication, interdiction,investigations, and prosecutions are dependent on effectiveintelligence gathering. Less commonly acknowledged is thatstrategies to reduce demand are similarly dependent on suchintelligence. Adequate data is the foundation upon which focused,purposeful programs to reduce demand must be built. There issubstantial evidence to suggest that such a foundation is oftenlacking in our current approaches. Intelligence concerning both drug abuse and drug traffickingmust be shared between strategists who are working to reducesupply and demand. Evidence indicates that thorough strategicplanning, whether concerned with the reduction of demand or withattacks on supply, must carefully consider the available data onthe other side of the equation. For example, to achieve the mostcarefully reasoned deployment of resources, decisions concerningpriorities for disrupting the supply of a particular drug shouldconsider not only the geographical and political conditions insource and transit locations, but also carefully evaluate thegeographic and demographic data concerning drug consumption. Suchcoordination of data from both sides of the supply-demand dynamicis crucial to long-range planning. An awareness of traffickers'ultimate markets will facilitate anticipatory deployment ofresources. This unified theory of planning is the basis for the"all source" intelligence center discussed below. Domestic Data Collection One principal category of drug-related intelligence isconsumption and law enforcement data formally collected withinthe United States. Such data are essential to describe andmeasure the problems of drug abuse and trafficking. They are alsovital to our efforts to evaluate the effects of various effortsto reduce the supply of and demand for drugs. The reliability ofthese estimates is critical for both policy makers and drug lawenforcement officials. However, because drug trafficking and useare illicit activities, data concerning them are necessarilyestimates. Compounding this problem is the fragmentation of thecurrent system of drug data gathering. Much greater coordinationis imperative. Two primary ongoing studies are used to measure the number ofdrug users and frequency of drug abuse in the United States: thebi-annual Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the annual HighSchool Senior Survey, both sponsored by the National Institute onDrug Abuse (NIDA). The Household survey sample includes 5,000people 12 years of age or older, living in households across thecountry. The High School Senior survey questions approximately17,000 high school seniors. These surveys have been criticizedbecause they do not include information from those populationsthat are frequently involved with drugs, high school dropouts andpeople without residences. To compensate for this deficiency, ithas been proposed that these surveys oversample groups thought tobe heavy users of drugs. While these surveys provide estimates of the extent of drugabuse, they do not gather important data, such as the price andquantity of drugs purchased. Such information is crucial foreffective organized crime and drug enforcement policy planning,because it would provide information concerning the effects ofcertain enforcement actions on drug purchasing/using behavior.NIDA should amend these surveys to include questions about drugpurchases. To the extent possible, they should also be designedto determine the sources of the funds used to finance drugpurchases. Such data may be crucial to effective preventioneducation planning. NIDA provides two additional data bases of drug use in thisarea. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) collects dataconcerning drug-related emergency room visits and deaths. Thesestatistics are based on reports gathered by NIDA from one-sixthof the country's emergency rooms and two-thirds of the medicalexaminers' offices. NIDA collects information about drug users intreatment through the Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process(CODAP). Formerly, all States were required to provide such dataas a condition of Federal assistance. However, since theinstitution of block grants to partially fund State drug programsin 1982, the Federal government has not been able to compelparticipation in CODAP, and the number of participating Stateshas shrunk to approximately 15. Because of the importance of thistreatment data, the Federal government should again requireparticipation in CODAP. Much data concerning drug trafficking is gathered by the11-member National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee(NNICC) and reported annually in the Narcotics IntelligenceEstimates (NIE). This data includes estimates of the amount ofdrugs produced and entering the United States, traffickingpatterns, and prices and purity of drugs. Although the NIE claimsto be "the most comprehensive assessment prepared for theFederal Government on the worldwide illicit drug situation in1984," the report also states that, "[b]ecause of gapsin some of the data used to derive the estimates, there is a highdegree of uncertainty to the resulting estimates." In 1983 NNICC prepared a report analyzing the methodologiesused in preparing drug estimates. The report concluded that NNICCestimates are not timely, with estimates generally 18-30 monthsout of date; there is insufficient data concerning the price andpotency of drugs, in part because of inadequate input from Stateand local sources; and estimates of the total retail value ofdrugs is an imprecise measure, which should be replaced by abetter measurement of final drug sales. In addition, NNICC'smethodology has been criticized as "analysis bynegotiation," with final estimates resulting from abargaining process among the member agencies. Complaints aboutthe reliability of NIE data also result from the fact that NNICCdoes not publish the background data used to develop theestimates. Another important set of data in the drug field is theestimate of the results of drug law enforcement, including theamount of drugs and property seized, and the numbers of arrestsand convictions and sentences imposed on drug violators. Asignificant problem in generating reliable statistics in thisarea is the lack of a centralized system for collection. Becausemany agencies often are involved in the same case, the amount ofdrugs seized and other information may be reported by eachagency. According to the National Drug enforcement Policy Board, One of the principal problems encountered by the FederalGovernment in its efforts to gauge the effectiveness of itsoverall drug law enforcement program has been the lack ofcentralized statistical information on Federal drug seizures . .. Because of an undetermined amount of double and triplecounting, reliable statistics on total Federal drug seizures arenot available. In apparent response to this problem the 1984 NationalStrategy called on the Drug Enforcement Administration to developand maintain a centralized system for statistics concerningFederal drug seizures. As discussed throughout this report, asset forfeiture programsare an extremely promising source of funding for anti-drugefforts. Unfortunately, the availability and reliability ofinformation about non-drug assets seized by all levels ofgovernment is hampered by the same double counting,decentralization, and inconsistent data gathering methodologiesdescribed above. Although the Department of Justice AssetForfeiture Office was created to maintain centralized informationon forfeited assets, the office is still in the process ofdeveloping statistics for total Federal assets forfeited. A studyof State and local officials found that more than one-half ofthose surveyed could not estimate the value of property and cashobtained through forfeiture. State and local governments whichhave not already done so should establish asset managementsystems for the disposition of forfeited assets to provideaccurate estimates of their value. Drug Supply Intelligence With regard to intelligence concerning drug supplies, thisCommission is encouraged by what appears to be a growingcommitment to effective information-gathering. A number ofagencies have reported confidentially to this Commission thatboth their funding and priority determinations are giving greaterweight to effective intelligence programs. Intelligence efforts in this area take different forms,depending on the topic to which they are directed. All aresubject to the two classic categories of information gathering:human intelligence, referring to data gathered from humaninformants, and technical collection, gathered by such means assurveillance flights and satellites. In the area of croperadication, the lead agency is the State Department's Bureau ofInternational Narcotics Matters, supported by other members ofour country teams. Issues here include crop conditions, hostcountry political and military capabilities, and the role, ifany, of groups, including insurgents, opposing eradicationefforts. Interdiction efforts require tactical intelligence concerningspecific drug movements, such as the identities of thoseinvolved, shipment techniques, vessel and aircraftidentification, routes, and schedules. Also required is"strategic" information, such as shifts in processingand staging locations or in transshipment techniques. The currentexclusion of the Customs Service from foreign intelligencegathering, mandated by the 1973 reorganization plan, particularlyneeds to be re-examined. Strategic and tactical intelligence arecritical for border interdiction. Therefore the Commissionproposes that the Customs Service be integrated into the foreignintelligence process of the Drug Enforcement Administration, tothe maximum extent permitted by the Reorganization Plan currentlyin effect. Because international drug trafficking organizationsfrequently locate components of their operations within U.S.borders, domestic investigations and prosecutions are oftendependent upon effective international intelligence gathering tosupplement such domestic techniques as legal electronicsurveillance and development of informants. Effective international intelligence collection anddissemination is not necessarily a highly sophisticated process.On the contrary, it can consist of information as simple asproviding the names of suspected traffickers known to the DrugEnforcement Administration to the State Department to ensure thatconsular officers do not issue U.S. visas to such persons, orthat issuance be on a controlled basis to assist theinvestigative work of DEA. It is encouraging that the NationalDrug Enforcement Policy Board, pursuant to the Foreign RelationsAuthorization Act for 1986 and 1987, has been directed to compilea list of such traffickers and prepare guidelines forinter-agency sharing of that information. In the area of more sophisticated drug-related intelligencework DEA and the intelligence community are currently playingleading roles. The former has recently expanded its foreigndetail by ten percent, and additional expansion is prevented bylack of funding. This matter deserves careful consideration byboth Congress and the Executive Branch. In addition, thecapabilities of DEA agents presently stationed in foreignlocations are unduly and unnecessarily hampered by the"Mansfield Amendment" to the Foreign Assistance Act of1961, which restricts their activities to a secondary role. Aspart of a new expression of determination to combat internationaldrug trafficking, the amendment should be repealed. The intelligence community is not burdened by any suchill-conceived restriction. On the contrary, with regard tointernational narcotics trafficking, its mandate, found inExecutive Order 12333, is clear, direct, and sweeping: 1.4 The Intelligence Community. The agencies within theIntelligence Community shall, in accordance with applicableUnited States law and with the other provisions of this Order,conduct intelligence activities necessary for the conduct offoreign relations and the protection of the national security ofthe United States, including: (c) Collection of information concerning, and the conduct ofactivities to protect against, intelligence activities directedagainst the United States, international terrorist andinternational narcotics activities, and other hostile activitiesdirected against the United States by foreign powers,organizations, persons, and their agents. Although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has in the pastbeen criticized for failing to give sufficient priority to drugtrafficking, the Commission is satisfied that the agency iscurrently placing suitable emphasis on the issue. This is due, inpart, to the necessary Executive direction now being given to theintelligence community, and in part to the growing recognitionthroughout the government that drug trafficking in many forms andin many locations has grown to become a national securityconcern, transcending the traditional drug-related health and lawenforcement concerns, as discussed in this report. To complementthis effort, additional options are available and should bepursued. First, consistent with the direction now being provided to theintelligence community, the Department of State should vigorouslypursue a program of educating its own foreign-based personnel tothe importance being given to drug-related intelligence and tothe critical need for State Department support for such efforts.This appears to have been less than entirely adequate in allinstances. Second, the CIA's operational capabilities should befully explored to determine how the infrastructure of drugtrafficking organizations can be disrupted, consistent with theconcerns expressed in Executive Order 12333 and elsewhere.Finally, the CIA's considerable research and developmentcapabilities should be used to develop additional means forfurthering efforts directed at international drug traffickers. In connection with these contributions by the intelligencecommunity, it is encouraging to note the rapid evolution of acooperative relationship between the intelligence and lawenforcement communities. This is evidenced by the pertinentlanguage of Executive Order 12333, which provides that: 1.7 Senior Officials of the Intelligence Community. The headsof departments and agencies with organizations in theIntelligence Community or the heads of such organizations, asappropriate, shall: (g) Participate in the development of procedures approved bythe Attorney General governing production and dissemination ofintelligence resulting from criminal narcotics intelligenceactivities abroad, if their departments, agencies, ororganizations have intelligence responsibilities for foreign ordomestic narcotics production and trafficking. This direction is complemented by the inclusion of arepresentative of the CIA on the Coordinating Group of theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board. Defense Capabilities The intelligence community is not the only available source ofdrug-related intelligence. The Department of Defense has a widerange of facilities, equipment, and operations, which lendthemselves to effective participation. Although such a role ismost frequently discussed in connection with interdictionoperations near the U.S. border, intelligence-gatheringopportunities for Defense Department components exist muchfarther afield. Like their counterparts in the interdiction area,such efforts may be subject to Defense Department directives andpriorities, which in turn rely on a changeable definition of"national security." Nevertheless, if as a matter ofnational policy, the military view of national security drawscloser to that of the intelligence community, as expressed inExecutive Order 12333, the potential for military drug-relatedintelligence-gathering is profound. Because of the connectionbetween some drug trafficking organizations and terrorist orinsurgent groups, whatever assets are currently in place or inplanning for intelligence-gathering regarding terrorism orinsurgency could just as well function in connection with drugtraffickers. Intelligence-gathering in source and transshipment countrieswould be particularly effective in the interdiction effort, inthe opinion of former SOUTHCOM Commanding General Paul F. Gorman: I can't stress enough that it seems to me that the easy way tooperate on the [drug smuggling] pilots is down at the other end.He is at the other end of his communications tether where theairfields are much more primitive, where he is dependent on thesecartels and it's easier to penetrate. Because they occur outside of U.S. territory, such operationswould not violate the Posse Comitatus Act. In addition, with anexpanded definition of national security, such as that manifestin Executive Order 12333, the Economy Act would not be anobstacle. Such an expanded intelligence-gathering role is adesirable course of action for the Department of Defense. TheCommanding Officers of Unified Commands should be given maximumflexibility in deploying their forces. Another change in our application of military assets todrug-related intelligence is much less sweeping in concept, butnevertheless appears very useful. That is the inclusion of CoastGuard officers in our Defense Attache programs in drug source andtransit countries. This Commission has been advised that such aprogram is in process and encourages the agencies involved topursue this program with all due speed. Allied governments in affected areas could significantlyenhance the intelligence operations of our own military units.Such activities already under way and worthy of note include aregional radio communications network being set up among the drugenforcement authorities of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, andVenezuela. This network is designed to give these countries theopportunity to coordinate drug enforcement strategies and workclosely together in confronting the drug trafficking threatcommon to all. Agreements signed very recently by Brazil,Venezuela, and Colombia allow these countries to initiate jointinvestigations on their common borders, call for periodicmeetings between drug enforcement police, exchange intelligence,and solve common problems. Although such efforts must contendwith the endemic problems of corruption and organizational andnational rivalries, they are a step in the right direction. Tothe extent that United States assistance can contribute to theelimination of corruption and other systemic problems, suchassistance should be provided to promote these programs. All Source Intelligence and Operations Center Data collection is but one phase of a complete intelligenceoperation. To be effective collection should be followed bythorough and timely analysis and dissemination. This Commissiontherefore concludes that this Nation's anti-drug intelligenceefforts should be built upon an all-source intelligence andoperations center. Such a concept is described briefly above inconnection with interdiction efforts. EPIC and NNBIS togetherprovide an existing core upon which such a center could be built.EPIC has demonstrated the feasibility of joint agency operations,and NNBIS has shown that interagency operational coordination,particularly involving military components, is well withincapabilities. As a component of a comprehensive intelligence program, such acenter should be designed to collect drug-related intelligencefrom the broadest base possible, including those sovereignnations that will provide consistent, timely data on acooperative basis. In this regard, it is encouraging to note thatLatin American drug enforcement agencies are reported to beplanning to establish a regional intelligence center in astrategic location, such as Panama, in the near future. Becauseanalysis should be as complete as possible, such a center shouldinclude not only supply and transit-related intelligence, butalso counterpart demand data, including information on suchtopics as drug-related deaths and emergency room admissions. Thiswill allow a complete picture of drug distribution from one endof the chain to the other. This center would assume thefunctions, including issuing annual reports, currently undertakenby the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee(NNICC). In addition, it should integrate all financial datacurrently available to agencies of the Federal government, toenable analysts to complete their knowledge about the drug-moneycycle whenever possible. To be consistent with the rest of our national effort, such acenter should be under the general direction of the Policy Boardor its delegate, with the Vice President retaining primaryresponsibility for management and coordination of the informationrelated specifically to interdiction. Such a facility would thuscoordinate the collection, analysis, and dissemination ofintelligence, covering every topic from production andcultivation (including related political issues) to domesticenforcement and detailed patterns of domestic consumption. Itwould also provide the necessary centralized data base forthorough inter-agency coordination of operations. Given thesensitivity of many of its sources and the data receivedtherefrom, the functions and output of such a center would, ofcourse, require physical and communications security. Theresources and expertise of the National Security Agency withregard to operational and communications security is an extremelyvaluable national asset, which should be exploited to the fullestextent possible in this connection. As this Commission has soughtto demonstrate repeatedly, drug traffickers have regularly andsuccessfully sought to penetrate law enforcement communications.The equipment available for such purposes is readily available.Communications security thus requires very careful attention inthe planning and design of all anti-drug operations andfacilities.

Interdiction, just one of thesesub-components, presently consumes one-third of the entireFederal drug abuse outlay for the fiscal year. Measured just interms of outlays designated for law enforcement activities,interdiction's portion swells to almost one-half of the Federalfunds being spent to combat drug abuse. By Commissioncalculation, Federal funds devoted to interdiction have increased100 percent over the last five years. Despite this massive dedication of funds, drugs of primarilyforeign origin - cocaine, heroin, and marijuana - continue to bewidely available in this country. Many observers, including someleading drug enforcement officials, readily acknowledge thatinterdiction can only serve a limited role in increasing risks tosmugglers while this government pursues other programs. FrankMonastero, former Assistant Administrator for Operations of theDrug Enforcement Administration, summed up this view in a recentinterview: [Interdiction] is important, but it is the least effectivething you can do . . . it's like the patrolman on the beat . . .It is preventing [some drugs] from getting into the trafficking,and that's something. But we can continue that ad infinitum. Ifwe don't do something at the source or don't do something beforethat or don't do something at the end of the trail in theprevention area, we will never change the situation. It is the view of this Commission that interdiction is notgoing to end drug use or availability in this country. It will,however, continue to discourage some potential smugglers. Thisdeterrent effect is often overlooked or denied by many critics,but not by smugglers themselves. According to Adler B. Seal, anexperienced drug smuggling pilot, in response to a questionconcerning the difficulty of recruiting smuggling pilots: Well, it used to be easy. However, now it has become a littleless attractive for some of the younger pilots. Some of the olderpilots, as myself, have been indicted. We've been cognizant of law enforcement techniques and theimprovements in it; and the younger pilots are seeing thenewspaper reports of the older pilots and the amount of time thatthey are being convicted on and serving, and it's not asattractive a proposition as it used to be. Successful interdiction not only discourages some new membersfrom joining smuggling enterprises, but also encourages somealready in the field to get out of it. This was confirmed by thefirsthand experience of smuggler Seal: I think that the more flights that are interdicted, the wordgets around. For instance, I have absolutely - or had in my capacity - nodesire whatsoever to go into and would do anything to stay out ofthe south Florida area simply due to the fact that that is wherethe concentrated interdiction efforts are being made due to theVice Presidential Task Force, which has been highly publicizedand which has taken its toll on the paranoia of the drugsmuggler. It also appears to this Commission to be consistent with theview of the Commissioner of Customs, William von Raab: We are always asked what is a good measure of success againstsmuggling. It is always quoted in terms of how much we seize. I have always maintained that a good measure of success is toreach a point at which a pilot doesn't want to fly into theUnited States anymore; and I have always suggested that there maybe a percentage. For example, if he has a one-out-of-ten chance of gettingcaught, he might run in; but certainly if he had anine-out-of-ten chance of being caught, he's not going to do it. In summary, this Commission recognizes that interdiction isand should continue to be a vital component of our Nationalstrategy, as a complement to other approaches to reduce drugsupply. Any analysis that defines success in the area ofinterdiction as apprehending all, or nearly all, smuggled drugsis unrealistic and counter-productive. To the extent that is avery costly approach, additional expenditures must be weighedvery carefully, particularly if they have the effect of reducingfunds available for other efforts to reduce supply and demand.There are, however, improvements to our interdiction effortswhich can be made without any significant increase in funding.These steps, which generally involve reordering of priorities orredefinition of interagency responsibilities, are discussedbelow. It is crucial to note that the single most important need inthe interdiction field is leadership. If innovation and increasedcommitment are to be pursued successfully and expeditiously, bothby foreign governments and agencies of our own, a strong leaderorchestrating a single comprehensive plan is the key. That roleto date has been played by the Vice President, and it is one inwhich he should continue. The weight of his office has producedresults when other officials might have been ignored. While theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board necessarily includesseveral Cabinet-level officers, they serve as peers. Only theVice President brings to the interdiction effort sufficient rankto lead them. His central role should be preserved and promotedwithin the context of the National Drug Enforcement PolicyBoard's leadership in drug enforcement. Recognition by the Boardof the Vice President's leadership in interdiction activitiesholds the promise of singularly promoting success in that keyarea, preserving the momentum and continuity of existinginteragency interdiction efforts, and putting to rest theconfusion that has already begun to surface concerning the VicePresident's relationship to the Board. Air Interdiction The United States Customs Service has the lead responsibilityfor air interdiction. To combat drug smugglers, some of whom havethe most sophisticated and expensive communications andnavigational equipment available today, Customs has increased itsairborne capabilities significantly in the recent past. At thetime of this report, the Service had just received $11 million ina supplemental fiscal year 1985 appropriation for its airoperations, bringing the agency's total fiscal year budget forair operations to $55.4 million. Customs' most significant need,apart from more aircraft and more sophisticated electronics, isthe support of other Federal agencies with related jurisdictions. One example of the need for support is on the diplomaticfront. Customs has for some time found itself frustrated by itsinability to pursue suspected smuggler aircraft into Mexicanairspace after detection on the American side of the border.Although this has been the subject of numerous diplomaticdiscussions, there has been little progress to date. Giving thismatter an extremely high priority in our bilateral negotiationswith Mexico is the type of assistance another agency, in thiscase the state Department, can and should provide to Customs inrecognition of the critical importance of the fight against drugsmuggling. Another Customs' Services critical need is intelligence, bothtactical and strategic. While "cold hits" -apprehension of smugglers in a random, uninformed basis - have animportant role to play in deterring smugglers by their veryrandomness, intelligence is the key to effective interdiction.According to former Drug Enforcement Administrator FrancisMullen, every major seizure of drugs from South America made byhis agency has been made on the basis of prior intelligence, andit is no less critical to the Customs Service. While the topic ofintelligence-gathering is the subject of a separate analysis inthis report, it is important to note in connection with thisdiscussion on inter-agency support that Customs and the DrugEnforcement Administration have made considerable progress in thearea of information sharing. Customs has for some time had ananalyst stationed in DEA's Office of Intelligence, and a programis currently underway to place Customs intelligence analysts incountry teams abroad to analyze data gathered by DEA. Thisprogram should be pursued aggressively. Simultaneously, theCustoms Service should scrutinize its Customs Attache program todetermine to what extent it can play a larger role inintelligence-gathering concerning smugglers. With its closeliaison with host government customs officials, this program maybe of particular significance with regard to smuggling involvingcontainerized and other commercial cargo. As interdictioncapabilities improve in the areas of pleasure craft and generalaviation, it is almost certain that commercial cargo will be usedincreasingly for concealing illicit drug shipments. This hasalready been observed in some cases. Such a Customs effort wouldbe complemented by the private sector initiatives Customs hasbeen able to bring about, such as the agreements now in effectwith the Airline Transport and International Airline TransportAssociations. An active intelligence gathering role for Customs is nowblocked by the 1973 Reorganization Plan. The current recognitionby Customs and DEA of the former's need for time-sensitiveintelligence is of vital importance however, and should beactively cultivated by the two agencies and the Policy Board.That this would require modification or elimination of certainprovisions of the 1973 Reorganization Plan should not be anobstacle. The area of inter-agency support currently in need of the mostattention is the relationship between the Customs Service and theFederal Aviation Administration (FAA). The latter, which hasprimary jurisdiction over entry into United States air space,maintains a number of programs, which lend themselves to supportof Customs operations. While the FAA has to date givensignificant support to Customs in a number of instances, more isneeded. To this end, the Customs Service has recently proposedomnibus legislation, currently entitled the Customs EnforcementAct of 1985, which contains provisions that address suchsensitive topics as restricted entry points and minimum altitudesfor air entry. Among other things, this Act would require allvessels and aircraft entering the United States to reportimmediately for Customs inspection, and would increase the finesfor failure to report entry. Fines would also be substantiallyincreased for smuggling controlled substances, and suchviolations would be punishable by imprisonment. All assets seizedby Customs, including planes, vessels, and cash, would be subjectto forfeiture. The Act would prohibit airdrops to vessels, makeit unlawful to operate an aircraft without lights, and prohibitthe installation of all illegal fuel tanks in planes. Inaddition, commercial carriers would be subject to more stringentregulations under the Act. While this legislation may beunpopular with private aviation, it is a collection of importantanti-smuggling measures which go directly to some of the mostfrequently encountered drug smuggling techniques. It is worthy ofsupport. Similarly, proposals advanced by both Customs and DEA thataircraft identification numbers, now required to be twelve incheshigh and displayed on the fuselage or tail, be displayed on anupper and a lower wing surface as well are entirely consistentwith anti-smuggling requirements. DEA pilots have been fired uponfrom the ground as they tried to fly low enough to read tailnumbers. Although the FAA has stated that an increase in requirednumber size has no "aviation safety basis," it is thisCommission's position that needless exposure of Federal agents tohostile fire should be considered an "aviation safety"concern sufficient to justify remedial action. Again, reportsthat a change in required number size or location would be veryunpopular with the general aviation community seem frivolous inthe context of issues as grave as those under discussion here.There are a number of additional aviation-related proposals beingadvanced by Customs today, concerning such matters as pre-filingof "border flight plans," advanced notice of entry intoU.S. air space, and improvements in pilot identificationcertificates, which appear to this Commission to be worthy ofadoption, absent some compelling opposition. There are other promising areas for Customs/FAA cooperation.Customs reports, for example, that the FAA, in undertaking itslong-term buildup of the approach radar system, is workingclosely with Customs to accommodate the latter's needs. This isto be encouraged, particularly by the Policy Board, which hasboth Customs and the FAA on its Coordinating Group. One legal issue which would benefit from careful analysis bythe Board is the extent to which current asset forfeitureprovisions need revision to enable seizure of aircraft and otherequipment which is rented or leased by traffickers for thepurpose of avoiding forfeiture. Another area worthy of study is the extent to which Customs'air interdiction capabilities could be enhanced by Coast Guardaviation components. Although such a concept might be contrary toexisting understandings, it would be a grave omission ifsubstantial Coast Guard aviation assets were overlooked,particularly at a time when fiscal considerations threaten theCustoms air operations budget. Maritime Operations In the area of maritime interdiction, the Coast Guard servesas lead agency. Its success has been remarkable and is limitedonly by shortages in resources. New tactics and innovative formsof assistance by the Navy have significantly improved the CoastGuard's capabilities. There is no question that not only maritimetraffickers but air smugglers as well are intimidated by theseaborne detection capabilities of Coast Guard vessels. Inasmuchas the most critical limitation on Coast Guard capabilities isthe lack of budgeted resources, the single most pressing concernis the augmentation of the Coast Guard budget to permit moreextensive participation in interdiction operations. A proposal,which has surfaced annually but to no avail as yet, is theimposition of user fees for various Coast Guard services nowprovided to the boating community gratis. As with the aviationcommunity in connection with the FAA discussed above, there isconsiderable opposition to maritime measures that wouldinconvenience the user community or cost it money. However, giventhe inescapable facts of the drug invasion this country isexperiencing, the nominal costs of various user fees would seemto be a small price for boaters to pay as their contribution towhat must be seen as a national effort to defeat a deadly enemy. In-shore operations of the Customs Service bolster Coast Guardmaritime interdiction operations. Having received over $12million for maritime operations in its fiscal year 1985supplemental appropriation, Customs has begun to get fast, stateof the art pursuit boats in the water off the coast of Florida.These have been used to great effect, and more such craft shouldbe deployed. One innovation for which the Customs Service and theleadership of the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System(NNBIS) are to be commended is the highly effective integrationof State and local authorities in the recent operation "BlueLightning." It is clear and has been stressed throughoutthis report that comprehensive, coordinated multi-agencyoperations are absolutely essential to effective anti-drugprograms. On the Federal level, this typically means"horizontal integration," i.e., the careful combinationof equal Federal agencies. Blue Lightning is a fine example ofthe equally important concept of "verticalintegration," the well-planned and complementary cooperationof Federal, State, and local resources aimed at a specifictrafficking activity. The Customs Service and NNBIS arerightfully proud of this accomplishment and are encouraged topursue similar successes in operations to come. Consolidated Efforts The evolution of interdiction in recent years has been in thedirection of consolidation of intelligence and operations. Thisis a trend characteristic of anti-drug efforts generally, and itis a proper response to the breadth of the drug smugglingsituation. In the area of interdiction, the most prominent jointefforts in addition to NNBIS are the National Drug EnforcementPolicy Board (the Board) and the El Paso Intelligence Center(EPIC). All are described in detail elsewhere in this report. The following is a proposed realignment of theseorganizations, based on this Commission's review. First, our proposal recognizes the leadership role of theBoard. That important topic is the subject of a separate analysisin this report. Within the Board and as a part of its coordinatedprogram, we propose the combination of the functions of EPIC andNNBIS into a single, all-source intelligence facility. In thecritical early stages of designing and implementing such anoperation, the Vice President's leadership will be invaluable.The combined intelligence center will incorporate the input ofall intelligence-gathering components at the Federal level,including those sources already feeding into EPIC and NNBIS, aswell as new sources still to be developed, as outlined below. The present duplication between the various functionsperformed by EPIC and NNBIS has been acknowledged by suchauthorities as David Westrate, Assistant Administrator forOperations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the parentagency of EPIC. Although it is true there are certain functionsbeing performed by each of the two activities, which are notduplicated by the other, this should not prevent effectiveintegration of their functions. Everywhere in the current Federalresponse, we find a movement toward consolidation andcoordination. Intelligence and planning should not be exceptions. A combined all-source intelligence center would require atleast two features not found in either NNBIS or EPIC. One is aphysically secure headquarters facility. EPIC is presentlylocated in a private office building in El Paso. It has neitherthe space nor the necessary physical security to accommodate thecomprehensive input advocated here. NNBIS headquarters is in theOld Executive Office Building in downtown Washington, and itsregional facilities are located in various Federal buildingsaround the country. While such quarters might provide adequatephysical security, they are not equipped to provide for the scopeof the proposed undertaking. A secure facility with sufficientphysical dimensions is crucial, as are secure communications withparticipating agency and military headquarters. Ft. Bliss, Texas,is a potential site, as it provides the necessary physicalsecurity and is located near the present EPIC facility. This andsimilar locations should be considered. The second requirement of the facility proposed here isenhanced intelligence input. Thorough, "real-time"intelligence is absolutely vital to effective interdiction, andit is almost as critically important to other areas ofenforcement operations as well. The importance of intelligence issuch that it is treated as a separate topic below. At this point,it is sufficient to note that the design of a new center mustfrom the very outset include the most thorough provisions for themaximum intelligence contribution permitted by law and physicaland technological capabilities. Military Support for Interdiction Perhaps the single most valuable development in the area ofinterdiction in recent years has been the assistance rendered bycomponents of the Department of Defense. Such activities wereconstrained somewhat by the Posse Comitatus Act until certainexemptions to the Act were passed in December 1981. Since thattime the assistance rendered by the military has growndramatically. In calendar year 1984 the military providedassistance to interdiction efforts worth $100 million by Pentagoncalculations. Such assistance is typically in the form of aerialsurveillance, transport of enforcement personnel, and loans ofequipment and personnel as permitted by law. The role of the Defense Department has become steadily moreactive, more innovative, and more flexible. The quality andquantity of such assistance, however, continue to be limited bythe constraints found in the Posse Comitatus exemptions: militaryassistance to law enforcement cannot include direct participationby military personnel in arrest or seizure activities, and it canbe provided only if it does not affect military preparedness.Furthermore, law enforcement authorities will be required by theEconomy Act to reimburse the Department of Defense for assistanceprovided, unless such assistance is incidental to existingmilitary operations or provides "equivalent training."Reimbursement may also be waived, if such waiver does notadversely impact military preparedness. In this regard, as inother, the Department of Defense has been increasingly flexible.One example of this is the expanded delegation of authority towaive reimbursement, as found in the January 2, 1985,modifications to the applicable Departmental directive. Anotheris the increasingly positive liaison role being played by theDepartment of Defense Task Force on Drug Enforcement. There are grounds for concern that the military's rolecontinues to be too narrowly defined. There appears to be afundamental misconception at the very top of the Departmentconcerning the permissible scope of the military's role. Writingto the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in June1985, Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger stated that directmilitary participation in drug seizures outside United Statesterritory would do violence to "the historic separationbetween military and civilian spheres of activity . . . one ofthe most fundamental principles of American democracy. ThisCommission has been unable to find the basis for such a"fundamental principle" of co-equal "spheres ofactivity." The fact is that the military, rather than beinga parallel entity, has traditionally been subject to thedirection of the civilian "sphere." Indeed, themilitary's Commander-in-Chief is a civilian. The Posse ComitatusAct does no more than prohibit use of military forces to enforcecivilian laws on the territory of the United States. TheConstitution was in existence for approximately a century beforesuch a law was passed by Congress. The Act has been amended oncesince then, and it can be amended again if appropriate.Furthermore, there is nothing in the laws of the United Statesforbidding an active enforcement role by the military outsideUnited States territory, except the requirement of reimbursement.This in turn hinges upon the definition of "militarypreparedness." However, nowhere in the debate over themilitary's role in this area has this Commission found adiscussion of this term. The definition of the military's rolehas been left to the military itself, which, through the JointChiefs of Staff, has declared that the military shall be preparedto serve national security by providing: a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile ordestructive action from within or without, overt or covert. As described in Chapter 3 of this report, international drugtraffickers have regularly formed alliances with insurgent andterrorist forces in certain countries. In a few instances thesealliances may actually threaten friendly governments. In manymore countries such a combination at least drains resources fromconstructive goals and inhibits efforts to build or maintain astable democracy. Even where the threat is more remote, it isclear that the smuggling techniques in use are the very same onesthat are or could be used to move personnel, weapons, and othersupplies for insurgent groups. For these reasons alone, theactivities of traffickers should bring them squarely within thenational security concerns of the Department of Defense. Thisfact has already been recognized by the Vice President, who hasstated clearly that "success against drug smuggling isintimately tied to the continuation of freedom and democracy inthe hemisphere." Recognition of this fact would permit theDefense Department much greater latitude in conducting militaryoperations aimed at disrupting trafficking organizations.Examples of such programs include a wide range of activities,such as expanded and focused intelligence gathering, securityassistance to receptive host governments, expanded deployment oftethered aerostat radar sites, and joint research and developmentbetween military and law enforcement agencies to provide greateroperation compatibility. Beyond threats to friendly democracies, international drugtraffickers should be considered a threat to our nationalsecurity because they comprise a direct attack on the physicaland social well-being of our country. The costs of this invasion,which comes by air, sea, and land, is thoroughly documented inthis report. Recognition of this attack as a ". . .destructive action from without . . ." which is within themeaning of the Joint Chiefs' definition, would bring theDepartment of Defense squarely into the war in which we presentlyfind ourselves. This may be further than present policy makersare prepared to go, but it is surely time to bring the issue intothe debate so that it can be decided on the basis of what isactually permitted or proscribed by the laws and Constitution ofthe United States. Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions Domestic investigative and prosecutive activity is only onefacet of drug law enforcement. As with all other approachesdesigned to reduce the supply of drugs, proper assessment oftheir effectiveness requires that realistic goals be established.As this report has demonstrated, it is unrealistic to expect thatdomestic law enforcement alone will solve, or even substantiallyreduce, the Nation's drug abuse problem. Rather, its goal must bea more limited one: to increase the arrests and successfulprosecutions of drug traffickers, whether they be importers,wholesalers, or retailers, and those who assist them, includingpilots, bankers, and attorneys, and the forfeiture of theirproperties accumulated from criminal activity. The attainment of this objective would contribute to theultimate national policy goal of eliminating drug use in severalways. First, it would directly reduce the supply of drugs byremoving from the illicit drug market those drugs that are seizedalong with the arrested traffickers. Second, it would reduce thesupply of drugs indirectly by disrupting the networks that makeit possible to distribute drugs efficiently. Finally, thetraffickers would likely raise the price of their product toreflect the increased risks, which theoretically should cause areduction in the overall consumption of drugs. In a recent study prepared by the Rand Corporation the authorsconcluded that prevention programs, not intensified domestic lawenforcement, were the best approach to control adolescent druguse. The Commission agrees with the Rand Corporation'sconclusions concerning adolescent drug use and believes that theyare equally valid with respect to adult drug use. However, suchconclusions should not be interpreted as a call for a reductionin domestic law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking.Without effective domestic law enforcement, the drug abuseproblem, and its concomitant organized crime effects, would beimmeasurably worse. Although domestic law enforcement has a limited, albeitessential, role to play in the national effort against drugabuse, the Commission has concluded, on the basis of itsinvestigations, hearings, and study, that changes in focus andattitudes and a rearrangement of priorities must be undertaken toachieve the maximum effect of domestic law enforcement. Beforediscussing these matters, it is necessary first to address twofundamental issues: (1) Do organized crime policy and drug abusepolicy conflict? and (2) What, if any, should be the level ofinteraction and cooperation between Federal law enforcementagencies on the one hand and State and local agencies on theother? Professor Mark H. Moore, a former Special Assistant to theAdministrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, hasdescribed the objectives of U.S. organized crime policy asfollows: [T]o suppress the provision of illegal goods and services thatconstitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violenceand corruption that is more characteristic of organized crimegroups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent theemergence of very large, durable organizations with welldeveloped capacities for violence and corruption. This Commission believes that the Nation's drug policy musthave as its goal the elimination of illegal drug use. Domesticlaw enforcement contributes to this goal by reducing the supplyof drug in the illegal market and by increasing the prices ofdrugs that remain available for purchase. It has been suggestedthat the pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, without regard forits impact on organized crime, may exacerbate the country'sorganized crime problem by enriching organized crime groups,eliminating their competitors, and encouraging traffickingorganizations to become organized crime groups if they are notalready. Although agreeing that such a concern is legitimate,this Commission has concluded that drug and organized crimepolicies do not inherently conflict. Indeed, there issubstantial, if not complete, overlap in the goals of the twopolicies because, as the Commission has found, drug traffickingis a principal activity of organized crime groups. In light ofthis, the Commission recommends that targeting high-levelorganized-crime trafficking groups, whether they be foreign,multinational or domestic, should be the top priority of Federaldomestic law enforcement. As Professor Moore has stated: What is not in conflict, however, is the need of both drugabuse policy and organized crime policy to develop and usetactics that are successful in attacking large, entrenchedcriminal organizations. This is useful to drug policy, andessential to organized crime policy. The Commission is aware that some commentators have criticizedthe Federal Government's bias in favor of enforcement againsthigh-level dealers to the virtual exclusion of lower- orstreet-level enforcement. However, the Commission'srecommendation that targeting organized crime trafficking groupsshould be the top priority of Federal domestic law enforcementshould not be construed to mean that lower-level enforcement isnot useful and therefore has no place in the Nation's drugpolicy. On the contrary, such lower-level enforcement isessential to achieve the goal of eliminating drug use for severalreasons. As discussed earlier, the arrest of the customers ofdrug retailers may result in a direct and immediate reduction inthe demand for drugs. In addition, successful enforcement effortsdirected at lower-level dealers will reduce the supply of illegaldrugs and raise the price of drugs available for purchase, thusresulting in lower drug consumption. Finally, lower-levelenforcement operations are useful in providing information thatwill be invaluable to those involved in investigating high-levelorganized crime trafficking groups. The absence of vigorouslower-level domestic law enforcement could encourage organizedcrime groups to remain in drug trafficking, and quite possiblespawn more such groups. High-level enforcement efforts could becrippled, if not completely undermined, by a lack of acomplementary, lower-level effort. A fundamental question remains: Which agencies should beresponsible for the various facets of domestic law enforcement?The investigation of high-level organized crime traffickinggroups, whose activities are generally regional, national orinternational in scope, is expensive, time consuming, andrequires special skills and sophisticated tools. The Federalgovernment, through its agencies, is best equipped to undertakesuch investigations. State and local agencies, because of theirunique knowledge of local conditions and expertise in therequired techniques, are more qualified to conduct lower-leveldomestic law enforcement, including street operations andinvestigations of certain smaller and geographically-restrictedtrafficking organizations. The conclusions and recommendations set forth in the precedingparagraph are not intended to suggest that Federal domestic lawenforcement and that of State and local agencies should becompletely separate and independent. The drug problem facing theUnited States is a national one, and the efforts of all lawenforcement agencies must be coordinated and interrelated to someextent, if we are to deal successfully with the problem. Therequired level of cooperation in some instances may be more thanthe routine exchange of drug intelligence or the suppression ofinteragency rivalries and jurisdictional disputes. In thisregard, the Commission endorses generally the view expressedrecently by a Federal prosecutor concerning drug enforcementefforts in New York City: [O]ne can not compartmentalize the narcotics enforcementeffort, and leave the streets entirely to state and localenforcement and the conspiracy cases entirely to the federalgovernment. While each may have a primary area, each must do someof both. The ideal combination may be some federal prosecution ofstate and local arrests, and a significant state and localparticipation in joint Task Forces, aimed at dismantling of drugnetworks through the conspiracy law. Examples of successful joint ventures involving Federal, Stateand local personnel include the Organized Crime Drug EnforcementTask Force Program, Operation Pressure Point, and the New YorkDrug Enforcement Task Force, which was formed in 1970. Theseprograms can serve as useful models for any future cooperativedomestic law enforcement arrangements that might be needed. Federal Domestic Law Enforcement As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission hasconcluded that the tools and techniques needed to permit Federallaw enforcement agents to prosecute their portion of the waragainst drug traffickers successfully are for the most partcurrently available. The need is not for sweeping new legislativeinitiatives but for further changes in attitudes and a greatercommitment to cooperation and coordination among the Federalagencies involved in drug law enforcement. Balkanization andjurisdictional disputes between agencies are the most seriousobstacles to success in the struggle against drug trafficking.The personnel of each Federal agency involved in domestic lawenforcement, from the chief executive to the newest employee,must understand that their agency alone cannot solve the Nation'sdrug problem. Acceptance of this reality will go a long way ineliminating the destructive competition that in the past hashampered Federal law enforcement. As discussed above, the Commission has concluded that thetargeting of high-level organized crime trafficking groups shouldbe the top priority of Federal drug law enforcement efforts.Because of the sophistication and complexity of suchorganizations and their operations, the Federal response must beequally sophisticated and complex. The Reagan Administration'sestablishment of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task ForceProgram (OCDETF Program) in late 1982 was an attempt to create amechanism for attacking high-level organized crime traffickinggroups; by their own account, the multiagency Task Forces,drawing on the resources of a broad spectrum of Federal, Stateand local agencies, have achieved an encouraging degree ofsuccess. The success that has been achieved was not the result ofthe development of new techniques but of the efficient use ofexisting ones: The OCDE Task Force Program can lay claim to no new inventionsin the fields of investigative and prosecutorial techniques. Itcan, however, be justifiably proud of its creative utilization ofexisting tools. The Commission applauds the OCDETF Program and those whodesigned and have implemented it. It strongly favors thePrograms's continuation and expansion, to the extent that it isdesirable and feasible to do so, for several reasons: the Programhas resulted in the elimination of interagency disputes to asubstantial extent; the disruption of large and sophisticatedtrafficking groups requires large, efficient and stronglysupported enforcement organizations; and multiagency task forcesare particularly suited to use the Federal conspiracy, RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Continuing CriminalEnterprise (CCE), and forfeiture statutes to the maximum andoptimum extent possible. In addition, the different investigativetechniques used by the participating agencies increases theprobability of successful infiltration of traffickingorganizations. However, the effectiveness of the OCDETF Programcould be enhanced if the following changes were made. In creating the OCDETF Program, its designers concluded thatto insure the maximum support of the participating agencies, aconsensus-based decision-making process was necessary. In thisregard, no single agency was designated as the lead Task Forceagency. Although participants in the OCDETF Program have beenable to reduce interagency competition and conflict to asubstantial and significant extent, the Commission believe thatfurther improvement is both desirable and feasible. Suchimprovements would flow naturally from a renewed, unambiguouscommitment to the Program and its goals by participatingagencies. Increased cooperation and coordination might alsoresult, if DEA or the FBI were designated as the lead Task Forceagency, or if the United States Attorneys were given greaterauthority with respect to the operations of the Task Force. TheCommission recommends that those in charge of the OCDETF Programshould consider whether a lead agency should be designated or aU.S. Attorney be given greater authority to achieve even greatercoordination of effort. Law enforcement agencies that participate in the OCDETFProgram have other missions in the struggle against drugtrafficking. For this reason, each "agency must balance itscommitment to the Task Force concept with its fundamentalmission. Because the targeting of high-level organized crimetrafficking groups should be the top priority and because theOCDE Task Forces are the best available devices for infiltratingand disrupting such groups, the Commission is concerned that, inallocating manpower and other resources between the program andother missions, the participating agencies should not shortchangethe Task Forces in any way. The top echelon of each participatingagency must be strongly committed to the OCDETF Program and itsgoals and must be actively involved in assuring its success. Therequired commitment and involvement are not satisfied byabdicating responsibility for insuring the success of the programto those heading field offices. Indifference at the headquarterslevel will be reflected eventually in field offices. To signal their commitment to the program and to encouragetheir best agents to participate in it, the top executives ofeach participating agency should adopt an unambiguous policy thatsalary increases and career advancement within the agency for anagent who participates in an OCDE Task Force will not beadversely affected in any way by that participation. Such apolicy would require that the evaluation of an agent assigned toa Task Force be based not on such criteria as the number ofarrests or cases made or the amount of drugs seized. Evaluationsshould assess that agent's qualitative performance in complexfinancial and conspiracy cases, which may last more than twoyears and which may result in the arrest of few, albeithigh-level and important traffickers. The OCDETF Program is only one facet of the Federal effortagainst drug trafficking. The effective functioning of the otherfacets of Federal domestic law enforcement, i.e., Organized CrimeStrike Forces, the South Florida Task Force, the FBI, DEA,Customs, and U.S. Attorneys, is also essential if the Nation'sdrug problem is ever to be contained and eventually eliminated. That the OCDE Task Forces are and should be primarilyresponsible for disrupting high-level organized crime traffickinggroups does not mean that the other Federal efforts should bedevoted to, or focused upon, lower -or street-level traffickersor purely local drug problems. For the reasons discussed above,these enforcement concerns are rightfully and almost exclusivelythose of State and local law enforcement. However, there will becases against organized crime trafficking groups that will bedeemed inappropriate for OCDETF treatment, and these will thenhave to be handled by some other Federal agency; this is alsotrue with respect to large trafficking organizations that are notorganized crime controlled and that may or may not bemulti-jurisdictional. As a result of its investigation and study, the Commission hasconcluded that the non-OCDETF Program segments of Federaldomestic drug law enforcement are for the most part functioningwell and that the variety of investigative techniques that theseagencies bring to the Federal effort to reduce the supply ofdrugs is a great benefit. The use of financial expertise,undercover, sting and reverse sting operations, informants,electronic and other kinds of surveillance, preselected targetand target of opportunity approaches to initiatinginvestigations, and buy-bust transactions are all useful ways ofinfiltrating trafficking organizations. However, the Commissionis concerned that the healthy competition among enforcementagencies that the current organizational structure is supposed toencourage often degenerates into jurisdictional conflicts thatharm the overall Federal effort against traffickers. This willcontinue to occur unless top agency officials instill in theiragents and employees the sense that genuine cooperation andcoordination with other agencies are essential to the ultimatesuccess of the Nation's drug effort. In this regard, the NationalDrug Enforcement Policy Board has an important and unique role toplay insuring that healthy and constructive competition does notbecome destructive and petty conflict. The Board could take one important step to eliminatejurisdictional disputes, as well as to avoid duplication ofinvestigative efforts and to provide maximum safety to drugagents. This would be to require the establishment of a systemwhereby an agency would file a report with a central reportingrepository, once it has opened an investigation of an individualbelieved to be a part of a trafficking operation. If two or moreagencies were investigating the same individual, they would benotified of that fact, and they would be required to decide,after negotiations, the best way for conducting theinvestigation, a single agency or an ad hoc task force. Such asystem would work at its optimal level only if all lawenforcement agencies, including State and local units,participated. The Commission believes that such a reporting andcontrol system is highly desirable and, because of existingtechnology, feasible. The Commission also believes that thissystem could be incorporated easily into the all-sourceintelligence and operations center, recommended elsewhere in thisreport. As result of the 1973 reorganization plan, the Customs Servicewas prohibited from conducting investigative, intelligence, andlaw enforcement functions, relating to the suppression of drugtrafficking, at locations away from ports of entry or borders.This aspect of the plan has been controversial and as elicitedmuch criticism on the ground that is weakened the "Nation'scapability to interdict the flow of narcotics into the UnitedStates." The Commission has no objections to that feature of the 1973reorganization plan that created a lead agency in Federal druglaw enforcement, and indeed believes that it remains a validconcept today. However, the Commission has concluded that it isan appropriate time to study whether the functions of the CustomsService with respect to drug trafficking should be expanded toinclude investigative, intelligence, and law enforcementfunctions within this country, beyond the borders and ports ofentry, where appropriate and subject to the oversight andsupervision of the lead agencies. In this respect, the Commissionnotes that the 1973 reorganization plan was modified somewhatwhen, on January 5, 1984, the Attorney General signed the"Request for Assistance and Authorization Respecting DrugEnforcement Activities of Certain Customs Officers in DomesticDrug Investigations." This action granted authority to theDEA Administrator to endow specific Customs agents, for adesignated period of time, with the power, among others, toconduct investigative, intelligence, and law enforcementfunctions relating to drug trafficking. Because this arrangementappears to have worked well, a broader expansion of Customs'functions may be warranted at this time in an effort to improvedomestic law enforcement. In addition to the attitudinal and organizational mattersdiscussed above, the Commission proposes substantial expansion ofthe use of one particular investigative technique because of themagnitude of illicit drug production in this country. All of thePCP (phencyclidine), almost all of the methamphetamine, and anestimated 80 percent of injectable amphetamine availableillicitly in the United States in 1984 were produced in domesticclandestine laboratories. In addition, an increasing amount ofcocaine in being processed in this country. In fact, the numberof cocaine laboratories seized by law enforcement authorities inthe United States between 1983 and 1984 nearly doubled. To combat both the domestic and foreign production of illicitdrugs, law enforcement officials have, in some instances,targeted the chemicals used to manufacture the drugs. Forexample, through its "Operation Chem-Con," DEA tracksthe movement of chemicals used to process cocaine from theprincipal manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to their finaldestinations. According to the chief of the DEA's cocainesection, Johnny Phelps: Through cooperation gained by DEA from the world's etherindustry and foreign law enforcement elements, we now havevoluntary restrictions on sales to known trafficking groups andare able to seize shipments of chemicals after purchase causinggreat financial losses to cocaine producing consort[ia]. In addition to the voluntary compliance of chemical companiesin Operation Chem-Con, reporting requirements are sometimes usedto control chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs.Piperidine, a chemical used to manufacture the hallucinogen PCP,is subject to reporting requirements under the ControlledSubstances Act. The provision requires that any person sellingpiperidine report to the Attorney General information concerningthe sale, including identifying information about the purchaser,and the quantity, form and intended use of the piperidine. Thissystem has worked well and permits DEA to investigate anysuspicious sales of piperidine. Since 1984 DEA has seized fourclandestine PCP laboratories and has located at least ten otheroperations, which obtained chemicals for PCP manufacture byposing as legitimate businesses. Chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs can be regulatedin the same manner as controlled substances. Under the ControlledSubstances Act, the Attorney General may place an immediateprecursor in the same schedule as the controlled substance forwhich it is a precursor. Although the regulation of chemicals used to manufactureillicit drugs can thwart efforts to produce these drugs and canhelp law enforcement officials to locate clandestinelaboratories, several factors limit the effectiveness of suchapproaches. First, many of these chemicals have widespreadlegitimate uses in industry, and tracking their sales would beimpractical. Even tracking a limited number of these chemicalswould be costly, requiring adequate computer resources andindividuals to review and analyze chemical sales information.Second, controls on chemicals may have only short-term effects.In the case of the reporting of piperidine, both use of PCP andclandestine laboratory activity appeared to decline from 1979 to1981. However, by 1982, trafficking in and abuse of PCP hadincreased. Third, some chemicals can be obtained illicitly. Forexample, a shortage of P2P (phenyl-2-propanone), which is used tomanufacture methamphetamine, resulted from the placement of P2Pin Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Traffickersresponded by increasing illicit manufacture of P2P in 1982. Despite these limitations, controlling a limited number ofthese chemicals has merit. The United Nations InternationalNarcotics Control Board has identified the following chemicals assuitable targets for control: ether, used to process cocaine;acetic anhydride, (heroin); P2P, (methamphetamine); ergotamine(LSD); anthranilic acid (methaqualone); and piperidine (PCP).This United Nations Board has called on countries in whichillicit drug manufacture occurs to impose a licensing system andquotas for supplying and importation of these chemicals. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission recommends that DEAshould determine which chemicals currently used to manufactureillicit drugs should be subject to reporting requirements orplaced in a schedule of the Controlled Substances Act. Thisreview should included a consideration of which drugs are mostabused, which have the most serious consequences, and whichprecursor chemicals are essential to the production process. Inaddition, DEA should identify the resources needed for thecomputerization, analysis and follow-up of reports concerningchemicals selected for monitoring. The Commission's final recommendations concerning Federaldomestic law enforcement relate to the Federal agents andemployees who are most involved in the Federal effort againstdrugs. This country owes these agents the greatest possibleamount of protection and assistance against the vicious andruthless participants in organized crime traffickingorganizations. As the testimony of drug pilot Adler Barriman Sealbefore this Commission revealed, because of the massive amountsof money involved, high-level traffickers are able to procure anduse the products of the latest technological advances tofacilitate their trafficking operations. Drug agents must also begiven access to such state of the art equipment and weapons. Inthis regard, the research and development operations of Federaldrug law enforcement agencies should work closely with fieldagents to produce the equipment and tools needed to defeat drugtraffickers. Finally, this Commission has made several recommendationsdesigned to improve Federal domestic law enforcement. However,the men and women involved in the day-to-day effort against drugtrafficking have the most incentive and are the best qualified tooffer suggestions as to how to improve domestic law enforcement.These "experts" should be encouraged to makerecommendations and should be rewarded for the ones that aresuccessful. State and Local Domestic Law Enforcement The role of State and local agencies in the national campaignagainst drugs has been described above: they have the primaryresponsibility for lower- and street-level enforcement because oftheir proximity to the affected areas and because they possess orcan adopt the tools necessary for carrying out their mission. Thesuccessful accomplishment of the mission of State and local lawenforcement agencies is a desirable end, in and of itself,because harassment and disruption of drug retailers and smalleror geographically-restricted distribution networks could lead toa reduction in the supply of drugs, an increase in the price ofthe drugs remaining in the marketplace, and discouragement ofnon-drug users from experimenting with drugs. Successfulcompletion of this mission will also permit State and localauthorities to provide Federal law enforcement agencies withinformation that will be invaluable to the latter in infiltratingand disrupting high-level organized crime and other largetrafficking organizations. The leaders of State and localagencies must constantly reiterate to their agents that theirefforts cannot be viewed in isolation and that they are part ofmuch larger national campaign against drugs. Such indoctrinationwill result in the kind of cooperation and coordination essentialto the success of the overall national effort. Effective State and local domestic drug law enforcement willundoubtedly require increased expenditures, including theexpansion of prison facilities. Although the drug problem isquite correctly denominated a National one, its devastatingeffects are most pronounced at the State and local levels.Therefore, the Commission recommends that State and localgovernments determine what is necessary to permit their lawenforcement agencies to carry out their drug mission successfullyand do all they can to convince their citizens that any requiredincrease in expenditures is absolutely essential. Such a campaignwill be considerably more palatable if it includes a largesegment of funding from seized drug revenues and assets, asdescribed below. The Commission has concluded that if a State is serious aboutresponding to the drug problem within its jurisdiction it mustprovide its law enforcement agencies with certain tools that areavailable to their Federal counterparts. The Commission thereforerecommends that those States, which do not already have suchstatutes, consider enacting legislation patterned after thefollowing Federal statutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984, theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act;statutory use and derivative use immunity for witnesses;statutory criminal and civil forfeiture provisions; theContinuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) statute; Title III of theOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (electronicsurveillance); and the Currency and Foreign TransactionsReporting Act. In addition, the Commission recommends that, whereappropriate, States consider adopting statewide grand juries,with public reporting authority, to improve their investigationsof drug trafficking organizations and eliminating accomplicecorrobation statutes or rules. Although the Commission iscognizant that there may be legitimate State constitutionalobjections to the adoption of some provisions and devices, theCommission nevertheless believes that each has increased theeffectiveness of Federal domestic law enforcement and wouldsimilarly increase the effectiveness of State and local lawenforcement agencies in infiltrating and disrupting traffickinggroups. Foreign Assistance Because the majority of drugs consumed in the United States isproduced abroad, a primary component of our national strategy isinternational cooperation to control drugs. A prerequisite ofthis strategy is the cooperation of drug producing andtrafficking nations. While this has proved difficult or evenimpossible in some situations, due to the political, economic orsocial instability of some drug producing countries,international cooperation can contribute to our national effortto reduce drug consumption. The United States provides various forms of assistance toother countries to help them in their anti-drug efforts,including both economic and military aid. According to the 1984National Strategy For Prevention of Drug Abuse and DrugTrafficking, the objectives of the U.S. international strategyare: . . . strengthening U.S. efforts to assist foreign governmentsin stopping the production and transportation of illicit drugsand improving interdiction efforts in transit nations;encouraging and assisting governments of producer nations toundertake crop control programs as the most effective means ofcurbing production; developing innovative mutual assistancetreaties with foreign governments, directed at facilitatingjudicial actions against the drug trade, seizing assets derivedfrom drug trafficking, eliminating banking procedures which hideillicit drug transactions, and extradition and other legalarrangements; encouraging other nations to support internationalnarcotics control programs, financially and with other resources,including developmental assistance linked with crop control andcooperative law enforcement efforts; encouraging internationalorganizations and development banks to link their assistance withnarcotics control objectives, where appropriate; and curtailingthe diversion of pharmaceuticals and chemicals from legitimateinternational commerce. Indications are increasing that the concern over drug-relatedproblems is becoming universal. This growing concern is duelargely to recognition by governments in both developed andless-developed countries, that the illicit production,trafficking and abuse of drugs pose serious problems to theirnations' development, their societies, and in some cases, totheir national security. The multiple effects of drug traffickingare increasingly felt in Latin America, Southeast Asia, andSouthwest Asia. These effects include crime, corruption, economicdestabilization, political manipulation, and epidemic drug abuse.Much of the increased anti-drug activity in South Americancountries in the past two years correlates directly to theemergence of domestic drug problems in those countries, and theirawareness of their own vulnerability to the myriad problemsrelated to drug abuse. At a time when drug traffickers rule segments of somecountries, and dominate local economies in others, an increasingnumber of nations are realizing that passivity is not the answer.This realization is encouraging efforts for more cooperation withthe United States in its multilateral enforcement and demandreduction programs. Reduction in the demand for drugs in theUnited States and abroad is beginning to be perceived by drugproducing and trafficking nations as a vital component in thefight against drug abuse. It is an objective that has greaterlong term potential for producing action by source nationgovernments than do efforts perceived as benefiting the UnitedStates exclusively. The Commission recognizes the importance of existinginternational drug control efforts. Because drug trafficking andproduction are threats to the stability of existing democracies,a primary goal of the United States and its allies should be toenhance the security of drug producing and transshipment regions.Because some source countries are promoting drug control in theinterests of their own national security and public welfare moreactively than they have in the past, it is an opportune time forthe United States to intensify its international drug controlefforts. The success of these efforts requires the political andfinancial support of a much broader coalition within theinternational community. The United States offers assistance to numerous countriesaround the world with drug abuse and trafficking problems,primarily through the Department of State's Bureau ofInternational Narcotics Matters, the Agency for InternationalDevelopment, and the United States Information Agency. The UnitedStates currently supports crop eradication programs in 14countries and is working to develop such programs in severalothers. These control efforts are vitally enhanced by the publicadareness programs sponsored by the Department of State, theAgency for International Development, and the United StatesInformation Agency. There has been an ongoing debate in this country concerningthe wisdom of making foreign assistance, both general anddrug-related, conditional on the progress of drug controlefforts. Proponents of utilizing existing authority to suspendaid to any nation not taking steps to control drug productionclaim that the United States should employ this leverage as afinal step in forcing nations to stop drug production. Opponentsfeel that sustained aid is necessary to achieve U.S.-supporteddrug control objectives and that an aid cut-off might undermineother U.S. interests in some cases. The National Drug Enforcement Policy Board is now in a centralposition in this area, as in all others in the anti-drug effort.It should carefully evaluate the data used in the President'sannual decision whether to suspend aid to drug producing ortransshipment countries, and make a suitable recommendation tothe President for his ultimate decision. Extradition and mutual assistance treaties can also contributeto international drug control efforts by enhancing diplomaticinitiatives and providing leverage in United States' foreignpolicy decisions. Clauses in several existing treaties areparticularly innovative and worthy of inclusion in futureagreements. The willingness of a country to engage in andactively implement drug-related extradition and mutual assistancetreaties should be a primary consideration in ultimate U.S.policy decisions regarding foreign assistance to a country, andshould be weighed in the deliberations of the President and thepolicy Board described above. The Department of State, in conjunction with the Department ofDefense, should continue its program of expanded economicassistance with emphasis on assisting those foreign governmentsmaking concerted efforts to control their drug problems. At thesame time, a recognition that drug trafficking has become anational security issue should lead to the availability and useof security assistance funds. The effectiveness of suchassistance is, of course, dependent upon the political will ofthe host government. To encourage this, the United States shouldraise the drug issue to the highest level possible in bilateralrelations with producer and trafficker nations. Similarly, theUnited States should raise the drug issue in terns ofinternational security with its industrialized allies. Thisshould occur not only in the United Nations, but also on abilateral and multilateral basis. This would provide incentive inurging those nations to increase their assistance and cooperationwithin the region and in urging those nations to raise the issueas a high priority in their bilateral relations with the producerand trafficking nations. In addition to these efforts to reduce the supply of drugs,international efforts to reduce the demand for drugs are animportant component of U.S. strategy. The United States should,therefore, continue to help producer nations develop preventionand education programs aimed at drug abuse within the producerand trafficker nations. Indications are overwhelming that the world community ingeneral realizes the dangers inherent in drug use. In the past,many nations regarded drug abuse as aberrational social behavior,and relegated governmental reaction, if there was any at all, tolaw enforcement or social/health ministries. As internationalawareness of the actual nature and scope of the threat of drugabuse increases, however, nations are placing the issue where itbelongs: within the realm of national security. Source Country Crop Control Strategies to control drug trafficking and drug abuse in theUnited States have traditionally included measures designed toeliminate illicit drug supplies at their source. These"source country eradication" measures, primarily themanual elimination or uprooting of illicit drug crops and the useof herbicides to kill illicit plants, remain a central focus ofthis country's anti-drug efforts. The 1984 National Strategy forthe Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking clearly statesU.S. policy in this regard: Fundamental to the overall supply reduction effort iseliminating illegal drugs as close to their source as possible.The major gains will be realized in the longer term reduction inthe availability of illicit drugs. Since 1978 the Department of State's Bureau of InternationalNarcotics Matters (BINM) has had primary responsibility foroverseeing and implementing foreign drug production controlefforts. BINM provides bilateral assistance for crop control andinterdiction programs in drug source countries in the form ofequipment, training and technical advisory services. BINM'sstated objective is: to control production simultaneously in all key sectors ofillicit drugs exported to the United States so that significantand lasting reductions in availability are achieved . . . .Preventing cultivation and destroying illicit narcotics at theirsource will prove to be the most effective means of reducingavailability. . . . BINM's first priority is on crop control -government bans on cultivation production, enforced by manual orchemical crop eradication. In a successful crop control system drugs would be stopped attheir source, thereby alleviating the "chain reaction"associated with drug trafficking and drug abuse in this country.In fact, crop reduction efforts have at best enjoyed limitedsuccess. Despite the fact that nearly all drug producing andtransit countries are signatories to a 1961 agreement thatrestricts production and distribution of certain drugs to onlymedical and scientific uses, drug production has escalated inmost source countries in the past 20 years. Increased productionhas resulted in decreased prices and wider availability of mostillicit drugs in the United States. Accordingly, domesticconsumption of many drugs has increased. The effectiveness of efforts to control illicit drug crops insource countries is inherently limited. First, many sourcecountry governments are not motivated to reduce crop production,either because the profits obtained from the illicit crops areessential to the economic and/or political stability of thecountry, or because they view drug consumption as an exclusivelyAmerican problem. In addition, many drugs that are illegal in theUnited States are traditionally consumed in milder forms bysource country natives and are viewed as necessities of life oran essential part of their culture. Secondly, in many cases farmers do not have an easilyavailable alternative crop. In any case, an illicit drug crop canprovide a farmer with far more income than any legitimate cropand is therefore likely to be selected above any other crop forcultivation. Third, the governments in many producing areas are weak and donot exert control over growers. The Thai and Burmese governmentshave long been fighting insurgent groups in the NorthwestFrontier Provinces, where most of the Golden Triangle opium isgrown. The Peruvian government has had little effective controlin remote coca producing regions controlled by that country'sShining Path Guerrillas. Even where governments aggressivelypursue crop eradication programs, difficulties are sometimesoverwhelming. Fourth, some major source countries are controlled bygovernments hostile to the United States, who while adoptingpolicies to reduce domestic consumption, have no hesitation aboutimportation of illicit drugs to the United States. Because manysource country governments are politically and economicallyunstable, United States diplomatic relations with even nonhostilesource country governments are often very complex. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the set of sourcecountries is not fixed. When a crop is successfully reduced inone country, production begins or increases in another country.New producers constantly emerge. This shifting has been observedrepeatedly throughout the history of source country controlefforts, even where the United States has claimed major croperadication successsses. This has been the most serious obstacleto total crop reduction efforts. U.S. and Mexican efforts provide an example. The croperadication program conducted in the mid-1970's in Mexico isoften cited as a successful model. Through the program, theUnited States supplied equipment, herbicide and funds for theeradication of opium poppies, primarily in Northern Mexico. WhileMexican heroin production declined after the program'simplementation, heroin production in and export from the GoldenTriangle and the Golden Crescent accelerated, and within fiveyears, total heroin available in the United States reached levelsequal to those attained before the Mexican eradication program.Mexican heroin production has increased every year since 1980,and in 1984 that country provided an estimated 21 percent of thetotal U.S. supply. Despite the limitations of source country control programs,the efforts to reduce international illicit drug crops areessential to the overall U.S. drug strategy. Implementedselectively and judiciously, crop control programs couldeffectively reduce the availability of targeted illicit drugs inthe United States, if only on a temporary basis. As viewed by theSelect Committee on Narcotics, Effective action in relatively few countries, against theproduction and trafficking of opium, heroin, coca, cocaine,marijuana and hashish would have a great impact on the drug abuseproblem in the United States by dramatically curtailing suppliesavailable to users and potential users . . . The United States, through the Department of State, shouldfocus crop control efforts in those countries where political andeconomic climates will make the success of crop eradicationprograms probable. Particular crop control opportunities couldbest be determined if the State Department established a cadre ofprofessional drug officers. Currently, international drugprograms are often managed by contract personnel or by ForeignService Officers not especially interested in drug issues.Narcotics Assistance Unit positions within the Foreign Serviceoften remain unfilled for long periods of time because ForeignService Officers often view them as a detriment to their careers.The absence of a specialized drug group within the ForeignService structure thus impacts negatively on the overallinternational drug effort. The Department of State shouldrecognize Narcotics Assistance Unit positions as priorityassignments, and integrate them into the career advancementstructure. BINM should also examine the possibility of introducing sourcecountry farmers to more imaginative and feasible alternatives toillicit drug cultivation. The available options are currentlylimited to cultivating licit replacement crops but could possiblyinclude the mining of indigenous minerals and the introduction oflight industry to a traditional growing region. Finally, the importance of international crop controls in thecontext of the overall drug reduction strategy should bereevaluated. The limitations inherent in these programs, themajority of which are beyond the control of the United States,make them a less likely success than other strategies discussedelsewhere in this report. In addition, the problems associatedwith international controls, most notably the relentless shiftingof drug crop cultivations to non-targeted countries, underscoresthe ultimate importance of reducing the demand for drugs in thiscountry. History has shown that as long as consumer demand for anillicit drug is strong, some country, somewhere, will become asource country.

While this seems plausible,a review of the 75-year history of these efforts reveals thatthey have not reduced social, economic or crime problems relatedto drugs. Despite continuing expressions of determination,America's war on drugs seems nowhere close to success. Now morethan ever, drugs present problems of vast proportions. This does not suggest that efforts to reduce supply, such ascrop eradication, border interdiction, and prosecution, havefailed. To the contrary, they have achieved a measure of success.In 1983, for example, authorities estimated that approximately 10percent of the drugs destined for illicit markets wereinterdicted. Crop eradication programs were significantlyexpanded in Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine isprocessed and nearly one-half of the marijuana consumed in theUnited States is grown. In addition, indictments and convictionsof some of the world's most notorious traffickers have beenobtained in recent years. Despite these efforts, American consumption of cocaineincreased an estimated 12 percent and dangerous drug useincreased an estimated 15 percent between 1983 and 1984. Cocaine,heroin, amphetamine, and methamphetamine-related deathsincreased, as did cocaine, PCP, and methamphetamine-relatedemergency room visits. In short, strategies to reduce supply are "working"by some standards, but only to a limited degree. Although some inherent factors limit the effectiveness ofthese tactics, the overwhelming and continuing demand for illicitdrugs among Americans is the primary cause of their limitedsuccess. Millions want illicit drugs and are willing to violatethe law, spend billions of dollars, and in many cases risk theirlives to obtain them. Supply Versus Demand Although the supply of and demand for drugs have often beenconsidered separate issues, by both the public and privatesectors, they are in fact inseparable parts of a single problem.The success of supply efforts are related to commitments made toreduce the demand for drugs through drug abuse education,treatment, research, vigorous enforcement of drug abuse laws, andeffective sentencing. Drug supply and demand operate in aninterrelated and dynamic manner. The strategies employed to limiteach should be similarly connected. The national fight against illicit drugs relies on twofundamental strategies: organized crime policy and drug abusepolicy. Organized crime policy targets specific criminal groupsand seeks to destroy those already in existence and prevent theemergence of new ones. In contrast, drug abuse policy attempts toreduce drug use and its associated adverse effects.Theoretically, organized crime policy and drug abuse policy canconflict. Reducing the demand for drugs advances the goals ofboth organized crime policy and drug abuse policy. Asignificantly smaller drug market, which would likely result froma substantially reduced demand for drugs, would attack organizedcrime groups by limiting the huge profits currently available indrug trafficking, while simultaneously reducing the number ofdrug users, the goal of drug abuse policy. A clear example of the relationship of supply and demand isprovided by the case of heroin trafficker Cecily Lermusiaux, whowith several associates, moved heroin into an area of Las Vegaswhere its use among "middle to high-class whites" waspreviously unknown. In a scheme which began with the distributionof free samples of heroin, Lermusiaux's independent heroinbusiness generated a profit of several million dollars inapproximately six years. The demand for drugs is also widely recognized as the fuelthat the illicit drug industry needs to operate. According toColombian President Belisario Bentancur: In the world war against narcotics, we need the commitment ofthe consumer nations to attack the traffic with the same vigor wehave shown. We can make all the sacrifices possible, but if thereis enormous demand, production will never be completelyeradicated. This sentiment has been echoed by the other side of the law.Carlos Lehder, who heads one of Colombia's most notorious cocainecartels, sees the American demand for drugs as the driving forcebehind the "bonanza" of drug trafficking: The demand for drugs in the United States is so great that theproducer countries like Colombia play a really tiny role comparedto the total consumption of the United States. Tactics to Reduce Demand Efforts to reduce demand are not hampered by internationalpolitical complications, or other factors that limit theeffectiveness of tactics to reduce supply. This Commission is ofthe opinion that since reducing demand is the single policyoption pursuable entirely within our own borders, it deservesgreater attention. More successful tactics to reduce demand may in the long-rundecrease the need for current high levels of funding forapproaches to reduce supply. A significant reduction in thedemand for drugs as a complement to aggressive enforcementefforts is likely to make drug trafficking less lucrative fororganized crime and thus prompt many organized crime groups todrop out of the drug business. According to analyst Mark Kleiman: Demand reduction is clearly the strategy of choice withrespect to its effects on organized crime . . . anything thattends to depress demand will reduce both trafficking-relatedancillary crime and the level of drug enforcement resourcesneeded to attain any given level of reduction in drugconsumption. Skeptics have argued that past tactics to reduce demand havenot been successful. However, the history of drug abuseprevention and treatment programs has been relatively short. Itwas not until the upsurge of drug use in the 1960's that theseprograms developed. Some early prevention approaches wereill-conceived. For example, they often presented informationabout drugs without persuasive arguments to deter their use, andother programs used exaggerated information. Such programs havebeen criticized for unintentionally encouraging experimentationwith drugs or squandering the credibility of anti-druginformation. The most recent and effective drug abuse educationand prevention programs focus on the psychological andsociological factors that contribute to the onset of drug use.Drug education programs must be continually evaluated andimproved to keep pace with changing drug abuse patterns. In a model program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse(NIDA) used the strategy of the anti-smoking campaigns of thelate 1970's, which many feel were effective, to develop its"Just Say No" campaign against drug use whichrecognizes the impact of social pressure. NIDA seeks to showadolescents through a music video, television commercials, andother media that they can turn down drugs by simply saying"no" to them. While it is difficult to measure precisely the effectivenessof such anti-drug advertising, it is clear that the media canhelp shape attitudes. Just as beliefs about cigarette smokinghave changed in recent years, so too can attitudes about drugs.Anti-drug advertising has an advantage over the anti-smokingcampaigns: drug dealers cannot openly advertise their product.According to the New York advertising firm of Trout and Ries, Unlike cigarette manufacturers, drug producers and sellerscannot use advertising to promote a fashionable image for theirdrugs. Quite the opposite, the government can use advertising tomake drugs less and less fashionable to use. This, if Americaruns true to form, will dramatically reduce demand. When it's'out' in America, it doesn't sell. Reducing the demand for drugs requires a long-term commitmentbecause it takes time to change attitudes. This commitment mustbe made by Federal, State, and local governments and the privatesector. Each must unequivocally reassert that any and all illicitdrug use is unacceptable in light of the effects of drugs onindividuals, families, communities, and governments. It is onlyin this context that a war against drugs that seeks to limit boththe supply of and demand for drugs can be effective. Federal Government Federal Priorities Three of the five elements of the current National Strategyfor Prevention of Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking are directed toreduction of demand: drug abuse prevention, medicaldetoxification and treatment, and research. The importance of reducing demand has, in addition, been,publicly acknowledged by leading law enforcement officials.According to Attorney General Edwin Meese III, for example: All the enforcement efforts that we can try in this country,all the police agencies in this nation and worldwide will neverbe able to stem the supply of drugs in this nation until we havefirst decreased the number of users and have decreased the demandfor these drugs. John Lawn, administrator of the Drug EnforcementAdministration (DEA), concurs: Were we [DEAl to increase dramatically in size, the drugproblem would continue to exist until we could do something aboutdemand reduction. While the importance of strategies to reduce demand has beenacknowledged, it is reduction of supply that has consumed thebulk of the Federal drug abuse budget. This may be due, in part,to the fact that certain enforcement operations are inherentlymore expensive, and they are exclusively a Federal function. Inaddition, primary responsibility for developing and maintainingprograms to reduce demand has been shifted to the States and theprivate sector. The concept of our current National Strategy, assigningcomplementary roles to the Federal government, on the one hand,and State and local governments and the private sector, on theother, is commendable for its recognition of the unique roles ofeach component. However, the adoption of this coordinatedapproach carries with it the responsibility for ensuring that thecomponents perform in a truly coordinated and complementaryfashion. There is insufficient evidence today that thisresponsibility is being met. Moreover, in precisely the same waythat approaches to reduce supply recognize a unique Federalcapability, there are certain functions in the area of demandthat, by their nature, can only be performed by the Federalgovernment. The Federal government's exclusive role in reducingthe demand for drugs includes providing national coordination inthe conduct of research, gathering nationwide data, anddeveloping and disseminating standards for drug prevention andtreatment programs across the country. Current budgetary figures reflect the emphasis on drug lawenforcement. while programs to reduce demand at one time receivedthe larger share of the Federal budget, the focus on enforcementhas increased dramatically during the last decade. For example,between fiscal year 82 and 86, Federal funding for drug abuseprevention has decreased by 5 percent, while Federal funding fordrug law enforcement has increase by 70 percent. For fiscal year1986 Federal expenditures on drug law enforcement constitute 84percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget outlay of $1.7billion. Interdiction alone consumes 38 percent of this budget.In the same year Federal funding for drug abuse preventionconstitutes one percent, treatment and rehabilitation 6 percent,and research 4 percent of the total Federal drug abuse budget. In addition to this funding the Federal government providesfunding to the States for drug abuse prevention and treatmentthrough the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grants.For fiscal year 1986 between $65 and $244 million is madeavailable to the States for drug programs. However, prior to 1981under the formula grant program, 40 percent more funds wereavailable to the States for these purposes. A thorough review ofthe current budgetary allotments for anti-drug efforts, nowcontemplated by the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board,should be placed at the top of the agenda of the Boardimmediately. This Commission concludes that such a review willindicate that greater Federal resources should be devoted toprograms to reduce demand, and that the Board should pursueappropriate action without hesitation. Asset Forfeiture Expanded efforts to reduce demand would, of course, requireadditional funding at all levels. A particularly promising sourceof such funding is the considerable amount of money and propertyobtained annually through forfeiture and seized by lawenforcement officials. In 1984 Federal agencies obtained anestimated $400 to 450 million through the forfeiture and seizureof drug traffickers assets. Rudolph Guiliani, U.S. Attorney forthe Southern District of New York, observes: The drug dealers are just about paying for the drug lawenforcement, and hopefully we can get them to pay for drugeducation. Under current policy, the Federal government channels allseized and forfeited assets into Federal, State, and local lawenforcement agencies and the Department of Justice AssetsForfeiture Fund. Presently, no portion of these funds is used forFederal drug demand reduction programs, such as prevention,treatment, and research. However, pending legislation is beingconsidered that would direct use of portions of the AssetsForfeiture Fund for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs.A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiture fundderived from drug cases should be devoted to programs to reducedemand in whatever proportion is indicated by the Policy Board'sbudgetary review. Funding to reduce demand should include aresponsible contribution to the States for their own programs inthis area. However, any funding directed to the States should bemade contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, andafter a reasonable grace period, funding should be denied to anyState failing this requirement. Failure to enact State electronicsurveillance measures and asset forfeiture provisions, with theproceeds thereof directed to anti-drug programs, shouldconstitute per se failure. Research Because data concerning drug abuse are in many instancesrelatively incomplete, and in all cases, subject to change basedon new discoveries, continuing research is a fundamentalcomponent of any drug strategy. Recent discoveries concerningcocaine provide an example. The 1967 President's Commission onLaw Enforcement and Administration of Justice reported thatcocaine did not "create tolerance or physicaldependence;" however, research during the 1980's showed thatcocaine does, in fact, create tolerance and some argue, physicaldependence. Despite this increased understanding about cocaine,many experts, such as Dr. Arnold Washton, argue that researchabout the effects of cocaine is still in its "infancy." Continuing research is required not only by the complex natureof drugs and their effects on the human mind and body, but alsoby the constantly shifting patterns of drug abuse. While heroinhas traditionally been the most frequently encountered drug ofabuse among individuals in treatment programs, cocaine nowfollows closely behind and has, in fact, overtaken heroin as theprimary drug of abuse by those in treatment in 18 States. Whilerequests for treatment by cocaine users are estimated to haveincreased by as much as 600 percent in the last three years,research about cocaine and its effects has not kept pace withthis growing problem. The development of new drugs, such ascontrolled substance analogs, presents another compelling needfor continuing research. Data Collection and Dissemination As part of its research responsibilities, NIDA supports twocontinuing epidemiological surveys, the National Household Surveyon Drug Abuse and the High School Senior Survey. While these twosurveys provide valuable information about the extent of druguse, neither NIDA nor any other agency systematically collects ordisseminates information about the thousands of drug abuseprograms. State governments, which disbursed 46 percent ($642.5 million)of the funding for alcohol and drug abuse prevention andtreatment services in fiscal year 1984, do not systematicallyreport to the Federal government about these programs. This lackof data is due primarily to the absence of any statutoryrequirement for such reporting, and is a major obstacle toeffective drug policy planning. The States should be required toreport to the National Institute on Drug Abuse information abouttheir prevention and treatment programs. With this information,and reports obtained from private programs, NIDA will be betterable to identify the best prevention and treatment programs andto develop and disseminate standards and guidelines for suchprograms to the States. The States should, in turn, provide thisinformation to all groups engaged in prevention, treatment, andrelated research. Guidelines Because the Federal government does not systematically collectand evaluate information about drug abuse prevention andtreatment programs, it cannot develop substantive guidelines forsuch efforts. The history of drug abuse prevention hasdemonstrated that certain approaches are considerably moreeffective than others. Some have even unwittingly encouragedexperimentation with drugs. As an increasing number of school andcommunity-based prevention programs are created, the need forguidelines for drug abuse programs is particularly acute.Officials at NIDA acknowledge that many programs use outdatedfactual information and philosophies; however, the Federalgovernment is in a unique position to establish and disseminatesuch guidelines to improve both State and private sector drugabuse programs. Its current failure to do so is a majordeficiency in the campaign against drug abuse. In addition to contributions to reducing the demand for drugsthrough research, data collection and dissemination, and theformation of guidelines, the Federal government should provide anexample of the unacceptability of drug use. The President shoulddirect the heads of all federal agencies to formulate immediatelyclear policy statements, with implementing guidelines, includingsuitable drug testing, expressing the utter unacceptability ofdrug use by Federal employees. Government contracts should not beawarded to companies which fail to implement drug programs,including suitable drug testing. State and Local Governments State and local governments are key components in the nationalcampaign against drug abuse. Their unique capabilities in thearea of reducing demand include State-sponsored media campaignsagainst drug use, prevention and education programs in theschools, drug treatment programs, more vigorous enforcement ofState drug laws, and the inclusion of mandatory treatment or jailsentences, as appropriate, for those individuals convicted ofpossession of drugs. Because the nature of drug use tends to varyamong different geographical areas, State and local governmentsare best positioned to tailor techniques to reduce demand to suittheir particular drug problem. Drug Education The public school systems of State and local governmentsprovide an appropriate forum for drug abuse prevention programs.Consistent with identified measures of success, State governmentsshould establish credentialing standards for prevention andtreatment programs. They should further require that allelementary, junior high, and high schools within the Stateinclude drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,designed in a manner consistent with such credentialingstandards. State funding should be made available to assure theproper training of educators assigned to such programs. Combining prevention programs, clear school policies about theconsequences of drug use, increased discipline, and higheracademic standards has been demonstrated to be effective. Forexample, Northside High School in Atlanta, Georgia implementedsuch a program in the late 1970's in the face of "pooracademic performance . . . student apathy . . . disciplineproblems . . . class cutting and open drug use on campus."By the early 1980's, performance on standardized tests improvedsignificantly and "the use and possession of drugs on campus[had] all but disappeared." Every employer, public andprivate, and public education institutions at all levels shouldhave clearly-stated policies prohibiting drug use, possession ofdrugs, or being under the influence of drugs on their premises.The consequences of violating these prohibitions should beclearly explained. Law Enforcement A critical part of a national campaign to reduce demand isvigorous enforcement by State and local governments of their lawsregarding the possession of controlled substances. The Departmentof Justice Uniform Crime Report for 1984 states that 552,552arrests were made in 1984 by State and local police agencies forpossession of drugs. Given that in 1984 there were estimated tobe 20 million monthly marijuana users, over four million monthlycocaine users, and approximately 520,000 heroin addicts, it isclear that the statistical probability of arrest for possessionwas and is quite low. This low probability of arrest vitiates inlarge part whatever deterrent value laws against drug possessionand use may have. In addition to increasing the likelihood of arrest for drugpossession, punishment for those convicted of such offenses canbe more effective. Drug users are not "victims" whobear no responsibility for their actions. Imprisonment forrecidivists provides both deterrent value and an opportunity tobreak the cycle of drug use. Uniform and rational sentencing fordrug offenses is essential. Such a system should provide asentence of probation and a fine for a first offense involvingpossession of drugs. The terms of probation should include arequirement to remain drug-free, to be verified through periodicdrug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs shouldresult in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment, if appropriate,or fines or all three. The results of random drug screeningshould be used in considering parole in cases of both drugpossession and trafficking. Society's commitment to the unacceptability of illicit druguse is properly expressed in vigorous enforcement of the lawsregarding possession of drugs and sentencing of recidivist usersto jail terms and mandatory treatment. Such a national commitmentis in conflict with various States' relaxation of criminalpenalties for the possession of marijuana. Because such measureswere based on limited information and popular misinformationabout the effects of marijuana, it is appropriate for thoseStates that reduced these penalties during the 1970's toreconsider these laws. This reconsideration is warranted,especially in light of a Federal campaign against marijuanasmuggling and the considerable evidence that a substantial shareof marijuana trafficking is dominated by organized crime groups,which are both ruthless and involved in smuggling other drugs. Inaddition, the sale of drug paraphernalia undermines this Nation'santi-drug efforts. States that have not already done so shouldenact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of drugparaphernalia. Reducing demand and increased enforcement of drug possessionlaws will undoubtedly place a greater burden on our courts andwill generate the need for more jail cells and treatmentfacilities. The accompanying increase in expenditures, however,could be met in part with funding extracted from the illicit drugindustry itself. All 50 States currently authorize forfeiture ofassets in connection with drug trafficking and manufacturing,making available millions of dollars in cash and property eachyear to State governments. The Private Sector: Attitudes and Actions The hostess who is certain enough of her own unwillingness totolerate pot smoking in her home doesn't need to call the cops tokeep her guests from lighting up. "Great scent. Lousy name." - Advertising Age, atrade journal commenting on "Opium," a popular perfumemarketed by Charles of the Ritz, a subsidiary of SquibbPharmaceuticals. Drug abuse is fundamentally a social problem, which cannot besolved by the government alone. Federal and State governments cansupport drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, conductresearch, enforce drug laws and provide leadership in the fightagainst drug abuse and drug trafficking. However, not untilpublic and individual attitudes change will illicit drugs and theorganized criminal groups that traffic in them be eliminated.Individuals need not accept drug use in their midst. There is no"right" to use drugs. Government efforts to combat drugtrafficking and drug abuse are a vital effort, but they areultimately only a holding action, while consensus continues tobuild among individuals concerning the utter unacceptability ofdrug use. Despite this growing consensus, a profound disparity existsbetween principle and practice. Popular entertainment aridadvertising, sometimes subtle, sometimes not, regularly reflectsand even promotes the view that the use of illicit drugs isglamorous, exciting, and sophisticated, or at least harmless andamusing. The illusion that drug use is glamorous is regularly, ifsomewhat indirectly, reinforced by revelations that drug use iscommonplace among celebrities in the sports and entertainmentworlds. In August 1985, for example, the New York Times reportedcocaine's alleged use by players on virtually every team in themajor leagues, prompting the Commissioner of Baseball to declaredrug use the "number one" problem facing the game. It is even possible to find purportedly responsible groupsurging not only recognition but acceptance of drug use as afeature of daily life. An article in the January/February 1984issue of Social Work, the journal of the National Association ofSocial Workers, prescribes the following for adolescent marijuanause: Use should be moderate . . no more than four to five jointsper week seem advisable. Such acceptance of drug use may be shared by many who resignthemselves to the fact that drug abuse is inevitable. Such a viewreflects a failure of will on the part of the American public.American society may view drug use in the abstract as wrong, andmany People agree that heroin addicts who commit additionalcrimes to support their drug habits should be jailed. However,many people react with ambivalence to the drug use in theirmidst. Even while the United States government spends almost abillion and one-half dollars on drug law enforcement, threatensto cut off foreign aid to drug producing countries, andextradites and imprisons foreign nationals on traffickingcharges, we appear to lack the same degree of resolve to holdthis country's drug users, as well as those who directly orindirectly promote drug use, accountable for their actions andthe consequences thereof. While attitudes are ultimately an individual matter, actionsneed not be. It is in combination with others that privatecitizens have been most effective in combatting drug abuse. Asdiscussed earlier, athletes, entertainers, manufactures,advertisers and media can promote drug use by their individualexamples or by favorable portrayals of drug use. However, theseelements of society also have the power to shape different publicattitudes about drug use by presenting the truth about drugs. Themedia and entertainment industries should carefully review theirportrayals of drug use and its consequences and ensure theiraccuracy. Efforts to combat drug abuse can also be successful in theworkplace. Many businesses across the country have EmployeeAssistance Programs (EAPs), which seek to prevent drug abuse atthe worksite and which offer treatment and referrals. Inaddition, many businesses now test employees or prospectiveemployees for drug use. According to a survey of 100 Fortune 500companies, two-thirds refuse to hire job applicants who fail suchtests, 25 percent fire employees and 41 percent require treatmentfor employees who fail. Drug testing protects businesses, whichlose billions of dollars each year in reduced productivity as aresult of drug use, employees, and the public. Drug testing incertain "critical positions," such as in thetransportation industry, law enforcement, and education isparticularly important. In addition to efforts in the workplace to combat drug abuse,health professionals, such as physicians, nurses, psychologists,and social workers can help identify and treat drug users.However, currently formal training in the diagnosis and treatmentof drug abuse is limited. Health professionals should bethoroughly trained to identify and counsel drug abusers. Decisions to use or not to use drugs are ultimately derivedfrom values that are best inculcated and reinforced in families,churches, civic organizations, schools and local communities. Theefforts of organizations, which seek to help families preventdrug use, such as the National Federation of Parents forDrug-Free Youth, are essential to the fight against drug use anddrug trafficking. First Lady Nancy Reagan has made an importantcontribution to this effort to reduce the demand for drugs.Relying on the task force approach which law enforcementofficials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,civic organizations, and business associations should formcommunity task forces in every community across the country toprovide a unified front against drugs.

The ultimate goal of the Nation's drug policy is theeffective suppression of drug abuse in the United States. Whileefforts to reduce the supply of drugs in this country, such asinterdiction and source country crop controls, indirectly advancethis goal, efforts to reduce the demand for drugs can make a moredirect contribution. For this reason, the Nation's drug policymust emphasize more strongly efforts to reduce the demand fordrugs. 2. Because drug trafficking and abuse are the most seriousorganized crime problems in America today, they must be addressedat the highest levels of government. Therefore, the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board (Board), under the direction of theAttorney General, is and should continue to be responsible forthis country's drug policy. The mandate of the Board should beinterpreted, or expanded if necessary, to require the Board tocoordinate carefully efforts to reduce both drug demand andsupply to achieve this ultimate goal. The Board should evaluateall programs undertaken pursuant to the national drug strategy interms of their contribution to this goal. In recognition of thescope of the problem of international drug trafficking and theextended national effort needed to combat it, the AttorneyGeneral, as Chairman of the National Drug Enforcement PolicyBoard, should depart from the current formulation of a NationalStrategy on an annual basis, directing instead the formulation ofa long range national offensive against drug supply and demand,including long term funding proposals. Such a program shouldinclude an appropriate role for State and local agencies as acomplement to Federal efforts. State and local police agenciesshould be trained and equipped to perform such a role. 3. The rigorous pursuit of the Nation's drug policy, asproposed in this report, will not undermine its organized crimepolicy. Indeed, the goals of the two policies substantiallyoverlap and therefore both can and must be implementedsimultaneously and aggressively. 4. The cost of this Nation's anti-drug efforts can besubsidized to a great extent by the seizure and forfeiture ofdrug traffickers' assets. That portion of the Federalgovernment's asset forfeiture fund derived from drug cases shouldbe devoted exclusively to anti-drug programs. Such a fundingmechanism should be made permanent through law, and the currentceiling of $10 million should be eliminated. In the annualCongressional appropriations process, these funds should beallocated to participating agencies according to Congressionalfindings, just as if the funds were appropriated. 5. Because of the international dimensions of drugtrafficking, the United Nations, in performance of its leadershiprole in the international community, should sponsor the draftingand promotion of a model International Controlled Substances Act,identifying each and every drug which is trafficked to thedetriment of any single member nation. This model act should beaccompanied by a Model Mutual Legal Assistance and ExtraditionTreaty, embodying the recognition that international drugtrafficking is a matter of profound international concern. In thespirit of international cooperation, the Attorney General, asChairman of the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board, shoulddirect the creation of bilateral working groups, modeled on thepresent Italian-American Working Group. Interdiction 1. Within the overall structure of the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board (the Board), the Vice President's roleas leader and coordinator of interdiction efforts should berecognized, maintained, and strengthened. 2. A proper and realistic goal of our interdiction effortsshould be the maintenance of persistent pressure on drugtraffickers, both as a deterrent and as a symbol of nationaldetermination. Operational and policy decisions should reflectthat measure of su cess and specifically reject any lessrealistic or effective goal. 3. Both Congress and the Board should carefully evaluate thetechnical capabilities and equipment of drug smugglers. To theextent that law enforcement agencies' capabilities and equipmentare inferior to those of drug traffickers, immediate steps shouldbe taken to rectify the situation. 4. All Federal agencies having any responsibility for theregulation of air, sea, or land travel into or out of the UnitedStates should review their policies and practices and ensure thatno purpose other than the promotion of public safety is givenpriority over the effort to combat drug trafficking. To this end,the proposed "Customs Enforcement Act of 1985" shouldbe enacted promptly. 5. The Policy Board should carefully examine the regulatorypractices of the Federal Aviation Administration, particularly inthe field of aircraft modification, to determine whetherpossibilities exist for more aggressive anti-smuggling efforts.In addition, the Policy Board should carefully monitor the designof the Federal Aviation Administration's approach radar system toensure that interdiction capabilities and opportunities aremaximized. 6. Diplomatic initiatives should be pursued immediately tofacilitate Customs pursuit of suspected airborne drug traffickersinto Mexican air space. Such efforts should be given the highestpriority in our bilateral relations with Mexico, including theWestern Hemisphere discussions agreed upon between the Presidentsof the United States and Mexico on January 3, 1986. 7. The Policy Board should thoroughly evaluate expanded use ofCoast Guard aviation capabilities in drug interdiction. 8. Congress should give careful consideration to user fees asa means of supplementing the Coast Guard's budget. Fees should godirectly to the Coast Guard's budget rather than the generalTreasury. 9. Both the Policy Board and the Department of Defense shouldcontinue to examine Navy assistance to Coast Guard interdictionoperations, with a view to expanding such assistance whenever andwherever possible. Such expansion should be facilitated byadoption of the broader military view of national securityadvocated in this report. 10. Monies from the proposed permanent asset forfeiture fundshould be made available to the Customs Service for theacquisition of necessary equipment, including but not limited tothe type of fast patrol boats recently deployed in Operation BlueLightning. 11. Joint Federal-State-local interdiction operations, such asOperation Blue Lightning, should be refined and used whereverfeasible and desirable. Intelligence 1. The Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensurethat data concerning all aspects of both drug supply and demandare adequately collected, analyzed, correlated and disseminated. 2. The Federal electronic surveillance statute should beexamined and amended to reflect existing technology. ExistingState laws should be similarly studied and changed wherenecessary. Those States still without a statute permittingcourt-ordered electronic surveillance should immediately enactone, consistent with current technology. 3. The "Mansfield Amendment" to the ForeignAssistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291 (c)(l)) should be repealedin its entirety. The concerns addressed by that legislationshould be incorporated in agency guidelines which providenecessary flexibility while embodying the limits of permissibleU.S. agency conduct. 4. Data relating to assets forfeited to Federal, State andlocal jurisdictions should be collected, analyzed, anddisseminated by the all source intelligence center discussedelsewhere in this report. 5. Because of the importance of information about individualsin drug treatment programs, the Federal government should againrequire the States to participate in the Client Oriented DataAcquisition Process. 6. Both the Household Survey on Drug Abuse and the High SchoolSenior Survey should over sample populations thought to be heavydrug users. In addition, because questions about the nature ofdrug transactions, e.g., the price paid and purity and quantityof the drug purchased, could provide important information forpolicy makers and enforcement officials, such questions should beadded to the Household and High School Senior Surveys. Combined Intelligence and Interdiction 1. The Policy Board should take immediate steps to ensure thatthe law enforcement and intelligence communities are thoroughlyfamiliar with each other's needs and capabilities. 2. Every agency involved in the interdict ion of drugshipments or the apprehension of drug traffickers should haveready access to all necessary intelligence gathered in source andtransshipment countries. To the extent that this requiresexpansion or modification of existing practices, the Policy Boardshould ensure that such change is pursued immediately. Inparticular, the critical nature of real-time intelligence toeffective Customs operations at the border must be recognized,and the Policy Board should take all necessary steps to ensurethat, under current Federal organization, such information fromall sources is being provided. 3. To the extent that the intelligence community under thecurrent Federal structure needs direction from the highest levelsof government concerning aggressive anti-drug actions, includingoperations against the infrastructure of foreign drug-traffickingorganizations, such direction should be provided immediately. 4. The "all-source intelligence and operationscenter," now being considered by the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board, should be pursued aggressively andexpeditiously. It should combine in a physically secure facilitythe functions now being performed by EPIC and NNBIS, retainingthe current Vice Presidential direction and regional structure ofthe latter for interdiction functions. Ft. Bliss, Texas, andsimilar locations should be considered as possible sites for thecenter. Its design, giving due consideration to the protection ofcivil liberties, should provide specific roles for all pertinentDepartment of Defense components and for all members of theintelligence community, to the fullest extent Permitted byExecutive Order 12333, The design should also incorporatespecific foreign intelligence-gathering functions for other U.S.Agencies, in order to maximize the acquisition of both strategicand tactical data. Each Participating agency should be requiredto present to the Policy Board its specific operationalguidelines for providing time-sensitive data to the center. Thecenter should also Include a uniform national system forgathering and analyzing drug related data on various categoriesof information, including arrests, seizures, convictions,sentences, forfeitures, emergency room admissions, and deaths. Asimilar system of compiling and analyzing financial data gatheredby all members of the intelligence community, as well as thatcontained in all financial records now required by law to be keptby any Federal agency, should also be included as an Integralcomponent of the center. Both data bases should be compiled andmaintained in a fashion that provides reliable, constant, anduniform tracking, retrieval, and compilation for the purpose ofcharting trends and profiles, as well as support for specificoperations whenever Possible. Access to all data compiled shouldbe available to appropriate State and local agencies, in additionto Federal components, subject to Procedures necessary to ensurethe integrity of the information-sharing process. 5. Joint enforcement and intelligence operations by source andtransshipment countries should be encouraged, and careful,resourceful analysis should be given to identify means of U.S.funding of such operations. Consistent with other recommendationsin this report, participation in such operations by Americancomponents should be promoted. 6. The Department of State should stress to Chiefs of Missionat principal reporting posts and to all other cognizantDepartmental personnel the high priority attached to acoordinated narcotics intelligence and interdiction strategy. 7. All necessary steps should be taken to ensure that Consularofficers can and do deny U.S. entry visas to individualssuspected of drug trafficking. Subject to the informing agency'ssafeguards of reliability, information provided by any agency ofthe United States, without further corroboration, should besufficient to require such denial under the pertinent statute, 8U.S.C. Section 1182 (a)(23). The Policy Board should promptlyestablish guidelines for similar information-sharing on agovernment-wide basis. 8. Both Congress and the Executive Branch should closelyexamine the operations and cost effectiveness of drug-relatedintelligence-gathering abroad. When and where justified by suchan examination, resources available for such operations should beexpanded. Particular attention should be paid to the criticalneed for adequate foreign intelligence by the Customs Service inperforming its border interdiction function. 9. Coast Guard officers should be thoroughly integrated intothe Defense Attache system. 10. The definition of "national security" nowemployed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as their starting point inmission determination is: A collective term encompassing both national defense andforeign relations of the United States. Specifically, thecondition provided by: a. a military or defense advantage over any foreign nationalor group of nations, or b. a favorable foreign relations position, or c. a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostileor destructive action from within or without, overt or covert. The Joint Chiefs should be instructed by the highest levels ofgovernment, through a National Security Decision Directive or byother appropriate means, that "hostile or destructive actionfrom within or without, overt or covert," as used in thisdefinition, shall include the airborne, amphibious, and overlandinvasion of this country by drug smugglers. This policy isalready followed by the intelligence community, pursuant toExecutive Order 12333. All Department of Defense and componentoperational decisions concerning interdiction of drug smugglersshould be made accordingly. 11. For the purposes of intelligence-gathering missionplanning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be given directionfrom the highest levels of government that the DefenseDepartment's definition of "foreign hostile action" isto be brought into accord with the view expressed in ExecutiveOrder 12333, as described in the preceding recommendation. 12. Consistent with the foregoing definitions of"national security" and "foreign hostileaction," Department of Defense policies and practices, suchas existing interpretations of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. Section1535, and exemptions to the Posse Comitatus Act, 10 U.S.C.Section 371 et al., should be thoroughly re-examined. Unitplanning and deployment should be adjusted accordingly. 13. The Posse Comitatus Act, IS U.S.C. Section 1385, and its1981 exemptions, now found at 10 U.S.C. Section 371 et seq,should be consolidated in Title 18. The consolidated statuteshould include a statement of purpose reflecting the view ofnational security advocated here and promoting an accordinglyexpansive interpretation of the statutory language, subject tosuch limitations as are necessary to protect civil liberties. 14. The Policy Board, in accordance with Executive Orders12333 and 12472, and with applicable National Security DecisionDirectives, if any, should coordinate with appropriate agenciesand departments to ensure that a secure and interoperable,interagency communications capability is available fordrug-related intelligence collection and dissemination in supportof interdiction and other anti-drug activities. The resources andexpertise of the National Security Agency should be fullyexploited to this end, and operational and communicationssecurity should be given a high priority in the training andoperating procedures of all pertinent agencies. Domestic Investigations and Prosecutions 1. Domestic drug law enforcement efforts directed athigh-level trafficking groups should be supplemented by andintegrated with enforcement efforts directed at lower-leveltrafficking groups and street-level drug activity. Unless thenecessary supplementation and integration occur, the enforcementeffort at all levels will be undermined. 2. Although the enforcement efforts of Federal and State andlocal law enforcement agencies cannot and should not becompletely independent, these agencies nevertheless have primaryareas of responsibility. The Federal law enforcement agenciesshould concentrate their efforts on infiltrating and disruptinghigh-level organized crime and other large traffickingorganizations. State and local law enforcement agencies on theother hand should focus their resources on street-level drugactivity and on smaller and geographically-restricted traffickingorganizations. 3. Although Federal, State and local agencies have primaryareas of responsibility, the drug problem is a national one thatrequires extensive and genuine coordination and cooperation amongall agencies. Those in charge of the agencies involved indomestic drug law enforcement must constantly instill In theiragents the need for such coordination and cooperation, especiallywith respect to the exchange of drug intelligence. Jointoperations, such as Operation Pressure Point, the New York DrugEnforcement Task Force, and the Organized Crime Drug EnforcementTask Force Program, have fostered this required spirit ofcooperation and coordination, and they should be undertakenwhenever appropriate, provided that they do not interfere with anagency's primary mission. 4. The sophistication of high-level trafficking groupsrequires an equivalent Federal response. Because of the varietyof investigative techniques used by participating Federalagencies and their unique ability to exploit such tools aselectronic surveillance, the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (RICO), the Continuing Criminal Enterprisestatutory provision (CCE), forfeiture, and currency transactionsreports, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)Program is the Federal mechanism that is best equipped to respondto and disrupt high-level organized crime trafficking groups. Itsoperation should be supported strongly and its scope should beexpanded wherever feasible and desirable. 5. Because the OCDETF Program has been operational for morethan two years, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board shouldconsider whether a lead Task Force agency should be designated.As an alternative, the U.S. attorneys Involved should be givengreater policy authority with respect to the participatingagencies In order to improve still further the coordination thathas been achieved by the consensus-based decision-makingapproach. If the latter approach is taken, the Board must takesteps to ensure uniform policies and priorities are recognized byall United States Attorneys involved. 6. The heads of the agencies participating in the OCDETFProgram must continually and unambiguously reiterate their totalcommitment to the success of the program. One simple way they cando so is to ensure that their agents involved in the Program arenot affected adversely in any way with respect to careeradvancement by their participation therein. 7. The components of Federal domestic law enforcement otherthan the OCDE Task Forces should focus their resources onorganized crime trafficking groups that do not qualify for OCDETFprogram treatment and on other large trafficking organizations,which may or may not be multi-jurisdictional. 8. To eliminate jurisdictional disputes between the Federalagencies involved in domestic law enforcement, to avoidduplication of investigative efforts, and to increase the safetyof drug agents, the National Drug Enforcement Policy Board shouldestablish a system whereby agencies would be required to filereports on whom they are investigating. If more than one agencyis investigating the same individual, the agencies involved wouldbe required to negotiate and to determine the best way forproceeding with the investigation, subject to uniform PolicyBoard guidelines. Such a reporting and control system should beincorporated into the "all source intelligence andoperations center" recommended elsewhere in this report. 9. It is an appropriate time to consider whether the missionof the Customs Service with respect to drug trafficking should beexpanded to include intelligence and law enforcement functionsbeyond the borders and ports of entry within this country, whereappropriate, subject to the lead responsibility of the DrugEnforcement Administration (DEA). 10. DEA should determine which chemicals currently used tomanufacture illicit drugs should be subject to reportingrequirements or placed in a Schedule established by theControlled Substances Act. This review should include aconsideration of which drugs are most abused, which have the mostserious consequences, which precursor chemicals are essential tothe production process, and which chemicals could feasibly beregulated. In addition, DEA should identify the resources neededfor the computerization, analysis, and follow-up of reportsconcerning chemicals selected for monitoring. 11. The research and development operations of Federal druglaw enforcement agencies should work closely with their fieldagents to produce the equipment and tools necessary to defeattraffickers. The expertise of the Central Intelligence andNational Security Agencies should be called upon to the fullestextent possible and proper in this regard. 12. Although the drug problem is a national one, its immediateeffects are felt most at State and local levels. To respondeffectively to the drug problem, State and local jurisdictionswill have to increase expenditures for such critical resources asprison facilities, increased manpower, and sophisticatedequipment. 13. States must provide their law enforcement agencies withcertain tools available to their Federal counterparts. ThoseStates, which do not already have such statutes, should considerenacting legislation patterned after the following Federalstatutes: Bail Reform Act of 1984; the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations (RICO) Act; statutory use and derivativeuse immunity for witnesses; statutory criminal and civilforfeiture provisions; the Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE)statute; Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe StreetsAct of 1968 (electronic surveillance); and the Currency andForeign Transactions Reporting Act. States should consideradopting statewide grand juries in order to improve theirinvestigations of drug trafficking organizations, as well aseliminating accomplice corroboration statutes or rules. Foreign Assistance 1. Because drug trafficking and production are threats of suchmagnitude to the stability of existing democracies, a primarygoal of the United States and its allies should be to enhance thesecurity of drug producing and transshipment regions. 2. As a part of its international responsibilities, theNational Drug Enforcement Policy Board should participate in thePresident's annual decision whether to suspend aid to drugproducing or transshipment countries. The Board should examinethe drug control efforts made by each foreign nation and make asuitable recommendation to the President for his ultimatedecision. 3. The willingness of a country to engage in and activelyimplement drug-related extradition and mutual assistance treatiesshould be a primary consideration in the ultimate U.S. policydecision regarding foreign assistance to that country. 4. The Departments of State and Defense should continue theirprograms of economic and security assistance with emphasis onassisting those foreign governments making concerted efforts tocontrol their drug problems. 5. The United States should continue to help producer andtrafficking nations develop prevention and education programsaimed at drug abuse within these countries. Source Country Crop Control 1. In light of restrictions inherent in international cropcontrol efforts, the Board should initiate a thoroughcost/benefit analysis of the entire history of those efforts bythe United States. If justified by such an analysis, theDepartment of State, through its Bureau of InternationalNarcotics Matters (BINM), should initiate or intensify cropcontrol and plant eradication programs selectively andjudiciously in those countries where the political and economicclimates make it probable that crop eradication programs willsucceed. 2. The Department of State should establish and present to thePolicy Board a specific formula for triggering the cut-off offoreign aid provided for in the "Diplomacy AgainstDrugs" amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. 3. Narcotics Assistance Unit positions must be recognized bythe State Department as priority Foreign Service assignments. TheState Department should establish a select group of professionalNarcotics Officers to fill those positions, and should ensurethat those positions are fully integrated into the careeradvancement structure within the Foreign Service. 4. BINM should expand the range of possibilities underconsideration as alternatives to illicit drug cultivation forsource country farmers and include such options as mining,petroleum production, and light industry, where feasible. Reducing Demand for Drugs 1. A thorough review of the current budgetary allotments foranti-drug efforts, now contemplated by the National DrugEnforcement Policy Board, should be placed at the top of theagenda of the Board immediately. If that review indicates thatgreater Federal resources should be devoted to programs to reducedemand, the Board should pursue appropriate action withouthesitation. 2. A portion of the Federal government's asset forfeiturefund, derived from drug cases, should be devoted to programs toreduce demand in whatever proportion is indicated by the reviewrecommended above. Funding to reduce demand should include aresponsible contribution to the States for their own programs inthis area. However, any funding directed to the States should bemade contingent upon their vigorous pursuit of such programs, andafter a reasonable grace period, as determined by the Board or byCongress, funding should be denied to any State failing thisrequirement. Failure to enact State electronic surveillancemeasures and asset forfeiture provisions, with the proceedsthereof directed to anti-drug programs, should constitute per sefailure. 3. The President should direct the heads of all Federalagencies to formulate immediately clear policy statements, withimplementing guidelines, including suitable drug testingprograms, expressing the utter unacceptability of drug abuse byFederal employees. State and local governments and leaders in theprivate sector should support unequivocally a similar policy thatany and all use of drugs is unacceptable. Government contractsshould not be awarded to companies that fail to implement drugprograms, Including suitable drug testing. No Federal, State, orlocal government funds should go directly or indirectly toprograms that counsel "responsible" drug use or condoneillicit drug use in any way. Laws in certain States which"decriminalized" the possession of marijuana constitutea form of such condonation, and should be reconsidered. 4. States that have not already done so should enact andenforce laws prohibiting the sale of drug paraphernalia. 5. The States should be required to report information abouttheir prevention and treatment programs to the National Instituteon Drug Abuse. With this information, and reports obtained fromprivate programs, NIDA will be better able to identify the bestprevention and treatment programs and to develop and disseminatestandards and guidelines for such programs to the States. TheStates should, in turn, provide this information to all groupsengaged in prevention, treatment, and related research. 6. Consistent with identified measures of success, Stategovernments should establish credentialing standards forprevention and treatment programs. They should further requirethat all elementary, junior high, and high schools within theState Include drug abuse prevention programs in their curricula,designed in a manner consistent with such credentialingstandards. State funding should be made available to assure theproper training of educators assigned to such programs. 7. Every employer, public and private, and public educationinstitutions at all levels should have clearly-stated policiesprohibiting drug use, possession of drugs, or being under theinfluence of drugs on their premises. The consequences ofviolating these prohibitions should be clearly explained. 8. Government and private sector employers who do not alreadyrequire drug testing of job applicants and current employeesshould consider the appropriateness of such a testing program. 9. State and local law enforcement authorities should enforcemore vigorously the laws prohibiting possession of drugs, andState legislatures should ensure that enforcement agencies havethe necessary resources to do so. Such resources can be funded inlarge part, if not entirely, through effective asset forfeitureprograms. 10. Uniform and rational sentencing for drug offenses isessential. Such a system should provide a sentence of probationand a fine for a first offense involving mere possession ofdrugs. The terms of probation should include a requirement toremain drug-free to be verified, if necessary, through periodicdrug testing. A second offense for possession of drugs shouldresult in a jail sentence or mandatory treatment or fines or allthree. 11. The media and entertainment industries should carefullyreview their portrayals of drug use and its consequences andensure their accuracy. 12. Health professionals should be thoroughly trained toidentify and counsel drug abusers. 13. Relying on the task force approach which law enforcementofficials have used successfully, parents, churches, schools,civic organizations and business associations should formcommunity task forces to provide a unified front against drugs. Conclusion The recommendations made here have not been reachedcarelessly. They are the result of months of concerted researchand analysis, documented in the body of the report. Although somerecommendations reach to the most fundamental levels ofgovernment agency operation and community life, they have beenpresented only after consideration of every identifiable option. The depth of concern expressed in this report is not theresult of any preordained strategy. Rather, it reflects thisCommission's recognition, based on objective evidence, that weare confronted with a national crisis. Every course of action,including a failure to act at all, has a natural consequence. Therecommendations made here are those actions deemed most effectivein promoting a national campaign against drugs at all levels ofsociety.

Kennedy School of Government of HarvardUniversity, Senior Lecturer in Political Science at theUniversity of Rochester, and President of BOTEC AnalysisCorporation. Executive Summary Organized crime control and drug enforcement need to beconsidered together insofar as drug trafficking contributes tothe organized crime problem or organized crime contributes to thedrug problem. In making policy it would be useful to know about(1) the role of drug trafficking in supporting organized crimegroups; (2) the role of organized crime groups in supplyingdrugs; and (3) the effects on each problem of changingenforcement practices in the other. Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source ofillegally-earned income in the United States. Both "traditionally" organized crime groups (Mafiafamilies) and "emerging" organized crime groupsparticipate in some aspects of the illicit drug traffickingindustry. In addition, some drug trafficking organizations havesome of the characteristics of organized crime groups, such asthe capacity and reputation for the use of violence andcorruption to frustrate enforcement. Organized crime can participate in drug markets either"productively," using its lawbreaking skills tocontribute to the supply of illicit drugs, or"parasitically," using violence and the threat ofviolence to extort drug merchants or organize cartels. Only theproductive activity of organized crime contributes to the drugsupply problem, which is the main target of drug enforcement.Parasitic organized crime activity, in illicit markets as inlegitimate markets, tends to raise prices and reduce consumption. Controlling organized crime and controlling drug abuse (anddrug-abuse-related crime) are two distinct objectives. Someagencies of government - the Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), forexample - have primary responsibility for drug abuse control.Others, like the Organized Crime Strike Forces, are concernedprimarily with organized crime control. The two sets of agenciesmay or may not promote each other's objectives. Drug enforcement actions may affect the drug markets inseveral ways. They may: (1) help or hurt the efforts of organizedcrime to participate in and profit from drug dealing; (2)encourage or retard the development of organized-crime-likecharacteristics among drug trafficking groups; and (3) lead tomore or fewer convictions of organized criminals. Unless it isdeliberately focused on organized crime groups, high-level drugenforcement may tend to foster organized crime by keeping priceshigh and driving out less well-organized competitors. Organized crime enforcement actions may make the task of drugenforcement harder or easier, depending on whether the roles ofthose groups in the drug markets are primarily parasitic orprimarily productive. Aside from heroin importation into NewYork, traditional organized crime is largely a parasite on thedrug markets; thus, as long as the organized crime effortconcentrates on the Mafia, it has little to contribute to drugsupply reduction. Data about drug trafficking and drug enforcement, and aboutthe relationships between the drug trade and organized crime, canserve three purposes: describing the current dimensions of theproblem, reasoning about how changes in enforcement activitymight make matters better or worse, and measuring the actualeffects of such changes after they are made. From the perspective of organized crime policy, essentialfacts about the drug markets are prices and quantities, and, mostimportant, the relationship between changes in retail price andchanges in the quantity purchased: the price-elasticity ofdemand. Driving up the price of an inelastically-demanded drugwill increase the total revenues of traffickers of that drug, andthus tend to promote organized crime. Data about the drug markets and drug enforcement come fromthree sources: (1) survey research; (2) observations of theconsequences of drug abuse (deaths, injuries, and demand fortreatment); and (3) enforcement statistics and reports. Current large survey efforts, among households and high-schoolseniors, do not gather much price and quantity data. We need aseparate national survey with a sample designed to overrepresentheavy drug-users, that ask very detailed questions about price,quantity, and conditions of drug purchase. In addition, local andregional surveys should be conducted to evaluate the effect ofenforcement initiatives on market conditions and drugconsumption. Two techniques not now in use - "panel" surveys ofdrug users and surveys of convicted dealers - should beundertaken, if the difficult operational and ethical issues canbe resolved. Neither abuse-consequence data now gathered (medical examinerand emergency-room reports through the Drug Abuse Warning Network(DAWN), drug abuse treatment data through the remnants of theClient-Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP), opinions oftreatment professionals through the Community Epidemiology WorkGroup (CEWG)) nor alternative ways of reaching the same facts arevery useful in making organized crime/drug enforcement policychoices. These programs serve other purposes and should not bedisturbed, except for adding bioassay capability to some DAWNsites. Pilot programs to test jail admittees for heroin use areworth pursuing. More could be done with enforcement agency data, which couldtell us about the enforcement effort itself (agency activities,targets, measured results) and on its effects (prices atdifferent levels of the drug trade). The new management of theDrug Enforcement Administration has put less effort intoestimating prices and quantities in the drug markets. That changeshould be reversed, and DEA should again publish price-chainestimates. Enforcement agencies can also make and analyze retail-leveldrug purchases, unrelated to specific cases, to measure the stateof the drug markets. Such "monitor" programs should beincreased in frequency, systematized, and applied to marijuanaand cocaine as well as heroin. Recent revisions in the methods used by the National NarcoticsIntelligence Consumers Committee (NNICC) in preparing the annualNarcotics Intelligence Estimate (NIE) appear to have somewhatreduced that document's inconsistencies with observable fact.However, the NNICC still seems to practice analysis bynegotiation rather than basing its estimates on evidence. The NIEwould be more useful if its assumptions, data, and computationswere explicit. There might be value in allowing a group ofexperts outside the government access to NNICC documents andsources, from which they could develop an independent set ofestimates. Questions to be Answered: Drug trafficking and organized crime are linked problems.Policy making and evaluation for each is complicated by thepresence of the other. My objective is to outline a set of datacollection and analysis activities that would answer questionsunder four headings: 1. What effects do organized crime have on drug traffickingand enforcement? 2. What effects do drug trafficking and enforcement have onorganized crime? 3. How should federal agencies engaged in organized crimeenforcement adjust their policies to contribute to the objectivesof drug policy? 4. How should federal agencies engaged in drug enforcementadjust their policies to contribute to the objective of organizedcrime control? Data collection and analysis are never free; in the drug area,they are likely to be quite expensive. It is therefore importantto identify in advance what is relatively certain on the basis ofinformation and analysis now in hand; it doesn't take aspectroscopic analysis to discover that the sky is blue. Thefollowing section will therefore attempt to describe what we nowknow and to identify the key analytic points. Introduction: Drug Enforcement and Organized Crime Control How Two Objectives and Two Sets of Institutions Intersect The objective of drug enforcement is to keep drugs away fromconsumers. The objective of organized crime enforcement is tocontrol the wealth and power of major criminal organizations andto frustrate their goal of being able to defy the law. These objectives interact where the illicit drug business is amajor source of power or revenue to organized crime groups (or amajor source of their vulnerability to enforcement), and wherethe capabilities of organized crime groups make drugs moreavailable than they would otherwise be: in other words, where thedrug trade contributes to the organized crime problem or whereorganized crime contributes to the drug problem. Defining Organized Crime The term organized crime can be used in one of two ways. Itmay be merely an ethnically neutral euphemism for "theMafia" or "La Cosa Nostra" (LCN); or it maydescribe a class of criminal organizations whose characteristicsmake them particularly worthy of law enforcement attention. Size,wealth, political power, participation in a variety of criminalactivities, and continuity over time have all been suggested assuch characteristics. One way to bridge the gap between the two definitionalapproaches is to refer to the Mafia as "traditional"organized crime, while acknowledging the existence of other,"emerging," organized crime groups. Defining organized crime in terms of its characteristics,rather than ostensibly, complicates the analysis. Not only doesthis approach treat the set of "organized crime" groupsas variable rather than fixed; it also implies a many-valuedrather than two-valued classification. Criminal groups, ratherthan simply being organized crime or non-organized crime (i.e.,Mafia families or other), will fall along a spectrum of beingmore or less "organized-crime-like." This suggests thepossibility that drug enforcement activity can increase ordecrease the number of drug-dealing organizations with manyorganized crime characteristics. It also suggests that it canmake existing organized-crime-like drug dealers more or lessorganized-crime-like and give such groups a greater or lessershare of the drug market. This paper will attempt to distinguish between traditional andemerging organized crime groups, but will think of organizedcrime as primarily a set of organizational characteristics ratherthan a predefined set of organizations. The relevantcharacteristics are organizational continuity and organizationalinvestment in the capability and reputation for violent orcorrupt interference with law enforcement activity. Organized Crime as a Drug Supply Problem "Traditional" organized crime - La Cosa Nostra -does not now contribute substantially to the drug problem, withthe exception of the major roles of two of the five New York LCN"families" in heroin importation. This is not to saythat LCN members and associates do not participate in drugdealing on many levels, but only that they make no distinctivecontribution to the supply of illicit drugs. Indeed, as ThomasSchelling has pointed out, the activity of organized crime incartel formation and extortion from illicit entrepreneurs may onbalance reduce the supply and increase the price of illicitgoods, as is true in licit markets. As a consequence, organized crime enforcement institutions -the Strike Forces and the investigators who work with them - haverelatively little to contribute to solving the problem of illicitdrug supply, as long as they continue their concentration on"traditional" organized crime groups. Thisconcentration has been so successful, both in terms of successfulcases and in terms of creating and maintaining productive,high-morale enforcement and prosecution institutions, that itseems both unlikely (as a matter of prediction) to be changed andunwise (as a matter of policy analysis) to consider changing. It may be the case that some "emerging" organizedcrime groups make distinctive contributions to various parts ofdrug supply, so that their disruption would contribute to drugsupply control (over and above the general effect of enforcementin raising prices by raising the costs and risks of drugtrafficking). Outlaw motorcycle gangs - the Hell's Angels in theWest, the Outlaws in the Mid-Atlantic region - may be"least-cost suppliers" in the distribution of cocaine,amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). Similarly, someethnic-based organizations among Asian-Americans may besignificant contributors to the heroin supply, as the Herreraorganization certainly was at least until the recent arrests. Bycontrast, neither the importation nor the distribution ofmarijuana appears to offer the economies of organization thatwould make breaking up particular trafficking groups a majormarijuana enforcement objective. The marijuana trade may be atits most efficient as a decentralized set of independent buyersand sellers. To develop a set of institutions to appropriately address therole of emerging organized crime groups in the drug markets willrequire devising organizational incentives and career patternsthat support extremely long-term investigations and investmentsin intelligence (broadly defined), while maintaining asupply-control orientation among agents and prosecutors. Thiswill not be an easy task. There may be lessons to be learned fromthe Federal Bureau of Narcotics in its approach to LCN heroindealing. The Drug Markets as an Organized Crime Problem The illicit drug traffic contributes to the organized crimeproblem because of the enormous amounts of money at stake. Thesepotential revenues will both attract (and help to sustain)existing organized crime groups and call into existence newgroups with organized crime characteristics. LCN families, other ethnically-based organizations long inexistence, and outlaw motorcycle gangs may engage in drug dealingas a way to support themselves financially and to take advantageof their organizational abilities in illicit transactions. Theopportunities in the drug trade may also allow the development oforganizations whose origin is in drug dealing, and which mayremain specialized in drug dealing, while taking on organizedcrime characteristics, in particular, organizational continuityand organizational investments in the abilities to use violenceand corruption to resist enforcement efforts while remainingprominent in illicit markets. Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source ofillegally-earned income in the United States, far outstrippingthe market for illegal gambling or prostitution. Estimates oftotal revenues from drug sales vary widely and are highlyunreliable. It seems unlikely that total annual revenues are muchless than $25-30 billion. Virtually all of this represents rewards for lawbreaking; thepayments forlicit goods and services (rental or purchase ofvehicles and buildings; lawyers' fees) are negligible. On theother hand, relatively little represents revenue to largecriminal organizations, because so much of the final retail priceof illegal drugs consists of the markups of retail dealers andlow-level wholesalers. For heroin and cocaine less than one-tenthof the final retail price is collected by the dealer who sellskilogram units. Marijuana, by contrast, with much less vigorousenforcement at lower levels, undergoes only about a four-to-oneprice markup between first domestic distribution and final retailsale. Therefore, while all three markets have total values on theorder of $10 billion per year, more than $2 billion of themarijuana market represents the revenues of high-levelorganizations, while the heroin and cocaine markets at that levelrepresent about $1 billion each. On the other hand, the tighterdistribution channels for heroin and cocaine make it possible forlarge and highly disciplined organizations to exist at thewholesale-retail level, so that organizations with many of thecharacteristics of organized crime may exist at lower levels ofthose trades (e.g., the Barnes organization in the Harlem heroinmarket). Making Strategy Drug enforcement actions change the drug markets in ways thatmay: (1) help or hurt the efforts of existing organized crimeenterprises, whether traditional or emerging, to participate inand profit from them; (2) encourage or retard the development oforganized crime characteristics in existing or new enterpriseswithin the drug markets; (3) be more or less helpful in securingconvictions against members of already-identified organized crimegroups and the identification of new groups meeting thosecriteria. The more effectively drug enforcement is directed towardorganized crime control, the less hospitable organized crimegroups will find the drug markets. On the other hand, an increasein the overall level of drug enforcement not aimed specificallyat organized crime groups may tend to frustrate organized crimecontrol by helping existing organized crime groups profit fromthe drug trade and by encouraging existing drug enterprises totake on more organized crime characteristics. The ability of organized crime groups to profit from the drugtrade - and the tendency of the drug trade to spawn new organizedcrime groups - depends both on the amount of money to be made inthat trade and on whether the environment rewards or punishestight control and a reputation for violence. Under someconditions, tightened enforcement can both boost the total moneyavailable to be made and confer competitive advantage on moreviolent groups at the expense of less violent ones. Tighter enforcement can increase the money to be made in anyblack market, if it succeeds in raising the price of thecommodity involved and if consumption decreases less, inpercentage terms, than prices rise. (A 50 percent price increasethat causes only a 20 percent decrease in volume will create anew market with total revenues 1.5 x 0.8 = 1.2 times as large asthe revenues in the old market, and thus increase the money to bemade by 0.2 or 20 percent.) Thus the sensitivity of consumerdemand to retail price - what economists call theprice-elasticity of demand - becomes an essential number to know. If the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)greater than one - if a given percentage increase in price willcause a larger percentage decrease in volume - then priceincreases will decrease total revenues. (Such goods are said tobe "relatively elastically demanded.") On the otherhand, if the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)less than one - if a given percentage change in price will causea smaller percentage change in volume, as in the example above -then price increases will increase total revenues. (Such goodsare said to be "relatively inelastically demanded.") In markets where demand is relatively elastic - whereconsumers will respond to price increases by cutting backconsumption sharply - increased enforcement will reduce the moneyat stake and thus tend to make the markets less lucrative fororganized crime. Where demand is inelastic, increasingenforcement will increase the money at stake and thus make themarkets more able to support organized crime. Much of theempirical work recommended below centers on measuring theprice-elasticity of demand for various drugs. Unfortunately, it appears that the demand for marijuana andcocaine is relatively inelastic. (The argument with respect tomarijuana is on much firmer ground than the argument with respectto cocaine.) In any case, tightened general drug enforcement - asopposed to drug enforcement targeted at organized crime - willtend to give organized crime groups and organized crime-likegroups relative competitive advantage, because their capacity forviolence and corruption helps protect then against ordinaryenforcement actions. This is the central tension in organizedcrime/drug enforcement policy: good drug enforcement may be badorganized crime control. Observations to be Made The observations to be made fall into three broad classes:retail purchasing and consumption, lower-level dealing, andenforcement activity. (Of course, observations on high-leveldealing are also of great importance, but they are almostimpossible to distinguish from enforcement intelligence. Datacollection here means talking to agents, enforcement-agencyanalysts, and prosecutors, and the information to be collected israrely in quantitative form.) Three Objectives of Data Collection and Analysis Data collection and analysis about drug markets can servethree distinct functions: - Descriptive: measuring the current dimensions of the problemand identifying trends. Sample questions: How much cocaine wassold to end users last year? What prices do they pay? How werethose revenues distributed among individuals and groups in theillicit cocaine industry? What were the relationships betweenidentified organized crime groups and cocaine trafficking? Howhave the volumes and prices in the cocaine market changed overtime? What organized crime groups are active in the cocainemarket? What role does it play in their other activities? Whatroles do they play - productive or parasitic - in the market? - Theoretical: generating and testing hypotheses aboutrelationships among variables, and in particular about the likelyeffects of changes in enforcement. Sample questions: Are there"barriers to entry" at some levels of the cocaine tradethat allow traffickers to collect "pure" profits("economic rents")? How would the average size andlongevity of cocaine-trafficking organizations change ifenforcement were substantially tightened? - Evaluative: measuring the actual effects of enforcementinitiatives. Sample question: How did the South Florida TaskForce change prices and volumes in the cocaine market? Three Sources of Data Illicit activities are by their nature hard to observe andmeasure, because participants attempt to conceal them fromauthorities. Excise tax data, which provide the most convenientmeasures of alcohol and tobacco consumption, are unavailable forillicit drug markets. The same is true of the reports routinelyprepared by licit enterprises reports to state and federal taxcollectors, to trade associations and government statisticalcollectors, to trade associations and government statisticalagencies, and to stockholders - from which estimates of licitmarkets are derived. The remaining potential sources of information about illicitdrug markets are: (1) Surveys of drug users and potential drug users; (2) Observations of the consequences of drug - abuse healtheffects, intoxicated behavior, and demand for treatment - and theopinions of professionals who deal with those consequences; and (3) Enforcement data and the opinions of agents andprosecutors. Note that while surveys and observations of consequences tellus almost exclusively about the behavior of drug consumers anddrug dealers, enforcement data and the opinions of enforcementprofessionals can also tell us about the other half of theequation: the governmental response. Several current programs now attempt to tap these threesources of information. None is without major flaws from theperspective of organized crime policy. A major problem common tomany is that they are more concerned with numbers of users andfrequency of use consumed than with quantities consumed and flowsof revenues. Survey Research Survey research is potentially the most powerful toolavailable for studying the markets for illicit drugs. Unlike datafrom enforcement activity or abuse consequences, survey researchcan attempt to measure prices and quantities directly rather thanthrough complicated chains of inference. Performing surveys aboutconsumption activities - market research supports a ratherprosperous industry, including both for-profit enterprises andprestigious universities and nonprofit research centers. Theseinstitutions have developed a repertoire of establishedtechniques. The fact that consumer-goods firms continue to use itheavily testifies to the ability of market research to measureand predict consumer behavior. The National Institute on Drug Abuse funds two series ofsurvey research projects on illicit drug consumption. The SocialResearch Group of George Washington University does a surveyevery two years of more than 5,000 persons 12 years or olderliving in households [Miller et al. 1983]. This series isreferred to among students of drug abuse as "the householdsurvey." Every year, the Institute of Social Research of the Universityof Michigan questions about 17,000 seniors in high school. TheMichigan reports are referred to as "the high-school seniorsurvey." These two surveys are believed to cost NIDAsomething less than one-half a million dollars for each two-yearcycle. The concept of survey research is simple. Draw a sample sodesigned that every member of the population under study has anequal probability of being chosen. (This is what statisticiansmean by the term "random sample." A variant on simplerandomization is to divide the population under study intosubgroups, called "strata," and to draw the sample sothat each stratum is represented in proportion to itsrepresentation in the population, and each member of a givenstratum has the same chance of being drawn as any other member.This procedure, called "stratified random sampling," isthe most commonly used.) Having drawn the sample, ask questionsand record the answers. Then use the percentage answers from thesample as estimates of the behavior of the population from whichthe sample was drawn: that is, make population projections basedon sample results. Surveys can be inaccurate for three reasons: random error,sample bias, and response bias. Random error (or "sampling error") occurs becausethe law of averages only works on average. If 30 percent of thepopulation uses Crest Toothpaste, then in a sample of 100 personsdrawn at random about 30 will say they use Crest. But theoperative word is "about:" one time it will be 28,another 33. The larger the sample, the smaller the randomsampling error, in accord with well-known statistical formulas.This does not depend on the size of the population to bemeasured: a sample of 1,000 is subject to the same sampling errorin estimating a population of 100,000 as in estimating apopulation of 10 million. The rule of thumb is that the samplingerror is inversely proportional to the square root of the samplesize: a sample four times as big gives estimates one half asuncertain. For many purposes - predicting the outcome of aPresidential election, for example - a sample size of a fewhundred is ample. The smaller the percentage of a population that has sometrait, the larger the sample needed to measure that traitaccurately, because a sampling error of 2 percent looms larger ifthe underlying figure is 5 percent than if it is 50 percent.Thus, attempts to measure rare phenomena - heroin use, forexample - take bigger samples than attempts to measure commonphenomena such as alcohol use. The other factor that drives upneeded sample sizes is the desire to study how subgroups of apopulation differ. In a study of the effect of income on cocaineuse, the relevant sample size is the number of respondents withineach income class. To study whether recent increases in marijuanaenforcement by the Boston DEA office succeeded in reducingmarijuana consumption, one would need a sample including at leasta few hundred marijuana consumers from New England, and a similarsample from another area to serve as a control. Other than the expensive expedient of using very large samplesizes - such as the 50,000 households interviewed each month bythe Bureau of Labor Statistics - the only way to reducesampling-error problems in estimating rare traits is to deviatefrom stratified random sampling. Areas under special study orsubpopulations among which the trait in question is less rare canbe deliberately overrepresented. For example, if cocaine use isconcentrated among upper-income urban males in the 20-45 agebracket, a study of cocaine use might deliberately seek out asample including more such people; this is called oversampling.The results of a survey using oversampling need to be adjusted toproject them back on the population. Those adjustments introducegreat complexity into the statistical analysis of survey data.Subtle errors can easily creep in. In consequence, surveyresearchers try to avoid using oversamples. Random error, just because it is random, does not tend to biasresults. The luck of the draw produces overestimates andunderestimates impartially. It does, however, introduceuncertainty. This is more of a problem when trying to measuretrends (where small changes from one survey to the next mattergreatly) than in measuring absolute levels. By contrast, bothsample bias and response bias can create systematic divergencesbetween survey results and actual phenomena. Sample bias comes from a failure to draw a representativesample. If the sampling technique makes persons with a giventrait under study more or less likely than average to beselected, the sample results will consistently overestimate orunderestimate the trait in question. For example, the householdsurvey omits persons with no fixed address and those living indormitories, barracks, and prisons. If very heavy drug users aremore likely than the general population to be drifting, away atschool, in the service, or in prison, then the household surveywill underestimate the number of very heavy drug users.Similarly, the high-school senior survey may underrepresent drugabuse among persons in that age range for two reasons. Bychoosing to study high-school seniors, it omits dropouts, who maybe more likely than average to be heavy drug users. In addition,the actual sampling technique may tend to underrepresent frequentabsentees, and frequent absenteeism seems to be associated withheavy drug use. If the only statistics of interest are population proportions(e.g., the proportion of the voters who think the President isdoing a good job), sample bias is a controllable problem. Whenfrequency or quantity is at issue (e.g., how frequently theaverage high-school senior smokes marijuana, how much cocaine wasconsumed last year, the total amount paid for heroin) sample biascan be a major worry. A small proportion of any population caneasily account for a very large fraction of any activity, frombaseball games attended to books purchased. In the case ofalcohol, for example, 5 percent of the population accounts for 50percent of the consumption. By one estimate, 10 percent of themarijuana-using population smokes two-thirds of the marijuana.Cocaine consumption may be even more skewed, with the additionalproblem that the total number of cocaine users is itself muchsmaller than the totals for marijuana and alcohol; two-thirds ormore of the cocaine consumption may be accounted for by one-halfa million users. Sampling procedures to guard against underrepresenting suchvery small populations are hard to devise, particularly when thebehavior under study tends to make them furtive or to reducetheir participation in various normal activities. Oversamplingcan help; so can what are called "snowball" techniques,where respondents who fit some profile are asked for the names ofother respondents. The illicit nature of drug abuse can make"snowball" sampling very difficult, however. Response bias comes from the systematic failure of respondentsto answer accurately. Any survey will gather some inaccurateresponses, due to misunderstanding the questions, lapses ofmemory, or deliberate deception by respondents resulting fromfear of breach of confidentiality, embarrassment, or a simpledesire to tell the interviewer what the respondent thinks he orshe wants to be told. As long as those errors cancel out, theypose no problem. The problem comes if the inaccuracies are tiltedto one side or the other. A survey that asks questions aboutactivities that are both illegal and socially disapproved runs agreater-than-normal risk of encountering response bias. A clue to how serious response bias can be, even with legalbehavior, comes from surveys where people are asked how muchalcohol they drink. Only two-thirds of the alcohol on whichexcise tax is paid (which may be an undercount of alcohol sold ifdistillers cheat the Treasury) is accounted for by surveyresponses; the survey data thus underestimate consumption by atleast 50 percent. It has been suggested that psychological"denial" by a small population of extremely heavydrinkers may account for most of the difference. Here again, aswith sample bias, problems with a very small portion of thesample can cause the results to be seriously wrong. On the otherhand, a compilation of studies in which survey responses toquestions about illegal drug use were compared with urine-testresults showed no tendency to underreport. A special kind of response-bias problem comes when survey dataare used to estimate trends. If the level or social disapprovalas perceived by recipients changes, then response bias may changetoo. For example, increasingly negative attitudes about marijuanause might lead adolescent respondents to the high-school seniorssurvey to be less likely to tell adult interviewers that theysmoked marijuana every day, even if their actual behavior did notchange. The result would be an apparent, but spurious, decline inheavy marijuana use among adolescents. (This is not to say thatchanging attitudes might not also change behavior, only that thesurvey evidence is subject to error from this source). There are no easy answers to the problem of response bias.Sometimes, as in the studies cited by K. H. Marquis, it ispossible to collect independent data as a check on a sample ofresponses, and then adjust the sample results for the measuredbias. Another strategy is to vary the circumstances of response,for example, by using "secret ballot" answer sheetsinstead of face-to-face questioning or by changing thecharacteristics of the interviewers. Just as pollsters long agodiscovered that black respondents answered many questionsdifferently when the interviewers were black, it may be the casethat some adolescents would respond differently to questionsabout drug use put by another adolescent - particularly onedressed and groomed in ways consistent with drug use - than tothe same questions put by an adult. Changes and Supplements to Current Surveys Both the household survey and the high-school seniors survey,conducted by experienced researchers at institutions withreputations for producing high-quality survey research, arewell-designed for their intended purposes: primarily themeasurement of the number of drug users, secondarily themeasurement of frequency of drug use. But from the perspective ofmaking drug enforcement policy, and particularly policy tocontrol organized crime, they do not gather the right data, orgather it from the right people, or gather it frequently enough.The most important things surveys can tell us are the quantity ofeach drug purchased and consumed; the prices at which thosepurchases are made; the identities and relationships of buyersand sellers; the effects of enforcement on market conditions; andthe effects of market conditions on consumption. In order tolearn these things, surveys would have to: 1. Find More of the Heavy Drug-Users. So much of total drugconsumption is concentrated among a relatively few very heavyusers that no practical increase in sample size for a stratifiedrandom sample among the general population will yield an adequatesample. For example, the 5,000-person household survey couldexpect to get by chance about a dozen of the one half-millionheaviest cocaine users. There are two ways to get a meaningfulsample of heavy users: either use oversampling in drawingrespondents for the household and high-school senior surveys, orrun separate studies of heavy use. The "Young Men andDrugs" studies show both the feasibility of finding samplesrich in serious drug abusers and the value of the results thatfinding such samples can yield. 2. Ask about Prices and Quantities purchased. We would like toknow when the user's last purchase of a given drug took place;what quantity was involved, plus whatever the purchaser knows orwas told about purity/potency/ quality; and how much moneychanged hands; this information is essential to making anyserious estimate of the dollar volume of the market. 3. Ask about the Conditions of the Transaction. Where did thepurchase take place? (The purchaser's residence, the seller's, aschool building, an office building, an apartment corridor, apark, a street corner?) Were there other people present? Had thetransaction been prenegotiated? Was the pricetake-it-or-leave-it, or was there negotiation? Was thepurchaser's previous transaction with the same seller or adifferent seller? Is the seller a relative, a close friend, andacquaintance, or a stranger? These questions can help answerquestions about the possible effectiveness of retail-levelenforcement as a way to cut down on the volume of drugs consumed. 4. Ask about Price Increases, Shortages, Sharing, and ConsumerInventories. Was the price of the most recent transaction higheror lower than the respondent's previous transaction? Than therespondent expected? If the price of the drug were to increase by25 percent, what would the respondent do? (Use about the sameamount, use less, quit altogether, switch to another drug?) Hasthe respondent ever been unable to find a supply of the drug inquestion at any price? Does the respondent now have a supply ofthe drug? If so, how long would it last at his normal consumptionrate? How frequently has the respondent used drugs purchased byanother? Given drugs to another? These questions will helpdetermine the effect of price increases and temporary shortageson consumption behavior. Unfortunately, experience from marketresearch on legitimate products suggests that the answers to thewhat-if questions are likely to be unreliable. 5. Give Information about Local Markets. Federal and localenforcement efforts vary widely across the country in theirintensity and success, but there are almost no studies of whatthe effects are on retail purchases and consumption. Nationwidesamples need to be supplemented with local ones. 6. Provide a Steady Stream of Data in Addition to Annual orOnce-Every-Two-Years Snapshots. This is particularly valuable incombination with local data as a way of measuring the differenceenforcement makes (or fails to make). Is the availability ofdrugs fairly constant, or does it vary? How do consumers respond?Estimating the price-elasticity of demand requires frequentmeasurements of both price and quantity, both to generate anadequate number of data points and to avoid confounding priceeffects with long-term trends or cohort effects on the demandside. One alternative to random sampling often used in marketresearch is a panel survey, where questions are asked repeatedlyof the same group of respondents. Panel data would be enormouslyuseful in understanding the effects of market conditions on druguse, and the individual patterns of drug consumption. Forexample, when drug supplies are short, how are consumptiondecreases distributed among new users and existing users, poorusers and affluent users, heavy users and light users? What drugsare used as substitutes when marijuana is scarce or expensive?How many users, who cease use when supplies are tight, neverstart up again, or start up at lower levels of use? An obviousproblem is assuring respondent confidentiality, and convincingrespondents that it is assured. Perhaps more worrisome, beingmembers of such a panel might make respondents moredrug-conscious, which raises serious ethical questions, as wellas threatening the validity of such studies. Obstacles Naturally, proposing such studies for someone else to fund andcarry out is much easier than doing the work. Aside from theproblems of expense and the mass of legal, ethical, andoperational issues raised by asking detailed questions aboutillegal transactions, such studies would face several obstacles: First, they would have to be cleared by the Office ofManagement and Budget, which views any expansion of surveyresearch by the government with a jaundiced eye. The complexityof the questions to be asked strongly argues for the value ofpaying respondents a small fee to encourage them to complete theinterview, but this makes OMB reviewers even more nervous. (The1981 household survey didn't get into the field until 1982because of a dispute with OMB about forms and payments torespondents.) Second, modifying the existing surveys in terms of content orsample selection will interfere with the ability of researchersto compare results from one survey to the next to determinetrends. The preference of survey researchers for asking the samequestions in the same words to the same samples is not mindlessconservatism, but a well-founded belief in the virtues ofrepeating measurements exactly, rather than changing surveyseries represents a big investment of money and talent. Finally, it is worth noting that neither the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse, which funds the current surveys, nor theresearches who conduct them, share the policy and researchperspective urged here. NIDA is far more interested in thepatterns of drug abuse than in the size and functioning of thedrug markets. Nor is there any demand for this sort of researchfrom the enforcement and prosecution agencies. Surveys of Dealers The discussion above concerns only surveys of drug users. Itis also possible to survey drug dealers, asking both about theirown dealings - transactions, strategies for dealing withcustomers, suppliers, and enforcement agencies, incomes,expenses, encounters, if any, with organized crime, opinions ofenforcement risk, pricing policy, recruitment into the trade,career patterns and goals - and about their knowledge of how thedrug markets work. There is probably no better way to start onserious estimates of, for example, bow many marijuana or cocaineto deliver drugs to the market - is more plausible the fewer theparticipants, and the more stable the organizational structure,of any given market. Finding and interviewing a sample of dealers poses bothproblems and risks for the researcher. However, we do have accessto a sample of drug dealers with nothing better to do than answerquestions: they are in federal and state prisons. Of course, theymay be unrepresentative of the overall dealer population,particularly in terms of their success in avoiding enforcement,and may also be unwilling to be interviewed, or to speakcandidly. Still, if systematic interviews could be conducted with asample of convicted drug dealers, the results could not fail tobe informative. The Rand Corporation is now conducting a pilotstudy along those lines funded by the National Institute ofJustice. Consequence Data One alternative to asking people about their consumption ofillicit substances is to observe the consequences of drug abuse.These consequences include coming into contact with both thepolice (arrests, automobile accidents) and the health caresystem: hospital emergency rooms, medical examiners' offices, anddrug treatment facilities. There is now no systematic attempt torecord drug intoxication at arrest or at accident scenes of drugusers, but the National Institute of Drug Abuse maintains threecollection activities to gather medical data: the Drug AbuseWarning Network (DAWN), the Client-Oriented Data AcquisitionProcess (CODAP) and the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG). The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) The National Institute on Drug Abuse collects and publishes[National Institute on Drug Abuse Statistical Series I)information from about one-sixth of the nation's emergency rooms,with a heavy concentration on 26 metropolitan areas (SMSA's), andfrom about two-thirds of the medical examiners in those 26 SMSA'sonly. The emergency rooms report on patients who come in as aresult of acute ill experiences with the non-medical use ofdrugs; the medical examiners report on persons who, in theirjudgment, died as the direct result of drug use. In 1981, themost recent year for which the data have been published, the DAWNsystem recorded 121,268 emergency room visits and 2,825 deaths,as a result of drugs. (The deaths exclude New York City, whichdid not report to DAWN in 1981; in previous years, New York hadaccounted for about one-quarter of DAWN medical examinerreports.) DAWN records all drugs used incidents of multiple drug abuse:thus 121,268 emergency room "episodes" yielded 199,400"mentions," and 2,825 deaths involved 5,640 mentions.Heroin is the third most frequently-mentioned drug in emergencyrooms, after alcohol-in-combination (alcohol alone is now countedin DAWN) and diazepam (Valium). Cocaine is sixth, marijuanaseventh. Others in the top ten are aspirin, methaqualone,acetaminophen (Tylenol), flurezapam (another tranquilizer) andPCP. Heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, the three largest drugmarkets in dollar terms, account for fewer than 20,000 totalmentions among them. This is such a tiny proportion of the usersof these drugs (about 1 in 50 heroin users, about 1 in 1,000cocaine users, about 1 in 5,000 marijuana users) as to make anyinferences from the DAWN sample to the general populationextremely questionable. In any case, other than personaldemographic data, no questions are asked of DAWN subjects otherthan "what did you take?" For some drugs, even theanswer to this question may be open to doubt, since illicit drugsellers frequently misrepresent their wares, and DAWN sites arenot equipped to assay blood or urine to determine the chemicalcomposition of the "speed" or "ludes" thatsubjects report they have taken. Attempts to base estimates of patterns and trends in drugavailability on DAWN data, but they have not been convincing.DAWN is valuable as an early warning network about both streetdrugs and pharmaceuticals causing injury and death; but it doesnot, and almost certainly cannot, contribute much to ourunderstanding of the kind of drug trafficking that contributes toorganized crime. The Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP) Through 1981 NIDA gathered data from all federally-funded drugtreatment clinics and programs and published them as NIDAStatistical Series E. Incentive to participate was provided bymaking participation a condition of funding under the NIDAcategorical grant program that paid for drug treatment. Theabolition of that categorical grant program and the inclusion ofdrug treatment in the Community Development Block Grant programof direct fiscal assistance to the states both reduced the totalnumber of drug treatment facilities and eliminated any directrelationship between the clinics and NIDA. As a result, NIDA canmo longer compel participation in CODAP. Approximately 15 stateshave voluntarily continued to submit CODAP data, and NIDAcollects the information and prepares am unofficial series ofannual reports. In 1981 there were 249,206 admissions to CODAPfacilities, more than three-fourths for outpatient treatment.(Persons admitted more than once during the year weredouble-counted, so the number of individuals admitted wassomewhat smaller). At any one time there were an average of126,000 persons under treatment, almost 85 percent asoutpatients. While CODAP collected demographic data and information aboutthe drugs for which its clients sought or were assigned totreatment, it did not collect data about individual purchase andconsumption patterns. Variations in CODAP counts over time mightindicate either increases in abuser populations brought about byincreased availability, growing numbers of addicts withoutconnections brought about by decreased availability, or merelyincreased availability of treatment. CODAP data were of greatinterest to treatment professionals and produced interestingtime-series data on such indicators as age at first use (whichallowed some inferences about "cohort effects").However, CODAP had even less direct relevance to enforcementplanning than did DAWN. While local studies of enforcementeffectiveness may wish to gather data on treatment demand, thiscan probably be done as effectively on an ad hoc basis as througha process like CODAP. Reviving that process would not seem to bea high priority from the viewpoint of organized-crimepolicymaking. The Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG) The Community Epidemiology Work Group, also supported by NIDA,collects reports from drug abuse prevention and treatment expertsand officials around the country about patterns and trends asthey perceive them in their own areas, and summarizes andpublishes those reports in volumes of "Proceedings".The local reports are not in standard format, and CEWG does notgenerate statistical series. Prices are occasionally mentioned;quantities rarely, if ever. It is conceivable that CEWGparticipants night be encouraged and funded to develop informal"panel studies" among drug users in their own areas.But this would represent a substantial move away from CEWG'scurrent informality. Changes and Other Studies As suggested above, drug abuse consequence data have littlepromise of contributing much to making or evaluating strategyagainst organized crime. The one source not now tapped is arrestdata. Arrests of users - particularly heroin users - for propertycrimes and prostitution may be quite sensitive indicators ofshort-run changes in availability. To develop such data, it wouldbe necessary to test arrestees' urine for the presence of opiatemetabolites and quinine. The National Institute of Justice isfunding a few pilot programs along these lines. Assuming theyturn out to be operationally feasible, they probably represent awise investment of funds. Enforcement Data From the agencies that arrest, prosecute, try, and imprisondrug traffickers and seize their drugs and other assets, we cangather valuable data both about the enforcement activity andabout the underlying illegitimate market. Some of thisinformation exists, or can readily be obtained, in statisticalform; the rest is buried in case reports, informant interviews,and intelligence analyses. The one governmentally-publishedseries estimating the revenues in the drug markets, the annualNarcotics Intelligence Estimate, is prepared primarily byenforcement agencies (particularly DEA) and apparently in largepart from enforcement sources. Information About Enforcement Activity Three things about enforcement activity are of interest: (1) Inputs. What resources - measured in dollars, agent-hours,prosecutor-hours, cell-years, ship-days, wiretap orders underTitle III - are spent on drug enforcement, and how are thoseresources divided among agencies, geographically, by target drug,by enforcement technique, and by the trafficking activity underinvestigation (high-seas smuggling, port smuggling, firstdomestic distribution, wholesaling and middleman activity, retaildealing, money laundering)? Even at the Federal level alone, something as relativelysimple as a comprehensive dollar budget broken down by agency andby drug is not available. An attempt has been made to estimatethe share of marijuana in total Federal enforcement; itillustrates both what is and what is not available. Assemblingsuch data is best done within the government, by an agency withthe authority to demand the relevant documents, than byoutsiders; the Drug policy Board, the Office of Management andBudget, the White House Drug Abuse policy Office, any one of thecognizant Congressional subcommittees, the General AccountingOffice, or the President's Commission on Organized Crime could,by collating budget submissions from the agencies involved,assemble crude but adequate estimates of dollars spent by agencyand drug rather easily. Assembling meaningful information about inputs in non-monetaryforms (e.g., work-hours) would be a tedious process, requiringboth access to internal agency reporting systems and anunderstanding of how those systems represent or misrepresentreality. However, assuming that something resembling the DEA'sannual statistical report is available from the Coast Guard,Customs Service, IRS, and FBI, it might be possible to assemble afair picture of Federal enforcement activity. Federal prosecutionagencies do not now have the ability to generate statisticalprofiles of their work that would be useful here. Thecase-management software system (PROMIS) being installed in theU.S. Attorneys' offices may be able to produce estimates ofprosecutive work-hours by case type, although the system may notcode enough of the case data (e.g., G-DEP rank of case anddefendants) to allow useful analysis. The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts can producecases-pending counts by offense, although this overestimates drugcases as a proportion of total cases to the extent that drugdefendants are more likely than others to default on bail andthus remain as active cases for long periods of time; noestimates are made of the use of judge-days or grand jury daysfor various kinds of cases. Moreover, since the statute names andnumbers attached to a given drug charge (manufacture,distribution, conspiracy, continuing criminal enterprise, etc.)do not vary with drug involved, it is almost impossible toseparate the conviction data by drug. It is possible to make verycrude estimates of Federal prison-cell utilization by convicteddrug dealers from the court data. The attempt to work directlyfrom DEA data is frustrated by the fact that the DEA statisticalreport lists total convictions, rather than convictions inFederal courts. The lack of a unified set of file numbers for thefederal criminal-justice agencies, or a set of links from onefile system to the next (what is called an "Offender-BasedTracking system," or OBTS) makes it nearly impossible totrace a sample of DEA defendants through prosecution andincarceration. The primary problem with assembling such data is nottechnical, but organizational: its collection and disseminationare not in the perceived interests of the agencies involved orthe key individuals within them. While that remains, littleprogress is to be expected. Below the Federal level, thesituation is much worse; there are simply no published figures ondrug enforcement spending or activities by state and local policeagencies, most of which do not have separate drug enforcementunits. The current paucity of data on enforcement activities wouldfrustrate any attempt to study the effects of changes inenforcement resources on the drug markets, even if adequate priceand quantity data were in hand. This problem is not easy to fix;unless the agencies involved have their own reasons forcollecting the data, it will be difficult either for"outsiders" - even from within the government - to dothe job or to persuade the agencies to do it instead. Thesituation is similar for state and local enforcement; in theabsence of any convenient ways of getting nationwide data, a fewstudies of individual cities and states might be useful. (2) Outputs. How do those inputs translate into enforcementactions felt by traffickers: arrests, convictions, sentences,time actually served in prison, drug seizures, asset seizures?How are those outputs distributed geographically, by drug, bylevel of the traffic? These figures are less nebulous than resource and workloaddata; a man-hour is "the stuff that dreams are madeon," but an arrest actually happens. Nonetheless, althoughDEA reports its arrests broken down by almost every possiblevariable, there is no government-wide collation of all arrestreports. Convictions and prison time, as noted above, are simplynot available in useful formats. Even drug seizure data are complicated by the multiplicity ofagencies involved; simply adding together agency totals runs therisk of double-counting. The first annual report of the OrganizedCrime Drug Trafficking Task Force program gives government-widenumbers that may be reliable. Data on asset seizures are complicated both by interagency(and Federal/ State/local) cooperation and by the complexity ofseizure cases: appraised value is one thing, realized value lesslienholders' equity something very different. The lags inforfeiture actions against seized items, plus the growth in theoverall level of seizures, make it difficult to computeseizure-to-forfeiture ratios, because 1984 forfeitures do notcorrespond to 1984 seizures. Some central responsibility for thisarea was assigned to the U.S. Marshal Service and the AssetForfeiture Office of the Criminal Division of the JusticeDepartment; those agencies may now be in a position to provideunified statistics. Arrests, convictions, seizures, and prison time are basicmeasures of risk imposed on the illicit drug industry, and it isvery hard to plan or evaluate policy in their absence. Unlikemost of the input numbers, good output measures can be assembledwith only minimal cooperation from the agencies themselves, ifsomeone with authority insists on it. Below the Federal level the situation is more dismal. Otherthan the uninformative counts of total drug arrests in theUniform Crime Reports, no national data are available. It hasbeen almost ten years since the last national study of stateprisoners by offense category, and even that study combined alldrug offenses into one category. Here again, the best that can behoped for is a few well-done local studies. (3) Effects. Enforcement actions impose costs and risks onillicit entrepreneurs and thus tend to increase prices andperhaps to make supplies less reliable. To some extent thecost-imposition value of a given enforcement action - theimprisonment of a major marijuana importer for an effective termof six years, the seizure of one kilogram of 90 percent pureheroin from a New York City wholesaler - can be calculated, andthose costs can be added together to estimate the effects ofenforcement on the market. Such calculations could contributesubstantially to policy analysis and evaluation. They could formthe basis for comparisons of alternative enforcement techniquesin terms of the costs imposed on a given drug market pergovernment dollar spent. However, to make then accurately oneneeds the right kind of tabulation of enforcement outputs. The value of any illicit drug grows enormously as it movesdown the distribution chain toward the final consumer. A kilogramof heroin that sells for $200,000 is the raw material for streetbags of heroin worth more than $2 million. Adding togetherphysical volumes seized at different stages of the traffic isadding apples and oranges. Each seizure should be evaluated atthe point where it is seized, and then the values added together.The "street value" calculations, so beloved byreporters, resemble calculations of the value of stolen cattlebased on the price of a steak dinner in a restaurant. Givenestimates of the "price chains" (of which more below),simple rules of thumb, based on quantity and location, will givereasonable estimates of the coast imposed on the illicit marketby drug seizures. Imprisonment data also need to bequality-weighted. The higher in the trade a trafficker is, themore dollars he would spend to avoid a year in prison, bothbecause he has more dollars and because any given period inprison costs him more in lost earnings. That willingness-to-payper prison-year-willingness-to-pay of traffickers at differentlevels. But unless the data on imprisonment are collected by drugand G-DEP violator class, there are no figures to use incalculation. Information about Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime Enforcement activity yields two kinds of information aboutdrug trafficking: (1) that which can be inferred from theenforcement statistics, and (2) that known to (and sometimespublished by) agents, prosecutors, and enforcement-agencyintelligence analysts. (1) Inferences from Enforcement Statistics. Lost in theorganizational history of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics is theunsung hero who first proposed the rule of thumb that enforcementagencies capture about 10 percent of the drug supply on its wayto market. That rule of thumb allows (once the problems with theseizure data are straightened away) a simple calculation of thephysical size of the drug markets: take seizures and add a zero.More of the official drug market estimation than anyone wouldlike to admit is still based on some variant of that methodology. There are two problems with this calculation. First, there wasnever a period when we had a good measure of the total markettraffickers will tend to lower it. In fact, if the change inenforcement is great enough to cause shifts in basic smugglingpatterns, the result may be a lower overall seizure rate despitea higher level of enforcement. This seems to have been the casefor the South Florida Task Force, which succeeded both in drivingdrug smugglers away from its territory and in causing many ofthem to switch from large vessels to smaller, faster vessels;total seizures actually fell. The same is true of using other enforcement measures asestimates of market size. The enforcement success count dependson the size of the market, the vigor and tactics of enforcement,and the countermeasures of traffickers. Without an independentbasis for estimating the effect of countermeasures, the successcount tells us little even about trends in the size of themarket. (2) Facts and Analysis From Agents and Agencies. Drugenforcement agencies are not in business to collect data or doanalysis; they are in business to put drug dealers in jail andseize their drugs. Like other agencies, they tend to collect andpublish data that will help them do their job better, willpersuade someone else to help them do their job better, or willmake them look good. Traditionally, the Drug Enforcement Agency and itspredecessors defined their mission as controlling the supply ofdrugs. Thus, for example, the estimates of the price and purityof heroin at retail were published as part of the"Performance Measurement System," implying that drugavailability was an important measure of agency effectiveness.This mission definition encouraged the development within DEA ofan extensive "strategic intelligence" capability,devoted to understanding the drug markets. By contrast, theFederal Bureau of Investigation has always defined its mission assecuring the conviction of lawbreakers. It regarded the number ofbank robbers it caught, rather than the number of bank robberies,as its central performance measure. Since the 1981 reorganizationthat placed DEA under the administrative authority of theDirector of the FBI, DEA's mission definition has moved closer tothe FBI's. At least in part, this reflected a belief thatenforcement outputs were more subject to organizational control,and thus more likely to consistently reflect organizationalsuccess, than drug market outcomes. This new mission definitionmay have advantages from the perspective of organized crimecontrol. The supply-control approach tended to stress quantitiesof drugs rather than trafficking organizations as targets.However, the new mission definition is much less hospitable tostrategic, as opposed to operational, intelligence. (a) Price Chains. In the past DEA devoted considerable energyto estimating "price chains" for drugs, based onundercover buys and data from informants. That information,insofar as it was accurate, told a great deal about the structureof the markets, and in particular about where the money was beingmade. It was never formally published, but it was estimated on aquarterly basis and available to the rest of the government. Itappears that such "price chain" estimates are no longermade, or no longer made available. If true, that should berectified. There is no other source for that information, and itis essential. There is an enormous amount of relevant informationin DEA case files. Undercover transactions, interceptedcommunications, and conversations with informants all containprice data. The problem is maintaining a staff to collate andanalyze what is there. One improvement that could easily be madein publishing all statistics on drug prices is to adjust pastprices for the effects of inflation, using the Consumer PriceIndex or GNP deflator. Otherwise, anyone trying to determineprice trends has to keep looking up the rate of inflation since1976, or whatever appropriate date. (b) "Monitor" Programs. DEA has never had asubstantial number of retail-level cases, but the PerformanceMeasurement System required data about retail price and puritiesfor heroin across the country. These were accordingly collectedby the simple expedient of sending agents out to make undercoverretail purchases and collecting retail samples from local policeto seek good quality at low prices? More seriously,"retail" included samples as large as 2 grams and up to14 percent pure, while the typical actual retail transaction isfor 100 milligrams (one-tenth of a gram) less than 5 percentpure. Now that price-purity data are no longer publicly released,there seems to be somewhat less monitoring activity than in thepast. It may well be true that a program run by local policeunits (perhaps with funding from DEA or NIJ) would be moreeffective than DEA-run monitoring efforts. (Unofficialresearchers might develop even more accurate results, but thelegal and ethical problems seem insurmountable). But whether runby DEA or outside, there is no substitute for actual street buysas an index of market conditions, and not only for heroin. Enforcement-based Analysis: NNICC The National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee(NNICC, pronounced "nick") is the official custodian ofestimates regarding the drug markets. It was originallyestablished to help control the embarrassing flow of mutuallycontradictory estimates that used to emerge from various Federalagencies. Although staffed primarily from DEA, it includes abroad variety of agencies as members, and its reports arenegotiated products. At one time, the NNICC annual report, called the NarcoticsIntelligence Estimate, provided sources, physical volumes, anddollar revenues for each of the four major drug categories:opiates, cannabis, cocaine, and the "dangerous drugs."Subsequently, criticism of the dollar-volume estimates, both fromoutsiders and from within the NNICC staff, led to a decision tocease publication of dollar-volume estimates. At the same timethe marijuana estimates for previous years were restated downwardby approximately one-third. As the NNICC methodology review makesclear, the NIE figures are largely derived from estimates offarm-level production in foreign source countries, because thedata sources on the consumption side are so inadequate. However,that same report shows how weakly grounded the production-basedestimates are. The crop figures themselves are hard todistinguish from guesswork, and the fraction of each country'scrop reaching the U.S. market is fundamentally unknown. Still more serious is a problem not considered in themethodology review: that a large fraction of the total crop inthe average year may go unsold. But a peasant marijuana-grower,for example, deciding how many plants to grow under uncertaintyboth about crop yields and about demand from exporters, will, ifhe is rational, overplant on average. Marijuana is so lucrative,compared with other crops, that it makes sense to grow an extraplant, even if there is only one chance in five of selling it forexport. Of course, if there were a smoothly functioningcompetitive market over wide geographic areas, the result wouldbe lower prices rather than unsold crops, but the market inmarijuana for export may be highly localized, with exportersbuying from nearby farmers even if prices elsewhere are muchlower. In general, then, it is hard to place much confidence in theNIE numbers, particularly because they are presented as a justset of conclusions, without any detailed presentation of theunderlying data or the calculations performed on that data. Oneway to improve this situation would be to gather better data,particularly about consumption, as discussed above. On the purely analytic side, two things might be done: (1)NNICC might publish more of its underlying data and some of thedetails about the calculations performed on them, or (2) a teamof outside scholars might be allowed full access to NNICCmaterials and asked to prepare an independent estimate. But whether one considers improving the data with which NNICChas to work or changing the analytic approach, the fundamentalproblem remains one of organizational incentives. The currentlack of adequate data or convincing analysis is not a problemfrom the perspective of DEA or other enforcement agencies. If theinformation were available, there is no reason to expect that itwould be used to reshape what agents and prosecutors do. In fact,by providing outsiders with a basis on which to criticize, dataand analysis might seem to threaten agency autonomy. Nor have theWhite House or Congressional staffs concerned with these problemsdisplayed any anxiety over the absence of information. The firststep in solving a problem is getting it identified as a problemby someone with the resources to bring about a solution. In thisarea, that step remains to be taken.

Submitted: September 1985. Frank Monasteroretired in 1985, having served as the Chief of Operations of theDrug Enforcement Administration. As we can see from media reports, cocaine has fast become thenation's number one drug abuse problem. The supply of cocainecoming from South America has reached overwhelming proportions.In 1985 alone the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimatesseizures will reach 50,000 pounds, and this, of course, does notaccount for that part of the supply that ultimately reaches themore than 20 million regular users. Another facet of the drug abuse problem, which could grow asrapidly if not addressed promptly, is that of controlledsubstance analogs, known as "designer drugs." These areclandestinely produced substances not covered by the ControlledSubstances Act because of their chemical structure. Most drugs, including those manufactured illicitly, areproduced at least in part from commercially available chemicals.The purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility anddesirability of regulating certain of these chemicals. It willalso analyze how to curtail illicit production and examine whatlegal mechanism would be effective to control the manufacture ofsynthetic analogs (designer drugs), produced for illicitpurposes. Cocaine abused in the United States has its origin from thecoca bush, a very hardy plant, grown in certain areas of Southand Central America. As in the case with almost all drugs,whether produced from plants or totally synthetic, one or moreprecursors, reagents or solvents is used in the process. Thesechemicals are defined as follows: a precursor is a raw materialused in the production of a controlled substance that becomespart of the finished product; a reagent reacts chemically withone or more precursors but does not become part of the finishedproduct; a solvent, which does not react chemically with aprecursor or reagent and does not become part of the finishedproduct, is used to dissolve solid precursors or reagents, todilute reaction mixtures, and to separate and purify otherchemicals. For example, a precursor for cocaine is coca leaves, areagent is sulfuric acid, and a solvent used in the manufacturingprocess is acetone. With respect to methamphetamine, a precursoris phenyl-2-propanone, a reagent is sulfuric acid, and a solventis methanol. It is important to understand that, in the case ofthese and other controlled substances, there are many otherprecursors, reagents and solvents, which can easily besubstituted to produce the same final product. With some exceptions only the final product drug itself, is acontrolled substance. Many of the chemicals used to produce orrefine illicit drugs are needed in industry to produce a myriadof items and are produced in tremendous quantities. Controllingtheir distribution would, in most cases, be impossible andprobably undesirable because of the cost alone. Acetone, forinstance, which is used as a solvent in processing opium and cocaleaves, is used to make paints, lubricants, pharmaceuticals,cosmetics and agricultural products. Although controlling all precursors, reagents and solventsused to manufacture illicit drugs is neither desirable norfeasible, the idea of controlling certain chemicals has merit. Infact, some chemicals are now subject to regulation. Piperidine isa precursor to the controlled substance phencyclidine, commonlyknown as PCP, which can have serious physical and psychologicalconsequences when abused. Piperidine is subject to reportingrequirements under the Controlled Substances Act, although itspossession and distribution are not subject to penalties, as isthe case with the possession and distribution of PCP. Formsrecording the sale of piperidine and the purchaser's name must bemaintained for two years. Anyone who sells piperidine must reportthe sale. This reporting procedure allows DEA to monitor sales ofpiperidine and to investigate those sales recognized assuspicious by either DEA or the seller. As a result of concertedefforts begun in late 1984, DEA has seized four clandestine PCPlaboratories and has located at least ten operations thatreceived chemicals from legitimate channels by posing aslegitimate businesses. In one case a manufacturer shipped asubstantial amount of piperidine to a "chemicalcompany" over an extended period, all in good faith based onthe company's name. A check of the address by DEA showed it to bean auto repair shop. Precursors, reagents and solvents are used to manufacture manydrugs, including synthetic analogs, drugs so close in structureto controlled substances that they create virtually the sameeffect for the user. These are not covered under the ControlledSubstances Act because of minor differences in molecularstructure. Synthetic analogs, commonly known as "designerdrugs," pose particular health threats. The production of controlled substance analogs,pharmacologically active, chemically related substances, to avoidthe laws regulating controlled substances, was first observed inthe mid-1960's with the synthesis of amphetamine analogs ofmescaline, such as MDA and others. Some of this group ofhallucinogenic amphetamines sold on the illicit market werebrought under the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, a predecessor tothe Controlled Substances Act. Others in the group weresubsequently controlled under the Controlled Substances Act afterits passage in 1970. Later three PCP analogs were controlled. The process of designing analogs is, therefore, not new, andthe formulas are not primarily a phenomenon of clandestinelaboratories. Most of these drugs were developed by legitimatepharmaceutical chemists in search of better medicinal agentsthrough the testing of numerous analogs of a parent compound. Itis not surprising, therefore, that some of their precursors havenames such as N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)-aniline (forfentanyl) or N-[1-(2-phenylisopropyl)]-4-piperidinone-4-one (foralpha-methylfentanyl). These analogs, in many cases, mimic thequalitative actions of the original compound but may vary inpotency or duration of action. Thus, there is a need to deal bothwith the problem of chemicals used in the production of illicitdrugs and with the problem of controlled substance analogs. Factors Affecting the Regulation of Chemicals There are in excess of 200 precursors, reagents and solventsused in the production of the 37 most commonly abused substances.Among these are amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, Diazepam,hash oil, heroin, LSD, MDA, PCP and methaqualone. In consideringwhat should be regulated two factors are most significant: (1)How common is the chemical interest? (2) How great is theworkload to track the needed information? Each situation must beexamined individually, if the objective is to reach an ultimatesolution for each drug. It is quickly apparent that there is no ultimate, universalsolution to absolute chemical control for all drugs. Acetone andether, although widely used, are subject to tracing. Piperidine,less available commercially, is easily synthesized. The firstconclusion might well be that if the source of the chemical isknown and that source will identify and report suspicious sales,the investigator will be able to pursue the investigation.Obviously, this will not help when all chemicals can be obtainedfrom illicit sources. But when the source will provide assistanceor at least when sales information is available for review,tracing can be attempted. The problem then becomes one of resources. How muchinformation can be reviewed and how many people are available topursue leads. These are very significant factors to consider. If,indeed, all chemicals used in the production of controlledsubstances were reported it is unlikely the responsible agencycould cull the most suspicious orders, let alone investigatethem. The computer input itself would be substantial.Furthermore, the drug abuse situation is constantly changing, anda chemical, not of interest today, might be a prime target as anew drug emerges. Case Study: Ether Because cocaine abuse is a serious problem in the UnitedStates at this time and because an increasing number of cocainelaboratories are being seized, it is important to examine thechemical control of cocaine. To refine coca, dried leaves aremoistened with an alkaline solution, such as lime water, sodiumor potassium carbonate. The moistened leaves are soaked inkerosene, which extracts cocaine and similar compounds. Thekerosene is extracted with aqueous sulfuric acid, and the acidneutralized with limestone or lime. After the cocaineprecipitates and is removed by filtering, it becomes coca paste.To become cocaine base, the paste is dissolved in a solution ofsulfuric acid, and a solution of potassium permanganate is addedto aridize impurities. The solution is filtered to removeimpurities and manganese oxides. Anmoniun hydroxide is added tothe filtrate, and the precipitate is collected and dried, formingthe base. The base is dissolved in acetone or ether and filteredto remove insoluble material. Concentrated hydrochloric acid isadded in acetone along with ether. Cocaine hydrochloride willcrystallize from this solution and is collected by filtration anddried. The ratio of base to cocaine hydrochloride is one to one. Because ether and acetone are readily available in the UnitedStates, traffickers recognized the advantage of processing here,and the number of base to hydrochloride laboratories seizedincreased steadily from 3 in 1980 to 21 in 1984; as of mid-1985,there were already 25. Six reagents are used to refine cocaine: ammonia, hydrochloricacid, lime, limestone, potassium carbonate, potassiumpermanganate and sulfuric acid. The four solvents used areacetone, ethanol, ether and kerosene. These could be targets formonitoring or control. However, after considering theavailability and usage of each chemical, the possible targets canbe narrowed to acetone and ether. As mentioned earlier, acetonehas a number of legitimate uses. An estimated 2.5 billion poundsis produced each year in the United States, a commercial value ofabout $400 million. There are 12 major U.S. producers and over 40 foreign sources.Although usually produced from petroleum or synthesized frombenzene, there are other processes to produce it. Nonetheless,acetone, in fact, was selected as a target, and the targeting didproduce results. Ether, likewise, has broad use, with a U.S.production estimate of over 60 million pounds, but with only fiveU.S. producers and seven major foreign sources. Ether, therefore,represents, and did turn out to be, an even better target. Early in 1982 a project was undertaken to determine how muchether was being shipped to Colombia and to what, if any,legitimate uses it was put. Colombia was selected because,although most of the coca is grown in Bolivia and Peru, most ofthe cocaine processing laboratories were known to be in Colombia.The Colombian government determined that thousands of gallons ofether were being imported annually, but that there was virtuallyno legitimate need for it. Most of the ether was imported fromthe Federal Republic of Germany and the United States. Throughliaison with those ether manufacturers and distributors who wouldcooperate, hundreds of barrels of the chemical were tracked toclandestine laboratories deep in the Amazon jungles of Colombia.Many of these labs were destroyed and thousands of pounds ofcocaine were seized. In the celebrated Tranquilandia raid inMarch 1984, 10,000 kilograms of cocaine paste and base wereseized and destroyed, along with thousands of barrels ofchemicals. Through court testimony and media attention, cocaineproducers have, no doubt, become aware of the detectiontechniques used to locate laboratories, and they are or will takeaction to avoid detection. Opportunities for a continuing supplyof ether exist through unscrupulous manufacturers anddistributors and through clandestine production from ethanol.However, the program has been useful and demonstrates theeffectiveness of the monitoring approach. Case Study: P2P In addition to tracking chemicals, such as ether, anotherapproach is to bring certain chemicals under the ControlledSubstances Act. For experience with this approach, it isimportant to examine methamphetamine and one of its precursors,phenyl-2-propanone (P2P). Domestic methamphetamine production issignificant. In fact, during a 45 month period beginning inSeptember 1981, more than 50 percent of the 751 clandestinelaboratories seized by DEA were methamphetamine labs. In order tocontrol clandestine methamphetamine production, P2P was placed inSchedule II of the Controlled Substance Act on February 11, 1980.P2P is an immediate precursor (used in the step just prior tocompletion) in the most desirable synthesis and was, therefore, agood choice for targeting. Furthermore, with the exception of itsuse as a cleaning solution, most of its uses are in connectionwith pharmaceutical manufacturing. Annual production in the U.S.is estimated to be about 10,000 pounds, with only two principaldomestic producers and nine foreign sources. Full control of P2Punder the Control Substances Act resulted in a significantincrease in the number of clandestine methamphetamine laboratoryoperators synthesizing P2P. More than 75 percent of thelaboratories seized after passage were refluxing phenylaceticacid and acetic anhydride with sodium acetate or pyridine. Inaddition, one laboratory was synthesizing phenylacetic acid aswell. Recommendations for Action (1) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting of allsales of selected chemicals used in the production of controlledsubstances, subject to public notice by the Administrator of DEAthat a particular chemical was selected for such control. Thiswould create a requirement similar to that affecting piperidine;however, reporting would only be required for those chemicalsspecified for a particular period of time. The requirement shouldapply to the importing and exporting of the specified chemicals. (2) That legislation be enacted to empower the Administratorof DEA or some other appropriate authority to identify and addnew chemicals to the list of those requiring reporting, as itbecomes known they are being used for the production ofcontrolled substances. (3) That DEA identify the resources needed for thecomputerization, analysis and follow up on reporting and thatthose resources be acquired through the budget process. Controlled Substance Analogs As previously stated, the controlled substance analog problemis not new. However, their wider illicit use and the greaterrecognition of their use has heightened concern. There have beenthree major types of analogs available in the United States:analogs of PCP, analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine havinghallucinogenic properties, and the newer trend, analogs offentanyl and meperidine. There are, of course, hazards common toall three groups. They are likely to contain toxic impurities.Dosage is not consistent, i.e., one dose of a substance is likelyto contain a different amount of the active ingredient thananother. As a result, a single dose could contain a lethal amountof the drug in question. Because they are analogs, they may wellproduce toxic effects not caused by their parent drug. Anothercritical consideration associated with designer drugs is thedifficulty of identifying them in the body. Recent testimony at aSenate hearing indicated there are now only two laboratories inthe country, capable of identifying certain "designerdrugs" in body fluids, because standards for identifying thedrugs are not widely available. This creates two seriousproblems: (1) Without the ability to detect and determine whatdrugs are being used on the street it is impossible to evenidentify that a problem exists let alone judge its magnitude; and(2) without being able to determine positively what drugs hasbeen ingested, it is impossible to identify the correct antidote,which in many cases could be a matter of life and death. The Situation in More Detail PCP was originally developed in the early 1950's as ananesthetic for humans, but it was soon limited to veterinary usebecause of its adverse side effects. Licit production ceased in1978, and PCP is controlled in Schedule I of the ControlledSubstances Act, as are three of its analogs. They now arerecognized as having no medical use. The National Institute onDrug Abuse has identified 35 other analogs, but none haspresented an abuse problem as far as is known. Many analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine are known tohave hallucinogenic affects. One receiving considerable mediaattention recently, known on the street as "Ecstasy,"is MDMA or 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine from the parentcompound MDA. Its psychopharmacological effects are similar tothose of MDA, altered consciousness, increased acoustic, visualand tactile sensory perceptions and mild intoxication. There isconsiderable concern among some experts that MDMA is likely tocause damage to the serotonergic system, which has to do withregulating sleep, mood, sexual activity and sensitivity toaversive stimuli. The conclusion is based on research indicatingthat MDA can selectively destroy serotonergic nerve terminals inthe rat brain. First recognized in the illicit traffic by DEA in1970, MDMA was proposed for control under the ControlledSubstances Act in July 1984 because of increasing incidents ofdiscovery. However, because of rapidly mounting evidence of abusesince then and possible serious neurological damage, theemergency provisions contained in the Comprehensive Crime ControlAct of 1984 were used, and the drug was controlled as of July 1,1985. Fentanyl is widely used by the medical community as ananalgesic and anesthetic. It was first marketed in the UnitedStates for this purpose in 1968 and is the most popular analgesicused in surgical procedures in this country. There are likelyseveral hundred fentanyl analogs, many with pharmacologicalproperties similar to heroin or morphine but far more powerful.The alpha-methyl analog was the first synthetic analog drugrecognized in the illicit traffic and was associated withoverdose deaths in California in 1979. Sold on the streets assynthetic heroin, or "China White," it was placed inSchedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in September 1981,substantially eliminating its appearance in the illicit traffic.DEA has identified seven additional fentanyl analogs in theillicit traffic since then, however. Interestingly, two analogshave not been recognized in the scientific literature. There are two dramatic concerns related to the fentanylanalogs: (1) their potency; and (2) their production/profitmargin. This second element will be of obvious importance totraditional organized crime elements. Three methyl-fentanyl, thelatest analog to appear in the illicit market, is 3,000 times aspotent as morphine and has already been responsible for over adozen overdose deaths in the San Francisco Bay area alone. Thisis the highest rate of fentanyl related deaths to date. Dosagesfor fentanyl analogs are measured in micrograms and are likely tobe less than 1 percent of the dosage unit sold to the user. TheDrug Enforcement Administration has estimated that one kilogramof fentanyl analog could be manufactured for under $2,000 andthat this amount might equal as many as 50 million dosage units,with a street value exceeding one billion dollars. Meperidine, a synthetic narcotic used to control pain, isfrequently used by heroin users when the street supply of heroinis low. Meperidine, known more commonly by its trade name"Demerol," is in the Controlled Substances Act,Schedule II. Two analogs of meperidine have been found in currentuse. The first apparent MPPP (1-Methyl-4-Propionoxy piperidine)abuse came to light in 1976 when a young man synthesized what hethought was the analog for his own use. He soon sought treatmentfor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In revealing his drug use heprovided the formula and procedures he had used. Subsequentanalysis revealed he had, in fact, created MPTP. Additionalresearch by a National Institute of Health grantee showed thatMPTP had produced the Parkinson's type symptoms. MPPP was firstidentified by a DEA laboratory in 1982; and samples of MPPP havebeen discovered to contain the neurotoxic byproduct MPTP, formedduring the synthesis of MPPP. The neurological damage produced byMPTP is irreversible and apparently worsens with time. The Stateof California has identified more than 500 people who have usedMPTP; many users thought it was a new synthetic heroin. Twenty ofthose involved have been permanently crippled. A group of sevenyoung addicts, who appeared at a California medical centerseveral years ago with symptoms resembling advanced Parkinson'sdisease, were unable to move or talk. Treatment withanti-Parkinson's therapy was, according to Californiaauthorities, probably life saving, yet the patients continued tobe severely handicapped, requiring medication every one to threehours just to be able to eat and drink. The other meperidine analog with effects similar to heroin isPePAP (l-(2-Phenylethyl)-4-Acetyloxpiperidine). The analgesicpotency of PePAP, measured in rodents, is described as from 12 to72 times the potency of meperidine itself. This analog has so farbeen discovered in California, although a clandestine laboratoryoperation in Texas may have been attempting the process but didnot succeed. Proposed Legislation As mentioned at the outset of this discussion, unless thespecific chemical makeup of the substance being abused can bedetermined by all laboratories regularly engaged in the analysisof substances being abuse, serious problems could go unrecognizedfor long periods, even years. Those who examine for and recordoverdose deaths and injuries must likewise be able to determinethe abused substance involved. Further, that information must becollected and analyzed at a central point. There is currentlyonly a limited mechanism for this collection (the NIDA DAWNsystem). When a situation needing attention is discovered,enforcement authorities must be empowered to act quickly. Thismeans that a mechanism must exist by which these "designerdrugs" can be controlled under the Controlled Substances Actand appropriate State laws. The Comprehensive Crime Control Actof 1984 does contain such a provision. Under that statute theAdministrator of DEA can bring a drug under Schedule I for up toone year, with a six month extension where justified, and onemergency basis, while the normal control mechanism is inprogress. The Administrator must decide that such scheduling isnecessary to avoid an imminent hazard to public safety. Controlof the substances occurs 30 days after public notice. Theefficacy of this legislation is yet undetermined, since it wasonly first used in the Spring of 1985. On July 16, 1985, a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate, S.1437, known as the "Designer Drug Enforcement Act of1985." This proposed legislation would make it a felony tomanufacture or distribute a designer drug for human consumption.The proposed act, which would amend the Controlled Substance Act,reads in part "(31) The term 'designer drug' as used insection 403A means a substance other than a controlled substancethat has a chemical structure substantially similar to that of acontrolled substance in Schedule I or II." During a Senatehearing on the legislation by the Subcommittee on Children,Family and Drugs and Alcoholism, July 25, 1985, both the DEAAdministrator and the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuseand Mental Health Administration, supported the bill. Recommended Actions (1) That DEA provide assistance to the States in acquiringlaboratory standards for use in identifying "designerdrugs." (2) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting byanyone authorized to sign a death certificate, to an appropriateFederal authority (perhaps the Public Health Service) of deathscaused wholly or in part from the ingestion of any substance. (3) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting to anappropriate Federal authority (DEA) by all laboratoriesperforming drug analysis for law enforcement purposes: (a) thetotal amount of each controlled substance as defined in theControlled Substances Act, received for analysis each calendaryear, and (b) immediate notice of the receipt of samples of anysubstance suspected of being or found to be a "designerdrug" as defined in the proposed bill. That DEA formulate model "designer drug" legislation for the States as has been done for other aspects of the drug abuse problem.

Moore. Submitted: January 3, 1986. Dr.Mark H. Moore is Daniel and Guggenheim Professor of CriminalJustice Policy and Management at the John F. Kennedy School ofGovernment, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. He isformer Special Assistant to the Administrator of the DrugEnforcement Administration. Introduction: Drug Policy, Law Enforcement and Organized Crime Criminal laws prohibiting the production, distribution, andpossession of narcotics and dangerous drugs are the basis of drugpolicy in the United States. These laws target the drugs thathave no recognized legitimate medical uses: heroin, cocaine,marihuana, and hallucinogens. Enforcement efforts against thesedrugs can be uncompromising, for there are no legitimate uses orusers to be protected. Other drugs, however, pose similar threats to public healthand welfare, but they do have recognized legitimate uses. Thesedrugs include morphine, methadone, barbiturates, amphetamines,and tranquilizers. With respect to these drugs the aim of thelegal regime and associated enforcement strategies is morecomplex. It is not simply to eliminate the drugs but to preservea legitimate sector in which the benefits of these drugs may beenjoyed, while minimizing illicit use. Towards this end the lawslicense a limited number of people to produce, import, sell,distribute and use them. To prevent the drugs from leaking fromand to illicit distributors and users, licensees have to securetheir inventories, and deal only with other licensees. To makesure that the licensees meet these responsibilities, they mustkeep records and make them available to investigators forinspection. Failures to meet their responsibilities expose thelicensees to both civil and criminal penalties. To make sure thatno one can operate outside the boundaries of the legitimatesystem, the unlicensed production, distribution or use of theselegitimate drugs is prohibited. Drug Laws as a Comprehensive Drug Policy It has become customary to think of the drug laws as operatingprincipally on the "supply side" of illegal drugmarkets. For most practical purposes this is appropriate, forthese laws are the principal policy instruments directed at thesupply of illicit drugs. It is also generally true that theprincipal targets of enforcement are suppliers rather than users.However, these laws impose criminal liability on the illicitpossession and use of drugs, as well as to illicit production anddistribution. And indeed, each year more than 500,000 drug usersare arrested for possession. Therefore, criminal enforcement isdirected at the "demand side" of illicit drug use aswell as the "supply side." To the extent that theselaws attack both the supply and the demand for illicit drugs,they can be understood as a comprehensive drug policy, designedto distinguish legitimate and useful drug use from illicit useand to minimize illicit use in the society. To produce this result, three different mechanisms are reliedon. One is the moral force of the law itself. To the extent thatindividual citizens are guided in their decisions about drug useby the explicit instruction provided by the law, or to the extentthat the existence of the law mobilizes widespread informalinterventions by parents, friends and relatives, the existence oflaws that define illicit use may succeed in reducing overalllevels of illicit use without any public enforcement activities. A second, more widely understood mechanism is generaldeterrence: the notion that citizens might be discouraged fromillicitly selling or using drugs by the fear that they will bearrested and punished. This notion differs from the first in thatit depends on citizens' fears of punishment to motivatecompliance with the laws, rather than their desires to conform orseek virtue. The more severe the penalties, and the higher theprobability of being caught, the more compliance will result. A third mechanism is incapacitation: the notion thatimprisonment may physically prevent drug dealers and users fromcontinuing their activities. This concept differs from the secondin that it operates only on those dealers and users who arecaught, and only for as long as they remain under legalsupervision. If enough drug dealers and drug users are locked up,then the problem of illicit drug dealing and drug use willdisappear. Limitations of Drug Laws as a Drug Abuse Policy To describe these mechanisms is to reveal the limitations ofthe drug laws as a comprehensive drug abuse policy. The problemis not that they are directed only at the "supply side"of illegal drug abuse. Nor is it that they fail to producereductions in the level of illicit drug use. The problem is thatthe drug laws are imperfectly effective. They leave behind aresidual market, composed of drug dealers and users, who failedto get the message that they should abandon their drugactivities. Moreover, while the levels of drug distribution anduse that remain are undoubtedly lower than they would be in aworld of legalized drugs, the character of the market on both thesupply and the demand side are fundamentally altered andgenerally worsened as a result of their illegality. On the demand side the users who are not dissuaded from usingdrugs discover that they confront high prices and low quality inthe drugs they buy. In addition, they are exposed to socialstigmatization and criminal prosecution. These circumstancesproduce disastrous results for their economic status, physicalhealth, and social well-being. Of course, to the extent thatthese consequences are unpleasant to the users, they provide acontinuing incentive for users to abandon their drug use. And, tothe extent that the users do so, an important social objective isachieved. But to the extent they do not respond, their lives aremade miserable with little corresponding social benefit. Thesociety is left with drug users who are more dependent, dangerousand unhealthy than they would otherwise be. On the supply side the residual capacity takes the form of anillicit industry. Some of that industry operates outside theboundaries of the United States, and therefore to some degreebeyond the reach of its law. Another portion operates under thecover of predominantly legal drug production and distribution -within reach of the law, but a morally and legally ambiguoustarget. The vast majority of the illicit industry, however,consists of wholly illicit traffickers in the United States. The Illicit Drug Industry: A Problem for Drug and OrganizedCrime Policy The existence of this illicit industry creates two differentkinds of problems. Viewed from the vantage point of drug abusepolicy, the principal problem created by the illicit industry isthat it continues to supply drugs to illicit markets. To theextent that this continues, old drug users nay continue theirharmful activities, and new users may be recruited into dangerouspatterns of drug use. Thus, to achieve the objectives of drugpolicy, the society must find ways to constrict the supplycapacities of the illicit industry. Viewed from the vantage point of those concerned with thecontrol of organized crime, the existence of the illicit industrycreates a different kind of problem. To a degree, the illicitdrug industry engages in the sort of activities that makeorganized crime a specially important social problem. Not only dothe illegal dealers frustrate the aims of drug policy bycontinuing to supply drugs, but they grow rich in the process andtaunt the society with their financial success. Moreover, theindustry seems to spawn violence. Sometimes the violence spillsout into the general population. But even when the violenceremains confined to participants in the industry, its sheerviciousness creates a general sense of lawlessness and brutalitythat is threatening to the community. The illicit dealers alsoseem to become heavily involved in corrupting governmentagencies. Such activities undermine community security, and theintegrity of its basic institutions. Finally, the illicit drugindustry may gives birth to unusually large and powerful criminalorganizations, or nourish those that already exist. From thevantage point of organized crime policy, then, the drug lawscreate a major problem to be solved. Drug Policy as a Portfolio of Policy Instruments To deal with these side effects and residual problems, thedrug laws must be complemented by other policy instruments. Todeal with the limitations of drug laws in suppressing the demandfor drugs, a comprehensive drug policy necessarily includes drugtreatment and preventive education programs. Treatment programsmust be provided to help users make the transition to non-use andto save lives that would otherwise be lost. Preventive educationprograms must be operated to give more detailed explanations toindividuals of why illicit drug use is undesirable. Indeed, giventhe focus of drug enforcement on the supply side of the marketand the obvious limitations of the drug laws in discouraging useamong those who are already dependent, it is generallyappropriate to think of drug treatment and education programs asthe principal instruments focused on the "demand side"of the illicit drug markets. To deal with the limitations of the laws in suppressing thesupply of illicit drugs and preventing the appearance oforganized criminal activity, traditional enforcement methods mustbe supplemented by some special policy instruments. Diplomacy andforeign aid must be joined to enforcement and regulation to reachthe pieces of the illicit supply system that operate outside theUnited States. An effective regulatory enforcement system must becreated to prevent the diversion of narcotics and dangerous drugsfrom legitimate to illicit markets in the United States. Andperhaps some special enforcement strategies that are effective inconstricting the capacity of the supply system to move drugs toillicit markets or in dispersing well organized drug traffickersmust be designed and used. The Objectives of the Paper The purpose of this paper is not to design an effectiveoverall drug policy. Nor is it to consider the wisdom of relyingon criminal laws against drug distribution and use to the degreewe do now. My opinion is that our current drug policy is a wiseone, and that the balance of risks favors the continuation ofcriminal laws directed against the distribution and use ofnarcotics and dangerous drugs. The aim of this paper is to take the existence of the currentdrug laws and policies as a starting point and to design astrategy to reduce supply consistent with the aims of our currentdrugs abuse policy. In designing such a policy, special attentionwill be given to the relationship between the strategy to reducesupply that is necessary to achieve the goals of our current drugabuse policy and organized crime policy. As we have seen, there is some tension between these policies.Making drug distribution illegal establishes fertile soil fromwhich existing organized crime groups might take sustenance ornew groups might arise. Thus, the continuing prohibitions of drugdistribution may exacerbate the organized crime problem. On theother hand, to the extent that organized crime groups are nowactive in producing or distributing drugs, and to the extent thatour organized crime policy makes available resources andtechniques that are effective in immobilizing such groups,organized crime policy may make an important contribution to drugpolicy. In balancing these concerns the dominant emphasis will begiven to designing a supply reduction strategy that can achievethe purpose of drug abuse policy. This perspective will beadopted not because it is obvious that an effective drug controlpolicy is more important than an effective organized crimepolicy, but simply because, if it were true that it was moreimportant to combat organized crime than to keep drugs fromillicit users, the simple solution would be to legalize the drugsso that no illegal firms could arise. Since the society does notchoose this option, it must be that we are willing to pay a pricein terms of the objectives of organized crime policy to achievethe objectives of drug control policy. The only interestingquestions, then, are how to minimize that price, and how best todeploy the special resources and capabilities or organized crimecontrol policies to further the objectives of drug policy. Thatis what we will try to discover. The Analytic Framework As we have seen, the character of the illicit drug industry isimportant to the ultimate success of both drug abuse policy, andorganized crime control policy. To define objectives, setreasonable expectations for success, and guide strategic choicesin targeting supply reduction efforts, an analysis of the illicitdrug industry is essential. The Crucial Distinction Between the "Industry" andthe "Firms" In carrying out this analysis, it is important to distinguishthe concept of the industry from the concept of individual firmswithin the industry. The industry includes everyone who isengaged in producing, importing, or distributing narcotics anddangerous drugs to illicit markets in the United States. A firmwithin that industry is nothing more than a collection of assetswhose specific uses are determined by the authoritative decisionsof an identifiable organizational unit. Obviously, the firms that make up the industry could take avariety of forms. They could represent different productioncapacities, such as a boat, a person who knows the chemistry toproduce psychoactive drugs, or $50,000 in cash. They could beinvolved in all aspects of the deal from financing throughproduction, transportation, and distribution, or they couldspecialize in only one of these functions. For any given functionthe firm may be more or less dominant in more or less localgeographic markets. They could consist of a single entrepreneurlinked to others only through the fragile ties of economicinterest, or they could include many people linked to one anotherby family or cultural ties. They could be relative newcomers orhave a long history in the industry. They could enter theindustry with hopes for a single, big score, or they could planto become or remain a permanent fixture. Often, the distinction between the industry and the firms thatcomprise it is blurred, and the industry is viewed as a singlefirm. This casual assumption is justified on one of two differentgrounds. One is that the observed performance of the illicitmarket is so impressive in terms of its operations andadaptability that it is hard to believe that it is not guided bya single intelligence. Nothing short of a single coherententerprise could accomplish the enormously complicated tasks ofcollecting raw materials, processing then, and transporting thefinished product through the mine fields created by enforcementagencies. Nor could anything other than an enterprise guided by asingle intelligence adapt successfully to the frequent changes insupply reduction strategies. The problem with this argument is that legitimate industriesaccomplish similar feats of production, distribution andadaptation all the time without a single intelligence guidingthem. The reason legitimate industries are successful is thatthere are many guiding intelligences, but none predominant. Theaggregate result of the individual choices made by individualeconomic actors may look organized in the sense that the industrygradually moves from places where enforcement has become heavy toareas where it is weaker, or it shifts from one drug to anotherdepending on consumer demand. But this orderly response need notbe the result of a wise choice by a single, powerful firm. Itcould be the natural result of the firms in the heavily enforcedareas being wiped out, and the firms in the less heavily enforcedareas growing to meet the demand. In short, the adaptations aremade at the expense of individual firms, not under their control- nor, necessarily, to their advantage. The second line of argument supporting the notion that theindustry should be viewed as a single firm is somewhat moresophisticated. It is based on the hypothesis that some illicitfirms will develop crucial specialized capabilities, and thatthese will give the firm important advantages in producing anddistributing illegal drugs, or effective control over others whodo. These special capabilities could be access to capital,connections with foreign sources of raw materials, knowledge ofhow to produce the drugs, a special tie to corrupt officials, ora general capacity for disciplined violence that could be broughtto bear on anyone who produced or distributed drugs without theirpermission. This argument depends essentially on the idea thatthere are some natural economies of scale in the illicitindustry, and that these will tend to produce a concentratedindustry. This is a more powerful kind of argument than thefirst, but it is only an assertion. It needs to be examined withboth logic and evidence. The Analysis of Industrial Organization The form of analysis that is appropriate is an analysis ofindustrial organization. An analysis of this kind rigorouslymaintains the distinction between the industry and the firms thatcomprise it. Indeed, the principal objective of an analysis ofindustrial organization is to understand the relationships amongthe structure of the industry, the conduct of the firms withinthe industry, and the long run performance of the industry. The Definition of Industry Structure. The concept of industry"structure" explicitly captures the distinction betweenthe industry and the firms that comprise it. It focuses attentionon how the activities of the overall industry are divided amongdifferent organizational units called Firms. One key concern inexamining structure is the degree of concentration in theindustry. The fewer the firms, the more concentrated theindustry. A second is the extent of horizontal and verticalintegration. Integration refers to the proportion of activitiesessential to creating a product and delivering it to a marketthat are contained within a single firm. Vertical integration ismeasured by the extent to which a firm includes all the stepsfrom extraction of raw materials to final sales to ordinaryconsumers. Horizontal integration is measured by the proportionof a given step in the production and distribution of a productthat is controlled by a single firm. The Definition of Industry Conduct. "Conduct" refersto the distinctive ways that the firms within the industry goabout their business. Specific questions might focus on theproduction technologies now commonly utilized, major factorsinfluencing costs within the industry, levels of investment inresearch and development, the rate at which new products areintroduced, or the geographic organization of the industry'smarkets. Conduct might also be concerned with institutionalrelationships in the industry; e.g., the competitive strategiesbeing pursued by firms within the industry, the relationshipswith governmental regulators, and even patters of collectivebargaining and labor relations. The Definition of Industry Performance."Performance" focuses on the question of how successfulthe industry is over the long run in delivering a product at lowcost, expanding the market, and adapting to changingcircumstances. Performance is ultimately what an industry analystis trying to understand. Indeed, the observations about structureand conduct are made principally to explain and predictperformance. The more decentralized and competitive the industry,and the lower the costs of bringing new products or newproduction technologies on line, the more adaptable and dynamicthe industry. The larger the economies of scale in operating,marketing, or bringing new products or production technologies online, the more concentrated the industry is likely to be. Themore concentrated the industry, the higher the prices and theslower the rate of innovation. Propositions such as these linkobservations of structure and conduct to explanations andpredictions of performance. Objectives in Attacking the Illicit Drug Industry To a great extent this framework of analysis can be carriedover and used in examining the character of the illicit drugindustry. But some crucial differences are worth noting. By farthe most important is that the implicit evaluative perspectivereverses when we are analyzing illicit industries. An Evaluative Perspective. In standard industry analyses onegenerally hopes for high performance from the industry. The moresuccessful it is in delivering products at low prices, expandingits market to new areas, adapting to changing economiccircumstances, and maintaining high rates of innovation, thebetter the result for the society. In the case of the illicit drug industry, of course, thesociety's hopes run in the opposite direction. High performancefrom the illicit drug industry means that it adapts well togovernment efforts to eliminate it and continues to supply drugsat low cost to illicit markets. Over the long run, this meanshigher levels of illicit drug use. In analyzing the illicit drugmarket, then, what one hopes for is a failing industry: one thatcannot overcome the hurdles set by the government in trying toget its products to market. These hopes are generally frustratedby the sheer inventiveness and adaptability of illicitentrepreneurs in pursuit of money. Nonetheless, one keeps hopingthat this industry will stumble rather than flourish. Indeed,making it fail is an explicit purpose of public policy. A second important difference is that in the analysis of theillegal drug industry, the structure and conduct of the industryhave an elevated importance. As noted above, in traditionalanalyses of industrial organization, structure and conduct haveimportance primarily as factors that influence the performance ofthe industry. In the analysis of the illegal drug industry, theyretain that importance: to the extent that structure and conductenhance or hinder the industry's long-run performance indelivering drugs to illicit markets at low prices, they are asource of interest, and a possible target of enforcement actions. What increases the importance of structure and conduct in theanalysis of illegal drug markets, however, is that they arevalued by the society independently of their impact on theperformance of the industry. Crucial questions about the conductof the firms within the illegal drug industry include the extentto which they rely on violence to maintain internal discipline oreliminate competition, and the extent to which they rely oncorruption to ward off the threat of enforcement. To the extentthat they do rely on violence and corruption as essentialelements of their business, their conduct has importance to thesociety quite apart from how these practices affect their abilityto supply drugs. Similarly, the society seems to be deeply concerned about thestructure of the illicit drug industry. Specifically, the societyseems to regard the problem as worse if the industry is highlyconcentrated and composed of a few large, durable firms than ifit were less concentrated and populated by smaller and moretransient firms. No doubt, this view derives primarily from adominant concern about the performance of the industry, and anassumption that an illicit industry, composed of a few large anddurable firms, would be more effective over the long run insupplying drugs at low cost to consumers. It is important to keepin mind, however, that a highly concentrated industry mightperform less well over the long run in delivering drugs toillicit markets than a more atomistic market. Economic theorytells us that prices would be higher in a concentrated market,and it is quite possible that innovativeness and adaptability toattacks would be less. The firms might represent more formidableenforcement targets, but the result of dismantling them might belarger and more durable than would be true in an atomisticmarket. Even if this were true, however, it seems likely that thesociety would still regard an illicit industry, composed of a fewlarge, durable firms, as worse than one composed of many smalltransient firms. The reason is that large, durable firmsconstitute a social problem independent of their ability tosupply drugs. Large, durable criminal organizations can bringmuch more powerful pressures to bear on their employees,competitors, the government officials who are pledged to attackthem, and even the communities in which they operate than couldsmaller or more transient firms. It is partly that the large,durable firms become very wealthy; partly that they can maintaintruly frightening capacities for disciplined violence; butperhaps most fundamentally that they will be around for a longtime and therefore able to reward cooperation and punishopposition that makes them so powerful. Thus, the concepts of structure, conduct and performance helpto clarify the society's objectives in dealing with the illicitdrug industry. The concerns of drug abuse policy are capturedprincipally by questions about the performance of the industry,since it is the long run performance of the industry that willdecisively shape overall levels of drug abuse. The concerns oforganized crime policy are captured principally by questionsabout conduct and structure. The concept of conduct captures theconcern about levels of violence and corruption associated withan illegal industry. The concept of structure captures thespecial concerns that are raised for organized crime policy bythe existence of very large, durable organizations, whose wealth,disciplined use of violence, and long memories make themespecially powerful. A successful supply reduction strategy,then, would leave an illicit drug industry, which is high cost,ineffective in supplying drugs to illicit markets, not veryadaptable, reluctant to rely on bribery and violence, andcomposed of small, transient firms. Competition among Objectives. We are accustomed to thinkingthat any supply reduction strategy will move us towards improvedperformance on all of these objectives, and therefore there areno trade-offs between the objectives of drug abuse policy andorganized crime control policy. We have already seen that thereis a certain tension between the aims of these two differentpolicies insofar as the criminal laws against drug distributionand use create the basic conditions under which an illicitindustry night arise. But now it is possible to see a new tensionas well, one that is not only between drug abuse policy andorganized crime control objectives, but also between differentobjectives of organized crime control policy. Ironically, a supply reduction strategy that increased thedegree of concentration in the illicit industry might achievesome important objectives of a supply reduction strategy.Economic theory predicts, for example, that the actual supply ofdrugs will be less in a concentrated industry than in a moredecentralized competitive industry. It is also likely that theviolence would be less, or at least more disciplined and focusedon those who were actually involved in the industry in a tightlyorganized, concentrated industry. Thus, a supply reductionstrategy might succeed in reducing the overall performance of theindustry and even changing its conduct to reliance on threats andbribery rather than overt violence, but do so only at the priceof increasing the size, power, and durability of criminalorganizations. Whether this would be preferred to a strategy thatreduced the concentration in the industry, but enhanced itsperformance and shifted its conduct to more random patterns ofviolence depends on how the society values these competingobjectives, and how much improved performance and violence itwould have to accept as the price of reduced concentration. Thatwould be a difficult choice. The Definition of Improvements. At any rate, the directions inwhich improvement lie, are clear, and so are the objectives of asupply reduction strategy. The first and most important objectiveis to frustrate the performance of the illicit industry - toconstrict its capacity to supply drugs to illicit markets. Thesecond is to shape the conduct of the residual industry so thatit is less violent and less corrupting. The third is to dispersethe industry so that the firms that comprise it are small andtransient rather than large and durable. How are one can go inachieving these objectives, and how sharp the trade-offs amongthem can only be answered by a close look at the factors thatshape the structure, conduct and performance of the industry. Major Factors Shaping the Industry As in any industry performance is determined at least partlyby engineering or mechanical factors: e.g., the physicalrequirements of production and distribution. To get drugs toillegal markets, firms must have access to raw materials, havethe knowledge and the equipment required to transform the rawmaterials into finished products, be able to maintain and protectinventories, and be able to transport finished products toindividual markets. In addition, the performance of the industry will be shaped byeconomic factors: i.e., the perceptions of opportunities andrisks. Those who make investments of the time and energy inproducing or diverting raw materials, in learning the techniquesand acquiring the equipment for producing illegal drugs, instoring and transporting the drugs, and so on, must have someassurance that they will make money from their investments. Theymust have some capital to give them the time and the capacity toarrange the deals that will ultimately produce satisfactoryreturns. They must also have a certain tolerance for risk - notonly the risk that they might be imprisoned for their activities,but also that they might take economic losses as a result ofsuccessful enforcement actions against them, betrayals by theirassociates, or more common economic disasters, such asshipwrecks, plane crashes, spoiled production runs, or suddenchanges in exchange rates. Unless there is a reasonable chance intheir minds that they can make enough money from illicit drugdeals to compensate them for their time and their risks, thedeals will not be made. A third factor influencing performance is the structure ofcriminal liability that surrounds the industry, for it is thelaws and the way that they are enforced that determines many ofthe opportunities and risks facing illicit drug dealers. A simpleway to think about how this factor operates is to think of thecriminal laws and the specific methods of enforcement as a kindof tax confronting the illegal dealers. To maximize their return,they seek to avoid as much of the tax as possible. They do thisby avoiding activities that are heavily taxed, by takingadvantage of loopholes in the tax laws or weakness inenforcement, by concealing as much of their operation from thetax collectors as possible, or by corrupting the tax collectors.Such activities affect both the scale and the character of theillicit industry. The Apparent Influence of Geography Geography looks like a factor that plays an important role indetermining the conduct and performance of the illicit industry.Indeed, much of our thinking about supply reduction strategies isguided by the notion that there are important "sourcecountries" that become the targets of diplomatic andenforcement initiatives. Thus, for many years, Turkey and Francewere regarded as the principal sources of heroin, although theyhave now been replaced by Mexico and Southeast Asia. Similarly,Colombia is now considered the principal source of cocaine, andJamaica a primary source of marijuana. The reason that geography seems important is that differentcountries represent different clusters of conditions that givethem a comparative advantage as a supplier of drugs to illicitmarkets in the United States. Sometimes a country becomes animportant source country because of agricultural conditions thatmake it an especially attractive (perhaps even unique) place inwhich to produce raw materials. Thus, for a while, we imaginethat opium poppies could be successfully grown in only a fewcountries in the world, and we now hope this is true of cocaleaves. In short, a country may become an importance source ofsupply due to a physical advantage. Other times it seems that a country has become a major sourceas the result of a long tradition of producing the relevant rawmaterials, or a large domestic industry that is based on them. Ineffect, the country has a unique institutional and economicadvantage because it has a large infrastructure already investedin the cultivation of the opium, coca leaves, or marijuana. Still other times, it seems that the country's advantage comesfrom week laws governing the legitimate or illicit drugindustries, or weak governmental commitment and capacity forcontrolling the illicit drug industry. Just as Las Vegas canbecome the center of gambling simply by establishing a legalregime that tolerates it, Jamaica may become a principal sourceof marijuana by being particularly lax with respect to thesuppression of illicit cultivation. Thus, while geography looks like it plays an importantindependent role in determining the character of the illicit drugmarkets, this apparent influence actually derives from the morebasic causes already noted: the physical relations governingproduction and distribution, the economic/ institutionalrelations that give economic actors reasonable assurances thatinvestments in particular activities will be rewarded, and thelegal regime that has an independent effect on the risks andopportunities confronting illicit dealers. Thus, geography maydrop out of any close analysis of the factors shaping theperformance of the illicit supply system, and be replaced by aseparate consideration of how certain countries seem to representunusually favorably combinations of the underlying causalfactors, and which ones seem particularly important. The Irrelevance of Physical Requirements While it is tempting to search for the explanation of thestructure, conduct and performance of the illicit industry in thephysical mechanics of producing and distributing drugs, there isvery little in these relationships that is unusual, or that couldconstrain or shape the performance of the industry. Many of theraw materials necessary to produce narcotics and dangerous drugsare widely available. This is true primarily because they havemany legitimate uses, but also simply because they can be grownor artificially produced in many different locations. Of course,and occasional local shortage in basic raw materials may sometimeappear. But, given the alternative sources of supply, it is hardto imagine that the shortage would last. Indeed, it is hard toimagine long run shortages in the availability of opium poppies,marijuana, coca leaves, or even chemicals used to producedsynthetic opiates, hallucinogens, and other psychoactive drugs. It is equally difficult to imagine that either the knowledgeor the equipment necessary for manufacturing illicit drugs couldbe in long run short supply. The chemical structure of theillicit drugs are well known. Indeed, they are so well known thatillicit labs are now experimenting with small manipulations ofthe chemical structure of existing drugs to determine if thenewly created drugs will produce similar or superior psychoactiveeffects. These so-called "designer drugs" challenge thelegal regime regulating drugs because they may be legal toproduce and distribute until enough experience has accumulated todeclare them a significant abuse threat. The equipment required for the production of the drugs is alsocommonplace. Indeed, heroin "labs" in Mexico oftenconsisted of little more than wash-tubs and rubber hoses. And thedrugs can be made in many different quantities with fewimplications for the costs of production. So, there seems to belittle in the technology of production that would have a decisiveimpact on the structure, conduct or performance of the industry. The Impact of Illicitness on Industry Conduct My strong conviction is that the dominant factor shaping theillicit drug industry is the simple fact that it is illicit. Thisfact has broad and significant implications for its structure,conduct and performance. The immediate consequences ofillicitness register in the conduct of the illicit firms, but thechanges in conduct have important implications for structure andperformance. The Risk of Arrest. The most obvious consequence ofillicitness is that those who produce, import, distribute or usedrugs illegally are exposed to the threat of arrest, prosecutionand imprisonment. Moreover, in some countries, they arethreatened by the seizure of any property or assets used in theirillegal drug dealing - a threat whose significance may dwarf notonly any fine they may receive, but also some jail terms. The obvious effect of threatening illicit producers,distributors and users with jail is that the dealers who remainin the business will take steps to reduce their risks, or tocompensate themselves for the risks of being is the business. Theprincipal devices for reducing risks are to keep operationssecret so that enforcement agencies cannot discover them, or tocorrupt the agencies so that even if their operations arediscovered, they are not punished. The principal devices used tokeep their operations secret are to deal with a small number ofpeople, to conceal the traces of their activities, and to screenand discipline their employees, associates and customers to makesure they are not undercover agents, and do not become policeinformants. The principal ways of corrupting enforcement agenciesare to offer money to be allowed to continue to operate, and toinform on their competitors and associates so that the police canmake arrests without harming their operations. Such efforts can only be partially effective in eliminatingthe risk of punishment. To deal in large quantities of drugs andmake money from the enterprise, one must inevitably deal with alarge number of people, only some of whom are trusted andeffectively disciplined. Thus, the risk of informants andundercover agents among one's employees, associates or customersis always present. Similarly, drug dealing always involvesleaving traces of one's activities that cannot be entirelyconcealed: physical inventories of raw materials or drugs,records of financial transactions, even records of phone callsamong the conspirators. These, too, are vulnerable to discoveryby enforcement agencies. Also, there are so many agencies andagents involved in drug enforcement activities that one can neverbe sure whether all those who pose a threat have been corrupted.Since the risk can never be quite eliminated, the dealer'sresponse is to demand additional compensation for the risks intrafficking drugs. He demands higher prices for drugs than hewould if there was no risk of going to jail. The Risk of Rip-Offs. A less obvious but by no means lessimportant consequences of the illicit status of drug production,importation and distribution is that illegal dealers areconfronted by threats from other criminals as well as byenforcement agencies. Indeed, associates, competitors andordinary armed robbers probably create greater risks for illicitdrug dealers than enforcement agencies. Partly this is becausedealers are very tempting targets. They are likely to have largeamounts of cash, or large quantities of drugs that can beconverted to cash. Also, they are unlikely to turn to enforcementagencies to help protect their operations. They have to supplyprotection against armed attack or stealing. Those in thecriminal milieu may know more than enforcement agencies about whois "holding" or currently doing business, and theseother criminals may be less constrained by the niceties of dueprocess than the enforcement agencies. Thus, other criminals maybe more strongly motivated and better positioned to attackillegal drug dealers than the enforcement agencies, and thereforepose a graver threat to the illicit dealers. The implications of this fact are that the dealers must makespecial provisions to protect themselves from this threat. To adegree, the same methods of secrecy and discipline may be ashelpful against other crooks as against the police. But it seemslikely that the threat from other crooks is more apt to be met bycapacities for violence. In general, if an armed confrontationbetween the dealers and enforcement agencies occurs, the dealersknow they will lose. They may win a local fire-fight, but thereis no way they can compete over the long run with enforcementagencies in violent confrontations. Consequently, they rely mostheavily on secrecy and corruption to deal with the threat ofenforcement. With other criminals, however, the balance of armed power isless clear. Thus, it is tempting to build capacities for violenceto protect oneself and one's business from "take-off"artists, and to establish credible threats effective againstbetrayals by associates. This capacity for violence can also beused externally to drive out competitors. But the vulnerabilityto other criminals associated with illicitness provides the mostimmediate and compelling justification for developing a capacityfor violence, as well as for secrecy and corruption. Theexistence of these capacities for violence among dealers andthose who would steal from them produces the bulk of the violencewithin the illegal drug industry. Thus, the conduct of the firms within the illicit industry isprofoundly influenced by the fact of their illicitness. They areforced to maintain secrecy, and to prevent the infiltration ofpolice agents. They must develop capacities to bribe, suborn, ormislead government agents. Also they must develop capacities forviolence to enforce contracts with associates, protect theirproperty from armed robbers, and to discipline employees.Finally, because the risks of arrest or rip-offs cannot everwholly be eliminated, they must price their products not only tocover costs, but also to compensate themselves for the risk ofarrest or financial loss they are taking by engaging in such arisky business. These effects on the conduct of firms haveimplications for structure and performance. The Impact of Illicitness on Structure The consequences of illicit status for the structure of theillicit industry are hard to estimate, for they will bedetermined by a balance of conflicting influences. On one hand,the desire to prevent the police and other criminals fromlearning about their operation will motivate illicitentrepreneurs to keep their small firms, transient, and neithervertically nor horizontally integrated. The Virtues of Small Firms and Decentralization. Smallness hasthe virtues of involving only a small number of people and asmall number of transactions. This implies both that theintrinsic vulnerability of the operations is less, and that thecontributions of any special efforts to discipline or secure theoperation will go further because there are fewer associates,employees or transactions over which to spread these efforts. Transience has similar advantages to smallness. If theproblems for illicit dealers is to avoid others knowing they arein business, they can accomplish this by getting into thebusiness and out of it before anyone knows who they are. Indeed,from the perspective of avoiding detection, the best operation isone that is both small and transient. But that firm is not worthdisrupting, also, for it could never amount to much in terms ofits ability to supply drugs, its contribution to violence andcorruption, or to become a powerful institution to the community. Vertical and horizontal disintegration also have importantadvantages in avoiding detection. A vertically integrated firmwould require some system of information-gathering andrecord-keeping to exploit the advantages of explicit coordinationacross the different phases of the operation. But these recordswould become an important source of evidence against the dealers.Similarly, almost by definition, vertically integrated firm wouldbe large and involve many transactions, and each element of thefirm would know what other elements were doing. Thus, avertically integrated firm would present more possible points ofpenetration and would be much more vulnerable to any givenpenetration, than a firm organized as a set of largely separatecells that operated relatively autonomously. Similarly, a horizontally integrated firm would also have tobe large and would have to be in contact with all firms engagedin the activities at other stages of the production process.Thus, a horizontally integrated firm in the business ofoff-loading mother ships would come to know the principalimporting firms that arranged for the mother ships to appear offthe coast, and the principal firms engaged in storage anddistribution. This would make such a firm vulnerable to betrayalby the others, compared with a firm that handled less of theoverall off-loading business. Thus, to escape detection, firms in the illicit drug industrywould choose to be small, transient and disintegrated. This, inturn, would lead to a highly fragmented - even atomistic -structure in the industry. The Virtues of Scale and Concentration. On the other hand, itis possible there are some economies of scale in the productionand distribution of illicit drugs, or some opportunities forcontrolling competition that would lead to relatively large,durable firms, and a relatively high degree of concentration inthe industry. Ironically, the principal potential for economiesof scale do not seem to lie in the areas of production ormarketing. Instead they lie in the development of capacities forcorruption and violence that will give some firms specialopportunities to operate safely and efficiently in the dangerousillicit markets. The capacity for disciplined, irresistible violence may be aparticularly important factor of production in illicit supplysystems, and may be an area where there are natural economies ofscale. As we have seen, a capacity for violence is terriblyimportant in disciplining employees to keep then from becominginformants. It is also important in being able to enforcecontracts with business associates and in protecting life andproperty from other criminals in a world where one cannot rely onthe ordinary courts and police to perform this function.Moreover, once developed for these purposes, the capacity forviolence can become important in eliminating competition, orforcing it to be small and transient rather than large anddurable. For all these reasons, a firm had a substantial capacityfor violence would have an obvious competitive advantage insupply drugs to illicit markets. To argue that violent firms would have a competitive advantageis not quite the same as saying that the obvious value of acapacity for violence will tend to produce large, durable firms,and a concentrated structure in the industry. That argument restson an additional assertion that there are economies of scale inthe development of this special capacity for violence. Thisassertion, in turn, rests on the ideal that a useful capacity forviolence consists not in the production of actual violence, butinstead in a reputation for irresistible violence that canoverwhelm (in force, viciousness, sustainability or all three)any degree of violence that another illegal entrepreneur canimagine mounting. This is important, for it is quite obvious thatreal violence can be produced quite easily and inexpensively.What is valuable violence, however, is violence that need not beused but will still intimidate and discourage others because itis there to be used and cannot be successfully resisted. To havethis capacity, a firm must have available not only a largequantity of violence and demonstrate its willingness to use it,but also be a sufficiently permanent and relentless institutionso that the possibility of an opponent challenging it andescaping without retaliation seems remote. This capacity seems to have some natural monopolisticfeatures. One can easily imagine how a single organization couldgradually corner the market for irresistible violence and createa fairly impregnable local monopoly. One can less easily butstill plausibly imagine a small number of firms with suchcapabilities co-existing in an uneasy truce, and ignoring acertain number of violations of their tacit understandings, aswell as a small amount of minor competition from transientoutsiders. What is hard to imagine as a stable equilibrium is aworld in which there are large numbers of closely matched firmsvying for the position of a recognized dominant capacity forviolence. In that world the factor of production that has value -namely, a dominating capacity for violence that is sufficient todiscipline employees, enforce contracts, and protect reliablyagainst take-offs - is not available to any firm. Each firm istherefore vulnerable to all threats that a solid reputation forirresistible violence would guard against. If the reputation for irresistible violence is valuable, ittakes substantial investment to build the capabilities, and if itonly has value when it is greater than any other competingfirm's, the importance of this factor of production will tend toproduce high degrees of concentration in the industry. This willlead to the development of a few large, durable firms in anylocal market. This is true at least in part because thisreputation for violence can substitute for a small scale inpreventing the detection of the operation. If employees,associates, competitors and customers are all afraid to giveinformation about the operations of a firm to the police or othercriminals, then it can operate at any given scale with less riskthan another firm that is similar in all respects other than itscapacity and reputation for violence. The capacity for corrupting government officials may also bean important factor of production and distribution. This mightalso be an important factor of production and distribution thatmight also tend to create larger more durable firms and higherdegrees of concentration than one might hypothesize, if one werethinking only of how the illicit firms might escape detection.The easiest way to think about the problem of corruption is toimagine that the various government officials and agencies,responsible for enforcing laws against illegal production anddistribution, have a de facto power to grant a license to illegalentrepreneurs to operate legally - or at least with no treat fromthem. Obviously, the value of this license to the illicit dealersdepends on the extent to which a given official or agencymonopolizes the legal threat to them. If a given official oragency is the only official threat against an illicit dealer, thevalue of his protection will obviously be higher than if theofficial threat against an illicit dealer, the value of hisprotection will obviously be higher than if the official or agentis only one of many potential threats against the dealer. Thus, the question of whether corruption will tend toconcentrate in the industry depends crucially on the organizationof the enforcement agencies. If the enforcement agencies wereorganized in a single agency, and if the hierarchical controlwithin the agencies was very powerful, and if the illicit firmcould corrupt that agency, it would be able to gain and hold amonopoly in the area principally by using the enforcement agencyto help it eliminate competition, while keeping it safe. If, onthe other hand, the enforcement agencies had fragmentedjurisdictions, and quite imperfect control over their agents,then they might be more vulnerable to some degree of corruption,but the significance of the corruption would be much less.Essentially, the enforcement agency could not sell an exclusiveright to operate safely. It could only sell little pieces ofinsurance against threats from specific agents or agencies. Eventhis would produce some higher degree of concentration in theindustry than if corruption were not part of the operatingstrategies of the illicit firms, since it would establish somebarriers to entry and protect the position of some firms. But itwould by no means guarantee a monopoly. The Net Result of Conflicting Pressures. Therefore, there arepressures that push the drug industry towards small firms and anatomistic structure, and others that are consistent with thedevelopment of local monopolies and relatively concentratedstructures. My strong hunch is that the net result of this willbe to produce an illicit industry that includes a heterogeneousdistribution of firms. There will be a few firms that are instrong position to exploit the economies of scale that come froma reputation for trustworthiness, and for irresistible violencein the case of betrayal. Such firms may come to account for arelatively large fraction of the drugs reaching illicit markets,but they will be a small fraction of the total number of firmsoperating. This will be true partly because it is unlikely thatthese firms will become either horizontally or verticallyintegrated. The risks of long chains of command in the case ofvertical integration, or a wide network of contacts in the caseof horizontal integration are apt to be much greater than thepotential benefits. It is also true because these firms will notbe able to prevent (and will not find it worth preventing)occasional competition from transient or small operations whichhave their own sources of supply, and their own local markets.Therefore, there will be a great many firms of different sizes inthe industry. If one were thinking about analogies from legitimateindustries, my hunch is that the best analogy might be somethinglike the real estate industry, rather than the auto industry oreven the fast-food industry. Many developers put together large,uncertain deals, rather than producing or distribution a product.Moreover, the deals are likely to involve several differentpartners, and the partnerships and roles may change from deal todeal. Those in the industry who have a reputation fortrustworthiness, "deep-pockets," strong politicalconnections, and effective lawyers are likely to account for alarge fraction of the total dollar value of the deals made. Butthere will be a great many others in the industry who do smallerdeals. The Impact of Illicitness on Performance Because illicitness affects conduct and structure, it also hasan enormously importantly impact on industry performance. Thecrucial result is that drug prices are much higher than theyotherwise would be. This is partly because the defensivestrategies mounted by dealers against enforcement agencies andother criminals translate into higher operating costs per unit ofdrug delivered, and partly because dealers demand additionalcompensation for their risks. This is shown by the fact that theprice of drugs in illicit markets is higher than the price ofequivalent drugs in legal markets by factors of 20 or 30. Almost as important is that the drugs are less convenientlyavailable than they otherwise would be. Dealers have an incentiveto conceal their activities rather than advertise then. Growth inthe market tends to happen within intimate networks of friends,rather than through public advertising and widespreadavailability. In all likelihood, these are slower and lesseffective methods of market development than the same mechanismsjoined with a legitimate distribution system. We can combine the effect on price and the effect onavailability in a single concept called the "effectiveprice" of drugs in illicit markets. That would include notonly the monetary cost, but also the amount of time a customerwould have to spend looking for the drug, and the chance that hemight fail to find the drug, or be cheated by an unscrupulousdealer. In these terms, illicitness results in much highereffective prices for illicit drugs than if they were legal. Notethat this is probably true even if publicly supported enforcementactivities were relatively ineffective. For, even if the threatfrom the enforcement agencies were removed, the threat from othercriminals would remain, and that by itself would be enough byitself to increase dramatically the effective prices of illicitdrugs. So illicitness has a profound impact on the performance ofthe industry. The fact that the price of drugs is increased by the illicitstatus of the industry is evaluated in different ways fromdifferent vantage points. Viewed from the perspective of drugabuse policy, this is desireable because it will reduce overalllevels of drug use in the population by discouraging new usersfrom continuing their drug use, and motivating older users toseek treatment and abandon their use. Viewed from the perspectiveof organized crime policy, the increased prices mean a largerflow of revenues to illicit dealers and criminal organizations.This is damaging to the objectives of organized crime policy, forit creates the impression that crime pays, and provides thenecessary financial means to enlarge illegal operations, or toconsolidate a position vis-a-vis other criminal organizations orthe enforcement agencies. Regardless of whether the economicproceeds are used by illegal dealers for consumption orinvestment, the higher revenues become a problem for organizedcrime policy. It is also possible that over the long run, the higherrevenues become a problem for drug abuse policy. This would betrue, for example, if the conspicuous consumption of wealthy drugdealers attracted more people into the industry, or if theinvestments made by more disciplined dealers allowed them notonly to dominate the supply system, but to increase its overallcapacity to supply drugs. In each case, the revenues from theindustry would be operating to increase the overall supplycapacity of the system, just as excess profits in a legitimateindustry would attract new investment into that industry. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the reasonsthat prices are high in the drug industry is precisely becausedealers are confronted by risks of violence and financial lossfrom both the government and other criminals. This fact remainstrue and continues to discourage many from entering the business.Indeed, the greater the risks, the greater the profits must be toattract any one into the business. That is the explicit purposeof making the drug business illegal and attacking itaggressively. As long as that threat remains substantial, theoverall supply capacity of the industry will be much smaller thanotherwise, even though people in the industry are making money.People do not flock to the industry, even with high prices andhigh revenues, because the risks are also high.

Thesignificance of the legitimate drug system is most obvious fordrugs such as methadone, amphetamines and barbiturates, whichhave important medical uses, and very large legitimate productionand distribution systems. Even those drugs that do not havelegitimate medical uses often have some contact with a legitimatemarket system. Some illicit heroin, for example, comes fromlegitimate opium crops grown to produce morphine. Hallucinogensand methamphetamine are often manufactured from chemicalprecursors that have significant legitimate uses. And evenmarijuana has a legitimate sector composed of researchers who areexperimenting with its pharmacological characteristics andpotential medical applications for the control of glaucoma anddepression. The existence of a legitimate sector in which raw materials,precursors, or finished goods are produced, stored, distributedand consumed has a potentially significant impact on thecharacter of the illicit industry. The reason is that diversionfrom the legitimate market becomes an alternative to whollyillicit production and distribution as a source of supply toillicit markets. Exactly what influence will be exerted dependson the size of the legitimate market, the strength of theregulatory regime that surrounds it, and whether the legitimatesystem includes the production and distribution of finished goodsor stops some place short of this goal. For drugs which have a large, loosely regulated legitimatesupply system that includes the distribution of finished goods,diversion from legitimate sources is likely to become thedominant source of supply to illicit users. For drugs that haveonly a small legitimate sector that is limited to raw materialsor precursors, the illicit supply will be dominated by whollyillicit production and distribution. Thus, the illicit demand fortranquilizers is likely to be supplied principally by diversion.The illicit demand for hallucinogens and marijuana will beprincipally supplied by wholly illicit production anddistribution. Also, the illicit demand for amphetamines andopiate analgesics, such as heroin, morphine and methadone, willbe supplied partly by diverted legitimate drugs, and partly bywholly illicit production and distribution. The existence of a legitimate sector from which drugs may bediverted to illegal use will generally improve the performance ofthe illicit market in that drugs will be cheaper and more readilyavailable than they would be if no legitimate sector existed.This is true simply because some portion of the activitiesnecessary to produce and distribute the drug will not be hamperedby the difficulties created by illicitness. Raw materials can beacquired, transformed into finished products, stored, anddistributed with fewer worries about theft and betrayal byassociates, or disruption by enforcement officials. True,operating costs will be increased by the requirements of theregulatory regime. And true, also, someone must absorb the costsand risks of diverting the drugs to illicit markets. But in alllikelihood, these costs will be much smaller than the costsimposed on the firms, if they had to assume all of the burden ofprotecting their property and enforcing contracts as they have toin wholly illicit industry. To the extent that only a portion ofthe supply system must pay these costs, operating costs andtherefore prices should be lower in illicit markets. The existence of the legitimate industry should also make theillicit markets much more flexible. If an illicit amphetaminelaboratory finds that it cannot obtain precursors from thelegitimate market, it can always go into the business of stealingthem from the legitimate sector. Once it has the capacity tosteal precursors, the illicit firm might find it easier to stealfinished products. In short, the existence of the legitimatemarket allows illicit dealers the options of relying on theft orfraud with or without the collusion of people within thelegitimate industry to meet market demands - options that wouldnot be available if there were no legitimate market. The impact of the legitimate market on the structure of theillicit industry is also quite important. The crucial variablesare the places where leaks occur in the process of production anddistribution and the size and regularity of leaked quantities. Obviously, if only raw materials and precursors leak from thelegitimate system, the illicit system will have to developillicit production capabilities to transform the raw materialsinto finished goods. This will exert a slight centralizing trend,for the knowledge and the equipment necessary to produce thedrugs constitute a form of capital that must be amortized andthat means those who possess these will stay in business longenough and produce enough drugs to achieve this goal. Thebreak-even point may not require a very large or very durablefirm. The point is that the diversion of raw materials will beassociated with larger more durable firms than the diversion offinished goods. When finished goods are stolen, the firm may have no capitalto amortize, and may stay in business only long enough to disposeof an existing quantity. Of course, a large theft, such as atruck hijacking, can make a firm look like a major trafficker. Ifthe firm arranges to continue hijacking drug shipments, it maybecome a major drug dealer with an unusual source of supply. Inthe more likely case, however, a large theft of legitimate drugswill produce a large, but transient firm. It will go out ofbusiness shortly. The other possibilities are that small quantities of finishedgoods are diverted either continuously or irregularly from thelegitimate supply system. This form of diversion will producesmall firms that are either durable or transient depending on howfrequently they go back to the well. Thus, the supply of drugs that have legitimate uses to illicitmarkets will be decisively influenced by the size and characterof the leaks from the legitimate system. The earlier in theprocess of production and distribution the leaks occur, thelarger and more continuous they are, the more the illicit supplysystem will be composed of large durable firms. The later in theprocess of distribution, and the smaller and more erratic theleaks, the more the industry will be atomized. Thus, one mightexpect the illicit market in tranquilizers and methadone to becomposed primarily of small, transient firms fueled by smallscale thefts. The illicit markets in amphetamines andhallucinogens are likely to somewhat more concentrated with moreof the illicit supply in the hands of larger, more of the illicitsupply in the hands of larger, more durable firms. Different Drugs, Different Industries So far, our analysis of the illicit drug industry hasabstracted from the particular features of the principal drugs ofabuse in the United States. We have treated heroin, cocaine,marijuana, hallucinogens, amphetamines, barbiturates andtranquilizers in a similar analytic framework. But to analyze thesupply systems for these drugs from the same analytic perspectiveis not the same as assuming that the supply systems will besimilar. It is only to assume that they will be pushed in similardirections by the factors we have considered. Exactly how farthey will be pushed in one direction or another strongly dependson all the factors we have considered, including how zealouslythe illegal supply systems are controlled by regulatory andcriminal enforcement. Heroin Heroin, for example, seems to be primarily a problem of whollyillicit production and distribution. The fields in which theopium poppies are grown are generally illicit fields in countriesthat cannot adequately enforce existing laws prohibiting thecultivation of opium. Similarly, the processing of the raw opiuminto heroin occurs principally in foreign countries - probably toreduce the bulk of the material to facilitate internationalsmuggling. Because the volume of heroin is so small, it comesinto the United States through many different devices - in thecarry-on luggage of pilots, hidden in small cans of tomatoes andolive oil, concealed in secret compartments built into cars, andso on. In the United States the distribution systems seemmoderately tightly concentrated with significant localmonopolies, but little vertical integration. There is probablysome degree of horizontal integration at the importing stage, andit is at this stage that the concentration of the distributionsystem is probably the greatest. Perhaps the few largest firms inany given city control more than two-thirds of the total volumeof heroin in the city, with some cities in the U.S. serving astransshipment points for other cities. This relatively tight andconcentrated structure is the result of the fact that theenforcement pressures are probably still the heaviest againstheroin dealers. Cocaine The cocaine supply system seems quite similar to the one forheroin. It is principally a problem of wholly illicit productionand distribution. The sources of raw materials and finishedproducts are primarily foreign. The physical volumes to behandled are small enough to make concealment of the drugs arelatively trivial matter and to allow smugglers to use a varietyof different methods for bringing the drugs into the country. Theaverage size of the deals measured in terms of financialrequirements seem to be approximately the same as those thatoccur in the heroin market. The major difference between the heroin and the cocaine supplysystems seems to be that the cocaine system is less concentrated,and more violent than the heroin market. There seem to be manymore entrepreneurs who enter the cocaine business on a short termbasis. Moreover, none of the groups operating on a more permanentbasis seems to have established predominance in the industry.Thus, it is not surprising that this market is more violent thanthe heroin market, for there are cash, drugs and market positionup for grabs in a way unlike the heroin market. Marijuana Marijuana is similar to heroin and cocaine in that it is awholly illicit system with predominantly foreign sources of rawmaterials. Three principal differences seem to make the marijuanasupply system quite different, however. One crucial difference isthat the bulk of marijuana per dollar of value is so much greaterthan that of heroin and cocaine that the smuggling problem isenormously exacerbated. A hundred thousand dollars of heroin orcocaine can easily be held in a suitcase, but to carry a hundredthousand dollars worth of marijuana, one needs a small truck,boat or plane. Because marijuana is so much more visible thanheroin or cocaine, the primary mode of smuggling is in largeloads landed between ports of entry rather than infiltratedthrough ports of entry in the huge volume of cargo and peoplethat daily cross the U.S. borders. This also implies that manyspecialized firms might grow up to cope with the special problemsof smuggling marijuana. A second difference between heroin and cocaine on the one handand marijuana on the other is that the pressures in the illicitindustry seem less. It is not that marijuana dealers do not facesubstantial financial risks. Indeed, it seems that quite theopposite is true. The best current estimates indicate thatmarijuana dealers lose from a quarter to a third of theirshipments to enforcement agencies. Instead it seems that thelosses are primarily financial, and primarily inflicted by thegovernment. Other criminals do not seem to prey on marijuanatraffickers in the same way that they attack heroin and cocainedealers. Moreover, even if the government seizes property andarrests the dealers, the prison terms meted out to marijuanatraffickers seem less severe than for those who traffick in otherdrugs. Since the marijuana dealers face smaller and less drasticthreats from both the government and other criminals, themarijuana market seems less preoccupied by the problems ofsecrecy, discipline and security than the heroin and cocainemarkets. The net result of this is an industry that is probablyless concentrated then either the heroin and cocaine market, andalmost certainly less violent. The third important difference shaping the marijuana industryis the existence of small scale domestic production anddistribution as well as foreign. Indeed, the potential for smallscale domestic cultivation of marijuana makes the marijuanamarket more like the market for barbiturates and tranquilizersthan for heroin, because some portion of the overall illicitdemand will be met by those who grow their own. It is this factthat guarantees the overall industry cannot become veryconcentrated, just as it is the widespread availability ofbarbiturates and tranquilizers through small scale diversion fromlegitimate sources that prevents a concentrated illicit industryin these drugs from developing. Hallucinogens, Barbiturates and Amphetamines The supply system for hallucinogens seems to be primarilydomestic illicit production, although it is possible that somedrugs come from Mexico or Canada. There is a degree ofconcentration in this industry as a result of specializedknowledge, and the creation of brand names to which consumersbecome loyal. It seems to operate with relatively little relianceon either violence or bribery, probably because the industry issufficiently small to not be worth the time of enforcementofficials or other criminals. The industry that supplies barbiturates to illicit marketsseems to depend primarily on diversion from the legitimatemarket. Thus, its structure mirrors the character of the leaksfrom the legitimate system. This seems to produce a highlyatomistic market composed of small or transient firms. Again,there is little reliance on either violence or corruption becausethe economic stakes seem too small to warrant such risky conduct. The amphetamine industry seems to be a combination of thesupply system for hallucinogens and barbiturates. There seems tobe small scale illicit production and distribution that isprimarily domestic, but also from our near neighbors. There isalso diversion from the large legitimate supply system. The netresult is an industry that is high in performing, relativeatomistic in structure, and relies little on either violence orcorruption. Designing a Strategy to Attack the Illegal Drug Industry From the perspective of drug abuse policy the primaryobjective of a strategy to attack the illegal drug industry is toincrease the effective prices of drugs in illicit markets. Givenour analysis of the factors shaping the structure, conduct andperformance of the industry, it is reasonable to suppose thatmaking the production and distribution of drugs illegal will tendto make drugs more expensive and less available than they wouldbe if they were legal. The important policy question is how theresources of the government - its diplomatic initiatives, itsinterdiction efforts, and its criminal investigations - might bedeployed to maximize the impact of supply reduction efforts onthe effective prices of illicit drugs. Priorities in Attacking the Illegal Drug Industries One way to establish priorities is to determine whichparticular drugs seem to be causing the greatest social problems,and which present opportunities that would give supply reductionefforts relatively powerful leverage. The worse the drug, and themore powerful the leverage that can be exerted, the higher thepriority. Of course, the question of which drugs pose the greatestthreat to the society is much debated. One way to resolve theissue is to gauge the number of chronic users of each drug, andto weight that number by the seriousness of the health, economicand social problems that the chronic users of each drug suffer.By this reckoning, heroin, amphetamines and barbiturates tend tocome out on top as the worst drugs. A second standard would be to consider which drugs are mostwidely used, and therefore operate as the principal transmitterof an illicit drug culture and the most common introduction todrug use for young children. By this standard, marijuana andtranquilizers would probably come out on top. A third standard would be to determine which drugs seem to beassociated with the most money, violence and corruption, andattack that drug as the principal threat to the society. Thislast standard would probably make cocaine and heroin the dominanttargets of drug policy. In thinking about which of these standards night beappropriate to use in deciding which drugs caused the greatestsocial problems, it is worth trying to keep the separateobjectives of drug abuse policy and organized crime policy inmind. The principal objective of drug use abuse policy is tominimize the social problems associated with drug use. A keyinstrument of that policy are criminal laws controlling thesupply of drugs. These policies succeed when there are few peopleusing drugs in patterns that create grave threats to their healthand economic welfare. In effect, we use criminal laws andcriminal enforcement to achieve a social welfare objective. The principal objectives of organized crime policy are tosuppress the provision of illegal goods and services thatconstitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violenceand corruption that is more characteristic of organized crimegroups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent theemergence of very large, durable organizations with welldeveloped capacities for violence and corruption. There is a substantial overlap in the goals of organized crimepolicy and supply reduction efforts insofar as organized crimepolicy takes the control of the supply of drugs as an importantobjective, and insofar as the illicit supply systems includedviolence, corruption and large firms. But to the extent that thecore of organized crime policy is really concerned with thedisruption of major criminal organizations, there is an overlapbetween the core of drug abuse policy and organized crime policyonly insofar as the drugs are supplied by rich, violent andpowerful criminal organizations. As we have seen, that is true ofonly a certain number of drugs, and not necessarily the drugsthat pose the greatest threats in terms of widespread anddangerous consumption. In fact, the third standard described above is closer to adescription of the core objectives of organized crime policy thanto the core objectives of drug abuse policy. In essence, thesociety has to decide whether it means to go after the drugs thatcause it the most problem in illicit use, or whether it shouldattack the drugs that are supplied by the nastiest and toughestdealers. These are not necessarily the same. The Instruments of a Strategy Against Illicit Drug Industries Once the society has implicitly or explicitly established itsobjectives, it must then look to the available instruments of asupply reduction strategy. Again, there are many different waysone can think about the available instruments. Attacking Different Drugs. One way is to think about them interms of the particular drugs they attack. Thus, one candistinguish the instruments of heroin policy (which include theeffective control of legitimate opium in Turkey, the suppressionof illicit crops in Mexico and Afghanistan, the encouragement ofcrop substitution in Thailand, the creation of specialized heroindetecting devices at U.S. ports of entry, and the targeting ofheroin importing and distributing organizations, and even theoccasional attacks on street level dealing in notorious areas ofa city) from the instruments of a marijuana control policy (whichincludes diplomatic initiatives and foreign aid to Mexico andJamaica, the eradication of illicit fields, the training ofmarijuana sniffing dogs to stand guard at the border, themobilization of the Navy and Coast Guard to aid in theidentification of ships engaged in large scale smuggling, and soon). The point is that many policy initiatives are specific to,or have their maximum impact on, one drug rather than another,and it is a useful exercise to see how our efforts are deployedagainst particular drugs. Operating in Different Locations. A second dimension in whichstrategies against the illegal drug industry can be described andevaluated is geography. One can talk about the division betweenthe international drug control effort and the domesticactivities. Among the international efforts, one can talk aboutpolicy towards Southeast Asia (which would be principallydirected at heroin), or towards Colombia (which would beprincipally directed against cocaine), or towards Mexico (whichwould embrace heroin, marijuana and amphetamines). Within thedomain of domestic supply reduction efforts, one can discuss theallocation of enforcement efforts across major cities in theUnited States, and this, too, has implications for the differentdrugs attacked. Enforcement efforts in New York and Los Angeleswill probably give more emphasis to heroin and cocaine thanefforts in Kansas City or St. Louis. Targeting Factors of Production. A third dimension incharacterizing and analyzing supply reduction policy instrumentsis the factor of production and distribution that is theprincipal target. Thus, one can distinguish eradication and cropsubstitution programs, which are directed at raw materials; fromfinancial investigations, which attack the capital of illicitdealers; from interdiction programs which attack goods intransit, from conspiracy investigations, which are designed toimmobilize trafficking network; from street level enforcementwhich is designed to discourage advertising and the developmentof new markets. Of course, many instruments allow one to reachother targets as well as its principal target. Indeed, conspiracyinvestigations are often built from the discoveries made ininterdiction and street enforcement programs. The point is thatthese different policy instruments have different factors ofproduction as their proximate targets. To the extent that somefactors of production and distribution are scarcer than others,the relative importance of the different supply reductioninstruments in constricting the supply of drugs may be gauged andappropriate adjustments made in the supply reduction strategy. Relying on Different Agencies. A fourth way of thinking aboutsupply reduction policy instruments, and probably the mostcommon, is in terms of the agencies that are principallyresponsible for carrying out different activities within theoverall supply reduction effort. Thus, one thinks in terms of theinternational supply reduction program as the principalresponsibility of the State Department; the interdiction effortas the primary responsibility of the U.S. Customs, Border Patrol,and Coast Guard with occasional assistance from the U.S. ArmedForces; the domestic investigation program as the primaryresponsibility of DEA and the FBI; and the street levelenforcement effort as the primary responsibility of the nation'sthousands of local police departments. Thinking about the supplyreduction effort in these terms has the advantage of bringingimmediately to mind which agencies are available for supplyreduction efforts, and of suggesting approximately where they canmake a contribution both geographically and in terms of squeezingparticular factors of production and distribution. It has thedisadvantage, however, of not sharply distinguishing among thedifferent efforts in terms of either drugs or specific factors ofproduction and distribution. The Strengths and Limitations of Alternative Instruments For purposes of a broad brush strategic analysis, we will usethis last set of categories, since they are the terms in whichmost of the policy discussions at the federal level are now beingcarried out. Our task will be to determine the potential of eacharea in minimizing the supply of drugs to illicit markets in theU.S. That, in turn, depends on our ability to see how each ofthese programs affects the factors of production and distributionfor the major drugs of abuse. The International Program. The international drug controlprogram has two principal liabilities as an instrument of supplyreduction efforts. The first is that this program is inevitablyhostage to the interests and capabilities of foreign governments:the U.S. can do no more in this area than other governments willallow it to do. Of course, there are numerous ways in which theU.S. government can increase the motivation and capacities offoreign governments to control drugs that reach U.S. markets. TheU.S. can indicate the importance it attaches to drug controlamong other interests it is pursuing within a given country; orit can appeal to obligations a country has under internationaltreaties; or it can appeal to the country's self interest bydocumenting the extent of the country's domestic drug problem. Onthe capacity side, the U.S. can contribute money, or particularkinds of equipment, or technical assistance in the forms ofspecific on-site advice, or more generalized training of drugcontrol officials. These specific measures constitute the dailyactivities of the international program. In the end, though, theyrun up against more or less unmovable barriers, such as thelimited control of central governments over out-lying areas of acountry, or the inefficiency and corruption of governmentagencies. Against these obstacles there is often little that theU.S. government can do. The second limitation is that the bulk of this program seemstoo targeted on the raw materials for heroin, cocaine andmarijuana. Arguably, this is not particularly effective, sincethere is not particular reason to believe that the raw materialsfor these drugs are in long run short supply. Indeed, all ourexperience and intelligence suggests that potential growing areasfor these drugs are widespread, and that the elimination offields in one place will fairly soon be replaced by cultivationelsewhere. These limitations are sufficiently severe that it wouldprobably be a mistake to rely on the international program as theprimary instrument in a supply reduction strategy. It simplycannot do enough work reliably enough to merit that position.Having said this, however, there are some very important thingsthe international program can do that will make an importantcontribution to the overall effectiveness of supply reductionefforts. The first is that it will occasionally occur that the standardefforts of the international program suddenly become effective.This usually occurs when a country important in supplying drugsto the United States suddenly becomes highly motivated to controldrugs. When this happens, support from the United States canoften result in a significant shortage of the drug. Typically,the shortage lasts no longer than a year or two as the illicitindustry adjusts to the new conditions. But even so, thatshortage is worth producing. That is particularly true for drugsthat are unusually dependence producing, for the shortage meansthat a cohort of children in the ages of maximum vulnerabilitysquirts through that period of relative shortages with much lowerprobabilities of dependence or addiction. Indeed, this is what happened in the early part of the 1970's,when Turkey suddenly shut down its legitimate production of opiumand helped to produce a two to three year shortage in the supplyof heroin. The effect of this success was high effective pricesin the United States, reduced incidence of heroin use, and ashift to Mexico and Southeast Asia as the principal sources ofsupply, although for a while at lesser volumes than had been truewhen Turkey was also a supplier. Keeping open such opportunities, and being in a position toexploit them when they come along, are the principalcontributions of the international drug program. Hut one cannotalways count on such successes. It is important, then, that theinternational program continue, trying to increase the likelihoodthat it can occasionally produce such successes, but no oneshould rely on it as the principal supply reduction instrument. A second way that the international program can be helpful isby stepping up its efforts to support international criminalenforcement. In essence, the focus of the international programmight usefully shift from crop eradication, to efforts to denyinternational traffickers "safe havens" anywhere in theworld. This would mean concretely increased progress innegotiating extradition treaties with countries that now harbortraffickers, and improving operational coordination betweenforeign and U.S. police agencies to take advantage of bothextradition and investigations and prosecutions within the hostcountry. Such a thrust has potential for two reasons. First, it is anarrowly focused program. It has none of the logistical andbureaucratic difficulties of massive crop control programs.Second, it is targeted against a factor of production anddistribution that is probably in long run short supply, namelyindividuals with a sufficiently well established reputation forboth reliability in successful transactions and viciousness inbetrayals, who become the primary people with whom large drugdeals can be made. If this is the factor in long run short supplyin the illicit industry; and if the international program couldsqueeze this factor even more by denying notorious dealers safehavens anywhere in the world; then the international programwould have another more reliable and more powerful way of makinga contribution than cultivating the motivations and capacities offoreign governments to control illicit crops. Interdiction. In recent years, the interdiction program hasprobably been the fastest growing component of the supplyreduction effort. The growth has come primarily as a result ofengaging the U.S. Coast Guard and other military agencies in thepursuit of smugglers on the ocean and in the air. The results ofthis effort can be seen in the dramatic difference in the priceof drugs landed in the U.S. as compared with the price of drugsoff-shore, or in foreign source countries. The principal problem with interdiction as the dominantinstruction of supply reduction efforts is that it is principallyfocused on a single drug - marijuana. That is particularly trueinsofar as it concentrates on bulk shipments clandestinely landedbetween ports of entry, for marijuana is the only drug whosevolume restricts smugglers to these methods of getting the drugsacross the borders. Smugglers of heroin and cocaine have manymore options, and much more of these drugs seem to come across inrelatively small containers through ports of entry. Thus, theengagement of the Coast Guard, the Navy, the Air Force, and theFederal Aviation Administration, turns out to be an initiativethat is primarily targeted against marijuana. To the extent thatone thinks marijuana is currently a high priority drug tocontrol, this may be counted a benefit rather than a problem. Butto the extent that one thinks other drugs are higher priority, orto the extent one wanted flexible supply reduction instrumentsthat could be used for controlling several different drugs, thecurrent interdiction program has important limitations. The interdiction program has a further limitation. It isprincipally targeted on finished inventories of drugs. There is acertain, concrete satisfaction in capturing drugs that wouldotherwise reach illicit markets. But as in the case of cropelimination, one can wonder whether the inventories are what isin long run short supply. When we think about legitimate firms,we don't think of their inventories of finished goods as beingparticularly important. Obviously, the inventories have value,and to the extent they are eliminated, the firm had less capitalthan it otherwise would. But the inventories usually reflect onlya small portion of the total value of the firm. When Tylenol hadto be taken off the market, for example, no one expected thecompany to go out of business, even though a month's worth ofproduction had to be written off, and their reputation had beenseriously tarnished. Similarly, it is hard to understand why we think it is soimportant when drugs are seized. This may be important if thefirm was a short term operation, and the seized shipmentrepresented a large fraction of its total assets, but there is noparticular reason to believe this. Most of the time it seems thatshipments are divided up precisely to hedge against thepossibility that he drugs will be seized, and this seems to be alikely event. Current estimates indicate that somewhere betweenone-quarter and one-third of all marijuana shipments are seized,but this has had little impact on the effective price ofmarijuana. Thus, our experience and our reasoning suggest thatfinished goods are not a factor of production and distributionthat is in long run short supply. Consequently, a policyinstrument directed primarily against such inventories will notexert enormous leverage on the long run effective price of drugsin illicit markets. Domestic Enforcement. The standard criticism of the domesticenforcement program is that it is "too far from thesource" of drugs to allow effective control. By thisreckoning both the international and the interdiction programsare preferred instruments because they attack the chain ofproduction and distribution at an earlier stage than domesticenforcement. A second criticism is that the quantity of drugsseized in the domestic enforcement program is too low to allow itto have much effective control. A third criticism is that toomuch of the effort within the domestic enforcement program goesinto low level cases, which are farthest from the source andinvolve the smallest quantities of drugs. The difficulty with these criticisms is that they rely onassumptions - with little evidence or reasoning behind them -about the best way to control the supply of drugs. In fact, theyemphasize physical over economic relationships. A priori there isno particular reason to assume that resources are better spent"nearer the source." True, if one stops the drugsearlier rather than later on need not worry about the laterstages; and, true, the drugs may be at their maximumconcentration with respect to volume at the point they areprocessed into finished products. But neither point indicatesthat he source is the most important point to attack. As we haveseen, it may be quite difficult to mount an attack at that point.Moreover, both arguments place too much emphasis on the drugs andnot enough on the entrepreneurs and firms whose continueddetermination and adaptability keep the drugs flowing, even ifproduction runs are spoiled and inventories seized. If the principal difficulties that confront dealers inproducing and distributing drugs are risks posed by enforcementagents and other criminals, then the crucial factors ofproduction and distribution are not raw materials and technologyand warehouses, but the determination and capacity to completetransactions in this risky environment. Those may be qualitiespossessed by specific individuals or trafficking networks - notthe raw materials, not the finished inventories, not even thefinancial capital. If these observations are accurate, then anyinstrument that attacked the capacities to complete risky transactions would be more effective than those that attacked rawmaterials or inventories. It is here that domestic enforcement operations haveadvantages as an instrument in a supply reduction strategy. Theprincipal objective of domestic enforcement is the traffickersthemselves. The drugs are important only as convincing evidencethat will be sufficient to jail, and therefore presumablyimmobilize, the traffickers. In addition, the tactics of domesticenforcement operate principally on the capacity to executetransactions. The principal tactics include informants,undercover agents, and wiretap investigations. The first twoattack the ability to make transactions by forcing dealers to bewary of associates, employees and customers, since any of thesemight become an informant or an undercover agent. The third makesit difficult for traffickers to communicate efficiently withassociates, employees and customers. Therefore domesticenforcement presses hard on the factors of production anddistribution that seem in long run short supply. It is worth noting that slowing transactions and forcingdealers to be cautious has value at many different stages ofproduction and distribution. Even at the lowest levels ofdistribution there are some advantages in forcing dealers to becautious, for it prevents the aggressive recruitment of newcustomers and makes it more difficult even for regular consumersto find drugs. In short, street level enforcement increases theeffective price of drugs in illicit markets. At intermediate orhigh levels each transaction that is slowed reduces the overallcapacity of the system to supply drugs, and each traffickingnetwork that is eliminated results not only in loss of currentinventories, but also in future capacity to supply. Moreover, it is possible that the same techniques of attackingtransactions, and immobilizing those networks that have developeda continuing capacity to execute transactions in a riskyenvironment, would have enormous value in the internationalprogram as well as in the domestic one. Indeed, while one cannotassume that foreign countries have laws enforcement agencies thatallow them to attack criminal trafficking organizations, it seemsthat it is primarily convention that makes us think of theinternational program as focused on raw materials, and thedomestic program as focused on trafficking networks. Inprinciple, one could have a criminal enforcement program thatmoved across national boundaries. And that might hold the bestchance not only for minimizing the supply of drugs to illicitmarkets, but also for advancing the subjectives and using theresources of organized crime policy. An Alternative Approach to Attacking Illegal Drug Industries If the right way to think about strategies against the illegaldrug industry is to guess which factor of production anddistribution is in long run short supply and then to devise astrategy that presses hardest on that factor, and if the factorin long run short supply is the capacity to make transactionsquickly and effectively, then a different way is opened to thinkabout the strategy against the illegal drug industry.Specifically, the principal aim should be to frustratetransactions and immobilize the largest traffickingorganizations. With this as the principal aim the way that we think abouteach of the other instruments changes. Of course, theinternational efforts to control legitimate crops and eradicateillicit fields retain their special, occasional importance, andthe separate arguments for maintaining pressure at the streetlevel remain strong. But we can also see that the internationalprogram, interdiction, and domestic enforcement all representdifferent opportunities to slice into the illicit industry, andcreate possibilities for developing cases against illicittraffickers. To see how this alternative strategy would work, itis useful to introduce some different analytic terms. Patrol versus Investigation. If the goal is to immobilizetrafficking organizations that are able to complete transactionswith ease and efficiency, the central problem is to determine whothe traffickers are and to develop evidence against them. Thissounds like a problem of criminal investigation, and so it is.But all investigations must begin somewhere. In ordinary criminalinvestigations the start is usually provided by a victim orwitness to the offense or by physical evidence available at thesite of the crime. In narcotics investigations there is novictim, the witnesses are likely to be implicated in the crime,and the physical evidence will not reveal much. On the otherhand, the traffickers are likely to continue committing offenses,and therefore the opportunity to observe a crime occurring ishigh, if the enforcement agencies can get themselves intoposition to see it. In practice this means that narcotics investigations areextremely dependent on informants and undercover operators, whocan provide evidence themselves or produce sufficiently preciseand accurate information to justify a wire-tap or other lessintrusive but more expensive and less penetrating form ofsurveillance. They can position the evidence-gatheringcapabilities of enforcement agencies and how to infiltrateundercover agents into the illicit industry. The question thusbecomes how to develop and use informants and how to useinformants and how to infiltrate undercover agents into theillicit firms. One answer to that question is to attack the illicit supplysystems in the places where it is least protected. This means onthe streets in central cities where the distribution system mustfinally come into the open. Or, it means at the point that isinherently vulnerable, where drugs are moved physically from oneplace to another. Or, it means as raw materials are beingcollected from remote fields in foreign countries. Surveillanceand undercover operations conducted in these areas will not onlyfrustrate transactions at these levels, and remove small stocksof drugs, but they will also produce the rumors, the physicalevidence, and the potential informants who might provide thebasis for more intrusive and determined investigations of largernetworks. This will not always work, of course. Many people arrested atthis level will be small scale, transient operators. Others willbe employees, but they may be unable to supply information. Stillothers may know a great deal but be afraid to reveal it.Moreover, there are other ways of developing informants. One canoffer large payments to those who are greedy, or protection tothose who are afraid, or both to potentially valuable sources.And, just as low level enforcement operations against streetdealers, smugglers, and collectors in foreign countries canproduce potential informants,, all successful investigationsagainst medium and high level investigations can also yieldinformants. Therefore, successful cases can be built from manysources other than low level cases. But the argument is that a high volume enforcement effort atlow levels is often quite valuable as a source of rumors,intelligence and informants. In fact, there is an argumentsupporting low level enforcement. Even more unexpectedly, thereis an argument for a low level enforcement that is not directedor guided by intelligence about the operations of majortraffickers. The strength of investigative efforts is their capacity tomake connections among known facts and inform enforcementagencies how to position themselves to penetrate existingtrafficking organizations and develop evidence for a successfulprosecution. The weakness of investigation is that it becomesincreasingly narrow and discounts information that cannot berelated to something that is already known. In attackingsomething as mysterious and dynamic as the illicit drug industry,this tendency to become narrow is potentially very dangerous.There is always the chance that one is concentrating on only asmall piece of the overall industry and that there is a newer orbetter shielded piece that has so far escaped notice. If this istrue, the only way that enforcement agencies could discover thisis to look in areas where they didn't expect to find something.That is the role of broad, untargeted low level enforcementagencies. Like pickets and patrols sent out by a main militaryforce to maintain contact with a mysterious enemy force, agentson the street, at the border, and in the bazaars of foreigncountries help the investigative forces stay in touch with theemergence and development of new trafficking capabilities. For analytic purposes it is useful to think of these broad,low level enforcement operations as "patrol"operations, which are scanning for drug offenses, and theremaining pieces as "investigative" operations, whichcan develop the leads into powerful cases that immobilize majortrafficking organizations. Moreover, in many ways, the patroloperations perform better, if they are broad and random, ratherthan narrowly targeted. A random strategy is more successful indeterrence, and in disclosing previously unsuspected traffickingnetworks. The Role of Intelligence and Conspiracy Investigations. Totake full advantage of the potential relationship betweeninvestigative and patrol functions and to produce the maximumimpact on trafficking organizations, it is necessary that somepreviously neglected capabilities be more fully developed. Twoare particularly important: the intelligence function within theinvestigative agencies, and the capacity to develop and prosecuteconspiracy cases within investigative and prosecutorial offices. By the intelligence function, I mean the capacity to makedisciplined use of the information about trafficking networksthat is potentially available to the investigative agencies. Thisis essential not only to take full advantage of any opportunitiesthat present themselves, but also to make sure the investigativeagencies are not misled by informants. As we have seen, there isalways an incentive for traffickers to inform on theircompetitors. And there is always an incentive for enforcementagencies to use the information and keep the informant alive.This is acceptable as long as the informant is not more importantthan the traffickers he is delivering to the enforcementagencies. But if the informant is himself a dealer, then theresult of his informing looks like he and the enforcement agencyare colluding to maintain his position in the market. The onlyway to guard against this is to have relatively accurateinformation about both the informant and the target and to havesomeone other than the case agent monitoring this situation. Thatis something that a good intelligence analysis function couldprovide. The capacity to make conspiracy cases is essential becausethere are many traffickers who can be revealed only throughconspiracy indictments. They may never be in direct contact withdrugs, or with the violence and corruption that provide thestructure within which the drugs can be confidently moved fromplace to place and from person to person. In addition, conspiracycases have the advantage of simultaneously immobilizing manypieces of a trafficking network, leaving no remnants from which anew network might be constructed. If a single person is removed,he may be replaced. If the entire network is eliminated,replacement is more difficult because none of the personalrelationships that are so essential to successful traffickingremain. The challenges to investigators in making conspiracy cases arepartly matters of technique. Electronic surveillance is often anessential ingredient, as are financial investigations. And eachrequire the development of special skills. Hut producing highquality conspiracy investigations also requires a change inattitude. They require patience - including situations whereenforcement agencies allow some dealers to continue operatingeven though they are indictable. They also require riskingcertain cases that are certain, for a future case that may or maynot develop. Finally, the prosecution of conspiracy cases oftendepends on telling convincing stories rather than hard physicalevidence. Even though the stories night be a more accurateaccount of what has been happening than the hard physicalevidence, it requires a real knack for analysis and inference tomake the story solid and convincing. In short, patience, awillingness to take risks for an uncertain gain, and thought arerequired, and these are not always qualities plentiful inaction-oriented enforcement agencies. Yet, without these, theaggressive actions might have less impact than they otherwisecould. Summary and Conclusions Criminal statutes directed at illicit drug trafficking and useare an important part of drug abuse policy. If they wereperfectly effective in discouraging people from drug traffickingand drug abuse, there would be little need for any otherinstruments. The problem is that these laws are imperfectly effective: theyleave a residual market that consists of a continuing (butsmaller) demand for drugs, and a continuing (but smaller)capacity to supply drugs to that market. To deal with thecontinuing demand, the society relies on drug treatment andpreventive education programs. To deal with the continuingsupply, the country invests in diplomatic efforts to motivateforeign countries to control drugs destined for the U.S.,interdiction efforts to keep the drugs from landing on ourshores, domestic enforcement to disrupt trafficking networks anddiscourage the aggressive marketing of drugs to non-users,regulatory efforts to keep legitimate drugs contained inlegitimate channels of distribution and use. These efforts on the supply side of the illegal drug marketare helpful in achieving the purposes of drug policy. Theyincrease the price and reduce the availability of drugs, andtherefore discourage new drug use and motivate older users toabandon their drug use. But the laws create a problem fororganized crime policy, for they establish the soil from which anillegal industry can grow. The firms that continue in theindustry will make a great deal of money as compensation for therisks they run by continuing in the business. In addition, theywill engage in violence and corruption as crucial elements oftheir strategies for surviving in an illicit industry. Finally,some of the individuals and organizations involved in drugtrafficking may grow to become powerful criminal institutionsthat seem to defy effective control by law enforcement agencies.To the extent that these illicit firms become more adept atdealing drugs, they may become not only an organized crimeproblem, but an increased threat to the objectives of drug abusepolicy. Thus, the special instruments we associate with organizedcrime policy must be deployed not only to deal with the organizedcrime problem that is created by our drug abuse policy, but alsoto prevent organized criminal groups from defeating the purposesof drug abuse policy. Viewed from the perspective of drug abuse policy, the centralobjective of a strategy attacking the illegal drug industry is tominimize the capacity of the illicit drug industry to supplydrugs to illicit markets. In terms of traditional analyses ofindustrial organization, this objective can be described asminimizing the "performance" of the illicit industry. Viewed from the perspective of organized crime policy, thecentral objectives are to prevent the development of wealthy andpowerful criminal groups and to reduce the violence andcorruption associated with the illicit drug industry. Again, inthe traditional analyses of industrial organization, theseobjectives can be captured by attacking the structure and shapingthe conduct of the industry. There may be some tension between the objectives of drug abusepolicy on the one hand, and organized crime on the policy on theother. To the extent that the drug laws create the conditionsunder which an illicit industry might arise, there is an obviousconflict. Legalization of the drugs would almost certainlyincrease the number of chronic, intensive drug users andtherefore make the drug problem worse. But it would alsoeliminate drugs as an organized crime problem. Beyond thisobservation is another paradox, however. From the perspective ofdrug abuse policy, a highly concentrated industry may bepreferable to an atomized industry. A concentrated industry mightsupply fewer drugs at higher prices than an atomized industry.And, although each firm in the industry may be harder to attackeffectively, the impact of a successful attack might be largerand more enduring than the results of ten successful attacks onsmaller firms that accounted for a smaller portion of the totalsupply capacity and were easier to replace. From the perspectiveof organized crime policy, however, a concentrated industry wouldbe worse because it would imply the existence of large, enduringorganizations of substantial power and influence. What is not inconflict, however, is the need of both drug abuse policy andorganized crime policy to develop and use tactics that aresuccessful in attacking large, entrenched criminal organizations.This is useful to drug policy and essential to organized crimepolicy. In controlling the supply of drugs to illicit markets theUnited States relies on many instruments, in addition toattacks" on organized criminal groups that deal in drugs.There is an "international program" that tends to focuson the production of raw materials to produce heroin and cocaine.This has the advantage of occasionally producing a significantbut short-lived result when a foreign country's increasedmotivation and capacity to deal with the problem eliminates animportant source of supply to the U.S. But the value of theinstrument overall is limited by the widespread availability ofraw materials and the fact that U.S. objectives are alwayshostage to the motivations and capacities of foreign governments. There is also an "interdiction program" designed tointercept the drugs and shipment before they cross U.S. borders.This has the advantage of creating a significant obstacle totraffickers and inflicting economic losses on traffickers as aresult of seizures. It has the disadvantages of focusingprincipally on the inventories of drugs rather than on theorganizations that continue to send them, and of being relativelyless successful in dealing with heroin and cocaine than withmarijuana. Finally there is a "domestic enforcement program",designed to attack domestic trafficking organizations, and todiscourage the aggressive marketing of drugs through street levelenforcement. This program has the advantages of focusing on thetrafficking organizations and engaging the substantial resourcesof the nation's 400,000 local police officers. It has thedisadvantages to being only occasionally successful ineliminating major trafficking organizations. What appears to be missing in this common conception of thenation's strategy against the supply of drugs to illicit marketsis precisely the perspective that a focus on internationalcriminal organizations would bring. It seems likely that thecapacity to execute large scale transactions in the riskyenvironment of an illicit industry is in long run, short supplyin the illicit drug industry. The firms that can overcome thesedifficulties are likely to be large scale, enduring,organizations with a well established reputation for irresistibleviolence. Thus, these firms - in all likelihood, internationalfirms - should become the main targets of a supply reduction/organized crime policy. If this is the principal target, one's view of how the societyshould deploy it resources should change dramatically. Theinterdiction and domestic enforcement programs are suddenly seenprincipally as "patrol operations", which can produceintelligence and informants to be used in mounting attacks onmajor trafficking organizations. Moreover, the focus of theinternational program should shift from concerns about cropcontrol to the support of foreign enforcement efforts and thenegotiation of treaties, which would allow the more convenientprosecution of drug traffickers whose crimes cross nationalboundaries. Finally, major investments should be made in thecapabilities of intelligence agencies and an orientation towardssustained conspiracy cases among investigators and prosecutors.This strategy holds the greatest potential to achieve theobjectives of both drug abuse policy and organized crime policy.Moreover, this strategy depends most heavily on the continuingdevelopment of our capacity to deal with organized criminalgroups no matter what illegal goods and services they happen tobe supplying.

Rosenthal, M.D. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.Rosenthal is President of the Phoenix House Foundation, a drugrehabilitation program. There is a popular perception these days that America islocked in a "no win" struggle against drugs. Thisnotion of "the endless battle," in which we seem unableto prevail, that has prompted a good many lawyers, scientists,and writers to suggest that it might be time for the UnitedStates to quit. Some Americans have always believed that the use of certainillicit drugs is not such a terrible thing and others have arguedthat the government has no right to tell citizens what they canor cannot ingest. But the strongest opposition to the nation'sdrug laws and policies has come from those who believe that theyshould be scrapped because they do not work well. The latestconverts to this cause contend that legalization of marijuana andcocaine (some would include heroin) would eliminate drug profitsand crime overnight and substantially reduce the costly burden ofenforcing drug laws. The "quit now" crowd plainly does not recognize thatthere is a world of difference between "not winning" awar and "losing" one. The war against drugs, althoughit is going badly at the moment, is far from lost. But quittingnow and attempting to solve the drug crime problem throughlegalization would he tantamount to losing - at least in terms ofthe impact on drug abuse. The notion that we could make drugs legal, whilesimultaneously mounting (as some advocates of legalizationsuggest) a massive public education campaign to discourage theiruse would give cocaine and marijuana the same status ascigarettes. The most likely result, according to the formerdirector of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, would be atenfold increase in cocaine use. There would be just about asmany Americans using cocaine as now smoke cigarettes. Another reason not to give up the fight is because we can win.After more than 20 years of treating and curing drug abuse, I seeenough evidence to convince me that the war is winnable - notnow, but in time. It is winnable because what denies us victorytoday is the nature of the war we are waging and not the natureof the enemy we are fighting. The war is going badly for much the same reasons that any wargoes badly. In part, it is inappropriate strategy fighting thewrong enemy, in the wrong place and with the wrong weapons. Inpart, it is a failure of will. We are on the defensive, with battle lines stretching alongour borders. Our main weapon is interdiction. Most of the billiondollars a year the Federal government spends enforcing drug laws(two-thirds of all it spends to fight drug abuse) goes to haltthe flow of illicit drugs into our country. Yet, the drugs keep flowing, even though 13 tons of cocaineand 1,500 tons of marijuana (with a total street value of $11billion) were seized by federal agents last year. It would seemthat when $5 million or $50 million or $500 million worth ofdrugs is impounded, the total available for distribution would hereduced by a like amount. Hut that is not the case. Drugs lostthrough seizure are instantly replaced by producers andimporters. The more Federal agents seize at our end of thepipeline, the more drug traffickers feed into the other end.Although interdiction efforts have expanded dramatically and vastquantities of drugs have been seized, the flow to the street hasdiminished hardly at all, and cost to consumers has actuallyfallen. In frustration, Americans have turned their ire on producingnations. Apparently, we feel more comfortable and justifiedpressuring Colombians, Peruvians and Bolivians to stop producingcocaine than pressuring Americans to stop using it. In spite of minimal success, we remain committed to battlingdrugs primarily by reducing supply rather than by reducingdemand. Yet, the supply side is obviously harder to hit and tohurt. Producers are beyond our reach. Major dealers aresophisticated, secretive, and ruthless, willing to acceptenormous risks and enormous losses as long as profits remainequally enormous. The demand side, however, is easier to reach. It is vast,barely concealed at all these days, and it consists of the morethan 20 million Americans who now regularly use illicit drugs.What's more, the demand side is where all three weapons at ourdisposal can be deployed - not only law enforcement, but drugtreatment and drug prevention as well. Our reluctance to attack demand as vigorously as we attacksupply reflects nothing less than a failure of will - not on thepart of the administration, law enforcement agencies or drugabuse professionals, but on the part of the American public.Public attitudes and public expectations determine how we goabout fighting this war, limit how much we can do and how far wedare go. What limits drug treatment is not just reduced governmentsupport. Even if resources were available, there is no way wecould help the great majority of drug abusers in this country toovercome their drug dependency because most of them are notseeking help. They are not seeking help because society does notrequire them, and the law does not compel them. Limits on what drug prevention can accomplish reflect what canonly be called a public demand for selective prevention theprevention of some but not necessarily all drug use. Just abouteveryone wants to prevent one kind of drug use or another. Mostparents believe that kids shouldn't use drugs. Most employers areconvinced that workers ought not use them. The public in generalwould like to see criminals stop using drugs and stop stealing inorder to buy drugs. But, beyond this point, public demand softensconsiderably and attitudes become ambivalent. Nowhere is our ambivalence more evident than in our attitudestowards law enforcement. We are content with a "trickledown" approach - one that focuses almost exclusively onputting major dealers behind bars. But we learned during the daysof strict enforcement in New York State during the 1960's andfrom recent crackdowns on street dealers in New York City, thatthe real victories of law enforcement are not the number ofdealers or users arrested or convicted but the number motivatedto seek treatment. We know that when it becomes too dangerous ortoo difficult to sell drugs or to buy them, then a great deal ofdrug use will simply disappear and demand for treatment will riserapidly to the level of real need. Lenient or selective enforcement of drug laws - what amountsto non-enforcement and de facto legalization - in some areas - isa reflection of our ambivalence. It comes down to the way thatAmericans feel personally about drugs - not only about our ownuse, but about use by our grown and half-grown children and byour friends, and about what is wrongheadedly called"recreational" use of marijuana and cocaine. While itmay make us uncomfortable, most of us do not think of it in thesame way as we think about drug use by nine- and ten-year-olds orabout the heroin addiction of criminals. And we are generallyunwilling to see our friends and children at risk of arrest andprosecution because of drug use. But I do not believe we can win the war against drugs until wehave positive consensus on the strict enforcement of drug laws.However, we need not make that decision any harder than it mustbe. We don't have to agree that drug users should go to jail. Thepurpose of drug laws is not punishment - certainly not whenapplied to users. These laws serve what must be recognized as apublic health function - a means of controlling a contagiousdisease by imposing on its carriers the requirement of whateverit takes in the way of education and treatment to overcome theirdrug use. We are not likely to see this consensus come soon. Too manydrug-using young adults are still convinced they enjoy somespecial "right" to use illicit drugs and believe theycan handle them. Too many Americans are torn between the urge tocondemn behavior, of which they disapprove, and the need totolerate behavior they have somehow come to believe is a matterof individual freedom or simply none of their business. But both drug users and drug tolerators ignore the contagiousnature of drug abuse. The hostess who overlooks a little discreetafter-dinner pot-smoking or the professional who pointedlyignores covert coke-sniffing by his or her colleagues musteventually come to realize that a person can no more tolerate alittle recreational drug use than he or she can tolerate a littlerecreational smallpox. As for users, even those convinced thattheir own drug habits are under control cannot guarantee that thefriends, coworkers or teenagers they influence will be able toavoid drug dependency and the other high risks of drug use. Noris there any basis for them to believe that they will continue toenjoy immunity from the costs of drug use - if indeed they enjoyit now. Broad societal disapproval of illicit drug use is neededbefore we can come to a consensus about strict drug lawenforcement. Needless to say, active disapproval and the use ofinformal social sanctions will make more aggressive lawenforcement irrelevant in most cases. The hostess who is certainenough of her own unwillingness to tolerate pot smoking in herhome doesn't need to call the cops to keep her guests fromlighting up - no more than she need call them to stop her guestsfrom stealing the silver or spitting in the soup. Nor doprofessionals who recognize the danger of drug use to theircolleagues, need to turn to the law. They have far more effectiveways of bringing the behavior of these colleagues into line -once they accept the need to draw such a line. In many ways our society resembles the American family in the1960's. Many parents then believed they were doing their childrena favor by laying back and not taking a hard-line stand againstdrugs. They allowed youngsters to stumble through the drugexperience. Only later they came to realize the costs. Thosecosts ran high, both in chronic impairment and lost educationaland career opportunities. As a result, parental attitudes havechanged markedly. Parents are now taking the hard line, which isreally the loving line, one that shows responsible concern. More recently, the Navy has demonstrated how to go aboutattacking drug use on the demand side. While it brought heavyweapons into play - drug tests and disciplinary actions - it alsoeffectively reduced widespread tolerance for drug use. Bystressing the interdependence of seamen, the Navy began replacingthis attitude with a far more responsible one expressed by themotto: "Not on my watch, not on my ship, not in myNavy." This is the kind of attitudinal change I expect to seeoccurring throughout the country over the next decade. It isalready underway. Adolescents have become far more critical ofdrug use by their friends, and this is the result not only ofbetter drug education in the schools, but also of more awarenessof drug dangers on the street. Employers are now responding toincreasing evidence of economic costs directly attributable todrug use in the work force. So, there is every reason to believe that public attitudesabout illicit drugs will become firmer and more responsible. As aresult, the limitations on what we have been able to achievethrough prevention, through treatment, and through lawenforcement, will gradually be removed. They will no longerdictate strategy that prevent us from moving as aggressivelyagainst domestic demand as we do against foreign supply. If law enforcement is to work effectively in cooperation withtreatment and with prevention in this attack on the demand side,then we need to adopt consistent goals. While we should certainlypersist in interdiction and target major dealers, we cannot focusmost of our energy and resources on these high visibilityefforts. It is on the street that the final battle is going to bewon, and it will be won by constant pressure, over time, thatwill be felt by every drug dealer and every drug user. This kind of pressure will not result in any impressive stringof convictions, but it will respond directly to the desperateneeds of drug-ridden communities. It will strengthendrug-troubled families, and it will improve the quality of lifefor millions of Americans. This kind of pressure, supported by a popular mandate, willresult in the gradual erosion of the drug market and the gradualdecline of drug use. Demand for treatment will grow. Preventionwill cease to be selective but reach out broadly across allsociety. And drug abuse, while it may never entirely disappear,will cease to pose any substantial threat to the nation, itsyouth.

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Government Publications | America's Habits America's Habit Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, & Organized Crime President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 Consultant Paper: Preventing Drug Abuse: What Can We Do? By Dr. Arnold M. Washton. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.Washton is Director of the Addiction Research and TreatmentCenter, The Regent Hospital, New York, New York; and ResearchDirector of The National Cocaine Hotline "800-COCAINE,"Fair Oaks Hospital, Summit, New Jersey. The most dramatic increase in drug use has occurred since the1960's, a time of radical change in political and social beliefs,lifestyles and mores. Traditional values, authorities, andrestrictions on behavior were vehemently challenged. Psychoactivedrugs and the breakdown of traditional taboos against using thembecame symbols of the rebellion against the established order. Wehave come to recognize in the 1980's that we are paying a veryhigh price for the casual attitude towards drugs that developedin the 1960's. Much misinformation has been corrected, and wehave begun to formulate a more realistic appraisal of theproblem, but now we must take specific actions to reduce thedemand for drugs. Interventions that merely condemn drug use and try to frightenchildren about the potential dangers ("scare tactics")are futile. The most effective prevention strategies are thosethat address the factors that make drugs attractive and thwartthe process that leads youngsters to try them. Children use drugsfor many different reasons. Usually there are at least severalfactors that enter into the decision to experiment or continuewith drug use. Drug use itself is no evidence that parents havefailed to properly raise their children. Many children with agood family upbringing have yielded to the enormous outsidepressures to use drugs. The influence of peers can often overrideeven the best parental input. Effective drug abuse prevention must address the most basicand fundamental forces that promote drug-taking in our society.These fall into two main categories: supply and demand. Reducing Supply Reducing the supply of illicit drugs is an obvious way ofcurtailing use. Although this does little to alter the demand fordrugs, the widespread availability and abundant supplies of manydifferent types of powerful mood-altering substances makes iteasier for our citizens to become involved in drug use. Itreinforces the notion that illicit drugs are an expected part ofAmerican life. People are more likely to try drugs when they aresurrounded by them - and children are no exception. Most Americanadolescents know someone who "deals" drugs, uses drugs,or is able to get them. To counter the supply problem, we must continue to enforce andstrengthen our laws against the manufacture, sale, and possessionof drugs. We must also take a firmer stand against drug-producingcountries that receive American foreign aid. The failure of Prohibition is a dramatic example of howdifficult it is to eliminate the use of a drug by law enforcementefforts alone; especially when the drug is so well-entrenched insociety. Nonetheless, to legalize drugs, such as cocaine,marijuana, or heroin would cause nothing short of a nationaldisaster. When drugs are cheaper and more readily available, morepeople use them, become addicted to them, and suffer seriousconsequences to their health and functioning. Legalization ofdrugs would create an epidemic of unprecedented proportions. Although enforcement efforts are necessary to check abuse,they cannot prevent the problem by themselves. Neither cantreatment programs, which are utilized only after a serious drugabuse problem has been identified. Reducing Demand Prevention of drug use in the United States must focusintensively on the problem of demand. The cultural forces thatencourage and perpetuate drug use in our society must beeliminated. We must recognize that drugs have become adeeply-ingrained part of American life and that prevention cannotoccur unless social attitudes toward drug use change. Changingsocial attitudes toward drugs is a difficult undertaking, but notan impossible one. Many segments of society must become involvedin the effort. The message that drug use is unacceptable,unhealthy, and unnecessary must be communicated in a credible andconsistent manner by the family, schools, media, businesscommunity, medical and legal experts, politicians, professionalathletes, and other public figures. This message must bereflected in every aspect of American life including education,entertainment, business management practices, and lawenforcement. Being free of drugs must become a highly desirablepersonal attribute: one that is seen as mandatory for success inour society. One might hope that non-involvement with drugs wouldbecome at least as desirable as physical fitness andattractiveness. Several prevention strategies are outlined below. Recommendations 1. Public Education and Media Campaigns. The media ispotentially one of our most powerful prevention tools. It couldbe used to better educate the public about the dangers of drugsand to change attitudes about drug use through direct andindirect communications. Public service messages, educationalprograms, documentaries, and greater efforts to eliminatepro-drug programs, might help to counteract accepting attitudestoward drugs. 2. School-based Prevention Programs. Every school system inthe United States must have an active and creative drug abuseprevention program. Prevention efforts, such as saying"NO" to drugs and learning of their potential dangers,must start in the early grades, not just in high school. Studiesshow that drug use often starts before the 7th grade and that bythe time youngsters reach teenage it may be too late to changetheir attitudes about drugs or their willingness to"try" drugs. Nonetheless, early identification ofdrug-abusing youngsters and swift efforts to ameliorate theproblem are essential in our nation's high schools. In this regard, the "Student Assistance Program"(SAP) in New York's Westchester County has served as a modelprogram to other school systems around the country. The SAP isbased on the EAP (Employee Assistance Program) model usedsuccessfully in business and industry, utilizing on-sitesubstance abuse counselors, who are especially skilled atidentifying drug-abusing youngsters and providing the necessaryassistance or referral. 3. Education of Health Professionals. Despite epidemic levelsof drug abuse over the past two decades, most healthprofessionals receive no formal training in the diagnosis andtreatment of drug dependency. This situation must be corrected bymandating that a core curriculum in the clinical management ofdrug abuse problems be part of the training of physicians,nurses, psychologists, social workers, and other healthprofessionals. Drug Testing in DWIs. Currently, not a single state in the United States requires drug testing of drivers stopped for suspected driving under the influence of alcohol. Someone "stoned" on drugs may be able to pass a breathalyzer test with no difficulty, but still be too impaired to drive safely.

It also shows very clearly howprohibition warps society with irresistible incentives. This version of the story is excerpted from THE LONG THIRST-PROHIBITION IN AMERICA: 1920-1933 by Thomas M. Coffey WW Norton& Co, New York City 1975 SYNOPSIS: George Remus was born in Germany in 1876 and migrated toChicago at the age of 5. His father was incapacitated when he was 14 and Georgesupported the family by working at a pharmacy, which he bought atage 19. Within 5 more years, he bought another drugstore,married, and had a daughter. He became a lawyer in 1900, at age24. He specialized in criminal defense, especially murder, andbecame rather famous. By 1920 he was earning $50,000 a year (whengold was $20 per ounce). He divorced after developing an ongoingaffair with his beautiful and ambitious secretary (Imogene), whohad a 13 year-old daughter (Ruth). Alcohol Prohibition started inJanuary 1920, and within a few months Remus saw that his clients,a generally crude and ignorant lot, were becoming very wealthyvery quickly. He was sure he could do better than them with hisintelligence and knowledge of the law. He memorized the Volstead Act (that enforced prohibition) andfound loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmaciesso as to sell liquor to himself under government licenses for medicinalpurposes. Most of the liquor would disappear on the way tomarket. He moved to Cincinnati because 80 percent of America'sbonded whiskey was within 300 miles, and bought up most ofAmerica's best-known whiskey manufacturers. In less than three years he made $40 million ($760M in 1995dollars). He bribed hundreds of police, judges, and governmentofficials including $500,000 to the U.S. Attorney General. George and Imogene held a lavish party at their new mansion onNew Year's Eve of 1922-23. The guests included 100 couples whowere as well-connected as one could imagine. At dawn the Remus'spresented all their male guests with diamond jewelry, and gaveeach guest's wife a brand new automobile for the drive home. Thiswas the high point. Prohibition enforcement stepped up shortly and Remus foundhimself sentenced to two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary,which was (for rich inmates) much like a luxury hotel. While Remus was in prison, his wife Imogene took up with anextremely handsome prohibition agent named Franklin Dodge. Dodgesoon resigned from the Bureau of Prohibition. Together, he andImogene liquidated Remus' assets and hid as much of the money aspossible. They did various unkind things to him such as: Imogene gave George $100 as his share of the proceeds when she sold the Fleischman Company. At one point she tried to have him deported, claiming his father had never become a citizen. Dodge and Mrs. Remus reportedly offered a gang $15,000 to murder George. Imogene proceeded to divorce him in late 1927. On the day thedivorce was to be finalized, on the way to court Remus had hischauffeur chase the cab carrying Imogene and her daughter throughCincinnati, finally forcing it off the road. Remus jumped outscreaming and shot her dead while her daughter tried to stop him. Remus the expert criminal defender was now on trial for hislife. The trial made national headlines for a month, sharingfront pages with Lindbergh's flight to Paris. Remus pleadedtemporary insanity, a novel approach at the time. Having long been the most generous man in town, he was verypopular in Cincinnati, and he so successfully vilified Imogeneand her boyfriend Dodge that the jury deliberated only 19 minutesbefore acquitting him by reason of insanity. The courtroomerupted in shamefully exuberant jubilation. The state of Ohio then tried to commit him to an insane asylumsince the jury found him insane, but prosecutors were thwarted bytheir previous claim (backed up by the prosecution's threewell-known psychiatrists) that he could be tried for murderbecause was not insane. Remus tried to get back into bootlegging, but soon retiredwhen he found that the market had been taken over by vicious,well-armed gangsters. He moved across the Ohio river to a(relatively) modest home in Covington, Kentucky, and lived outhis life for another 20-odd years in relative obscurity.

Schaffer Some of us are destined for greatness. And theothers . . . There are a certain number of people in the world who believe,for whatever reason, that they have the one true answer to somemajor problem of their time. For a few of them, the belief isstrong enough that they charge off like Don Quixote, arrogantlydetermined to make the whole rest of the world conform to theirview of reality. For a tiny, rare percentage of them it is anactual historical truth that they have the one true answer to amajor problem. By far the majority, however, are just plain,garden-variety nuts destined to go to their deathbed thinkingthey almost had it. If you happen to be a person so afflicted,how can you tell whether you really are one of these uniquepeople in history, or just a plain, old nut? Consider, for example, the true story of Emperor JoshuaNorton. Joshua Norton was a businessman in San Francisco in the1800's. In the 1840's, just before the Gold Rush, he tried tocorner the market on rice and failed. He went from being verywealthy to being destitute overnight and the experiencecompletely shattered his reason. A couple of months after thisevent, he put on a formal admiral's uniform, complete with goldbraid and epaulets and strode in to the office of the newspaper.He handed the editor a large, official looking proclamation whichstated in quite formal language that, due to popular demand, hehereby declared himself Emperor Norton I of San Francisco,California, and Mexico. He bade all his subjects show him loyaltyand the other courtesies due a person of such eminent stature. From the pictures of Emperor Norton, it is immediatelyapparent that this guy has gone around the bend and ain't comingback. His eyes pointed in different directions, and neither onequite caught straight ahead. His uniform was formal to the pointof almost gaudy and, at the same time, it was quite apparent thathe and soap were not of regular acquaintance. The editor, with a rich sense of humor, decided to publish theproclamation on the front page of the newspaper, in allseriousness. The citizens of San Francisco, being what they are,immediately decided that this sounded like a good idea and, byunanimous acclamation, accepted Norton as their Emperor. It isundoubtedly the only time in history they ever had an unanimousvote on anything. He reigned for about forty years. During that time he ate inall of the finest restaurants and slept in the finest hotels forfree -- because he was the Emperor. He had three seatspermanently reserved in the front row of the San Francisco operahouse -- one for him, and one each for his two dogs. Twice a yearhe would review the police and fire departments as they paradedby, and then he would make a grand speech to the assembledcrowds. He printed his own money, which was accepted in businessestablishments around San Francisco as legal tender. Whenbicycles first came out, they got him a bicycle, too, and helooked all the more daft because of it. When one of his dogsdied, 10,000 people turned out for the funeral to console theirgrief-stricken emperor. When the Civil War rolled around, hegraciously offered his alliance and military support to AbrahamLincoln, who politely declined. Make no mistake about it, the Emperor Norton was as good aloony as you have ever run across and I can't help feeling that aman who was that intelligent must have had some idea of just howcompletely nuts he really was. Now here's the problem. During his reign as Emperor, Nortoncame up with three major ideas: 1) He called upon the other leaders of the world to join himin forming a League of Nations where disputes between nationscould be resolved peacefully. 2) He suggested that parts of San Francisco Bay be filled into make more room to build. 3) He proposed that a suspension-span bridge be built acrossthe spot where the Golden Gate stands now. He even laid out acomplete design that looks remarkably close to the bridge thatwas built sixty years after he died. He correctly predicted thatonly a suspension span bridge would have the strength to spansuch a large stretch, and the flexibility to stand up under theextreme stress which would be placed on such a structure. He didthis at a time when the only suspension bridges ever built wererope bridges in remote parts of Africa. Of course, when he proposed these ideas, the response was longand uproarious laughter -- the Emperor was up to his old tricksagain. In time, all of his ideas became reality. At the time, noone believed him. It has occurred to me that Jesus must have had the sameproblem. Think of what must have happened when he showed up forhis high school reunion. "Hey fellas," He says. "You'll never believewhat happened. It turns out I really AM the Messiah." "Yeah, right," his school chums say. "If you'rethe Messiah, where's your Porsche?" That's probably why he spent all his time doing miracles liketurning water into wine -- nobody took him seriously until heshowed up with the booze. So put yourself in Emperor Norton's position and consider whatyou might do. Suppose you are strolling down the street one day,perhaps toking your favorite blend, and a big bolt of lightningcomes out of the sky and blasts you right out of your shoes. Whenyou come to, you are thoroughly convinced that you have the onetrue insight which, unique among men, has given you the answer toone or more of society's most troubling problems. What are you todo? If you keep quiet about it, the world could be missing one ofthe best emperors ever to come along. Everyone loses, includingyou. If you act on it, tell everyone about it, and attempt toinstall yourself as emperor then you could do some real good forboth you and posterity. Certainly, if you can really save theworld then it seems almost a moral obligation to try. Of course,if you try, you have to face the fact that, statisticallyspeaking, it is far more likely that you are a nut than anemperor, and far more likely that you will be laughed at thantaken seriously. There have been lots and lots of nuts, and onlya handful of emperors. So what should you do? I think the only thing you can do isact on the belief, keep an enormous sense of humor, and becontent with the fact that you might wind up in the encyclopedianext to Emperor Norton. But that's just my take on the situation.

Schaffer This is a true story. The facts have not been embellished. Infact, I left a lot of stuff out. When I first met Art in the late 1960's, he had just gottenout of prison the first time and was in college, desperatelytrying to make a go of his life. He was a bit scroungy in hisappearance, but everybody was a little scroungy in those days andthe truth was that Art never did have the money for fine clothes.He did the best he could. Art was one the nicest, friendliest,and most agreeable people I ever met. As a friend, I enjoyed hiscompany on every occasion and found that Art was not a completeangel (neither was I, for that matter), but there was no reasonto ever believe that he might be any real threat to society. But Art was the unluckiest soul I have ever run across. Forexample, the first time Art went to prison, it was for stealinghis own motorcycle. He was later arrested and/or went to prisonfor burglarizing his own apartment, stealing a mattress from aSalvation Army box, and for selling marijuana that even thepolice knew wasn't his. Those are only a few of the misfortuneswhich befell him and I haven't even gotten to the part about hislawyer. I will explain. Stealing His Own Motorcycle When Art became old enough to get a driver's license, heworked hard and saved his money until he was able to buy thevehicle of his dreams, a three-wheeled motorcycle. When hethought he had enough money, about $1,000 as I recall, hesearched around and found a three-wheeled motorcycle for sale ata local wrecking yard. The owner of the wrecking yard was notwell-renowned for his honest business dealings, and Art probablyshould have been more cautious but Art was so dazzled with theprospect of fulfilling his dream that he bought it anyway. As Arttells it, the owner of the wrecking yard made certain promisesabout the mechanical fitness of the vehicle and Art quickly foundout that the vehicle was in no shape to be driven. Art called the owner of the junkyard, raised the riot act, anddemanded that repairs be made immediately. The owner of thejunkyard told him to bring the bike on over and he would fix itup. Art did so. About a week later Art showed up to pick up his bike. It wasall repaired and ready for the road, complete with a bill fromthe junkyard owner for several hundred dollars worth of repairs.Art went ballistic, screaming and shouting that he had beenrobbed and that the junkyard owner had warranted that the vehiclewas in good shape when he bought it. It was an old story, theused car dealer with a mechanic's lien against the injured buyer- who are you going to believe? Art left in a rage and his common sense, which never was ingreat supply, left him completely. The next weekend, he went tothe wrecking yard when it was closed, cut the lock on the gate,went in, got his bike, and took it home. On Monday morning, it was perfectly obvious to the junkyardowner what had happened. The lock was cut and only one thing wasmissing. This didn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out. He hadlong experience in turning such situations to his advantage. Hequickly called the police, reported the theft and, in addition,claimed that several thousand dollars of other goods had beentaken. Who can tell what is missing from a junkyard? The police simply stopped by Art's house, found the bike inthe driveway, and hauled him off to jail. The DA then trumpetedthe news that a major theft ring had been broken and shipped Artoff to prison. The proof that Art was part of a major burglaryring was supplied by the fact that there really wasn't muchevidence. They expected, from the junkyard owner's description ofthe incident, that there would be tons of stuff in Art's garage.As it was, there was nothing but the bike which indicated onlyone possible conclusion - he must have stolen tons of the stuffand been able to fence all of it in less than 48 hours -obviously a major theft ring. The DA and cops got a lot of goodpublicity for saving the community from this awful scourge. Finepolice work saved the day, they said. The junkyard owner got Art's money, the bike, and payment fromthe insurance company for the items "stolen" but notrecovered. Art's lawyer got a mortgage on Art's parents' house.The situation worked out great for everybody, except Art. Acouple of years later, when I met him, Art was still dealing withinsurance company people who were pursuing him and his parentsfor reimbursement of the stuff he never stole. For that he got a sentence of about five years, which netteddown to about 18 months in prison. He might have deserved a dayin jail and a short lecture about mechanics liens. When I walked down the street with Art, or appeared in anypublic place, it was immediately apparent that the SacramentoCounty Sheriffs had it in for him. I am not sure whether theyreally believed that Art ran a major theft ring as had beenalleged or whether they just didn't like his looks, or justdidn't like Art. I suspect it was the latter. He was an easytarget to pick on, and my personal impression was that they didit just because a number of them were plainly sadistic and theyliked easy targets. From that point forward, Art was likely to be stoppedanywhere, any time, by any Sheriff who happened to see him,without any real cause that I could determine. They just made ita point to hound him wherever they saw him. The Mattress Incident Art got out of prison and enrolled in the local juniorcollege. Art had no money and his parents had been effectivelybankrupted by the legal experience so Art was in a daily strugglejust to keep food in his belly and clothes on his back. But therewas no question that he was trying to get an education and pointhimself in the right direction. Because of the financial strains at home, Art moved out of hisparents' house and got a small two-room cottage."Small" is the operative word. The "bedroom"was literally not big enough to put a double bed in, and thekitchen was smaller. Mice and roaches? Of course. It was simplythe best Art could do. Life was extremely tough for Art. There wasn't much employmentavailable for anyone, let alone ex-cons, and he lived aday-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence. Beset by financialpressures, he turned to dealing marijuana on a small time basis,using some of the contacts he had met in prison. That income was"iffy" at best and Art had to use nearly all of it justto eat, pay the rent, and support his dilapidated pickup truck,which meant he didn't have any furniture. That is, the only thinghe had to sleep on was the linoleum floor. He went out driving with his friend John one night and noticeda mattress that someone had dumped at a Salvation Army donationbox. It seemed pretty clear to both of them that Art was just thekind of person for whom such a donation was intended, so theyproceeded to load it in to the back of Art's pickup truck. Asthey were doing so, the Sheriff pulled up. John, a talllong-legged guy, had an ounce of weed in his pants so he quicklyhurdled two or three six-foot fences and was gone into the night.Art was stuck. The deputies started their standard routine of harassing Artfor everything they could think of. They first hit him with everykind of mechanical citation they could on the truck, but thatwasn't much. Then they told Art they had found a joint on therunning board. Art, by this time, had learned the drill andpointed out that, realistically, such a charge would never stickand would just be a waste of time for both of them. Frustrated,the cops decided to charge him with stealing the mattress. Art,of course, clammed up and said nothing. They stuffed Art and the mattress into the back of theirpatrol car and drove down to the main jail in downtownSacramento, about fifteen miles away from where Art was arrested.When they got downtown, they talked it over with their superiorsand decided that - despite all the danger that mattress-stealingrepresented to the community - there was no way they could makethe charges stick in court. The reason was that they had caughtArt with the mattress half in, and half out, of his pickup truckand they couldn't tell for sure whether Art was stealing themattress, or dropping it off. I am sure it disappointed them. So they went to Art, gave him the news and showed him the exitdoor. He asked for a ride back to his truck which was greetedwith great hilarity all around. Art just turned slowly and walkedto the door. As he reached the door they called out "Wait!Don't forget your mattress!" They explained that he certainly couldn't leave his mattressthere and would have to take it with him. Art considered tellingthem that the mattress wasn't really his, but quickly realizedthat, if he did so, and refused to take the mattress, they wouldbust him again for stealing it. He asked for a ride again which,he later told me, provoked absolutely panic-stricken laughter."They were in tears!" he said. Art left the building dragging his mattress behind him, andwent out on the street to try to hitchhike home. He was tired,looked a little scroungy anyway, and was carrying a mattress, allof which is a real hindrance to efficient hitchhiking. Heconsidered just dumping the mattress and walking home, but therewere regular police patrols going by to watch his progress andmake sure that he didn't litter. Then it began to rain. Holding the mattress over his head allowed him to keep therain off of himself, but it meant that the mattress gotprogressively heavier with each step - and he still had more thanten miles to go. Late that night, after several hours of strugglewith the wet mattress, an undercover narc picked Art up, allowedArt to stuff the wet mattress in the back seat of his car, andgave him a ride home, pumping him all the time for information onwhere one might find a little weed. Art didn't tell him anything. Art finally got home, propped the soaked mattress up againstthe wall in the bedroom, and went to sleep, exhausted, on thelinoleum floor again. An hour after he fell asleep, the mattressfell over on him and, because the room was so narrow and themattress was so wet and heavy, it wedged him in so tight hecouldn't get out until his friend John came looking for him thenext day. Burglarizing His Own Apartment Times were undeniably tough for Art, and the exhaustion ofhaving to deal with the cops on an almost daily basis didn't helpmatters. A couple of times he did manage to get jobs, only to belet go when it became obvious to his employers that Art was acenter of attention for the police. But he managed to get by for quite a while doing odd jobs hereand there, eating next to nothing, and wearing the same oldthreadbare clothes. Then one day the rent was due and hislandlord came to the door. Art explained that he was about to goa job interview and then would pick up the rent money from hisparents and, if the landlord would kindly wait a little bit, Artwould surely have the money for him. It was a partial story - hisparents didn't have the money, either, but he did have a jobinterview - but Art was just trying to buy a little time to keephis life together. The landlord seemed to accept the story andArt thought everything was fine. Art started to get cleaned up for his job interview and, aftertaking a shower, put on his pants and went down to the mailbox tocheck the mail. By the time he got back, there was a padlock onthe door. He pleaded with the landlord but the landlord also knewby now that Art was of special interest to the cops, so thelandlord had no incentive to give Art even the tiniest break. Artwent out and sat in the middle of a field, with nothing on buthis pants, to think. By and by it got dark and Art figured he would sneak back into get the rest of his possessions which amounted to a belt, acouple of shirts, an old pair of shoes, three or four pieces ofraggedy underwear, and the mattress, which he decided not to tryto deal with again, because it had become extremely moldy fromthe earlier soaking in the rain. Getting in to his place waseasy. He just popped in through a side window. He was inside nomore than two or three minutes. When he popped his head out the window a deputy sheriff'sflashlight shone squarely in his face. The landlord had alertedthem hours before and they were waiting for him. Due to hisprevious criminal record, he wound up doing about another sixmonths on that one. The Marijuana That Wasn't His. When Art got out of jail he went back to college and tried tomake a go of it again. The only regular income he could find wasfrom selling small amounts of marijuana and other drugs. He hadsome fairly good drug connections from his various times in jail,but we was more honest and friendly than he was shrewd so henever did much more than a few small sales to eke out anexistence. As luck would have it Art ran into a bright young businessexecutive who was just starting out with a new wife and baby and,having put a little money aside, decided to dabble in themarijuana trading market. Somehow, he managed to get his hands onthirty pounds of weed and then started looking around to sell it.He didn't know anyone himself who was interested in thirty poundsof weed but eventually he ran into Art and mentioned that hewould pay Art a commission of one hundred dollars and a small bagof personal stash if Art could introduce him to someone who wouldbuy it. Art knew lots of people and one hundred dollars was a lotof money to Art, so he looked around until he found someone. Art introduced the two parties to the transaction and waitedpatiently for them to conclude their business so he could get hiscommission and leave. In the middle of the transaction, carlights went on and car motors started in the neighborhood aroundthem. In a matter of a few moments, they were surrounded bySacramento sheriff's deputies. The buyer he found turned out tobe a snitch. To summarize the legal proceedings which followed, the guy whoactually owned the weed pleaded that he was really a good citizenwho made a mistake, he had a wife and baby, etc., etc., He walkedout with probation, with an agreement to testify against Art. The snitch, who had previously been busted, got his previouscharges dropped with an agreement to testify against Art. Art was charged with possession for sale of the entire thirtypounds. That brings us to the lawyer. And Now, The Lawyer Art's lawyer advised him that, in view of all the previousconvictions, and a long string of nuisance violations (whichshould have been self-evident police harassment), this time Artwas destined to do some serious time in prison unless some sortof miracle happened. Art's lawyer suggested that the only way outwas for Art to turn someone else in - turn snitch. "Snitches get killed." Art said. "What else canI do?" "Maybe they would let you off if you had a job and couldshow that you were trying to be an honest citizen," hislawyer suggested. Art promptly went out and got an absolutely grinding jobseveral miles from home. It was a massive struggle just to keepup with the job, but he did it. Then he went back to his lawyer. "No dice," his lawyer told him. "You are goingto have to do something else." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" "Hmmm," his lawyer said, "maybe you should getmarried to show them that you are trying to settle down." Art looked up an old high school girlfriend, explained thesituation to her and she agreed to get married. She had a fairlydecent job and they were able to move into a good apartment onher income. After the wedding, he went back to his lawyer. "Still not cutting it," his lawyer told him."You are going to have to do something else." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" His lawyer thought it over again. "Maybe if you had ababy on the way. Babies always get sympathy." Art promptly went out and got his bride pregnant. When she wasbeginning to show, he went back to his lawyer. "Closer. I had them going for a while with the babystory, but it is still not enough," his lawyer clucked."You're going to have to do something more." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" His lawyer thought and thought again and finally said,"They might cut you some slack if you were a heroin addictand claimed that what you were out of control because of youraddiction and what you really need is rehabilitation. If you didthat, I might be able to get you out with a year or so in ahospital." Art had never taken heroin in his life, but it was hard toturn down that kind of opportunity to avoid a long stretch inprison. He developed a good-sized heroin habit, went through acouple of really good withdrawal episodes in front of doctors whocould testify that he really was addicted, and then went back tohis lawyer. "We almost had them there," his lawyer said,"but it still wasn't quite enough. You are going to have todo something else." "Like what?" Art asked. "You could always snitch someone off," his lawyersuggested. "Snitches get killed," Art said. "I don't wantto get killed. What else can I do?" By that time, both Art and his lawyer had run out of ideas.Art was now working, married with a baby on the way, and a prettygood heroin habit, all on the advice of his lawyer. Art becameresigned to the fact that, in order to avoid spending the rest ofhis life in jail, he was going to have to snitch someone off. The sheriffs really enjoyed Art's company as a snitch. Theyrounded up several people before the word got out about Art andit wasn't long before there were rumors floating the streets thatArt would not be long for this world if he hung aroundSacramento. But, it seemed to work. For the first time since he had beenbusted for the thirty pounds of pot which wasn't his, it began tolook like they were going to let him off the hook - until thenext time, at least. Then, a week before his case was due to come its finalresolution, his lawyer was busted for income tax evasion and hadto drop out of the case. Art got a public defender who knewnothing about the case and believed the sheriff's deputies whenthey gleefully told him that there had been no deal with Art atall. Art went to prison, full sentence for the full thirtypounds, a multiple felony offender besides, and remains theretoday. He spends most of his time alone in protective custodybecause of the death threats against him.

On the lastevening I was walking past the propaganda table at the mainballroom and passed this guy ambling the other way. He waswearing a leather jacket that was unzipped revealing his blackT-shirt with white letters in a nifty graphic saying "LowerEast Side Needle Exchange". We passed without greeting andafter about 5 steps I thought "I want one of thoseT-shirts". After 5 more steps I thought "maybe he knowswhere I could get one"... 5 more and "I'll never findout if I don't ask him now". I turned and scurried aroundthe corner where he had just disappeared. There were just the two of us in the 50 yard walkway alongsidethe ballrooms... "Excuse me, sir... excuse me... hey,where'd you get that T-shirt? Can I get one?" He stopped and turned methodically. "Well yeah, man,we're selling them for 10 bucks". "Do you have any in extra large?" "No. All we got left is large. Do you think you could getby with... No, I guess you need an extra large. I could send youone when we get back to New York." "How much would it be with shipping and handling?" "Well gee, I dunno... I guess it would be less than$20". "I suppose it would! How about 15?" "I guess that'd prob'ly do it. But hey, maybe my boss hasan extra large left. We could walk around and check." We exchanged pleasantries as we walked back around past theconference entrance where I had first seen him. He found that Iwas from outside of Dallas and asked if they have a needleexchange there, but I didn't know. When we came to the smallmeeting room on the other side he went in. The meeting was justbreaking up and people started filing out, some leaving, someforming small groups in the hallway. He came out with four or sixpeople kind of dressed like him who assembled by the windows ashe came back over to me. "I'm sorry, man, we're out of extralarge, but if you give me $15, I'll mail you one right when I gethome." I didn't have correct change, but after some fumbling anddiscussions with passers-by, I ended up giving him a twenty and afive, and he gave me a ten. "I don't have any cards left", I said, "do youhave some place I can write down my address?" He rifled through his stack of leaflets and handed me a lightblue half-sheet that was blank on the back. I sat on the benchalong the wall to write my address, but found that my pencildidn't show up well on the blue paper. "Do you have a pen?" I asked. "Sure!" he said, and he handed me a syringe. Thepart you push on with your thumb was in the "out"position, and the glass tube was filled with a reddishtranslucent liquid that I suppose was intended to represent amixture of blood and heroin. At the end where the needle would bewas a ball-point pen. "Well!" I said. "I've never seen anything quitelike this! Do you have any more of these?" "No, man, that's from a needle exchange across town. Wejust have the T-shirts." Sitting there on the bench, I wrote down "X-Large"and my address and handed it up to the disheveled gentleman inblack. As he leaned over to retrieve his pen, his dark wavy hairfell alongside his face and I was hit with a strong gust ofmysterious aromas punctuated by tobacco. "Thanks, man. We appreciate it. I'll send you someliterature, too." As he hurried off to join his comrades, he turned and waved."Thanks again, it's for a good cause." When I got back to the office on Monday, I was a big hit withmy tales about the drug law conference and the literature Ibrought back. Everyone gathered around to read "PrisonLife" monthly, with its advice column "Ask Bubba".Bubba dished up sage advice on such topics as "My cellysnores", and "I've got this thing for Hillary Clinton,what should I do?" And you can imagine the mirth and merriment when I told themabout the Lower East Side Needle Exchange T-Shirt: "You meanto tell me you gave fifteen dollars CASH to a guy in a T-shirtsaying "Lower East Side Needle Exchange?!!!", and"Just what was that 'good cause'?" I had to agree itwas a good joke, even if it was at my expense. But I decided itwas an excellent value. For the humble sum of $15, I had bought aticket to the Greatest Show on Earth, a show that would lastseveral days at least: Would I get my T-shirt, and if so, when? I thought aboutstarting an office pool, but nobody wanted to bet me. After all,they felt sorry that I was already out 15 bucks. And what kind ofodds could I get? And how long is too long? The T-shirt became a test of stereotypes about drug users.Everyone assumed this guy must be into heroin and the money wouldnecessarily disappear. So the question becomes: Is it possible for a heroin user to behave responsibly? Can ajunkie carry $15 in cash from Washington to New York and renderperceived value to a faraway stranger known only by a scawledaddress on a scrap of paper? Or would he need the money forsomething more important? That night I slept well, but awoke an hour or two early,thinking about my interest in changing our drug laws. Injuringpeople to protect them from themselves... The problem seems toget bigger the more resources we throw at it... Wouldcivilization grind to a halt if we let consumers consume whatthey want? Would a foreign enemy conquer us? Is the right toremain silent the only right we have left? Do we have the rightto? Do we have the right not to? What is right? About here Godkicks in. I have had some prayers answered in my day. I'm notvery good at praying, but I've heard God only cares aboutsincerity, so I went ahead, and it went something like this: Dear Lord, If it be thy will, hear my prayer. I'm just awhite-bread white-boy, what don't know nothing about the evils ofheroin. I believe our laws are causing these problems, but nowI'm not so sure. I've been working on this social issue with thegoal of letting half a million people out of jail... a course ofaction that would stifle the growth of America's prison industrythat has such high hopes of taking up the slack where themilitary is laying off... that would make tens of thousands ofgovernment employees rethink their career plans... Give me a sign, Lord. Is prohibition a vain attempt to plugsome safety valves you installed in our souls? Can a junkie wrapup a T-shirt and lick a stamp? I need to know if what I'm doingis right. Either way it comes out, I promise to submit the factsto a candid world like it says in the Declaration ofIndependence. And if you really want to make it a sign, thenbless the postman's fingers and grant him Godspeed. In Jesus'name I pr.... No, that would be cheating. If it be THY will, Lord. Let'sleave Jesus out of this... Well... Jesus, if you WANT to getinvolved in this, feel free. Thy will is pretty important too.And God, if you REALLY want to make it a sign, you can putcrosses on the package or something really over-the-top that Iwouldn't even think of and..... As my prayer further deteriorated into meandering brain cellsfiring in the night, I closed it out and went back to sleep. In the following days, I thought about the test I hadproposed. The U.S. Postal Service, or U.P.S. or whoever, didn'tbreak any delivery speed records, and the T-shirt didn't show upas we were saying Grace before Thanksgiving dinner. But Time-Lifewants 4-6 weeks to send out a CD. Andwhether it shows up or not,what is proved by a statistical sample of one? I can't even send a letter to my mother- why should I expect anameless junkie on the Lower East Side to send me something thatcosts money? A woman at work predicted I would get the T-shirt"about March. He'll lose the address and find it later.He'll think that's soon. Those people don't think about time likewe do." At the office the joking has died down, but now and again wefind someone who hasn't heard about the Lower East Side NeedleExchange T-Shirt and it's good for another laugh. Whether I getthe shirt or not, that fifteen dollars is still providing value,so I suppose it's way up there on the list of the best money Iever spent. Still, there are a couple of reasons I'm hoping thatguy can get his act together. One is a positive answer to thismomentous question. The other is- I want one of those T-shirts.

This retaliation should only beresorted to under peculiarly aggravated circumstances. If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, whileone of your more fortunate little playmates has a costly Chinaone, you should treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless.And you ought not to attempt to make a forcible swap with herunless your conscience would justify you in it, and you know youare able to do it. You ought never to take your little brother's"chewing-gum" away from him by main force; it is betterto rope him in with the promise of the first two dollars and ahalf you find floating down the river on a grindstone. In theartless simplicity natural to his time of life, he will regard itas a perfectly fair transaction. In all ages of the world thiseminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant tofinancial ruin and disaster. If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother,do not correct him with mud - never, on any account, throw mud athim, because it will spoil his clothes. It is better to scald hima little, for then you obtain desirable results. You secure hisimmediate attention to the lessons you are inculcating, and atthe same time your hot water will have a tendency to moveimpurities from his person, and possibly the skin, in spots. If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to replythat you won't. It is better and more becoming to intimate thatyou will do as she bids you, and then afterward act quietly inthe manner according to the dictates of your best judgment. You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parentsthat you are indebted for your food, and your nice bed, and foryour beautiful clothes, and for the privilege of staying homefrom school when you let on that you are sick. Therefore youought to respect their little prejudices, and humor their littlewhims, and put up with their little foibles until they get tocrowding you too much. Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged.You ought never to "sass" old people unless they"sass" you first.

It was strange,but still it was true that this one was called Jim. He didn't have any sick mother either - a sick mother who waspious and had the consumption, and would be glad to lie down inthe grave and be at rest but for the strong love she bore herboy, and the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh andcold towards him when she was gone. Most bad boys in theSunday-books are named James, and have sick mothers, who teachthem to say, "Now, I lay me down," etc. and sing themto sleep with sweet, plaintive voices, and then kiss themgood-night, and kneel down by the bedside and weep. But it wasdifferent with this fellow. He was named Jim, and there wasn'tanything the matter with his mother - no consumption, noranything of that kind. She was rather stout than otherwise, andshe was not pious; moreover, she was not anxious on Jim'saccount. She said if he were to break his neck it wouldn't bemuch loss. She always spanked Jim to sleep, and she never kissedhim good-night; on the contrary, she boxed his ears when she wasready to leave him. Once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry, andslipped in there and helped himself to some jam, and filled upthe vessel with tar, so that his mother would never know thedifference; but all at once a terrible feeling didn't come overhim, and something didn't seem to whisper to him, "Is itright to disobey my mother? Isn't it sinful to do this? Where dobad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother'sjam?" and then he didn't kneel down all alone and promisenever to be wicked any more, and rise up with a light, happyheart, and go and tell his mother all about it, and beg herforgiveness, and be blessed by her with tears of pride andthankfulness in her eyes. No; that is the way with all other badboys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this Jim,strangely enough. He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in hissinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that wasbully also, and laughed, and observed "that the old womanwould get up and snort" when she found it out; and when shedid find it out, he denied knowing anything about it, and shewhipped him severely, and he did the crying himself. Everythingabout this boy was curious - everything turned out differentlywith him from the way it does to the bad James in the books. Once he climbed up in Farmer Acorn's apple-tree to stealapples, and the limb didn't break, and he didn't fall and breakhis arm, and get torn by the farmer's great dog, and thenlanguish on a sick bed for weeks, and repent and become good. Oh!no; he stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right;and he was all ready for the dog too, and knocked him endwayswith a brick when he came to tear him. It was very strange -nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books withmarbled backs, and with pictures in them of men withswallow-tailed coats and bell-crowned hats, and pantaloons thatare short in the legs, and women with the waists of their dressesunder their arms, and no hoops on. Nothing like it in any of theSunday-school books. Once he stole the teacher's pen-knife, and, when he was afraidit would be found out and he would get whipped, he slipped itinto George Wilson's cap - poor Widow Wilson's son, the moralboy, the good little boy of the village, who always obeyed hismother, and never told an untruth, and was fond of his lessons,and infatuated with Sunday-school. And when the knife droppedfrom the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed, as if inconscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft uponhim, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch downupon his trembling shoulders, a white-haired improbable justiceof the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strikean attitude and say, "Spare this noble boy - there standsthe cowering culprit! I was passing the school-door at recess,and unseen myself, I saw the theft committed!" And then Jimdidn't get whaled, and the venerable justice didn't read thetearful school a homily and take George by the hand and say sucha boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him to come and makehis home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, andrun errands, and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife todo household labors, and have all the balance of the time toplay, and get forty cents a month, and be happy. No; it wouldhave happened that way in the books, but it didn't happen thatway to Jim. No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to maketrouble, and so the model boy George got thrashed, and Jim wasglad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys. Jim said hewas "down on them milk-sops." Such was the coarselanguage of this bad, neglected boy. But the strangest thing that ever happened to Jim was the timehe went boating on Sunday, and didn't get drowned, and that othertime that he got caught out in the storm when he was fishing onSunday, and didn't get struck by lighting. Why, you might look,and look, all through the Sunday-school books from now till nextChristmas, and you would never come across anything like this. Ohno; you would find that all the bad boys who go boating on Sundayinvariably get drowned; and all the bad boys who get caught outin storms when they are fishing on Sunday infallibly get struckby lightning. Boats with bad boys in them always upset on Sunday,and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the Sabbath. Howthis Jim ever escaped is a mystery to me. This Jim bore a charmed life - that must have been the way ofit. Nothing could hurt him. He even gave the elephant in themenagerie a plug of tobacco, and the elephant didn't knock thetop of his head off with his trunk. He browsed around thecupboard after essence of peppermint, and didn't make a mistakeand drink aqua fortis. He stole his father's gun and went huntingon the Sabbath, and didn't shoot three or four of his fingersoff. He struck his little sister on the temple with his fist whenhe was angry, and she didn't linger in pain through long summerdays, and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips thatredoubled the anguish of his breaking heart. No; she got over it.He ran off and went to sea at last, and didn't come back and findhimself sad and alone in the world, his loved ones sleeping inthe quiet churchyard, and the vine-embowered home of his boyhoodtumbled down and gone to decay. Ah! no; he came home as drunk asa piper, and got into the station-house the first thing. And he grew up and married, and raised a large family, andbrained them all with an axe one night, and got wealthy by allmanner of cheating and rascality; and now he is the infernalistwickedest scoundrel in his native village, and is universallyrespected, and belongs to the Legislature. So you see there never was a bad James in the Sunday-schoolbooks that had such a streak of luck as this sinful Jim with thecharmed life.

He would not play hookey,even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitablething he could do. None of the other boys could ever make thatboy out, he acted so strangely. He wouldn't lie, no matter howconvenient it was. He just said it was wrong to lie, and that wassufficient for him. And he was so honest that he was simplyridiculous. The curious ways that that Jacob had, surpassedeverything. He wouldn't play marbles on Sunday, he wouldn't robbirds' nests, he wouldn't give hot pennies to organ-grinders'monkeys; he didn't seem to take any interest in any kind ofrational amusement. So the other boys used to try to reason itout and come to an understanding of him, but they couldn't arriveat any satisfactory conclusion. As I said before, they could onlyfigure out a sort of vague idea that he was"afflicted," and so they took him under theirprotection, and never allowed any harm to come to him. This good little boy read all the Sunday-school books; theywere his greatest delight. This was the whole secret of it. Hebelieved in the good little boys they put in the Sunday-schoolbooks; he had every confidence in them. He longed to come acrossone of them alive, once; but he never did. They all died beforehis time, maybe. Whenever he read about a particularly good onehe turned over quickly to the end to see what became of him,because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and gaze on him;but it wasn't any use; that good little boy always died in thelast chapter, and there was a picture of the funeral, with allhis relatives and the Sunday-school children standing around thegrave in pantaloons that were too short, and bonnets that weretoo large, and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had asmuch as a yard and a half of stuff in them. He was always headedoff in this way. He never could see one of those good little boyson account of his always dying in the last chapter. Jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a Sunday-school book.He wanted to be put in, with pictures representing him gloriouslydeclining to lie to his mother, and her weeping for joy about it;and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep giving apenny to a poor beggar-woman with six children, and telling herto spend it freely, but not to be extravagant, becauseextravagance is a sin; and pictures of him magnanimously refusingto tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around thecorner as he came from school, and welted him over the head witha lath, and then chased him home, saying, "Hi! hi!" ashe proceeded. This was the ambition of young Jacob Blivens. Hewished to be put in a Sunday-school book. It made him feel alittle uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the goodlittle boys always died. He loved to live, you know, and this wasthe most unpleasant feature about being a Sunday-school-book boy.He knew it was not healthy to be good. He knew it was more fatalthan consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in thebooks were; he knew that none of them had been able to stand itlong, and it pained him to think that if they put him in a bookhe wouldn't ever see it, or even if they did get the book outbefore he died it wouldn't be popular without any picture of hisfuneral in the back part of it. It couldn't be much of aSunday-school book that couldn't tell about the advice he gave tothe community when he was dying. So at last, of course, he had tomake up his mind to do the best he could under the circumstances- to live right, and hang on as long as he could, and have hisdying speech all ready when his time came. But somehow nothing ever went right with this good little boy;nothing ever turned out with him the way it turned out with thegood little boys in the books. They always had a good time, andthe bad boys had the broken legs; but in his case there was ascrew loose somewhere; and it all happened just the other way.When he found Jim Blake stealing apples, and went under the treeto read to him about the bad little boy who fell out of aneighbor's apple-tree and broke his arm, Jim fell out of the treetoo, but he fell on him, and broke his arm, and Jim wasn't hurtat all. Jacob couldn't understand that. There wasn't anything inthe books like it. And once, when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in themud, and Jacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing, theblind man did not give him any blessing at all, but whacked himover the head with his stick and said he would like to catch himshoving him again, and then pretending to help him up. This wasnot in accordance with any of the books. Jacob looked them allover to see. One thing that Jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog thathadn't any place to stay, and was hungry and persecuted, andbring him home and pet him and have that dog's imperishablegratitude. And at last he found one and was happy; and he broughthim home and fed him, but when he was going to pet him the dogflew at him and tore all the clothes off him except those thatwere in front, and made a spectacle of him that was astonishing.He examined authorities, but he could not understand the matter.It was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books, but itacted very differently. Whatever this boy did he got intotrouble. The very things the boys in the books got rewarded forturned out to be about the most unprofitable things he couldinvest in. Once, when he was on his way to Sunday-school, he saw some badboys starting off pleasuring in a sailboat. He was filled withconsternation, because he knew from his reading that boys whowent sailing on Sunday invariably got drowned. So he ran out on araft to warn them, but a log turned with him and slid him intothe river. A man got him out pretty soon, and the doctor pumpedthe water out of him, and gave him a fresh start with hisbellows, but he caught cold and lay sick a-bed nine weeks. Butthe most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys inthe boat had a good time all day, and then reached home alive andwell in the most surprising manner. Jacob Blivens said there wasnothing like these things in the books. He was perfectlydumb-founded. When he got well he was a little discouraged, but he resolvedto keep on trying anyhow. He knew that so far his experiencewouldn't do to go in a book, but he hadn't yet reached theallotted term of life for good little boys, and he hoped to beable to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time wasfully up. If everything else failed he had his dying speech tofall back on. He examined his authorities, and found that it was now timefor him to go to sea as a cabin-boy. He called on a ship captainand made his application, and when the captain asked for hisrecommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to thewords. "To Jacob Blivens, from his affectionateteacher." But the captain was a coarse, vulgar man, and hesaid, "Oh, that be blowed! that wasn't any proof that heknow how to wash dishes or handle a slush-bucket, and he guessedhe didn't want him." This was altogether the mostextraordinary thing that ever happened to Jacob in all his life.A compliment from a teacher, on a tract, had never failed to movethe tenderest emotions of ship captains, and open the way to alloffices of honor and profit in their gift - it never had in anybook that ever he had read. He could hardly believe his senses. This boy always had a hard time of it. Nothing over came outaccording to the authorities with him. At last, one day, when hewas around hunting up bad little boys to admonish, he found a lotof them in the old iron foundry fixing up a little joke onfourteen or fifteen dogs, which they had tied together in longprocession, and were going to ornament with empty nitro-glycerinecans made fast to their tails. Jacob's heart was touched. He satdown on one of those cans (for he never minded grease when dutywas before him), and he took hold of the foremost dog by thecollar, and turned his reproving eye upon wicked Tom Jones. Butjust at that moment Alderman McWelter full of wrath, stepped in.All the bad boys ran away, but Jacob Blivens rose in consciousinnocence and began one of those stately littleSunday-school-book speeches which always commence with "Oh,sir!" in dead opposition to the fact that no boy, good orbad, ever starts a remark with "Oh, sir." But thealderman never waited to hear the rest. He took Jacob Blivens bythe ear and turned him around, and hit him a whack in the rearwith the flat of his hand; and in an instant that good little boyshot out through the roof and soared away towards the sun, withthe fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like thetail of a kite. And there wasn't a sign of that alderman or thatold iron foundry left on the face of the earth; and, as for youngJacob Blivens, he never got a chance to make his last dyingspeech after all his trouble fixing it up, unless he made it tothe birds; because, although the bulk of him came down all rightin a tree-top in an adjoining county, the rest of him wasapportioned around among four townships, and so they had to holdfive inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not, andhow it occurred. You never saw a boy scattered so. ^* [Footnote *: This glycerine catastrophe is borrowed from afloating newspaper item, whose author's name I would give if Iknew it. - [M.T.]] Thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could,but didn't come out according to the books. Every boy who everdid as he did prospered except him. His case is truly remarkable.It will probably never be accounted for.

"No," I said, after studying the matter over alittle. "No, I believe not; I am going to be travelling byrail all day to-day. However, to-morrow I don't travel. Give meone for to-morrow." The man looked puzzled. He said: "But it is for accident insurance, and if you are goingto travel by rail - " "If I am going to travel by rail I sha'n't need it. Lyingat home in bed is the thing I am afraid of." I had been looking into this matter. Last year I traveledtwenty thousand miles, almost entirely by rail; the year before,I traveled over twenty-five thousand miles, half by sea and halfby rail; and the year before that I traveled in the neighborhoodof ten thousand miles, exclusively by rail. I suppose if I put inall the little odd journeys here and there, I may say I havetraveled sixty thousand miles during the three years I havementioned. And never an accident. For a good while I said to myself every morning: "Now Ihave escaped thus far, and so the chances are just that muchincreased that I shall catch it this time. I will be shrewd, andbuy an accident ticket." And to a dead moral certainty Idrew a blank, and went to bed that night without a joint startedor a bone splintered. I got tired of that sort of daily bother,and fell to buying accident tickets that were good for a month. Isaid to myself, "A man can't buy thirty blanks in onebundle." But I was mistaken. There was never a prize in the lot. Icould read of railway accidents every day - the newspaperatmosphere was foggy with them; but somehow they never came myway. I found I had spent a good deal of money in the accidentbusiness, and had nothing to show for it. My suspicions werearoused, and I began to hunt around for somebody that had won inthis lottery. I found plenty of people who had invested, but notan individual that had ever had an accident or made a cent. Istopped buying accident tickets and went to ciphering. The resultwas astounding. The peril lay not in traveling, but in staying athome. I hunted up statistics, and was amazed to find that after allthe glaring newspaper headings concerning railroad disasters,less than three hundred people had really lost their lives bythose disasters in the preceding twelve months. The Erie road wasset down as the most murderous in the list. It had killedforty-six - or twenty-six, I do not exactly remember which, but Iknow the number was double that of any other road. But the factstraightway suggested itself that the Erie was an immensely longroad, and did more business than any other line in the country;so the double number of killed ceased to be matter for surprise. By further figuring, it appeared that between New York andRochester the Erie ran eight passenger-trains each way every day- 16 altogether; and carried a daily average of 6,000 persons.That is about a million in six months - the population of NewYork City. Well, the Erie kills from 13 to 23 persons out of itsmillion in six months; and in the same time 13,000 of New York'smillion die in their beds! My flesh crept, my hair stood on end."This is appalling!" I said. "The danger isn't intraveling by rail, but in trusting to those deadly beds. I willnever sleep in a bed again." I had figured on considerably less than one-half the length ofthe Erie road. It was plain that the entire road must transportat least eleven or twelve thousand people every day. There aremany short roads running out of Boston that do fully half asmuch; a great many such roads. There are many roads scatteredabout the Union that do a prodigious passenger business.Therefore it was fair to presume that an average of 2,500passengers a day for each road in the country would be aboutcorrect. There are 846 railway lines in our country, and 846times 2,500 are 2,115,000. So the railways of America move morethan two millions of people every day; six hundred and fiftymillions of people a year, without counting the Sundays. They dothat, too - there is no question about it; though where they getthe raw material is clear beyond the jurisdiction of myarithmetic; for I have hunted the census through and through, andI find that there are not that many people in the United States,by a matter of six hundred and ten millions at the very least.They must use some of the same people over again, likely. San Francisco is one-eighth as populous as New York; there are60 deaths a week in the former and 500 a week in the latter - ifthey have luck. That is 3,120 deaths a year in San Francisco, andeight times as many in New York - say about 25,000 or 26,000. Thehealth of the two places is the same. So we will let it stand asa fair presumption that this will hold good all over the country,and that consequently 25,000 out of every million of people wehave must die every year. That amounts to one-fortieth of ourtotal population. One million of us, then, die annually. Out ofthis million ten or twelve thousand are stabbed, shot, drowned,hanged, poisoned, or meet a similarly violent death in some otherpopular way, such as perishing by kerosene-lamp and hoop-skirtconflagrations, getting buried in coal-mines, falling offhouse-tops, breaking through church or lecture-room floors,taking patent medicines, or committing suicide in other forms.The Erie railroad kills from 23 to 46; the other 845 railroadskill an average of one-third of a man each; and the rest of thatmillion, amounting in the aggregate to the appalling figure of987,631 corpses, die naturally in their beds! You will excuse me from taking any more chances on those beds.The railroads are good enough for me. And my advice to all people is, Don't stay at home any morethan you can help; but when you have got to stay at home a while,buy a package of those insurance tickets and sit up nights. Youcannot be too cautious. [One can see now why I answered that ticket-agent in themanner recorded at the top of this sketch.] The moral of this composition is, that thoughtless peoplegrumble more than is fair about railroad management in the UnitedStates. When we consider that every day and night of the yearfull fourteen thousand railway-trains of various kinds, freightedwith life and armed with death, go thundering over the land, themarvel is, not that they kill three hundred human beings in atwelvemonth, but that they do not kill three hundred times threehundred!

By Mark Twain Delivered In Hartford, At A Dinner To Cornelius Walford,Of London, 1875 Gentlemen, - I am glad, indeed, to assist in welcoming thedistinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as aninsurance centre has extended to all lands, and given us the nameof being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand inhand - the Colt's arms company making the destruction of our raceeasy and convenient, our life-insurance citizens paying for thevictims when they pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating theirmemory with his stately monuments, and our fire-insurancecomrades taking care of their hereafter. I am glad to assist inwelcoming our guest - first, because he is an Englishman, and Iowe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of hisfellow-countrymen; and secondly, because he is in sympathy withinsurance, and has been the means of making many other men casttheir sympathies in the same direction. Certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than theinsurance line of business - especially accident insurance. Eversince I have been a director in an accident-insurance company Ihave felt that I am a better man. Life has seemed more precious.Accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect. Distressing specialprovidences have lost half their horror. I look upon a cripplenow with affectionate interest - as an advertisement. I do notseem to care for poetry any more. I do not care for politics evenagriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is a charmabout a railway collision that is unspeakable. There is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance. Ihave seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and intoaffluence by the simple boon of a broken leg. I have had peoplecome to me on crutches, with tears in their eyes, to bless thisbeneficent institution. In all my experience of life, I have seennothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshlymutilated man's face when he feels in his vest pocket with hisremaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right. And Ihave seen nothing so sad as the look that came into anothersplintered customer's face when he found he couldn't collect on awooden leg. I will remark here, by way of advertisement, that that noblecharity which we have named the Hartford Accident InsuranceCompany is an institution which is peculiarly to be dependedupon. A man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom. No mancan take out a policy in it and not get crippled before the yearis out. Now there was one indigent man who had been disappointedso often with other companies that he had grown disheartened, hisappetite left him, he ceased to smile - said life was but aweariness. Three weeks ago I got him to insure with us, and nowhe is the brightest, happiest spirit in this land - has a goodsteady income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day, andtravels around on a shutter. I will say, in conclusion, that my share of the welcome toour guest is none the less hearty because I talk so muchnonsense, and I know that I can say the same for the rest of thespeakers.

I heard from quite afew known and suspected members of the family, and picked upquite a few addresses of people who probably did not want to befound. Thanks to all of those who did reply, but it is stillapparent that we haven't tracked down all of the nefarious familymembers so let's keep up the effort to track down, and thoroughlyembarrass all those family members who are trying to hide. Bud called me one day to say that Laurence had called him tosuggest that we include with the Reunion News a brief update onwhere everybody is and what they are doing. He staunchlymaintains that both he and Laurence were sober at the time. He suggested that everyone should send in a short note ontheir current doings and significant events and a dollar or so todefray the expenses of producing and mailing the newsletter.Monetary contributions to support this effort would be nice (allblank checks eagerly accepted) but no one will be denied thebenefit(?) of this newsletter just because they failed to anteup. If you will drop me a line (as many have already) and let meknow of significant events in your life in the last year or so, Iwill include them with the periodic reunion information soeveryone can know how your life is going to Hell in a handbasket. I have attached a form at the end of this letter which you canfill out and return, if you wish, to help me keep all of theinformation accurate. All information on the forms is voluntary and I will not printor give out anyone's address or any other information withouttheir permission. Anyone who fails to report will, of course, have only the mostslanderous rumors printed about them. Sincerely, Clifford A. Schaffer REUNION DETAILS DATE: June 23 and 24, 1990 PLACE: Howarth Park - Summerfield Rd., Santa Rosa, CA. The park is located on the east side of town, and a map isenclosed. There is hiking, fishing, swimming, a small park, andan amusement park close by. There are also paddle boats at bothlakes. On the back of one of the sheets she sent me, in an almostillegible scrawl, Ruthie wrote, "It is also close to a lotof wineries." I'll bet it is. FOOD There will be snacks, dips, lots of other food, and plenty ofraw meat, roots, and berries for the Morrises. Dinner will beearly, at 3:30 or 4:00 on Saturday because of the previous badexperiences when we tried to feed the Leards and Morrises afterdark. Whatever food is left after the first attack of the Leardsand Morrises will be placed on the edge of the camp all daySunday to draw them away from the rest of us. People who live in the area should bring salad, beans, andother such items. People who live farther away should bringchips, dips, and dessert. Dinnerware will be provided, but bringdrinks and charcoal for your family. CAMPGROUNDS There are campgrounds in Spring Lake Park. A copy of acampsite reservation form is enclosed.

FAMILY DOINGS WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? INTRODUCTION I am pleased to report that the vast majority of people in thefamily are apparently healthy, active, and doing well. We do notyet have any relatives who are rich enough that we can all gomooch off of them, but nobody seems to be starving either. PASSINGS For all of those who were not aware, Mary Taylor died lastyear. She and my grandmother, Laura Richardson, are the reasonsthat we gather every year. She will be missed by all of us, butwe should all feel very lucky that we have had these women in ourlives. THE FAMILY ALLSMAN, DOROTHY (nee Richardson) - Currently selling real estate in Phoenix,Arizona. The last time I spoke with her she made a point ofmentioning how much she enjoys meeting all of the nice people inthis family every year at the reunion. Her doctor tells me thatradical personality changes are common in persons of extreme age.Ed has had some health problems which may limit their ability totravel. ALLSMAN, PAT Pat is living in Phoenix, doing well, and he has developedinto a good judge of appropriate Christmas gifts. ATKINSON, CHRISTINE (nee Sweet), eldest of Margaret and Vic, is in Chicago,working for First Boston Corp. doing something with computers.She didn't mention anything specific about the opportunities forembezzlement at her current position, but we know she will bealert. She tells a fairly wild, and almost believable, storyabout how her husband Scott travels a lot because of hishighfalutin position with something called Terra Museum. Sheswears that it is not a front for drug smuggling. BECK, META Bud says she is doing well but he did not provide a lot ofdetails. He is probably covering up. BERZ, RONNI Meta's second. Currently living in Bakersfield and prosperingnicely with her husband, George, who works with computers. HARTER, BARRI No information. May be the same Barri Harter rumored to beinvolved with Donald Trump. JOHNSON, GLENDA No current address. No information. May have been lost inBorneo while filming the headhunters. KRAMER, JOANNE (nee Morris) - Joanne is living in Fresno and sends obscenehoroscopes to all those who write to her. She still labors underthe delusion that I am really Satan. KRAMER, LARRY son of Joanne, no relationship to the Japanese monster film"Son of Joanne." According to Joanne, he is livingwith, and mooching off his mother in the finest Morris tradition. KRAMER, LESLIE MAUREEN Daughter of Joanne, living in Cleveland and working as anexotic dancer. (Yes, that's right.) She is the proud mother ofCrystal Ladd who, according to the sworn testimony of Joanne, isan extraordinarily beautiful and talented child. LEARD, DAVID His years in the Navy permanently damaged his ability to tellwhen it is too wet outside. He is currently living in the rainforests of Seattle and doing something with computer systems. Itdidn't surprise anyone that one of the Leards would eventuallyreturn to the Bigfoot territory from whence they came. His wifeis pretty, intelligent, and very nice. He must have liedtremendously to get her. LEARD, DOUGLAS Somehow the Richardson-Taylor arson gene went wrong inDouglas. He puts out fires for a living, instead of startingthem, and apparently enjoys it. He and Barbara, and kids, live inRancho and, last time I checked, they were all doing well andenjoying life. LEARD, LOUISE Louise is still living in the same old place in Sacramentothat she bought when houses were still $1.49. She is in goodhealth, reasonably good humor, and still unreasonablyconservative. She still says "Well, now Michael . . .",all the time, even when Michael is not around. LEARD, MICHAEL Michael just keeps on trucking. He is an air conditioningexpert at McClellan in Sacramento. He recently visited us in LosAngeles and found that he actually could cope with the freewaysdown here (but he still split as soon as he could anyway). He isin good health but needs more practice with his .22 pistol. LINK, BARBARA (nee Sweet) - Barbara is married to Dan Link, a pastor with adevotion to hopeless causes such as truth and morality. Theymoved to Ruidoso, New Mexico, presumably to escape the shame andguilt which follows excessively moral people in this family. Thename Ruidoso is Spanish for "noisy" which, Barbaraclaims, has only a coincidental relationship to Dan's sermons. MORRIS, ELEANOR and Don - No current word from them, although I thought Irecognized Don playing Digit in "Gorillas in the Mist."Way to go with that second career, Fellah. MORRIS, RICHARD No current word on his activities. What can you say about aMorris that hasn't already been grunted by someone else? I heardthat he was running a dress shop for transvestites and all I cansay is that Richard never denied it. MORRIS, STEVEN He is single (relatively speaking), working at DMV, and stilltrying to impregnate every female in the city of Sacramento nowthat the State has given up its effort to restrict his breeding.Remember the family motto, Steve - Never give your right name. NEWCOMB, RUTH (nee Taylor) - She is doing well and sends her love toeveryone. She mentioned that she is getting married very soon(says she doesn't have to) and recommends bear traps and doescent as the perfect combination for nailing a man. She didn'tgive his name but sent a nice picture of him bound and gagged inthe trunk of her car. Congrats, Ruthie. PEREIRA, CARRIE She recently had a baby, prompting Bud to lie far more than heusually does. PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW (Andy) son of Joanne Kramer - Currently living in Fullerton,CA and doing well in sales. PRUITT, BOB No information. Could be the same Bob Pruitt responsible forthe Exxon Valdez disaster. QUIGLEY, DONNA (nee Morris) - Donna reportedly lives next door to Margie andthey are known as the Unholy Two in their neighborhood. A recenteffort by the City Council to evict them failed when theauthorities were unable to prove a connection to the rest of theMorris family. RICHARDSON, BILL Bill and Dawn currently live in Ohio for no apparent reason,and Bill is now working as a cost analyst after many, many yearswith the U.S. Air Force. (You know - the people who brought usthe Stealth Bomber.) He gets Air Force retirement money andprobably makes a pretty good bundle at his current job, so he isprobably a good person to borrow money from. Dawn has, by allaccounts, consistently sullied the family reputation with a longstring of church work, good deeds, and other socially acceptabledo-gooder behavior which is totally alien to this family'scharacter. Mark, their eldest, is either on the high schoolfootball team, or he is the high school football team, - itwasn't clear from their letter. I saw a picture of Craig. He hasto be healthy. RICHARDSON, BUD He is in better health than he has a right to be, and claimshe is going to live forever. He called me just days after thebirth of his latest great grandkid and he had already concoctedthe most astonishing stories about this child. RICHARDSON, BECKY Eldest of James and Edna. No information. She may be livingwith a motorcycle gang responsible for several holdups in theCentral Valley. RICHARDSON, JAMIE Youngest of James and Edna. No information. Carried away byGypsies many years ago to the remotest reaches of Fresno County. RICHARDSON, JAMES Currently retired and residing in Fresno with Edna who, forsome strange reason, is a perfect match for James. His "OldFart" hat wore out so he is getting one that says"Older Fart." Unlike fine wines, the aroma of farts isnot greatly improved by aging. RICHARDSON, JERRY No information direct from Jerry but Bud tells me that he isdoing well. RICHARDSON, LARRY Bud tells the same story about Larry, further straining hiscredibility. RICHARDSON, PETE Pete has not yet learned that exercise is bad for the healthso he continues to run every day. Despite all this running, tothe best of my knowledge, he has never caught anything moresignificant than the common cold. He continues to compete and winraces in the Old and Decrepit category. SCHAFFER, CLIFFORD I am currently working as a computer systems consultant, writea few articles now and then and, lately, am doing some publicspeaking for the ACLU. Bonnie is a computer systems manager withPinkerton Detectives. Serena and Alyssa are 15 and in high school. Serena is inFlags with the marching band and Alyssa earned a letter last yearon the swim team. Melissa, 12, and Courtney, 10 are both doingwell. SCHULKINS, JOYCE No information. Rumored to be on an expedition to finddinosaurs in Africa. SCHULKINS, LARRY No information. May be the same Larry Schulkins who iscurrently a hostage in Beirut. SWEET, JULIE Julie is currently working at the Los Angeles Zoo, as ananimal keeper and trainer and thus would probably be the bestskilled person to manage the reunion. SWEET, MARGARET (nee Richardson) - Margaret sent out a letter with someoutrageous tale about how she and Vic are supposedly not oldenough to qualify for Social Security or something like that soshe is continuing to work. Margaret's letter starts out"Dear Friends and Relatives", which shows that shedraws a clear distinction between the two. Vic is working in afuneral parlor so he should have a lot of creepy stories to tellaround the campfire. TAYLOR, DAVID No information or parole date. TAYLOR, EDITH No information. Probably on the run from the law. TAYLOR, LAURENCE and WILMA Laurence was caught telling the truth last year and had tospend several weeks in therapy before he was well again. When youtalk to him you will see that he is much better now. TAYLOR, LOUISE No information. Possible KGB double agent.

She says they were unable to get the park for Saturday(something about too much police surveillance) so Saturday willbe at Spring Lake. She is going to try to get "the spot on your left just asyou come off the hill into the park area." Ruthie said thatif anyone has trouble finding the group she would leave a trailof bread crumbs but, of course, that only works until the firstMorris shows up. If in doubt, look for the clouds of tear gas andflashing police lights - the family will be in the middle. Hot dogs and hamburgers will be served around noon, with thebig meal around 4:00 PM. Remember that, if you are approached byany family member you do not immediately recognize, throw somefood away from your car. Do not attempt to feed them by hand. Sunday will be at Howarth Park as previously stated. She says to be sure to remember to bring all of the followingitems: bathing suits (to avoid the perennial lewd conduct charges) lots of ice (to take the swelling down) extra ice chests (storage space is always a problem) snacks (in sealed packets so the Leards can't smell them) charcoal (fire helps to keep the Morrises at bay) drinks Doug and Barbara should bring their game. Ruthie said thateveryone really enjoyed it as long as they were sober. Ruthie says there are paddle boats, hiking trails (remember tobring shoes), and a nice area for volleyball. Ruthie also asked me to remind everyone that it is time tosend your contributions. The contribution is $8.00 per household(cheaper than the average parking ticket) and should be sent to: Ruth Newcomb I still have not heard from all of the nefarious familymembers with their most current family information. I would liketo publish a fairly complete update of the family information todistribute at or near the reunion, so it would be nice if youwould all send it in. If you do not, I will do the most dastardlything possible - I will tell the truth about you. I am sure noone wants that.

It was a pretty good turnout with perhapsa hundred people (anybody want to count?). As usual, everybodygot older but me. We all owe thanks to Ruthie and Laurence for organizingeverything the way they did. The maps they sent me weren't thegreatest so, for all of you who thought Spring Lake park wasreally in East Africa, I apologize for that. However, the parksand all the fun and trimmings when we finally got there were verygood so I have to say that I thought they organized a prettysuccessful reunion. You can always tell a successful reunion -you can't recognize anyone. I hear that Margaret and Vic spentmost of Saturday morning with a nice family of Mexicans beforethey realized it wasn't us. I want to thank all of you who stepped forward to express yourappreciation for the work I did on the newsletter. I especiallywant to thank all those who pulled Joanne off of me while she wasexpressing her appreciation. My doctor says it was lucky I movedwhen I did and there probably won't be any permanent scarring. I understand that Margaret and Vic have volunteered toorganize next year's reunion, perhaps around the Carpenteriaarea. I think they like that area primarily because it makespeople say "Where?". It is around Santa Barbara - northof L.A. It is a lovely oil-rich area with beautiful beaches whichhave natural tar balls in the sand for your kids to track back toyour car. I am sure everyone will like it - just bring a few jarsof petroleum solvents. Assuming that Margaret still admits thatwe are blood-related, I will keep you posted. People who are easily offended should probably skip the FamilyDoings section on Don Morris. I have made a considerable effortto clean it up but it's hard to write anything about him and keepit decent. Sincerely, Clifford A. Schaffer Copyright 1990, C. A. Schaffer FAMILY DOINGS WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE? ARE THEY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM ME? WHEN WILL THEY BE PAROLED? INTRODUCTION This is the post-reunion dirt on everyone (that I am aware of)who either showed up or sent back their forms. It is not thecomplete family listing, if there ever could be one. I will doanother relatively complete update next year before the reunion. PASSINGS Mary Taylor Bob Taylor - son of Mary, one of the original old-time Taylors Jan Richardson - wife of Bud. She gave him a lot of love. Our loss can only be measured by the blessings they have givenus. THE FAMILY ALLSMAN, DOROTHY (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Clifford Male Patrick Male She mentioned again how much she enjoys the reunion but saidher pain medication wasn't as strong as it should be. LikeMargaret and Bud, she claims to have a copy of the family historythat Mary produced. They all said they would send me a copy but,apparently, they are afraid of what I might do with it. BARBER, PATRICIA "Teisha" (nee Taylor) CHILDREN Billy Male Eric Male The last time I saw Teisha she was about four years old. Shemust be at least eleven or twelve by now. Teisha and husband Mikeand a friend have purchased a gold claim in the Siskiyou NationalForest. If they will agree to send me ten percent of whateverthey find I will promise not to send their address to everyone inthe family. Mike is a Park Manager at Ft. Stevens Park in Oregon andTeisha is an advertising clerk for Payless. Like all Taylors,they spend most of their time in the woods, eating whatever theymanage to catch. Both of the boys are groundskeepers for a military cemetery sowe should all make it a point not to ask them if they collectanything. Billy is reportedly working for the county litterpatrol (if you don't have any they deliver) and will be hackingtrails through the wilderness for most of the summer. BECK, META (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Ronni Female Carrie Female Meta showed up at the reunion in a jocular mood and spent mostof her time fighting with Bud over which one of them was going toshow off her grandson. It was a tough battle, but I think Metawon - best two falls out of three. She must be doing well becauseshe is considerably better fed than the last time I saw her. BERZ, RONNI She was there with her husband, George, who seems to be a niceenough guy, so there is no real explanation how he got mixed upwith this family. Like all macho computer guys he spent a lot oftime talking about his big hard disk, and showing off his son. Ofcourse, Bud is so proud you would think he had the kid himself. BRYER, BRENT Currently managing cousin Gary's RV sales and service companyin Redding, and apparently making a bundle doing it. HARTER, BERRI She works in the electronics industry and is doing well. Nolonger involved with Donald Trump. HEDRICK, MARGARET (nee Morris) CHILDREN Scott Male Nancy Female This is the woman we all once knew as Margie Morris. She saysthat her husband calls her "Margaret" which often leadsher to believe that she is really Margaret Sweet. It's easy toget the two confused, especially if you are one. She dragged Michael and me off into the woods and went into amonster family-old-times-hugging fit. She has been married someincredibly long time to a guy who is a combat veteran but isscared to show up at the reunion, and is currently living withDonna. They tell me that Nancy (current last name unknown) isliving in the same town. Most legal authorities agree that threeMorrises in the same town is prima facie evidence of a criminalconspiracy. KRAMER, JOANNE (nee Morris) CHILDREN Michael Andrew Porter Male Laurence Kramer Male Leslie Kramer Female She says she is working as a supervisory"registered" nurse (Fresno County still requiresMorrises to be registered) in a hospital in Fresno. Can youimagine waking up from a coma to find Joanne standing over you?I'd probably get religion. Would you trust this woman with yourbedpan? Joanne listed no Significant Other and complained that thedestruction of the rain forests is making it hard for her to findgood dates. She pines for the good old days when she could justhide down by the railroad tracks and catch them unawares. Shesays that if anyone knows any good men she will pay all costs ofcapture, crating, and shipping. As achievements, Joanne says she finally got her student loanpaid off, probably making her the only Morris to ever pay a bill. KRAMER, LAURENCE Joanne says he is working at Vendo drilling holes in vendingmachines which has always been sort of a family tradition amongthe Morrises. I remember that most of the vending machines atFort Miller had the Morris family trademarks on them. Did youever wonder why the Morrises always paid for everything with abag of dimes? KRAMER, LESLIE CHILDREN Crystal Female She called me (fairly frantically but I won't say why) andsaid she had fond memories from her youngest years of how herGrandpa, Don Morris, would bounce her on his knee and sing herhis happy children's songs which are far too obscene to print.Even though she was very young at the time, she still rememberedthe words quite clearly and she sang one to me over the phone. Icould have had her arrested. Joanne says that Leslie has fallen in love with a "niceItalian boy" (as if there really was one), with an adorablegrandmother from the old country who speaks broken English, muchlike the Morrises themselves. Leslie brought the "nice Italian boy" to the reunion(he was the one with the shoulder holster) and introduced himaround. Joanne tried to convince me that he is a Mafia hit man,but that's only wishful thinking on her part because she wantsLeslie to date a man with a profession. LEARD, DOUGLAS CHILDREN Douglas Jr. Male Timothy Male Gummo Male Maurice Male Zeppo Male Douglas was there with wife Barbara. His list of children mayhave some omissions because they didn't send back their forms. Ididn't get a chance to talk much with them but they seem to behealthy and in good humor. LEARD, LOUISE (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Douglas Male David Male Michael Male She shamelessly claims that she spent twenty-six and a halfyears "working for the State of California" (an obviouscontradiction in terms) before she retired. She says she now hasmore time for the typical little old lady activities such astraveling (your tax dollars are paying for that), gardening,shopping (your tax dollars again), walking and just being lazy.(How is this so different than government work?) In an astonishing lapse of judgment she admits to havingproduced three children, now variously known as Douglas, David,and Michael. She has not yet seen fit to apologize to anyone forthat. Louise said these letters were OK "as long as you don'tpick on the Leards too much." Get real, lady. We ought tohave a Best Leard Joke contest. (No one gets to submit DavidLeard.) LEARD, MICHAEL CHILDREN None admitted. He bought a home in North Highlands and claims to be gettingcooperation from his neighbors, probably because they think he isa member of a motorcycle gang. He recently bought a .357 magnum, after trying mine out on thecrowds in downtown L.A., and is now laying for the neighbor'scat. Fire the first shot in the air, Michael. It gets themrunning and makes it a whole lot more fun. LINK, BARBARA (nee Sweet) She and Dan didn't show up but Magaret brought some pictureswhich may explain why. They live so far out in the boonies thatthey have to drive in to town just to use the outhouse. MORRIS, ELINOR (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Gary Male Donna Female Joanne Female Harpo Male Robert Male Richard Male Margie Female Chico Male Nancy Female Steven Male Jeff Male Several people wrote to say they were surprised to learn thatwas Don in "Gorillas in the Mist". Amazing realism,they said, but he looks a lot different with his hair combed. Iunderstand that he is currently working on his autobiography, KnuckleTracks in the Sand. Don was there this year, but Elinor was not. Seems she gets abackache just thinking about coming to the reunion. Don waslooking fairly fit (he can still carry his gut around) and he wasexceptionally well-behaved until someone coaxed him out of thetree. He is wearing suspenders now, which should help to cure thebreakaway pants problem which earned him the trophy for MostEmbarrassing Relative. After his belt got to a certain point onhis waistline there was nothing else to stop it, and away hispants would go, far too fast for his reflexes to catch them. Hislack of underwear was the really special touch which put away thecompetition year after year. I understand he even accidentallymooned Nancy's fiance the first time they met. His timing wasalways impeccable. Actually the trophy for Most Embarrassing Relative was retiredin 1975 when he successfully completed his 10,000th career LPF(Loud Public Fart). Younger family members will recognize it asthe Don Morris Memorial Award For Embarrassing Conduct, betterknown as the "Fellah". He has had many, many memorable LPFs including some realstunners in places such as churches, fine restaurants, andcrowded elevators. One window-rattler occurred when someone invited him to attendchurch (never a good idea) in the mistaken belief that it wouldhave some beneficial effect on his moral fiber. He stopped theminister's sermon dead in its tracks and had half thecongregation looking out the windows for storm clouds. "Ijust couldn't resist," Don grinned. "It echoes sonice." "The maitre' d thought I crapped my pants!" Don saysproudly about another incident. "Sir, would you like some assistance?" the maitre' dasked discreetly. "No thanks," said Don, "I can fart pretty goodall by myself." In crowded elevators, his sighs of relief are perhaps evenmore disturbing than the actual event itself. If you really want to know some of the history of why thetrophy was retired, you should ask him to tell you about the timehe got hold of some bad water while driving across the desertwith his boss and his boss's wife. He says he is too old to be a threat to women anymore but thatis probably just a ruse to lure them closer. It is still betterto be safe than sorry. When some men get to his age they tend tolose their inhibitions. NEWCOMB, DOUGLAS CHILDREN Joey Male Pam Female Josh Male Recently moved from North Carolina to Oregon with wife Joannand their multiple children. Currently working in Forklift sales. NEWCOMB, PAUL CHILDREN Kristi Female Ruthie says Paul is a "20-year man" but she didn'tindicate whether that was the Marines or San Quentin. NEWCOMB, RUTH (nee Taylor) CHILDREN Numerous, I am not clear how many, and I don't think she iseither. She proudly confirmed the name of her fiance, Tom Springer -she showed me the driver's license she found in his wallet. Hewas there and he seemed to be a nice enough guy, but probably alittle dazed by it all, and more than a little concerned aboutwhat Ruthie considers to be humorous. Ruthie says she is getting married in August and her grandsonEd will give her away. His is a joy I am sure we wish we allcould share. Ruthie said that she thought that she would have five of hers(so we know she has at least five children) there at the reunionfor the first time in 17 years (apparently a few of them werejust let out). She didn't tell me whether she actually achievedthat but how could I tell anyway? NEWCOMB, STEVE CHILDREN Bridget Female Steve is married to wife Colleen, and working as a carpenterin Santa Rosa. PORTER, MICHAEL ANDREW I got no word from Andy but instead received a note from somewoman who identified herself as Christie Clayton (an obviousalias) and said that Andy had been snared by "a nice younggirl" (where have we heard that before?). She also said thatshe was going to marry him next year and presumably attempt tobreed him in captivity. From what Joanne says, she is apparently fairly well-educated(a high school diploma and actual college classes and stuff) andher interest in Andy has nothing at all to do with her primateresearch project. Christie seems to be a devious type of personso she will probably fit in well. Joanne says Christie works inthe Disaster Coordination Office for Orange County which is whyshe insisted that Christie attend the reunion. This same woman, or someone purporting to be her, showed up atthe reunion with Andy in tow. He used to be a scrawny littlesucker but he ain't no more - the Morris blood lines arebeginning to show as he ages. He is working as a customer servicerep - probably for a loan shark. He laughed about the tricks weused to play on him when he was a kid. He said he got over mostof his anger soon after the casts came off. Joanne says that Andy has surprised everyone and turned into a"responsible human being". One must keep Joanne'sperspective in mind. QUIGLEY, DONNA (nee Morris) CHILDREN Rick Male Amy Female Manfred Male Felix Male Julius Male Donna showed up with her boyfriend Lyle and no clearexplanation of where she got that last name. She and Margie spentmost of the time telling a lot of lies about me as a child. Thetruth is that I never did any of those things. Neither she norMargie has provided a list of their children they can stillremember. RICHARDSON, BECKY CHILDREN Refuses to say. She showed up at the reunion with some apparently namelessguy. I have seen him before but he still looks suspicious. Shesaid his name is "Sadistic Sid" Smith, but he doesn'tlook quite that civilized. She did not say what his position wasin the motorcycle gang. On the subject of her occupation she wisely pleads the FifthAmendment but says that she is making a major contribution to thefinancial health of the California wine industry. She admits tono children or, more correctly, says the government will notrelease the records. RICHARDSON, BUD CHILDREN Meta Female Larry Male Jerry Male By Acquisition from Jan Brent Bryer Male Berri Harter Female How many people knew his real name was Austin? Yeah, you'relying too. Bud clearly holds the record for the best-preservedalias - not even his own family knew his real name. Bud, the elder statesman of the family, looks to be in greatshape. He said he was going to videotape everyone at the reunionand have them actually identify themselves, but I guess some ofthe family had legal objections or something so I don't know ifhe got around to it. As achievements, Bud lists ten grandchildren, and one greatgrandson (it is undetermined whether the word "great"refers to actual family lineage or is just Bud's opinion). He also suggested that we should produce a family tree. He maybe so old that he is simply beyond shame. I have ordered somecomputer software which will allow me to produce one. It shouldembarrass everybody. RICHARDSON, JAMES CHILDREN Becky Female Jamie Female I have to correct the impression I left when I said that"old farts" were not greatly improved by aging. Intruth, he smells about as good as he ever did. He and Edna were there and the years seem to be treating themfairly well. Edna says she is still working while James hasalready retired. James is no fool. My kids tell me that James sagely counseled them to drink beerand smoke pot. Thanks, James, you're a real help. Ednaspecifically requested that Bonnie and I and kids attend thereunion because (to paraphrase her) "misery lovescompany." On Sunday James engaged Laurence and Don in a livelydiscussion of which type of truck and tractor seats produce thebiggest hemorrhoids. I think they finally agreed on unpaddedmetal tractor seats. Never let it be said that we don't haveintellectuals in this family. RICHARDSON, JAMIE CHILDREN None admitted. Jamie says she is currently working as a "respiratorycare practitioner" which she did not explain, but says it isnot the same as selling pot. She said that she is currently at aCatholic hospital but she didn't make it clear if that is whereshe works, or just where they keep her at night. Jamie says she previously spent fifteen years with the Countyof Fresno. She must be referring to employment because they don'tusually hold people in county jails that long unless it is a longseries of offenses. She admits to no children and says she hasbeen spayed, which allows her to engage in a much greater varietyof disgusting behavior. As achievements she says she has a cat and pays her own bills,both of which are apparently new for her. As hobbies she says sheskis cross-country (it helps to be in practice when you aretaking it on the lam), and hikes in the woods, where she meetsmore relatives than she cares to mention. Like Becky, she ismaking a major contribution to the California wine industry, witha marginal preference for corked, rather than screw-capped, wine. RICHARDSON, JERRY CHILDREN Jerry Jr. Male Terri Lynn Female He and wife Karen did not show up. Bud says he is working forSanta Clara County and is doing well. RICHARDSON, LARRY He showed up with his hair and beard dyed mostly gray as partof his Moses imitation. Like Meta, he seems to be pretty wellfed. I didn't get to talk to him much but Bud says he works forBaltimore Cooling Towers in Madera and has just moved into a newhome. RICHARDSON, PETE Pete showed up and related the story of how he told the truthon a few occasions some years back. It's an old story, but hetells it well, and we all enjoyed hearing it again. He says he is going to run in the Nationals in Indianapolis inAugust. If he will keep me posted, I will let you know how hedoes. SHEETS, KATHY (nee Newcomb) CHILDREN Ed Male Drew Male Ed is a lucky kid. Ruthie says that with feet like his henever has to buy swim fins. Kathy works as a wine-maker and makesextra money by renting out Ed's old shoes as duplexes. Terry, herhusband, drives a truck. Ruthie did not say whether he is aTeamster so I don't know anything about his possible criminalbackground. Ed and Drew are reportedly "two of the very bestbaseball players anywhere." (Ruthie's words, apply theTaylor Veracity Factor.) SWEET, MARGARET (nee Richardson) CHILDREN Christine Female Barbara Female Julie Female This year she became the first woman in the family to openlyadmit having four-footed grandchildren. (Laura Richardson wasactually the first, with the birth of the Morrises, but everyonewas too polite to mention it.) She did a heavy-duty grandmotherroutine and bored us all half to death with about a hundredpictures of mountain lions, cheetahs, and the other beasts Julieworks with at the L.A. Zoo. They were cute. Margaret says thatJulie is well-behaved and does not fight with them over the fooddish. TAYLOR, DON Bob & Edith's eldest is a winemaker in Oakville, CA(notice how many Taylors are involved in making wine) andrecently married wife Rosemary on April Fool's Day. Fools rush in. . . TAYLOR, EDITH She was at the reunion, looking good, and apparently no longeron the run from the law. TAYLOR, LAURENCE Laurence was there with his famous hat. It really makes youwonder, doesn't it? At first I thought he wore it to hold hisbrains in, but then I realized that couldn't be true. Somerelatives said that what I reported about Laurence was notcorrect at all. Contrary to what I said, they asserted thatLaurence had not been caught telling the truth, and stated theyfound it difficult to believe that he ever would be caughttelling the truth. My apologies, Laurence. Laurence spent a good deal of time telling about his work withthe FAA. He says that he is not an Air Traffic Controller butdoes something to maintain the equipment all of the Air TrafficControllers use. I am sure that we will all feel better aboutflying just knowing Laurence is on the job. TAYLOR, LOUISE She was there at the reunion looking good and doing well. Noword on whether she is still connected to the KGB. TAYLOR, ROBERT Bob & Edith's youngest is a history teacher and basketballcoach, presumably at some sort of school, in Woodland Hills,California. He recently took it on the lam to Egypt, Greece, andTurkey. No word yet on whether he managed to make it throughCustoms coming back.

If youhave not made arrangements to attend the reunion you should do itnow. Margaret sent me a couple of maps to help you out in locatingthe more important sites in the area of the reunion. You may notethat she has indicated the location of her home on one of themaps. I am not sure, but I believe she mentioned that if anyonecould not find any other camping space or an available motel,they could camp on her front lawn. No need to call - just pitchyour tent and be there when she wakes up in the morning. Sheshould enjoy it. Margaret says she has a new grandchild, and Bud a newgreat-grandchild, so you can expect both of them to beparticularly boastful this year. Dorothy says that Margaret is anunusually aggressive grandmother so it may be best to avoid heraltogether. Only a few of you have sent back your family informationforms. Of course, there is no compulsion to send in your form (orcontributions) - it is entirely voluntary. You will note,however, that Don and Elinor did not send theirs in last year.This year, Elinor was quite prompt. As you all may have expected, there has been no word from the low-down,no-good Richardson individual living in Ohio who has neverattended even a single family reunion. (Due to my extremerespect for Bill Henry, I will not mention the name ofthis thoroughly disreputable individual.) Because the low-down, no-good Richardson individual livingin Ohio who has never attended even a single family reunionhas not returned his family information form, and has no apparentintention of attending even a single family reunion, I shall haveto fill in his family's information the best I can. Therefore, Iam asking all of you to think hard and come up with all thestories from this individual's past which most clearly delineatehis complete lack of character. There are a number of episodesfrom his past which I am quite certain he would not want repeatedunder any circumstances (I can think of several that are sodisgusting they would gag a maggot and make a hooker blush) solet's collect all of these tales and make sure they are publishedwhere all the world can read them. Because he has neverattended even a single family reunion we all know that he isbeyond shame, but perhaps we can induce some shame in some othermember of his immediate family. I have completed the editing and formatting of Mary Taylor'sfamily history and I had intended to include it in this mailing,but my laser printer is having serious problems so it will haveto wait. Besides, I am not sure if I want to send something soworthwhile to that low-down, no-good Richardson individualliving in Ohio who has never attended even a single familyreunion. With any luck I should be able to have it printedand ready to distribute to anyone who attends the reunion, whichwill naturally exclude that low-down, no-good Richardsonindividual living in Ohio who has never attended even a singlefamily reunion. We will see you all at the reunion (with the exception of acertain nameless and shameless Richardson individual). CallMargaret if you have any questions.

Margaret and Vic were our hosts last year. They left townimmediately after the reunion, claiming that the timing of theirmove was just a coincidence. The last I heard they were holed upin a cave in the badlands of New Mexico. As usual, we were supremely graced by the absence of severaldisreputable Richardson individuals living in Ohio who have neverattended a single reunion. (As I have stated before, I do notwish to embarrass Bill Henry by mentioning any names, orby pointing out that he is the only original Richardson whohas never shown his face at any reunion.) I asked severalpeople if they had heard from these no-good people, seeing as howthey had not replied to any of the notices, or even returnedtheir family information sheets. (The truth must be far tooshameful for even them to admit.) The Hell's Angels have a ratherunique reproach for people who fall asleep at their parties and Ifelt it was only fair that we also have a similar reproach forpeople who consistently fail to attend reunions for a soliddecade. I put out the word that I am interested in collecting, andpublishing, stories from this individual's past which would showhis most disgusting habits and complete lack of character. Hemoved his family away from the rest of us just about the time hiskids were learning to talk so, no doubt, they have not heard thebest part of this low-down, no-good individual's criminal career. As soon as I put out the word for stories of this type, LouiseLeard and Margaret Sweet immediately leapt to his defense sayingthat he is a very busy and important person (they don't haveenough practice lying to make it sound believable) and they weresure there was some good reason why this low-down, no-goodindividual had missed every single reunion in the last ten years.Of course, this just illustrates my point about this individual'scharacter. How low must one sink before Margaret and Louise come to yourdefense? (They have never defended my good character, or come tothe defense of any Morris that I can recall.) They bothproclaimed with the loudness of an incompetent liar that thisindividual had always been of sterling character and that therewere no terrible tales to tell from his childhood. They were soloud, in fact, that I could not catch most of the details of thestories Don and Laurence were telling about him. I believe thatDon may have gotten this individual mixed up with Herman Klomp insome of the stories but that's not important It is a sad case indeed when Margaret and Louise are left tostick up for you. In any case, you should all know that I will becollecting the most embarrassing stories about this low-down,no-good individual and publishing them soon, so his family mayknow the complete truth about why he consistently fails to attendeven a single family reunion. Those of you who attended know that I passed around copies ofMary Taylor's Family History which I transcribed and printed outon the computer. I am not entirely sure who got copies so I haveincluded some copies in this newsletter for the people whoweren't there. (This, of course, includes the low-down,no-good Richardson individual from Ohio who has never attended asingle family reunion.) If you did not receive a copy at thereunion, and I did not include one for you here, just drop me aline and I will send you a copy. It is a pretty interesting viewof the family's history going back a couple of centuries,although some people have commented that Mary was rather"optimistic" in recounting the facts. There was an unusually aggressive pack of grandparents at thereunion, all of them armed with a deadly arsenal of babypictures. Margaret and Vic, having waited so long for their firsttwo-footed grandchild, were perhaps the most vicious of thebunch. Margaret showed me some pictures of her and I had to admitthat she is an incredibly beautiful child, with a sparklingpersonality, and possessed of talents that ordinary human beingscan scarcely imagine. As soon as I did admit it, Margaret tookher foot off my throat, Vic picked me up, dusted me off, and theyboth allowed as how they had always known that I was a gentlemanof intelligence and good taste. Margaret and Vic were apparently unable to persuade Julie toattend the reunion. Julie explained to me that, although sheworks at the LA Zoo, she has no direct experience with largeprimates. Julie puts on little shows at the LA Zoo where, amongother things, she sings a duet with a coyote. (Really!) It'spretty interesting, but it must be said that the coyote has thedistinctly better voice. Julie also raised a mountain lion in herhome (how'd you like have this chick for a neighbor?). She saidthere was no problem at all as long as she had dinner ready ontime and didn't make any sudden movements. Dorothy showed up with that old tale about how she went to thehospital and the nurse wrote on her chart that she "looks atleast ten years younger than her stated age." If you haven'theard that story yet, just get within fifty yards of her, and Iam sure the subject of medical charts will come up soon enough.We will probably have to listen to that until she is at least tenyears older than her stated age. James pontificated quite a while about the problems of theseUnited States and how he would solve them if he was king. Cut offsome bodily part, he said, every time someone commits a crime.Lop off a hand, or an arm, or a foot, or something more valuable,he said. It's an interesting idea but, if that was really thelaw, his nickname would have been "Stubby" for manyyears now. In the interests of justice and fair play, he said hewould not impose any penalties for anyone who chose toprevaricate. In fact, he said, that is one of the few areas wherehe thinks government subsidies would be justified. James allows that some Richardsons, and perhaps a few Taylors,might have committed some minor variations from the absolutefacts on rare occasions, but swears that he has never been knownto tamper with the truth. I thought about that quite a while andthen I had to admit that he was probably right. I could notrecall any time that he had been close enough to the truth thathe could have been accused of tampering with it. Edna admits that her once-famous morals are gone. She says shesaves her copies of the Reunion News. Doug and Barbara were there with their delightfully comatosechildren. They recently made a trip with a motorcycle gang downto the tip of Baja where they frolicked with the mating whales,burned and pillaged a few mountain villages, participated in afew large drug shipments, and had many other exciting adventures.They came to visit us on the way back and took us out for a niceMexican food dinner -- which is not always a good idea when aLeard is around. (I am sure we have all had an unfortunateadventure in that regard.) "We didn't get the turistas near as bad as wethought we would!" Doug shouted through the bathroom door. Iwas glad. Pete has had a busy year. He says that he is still winningfoot races even at his advanced age, although he still hasn'texplained why someone would want to deliberately run around in acircle just so they could get back to where they started beforesomebody else did. He says he went to some track meet back inIndianapolis where (he claims) he won the 400 and 800 meter racesand placed second in the 1500, or some such nonsense. When thisstatement was greeted with some modest skepticism, he swore thatit was true (his standard first reply) and said the low-down,no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has neverattended even a single family reunion would verify everythinghe said. If two Richardsons swear to it, it's got to be true,Pete said. Alternatively, he offered to swear on a stack offamily birth certificates. As most of you already know (with the exception perhaps ofcertain low-down, no-good Richardson individuals living inOhio who have never attended a single family reunion), Petehas taken a wife, Sandy. Sandy said she thinks his name is Pauland that what attracted her to Pete was his refined, gentlemanlymanners. As you might expect, that caused a good deal ofhilarity. She is a Bohemian kind of person who wears funny clothes andcalls herself an "artist" and a "designer",although she was a little fuzzy on just what it is she"designs". I was in her company for most of two daysand she never did pass around any good drugs so there is somequestion about her artistic credentials. She does, however, likebeer, and seems to be friendly even when she has had a few. Sheclaimed to be a lady of refinement and good taste before I gotthe pictures of her with her head stuck in a watermelon. Most ofus hadn't seen such a sight since James sold his livestock. Shefits in pretty well. David Leard did not attend this year. He sent me a Christmascard with a rather snide remark about how I must have learned mywriting skills in jail -- a crack which was totally uncalled forconsidering all the nice things I have said about the Leards.David said that he was making huge sums of money in real estatebut he sent no cash. In a prepared statement, Louise Leard said that David's recentventures in real estate had nothing at all to do with the failureof several savings and loans in the Seattle area and she wasconfident that the criminal investigations would exonerate himcompletely. She explained that David did not attend the reunionbecause one of his escrows did not close when it should have sohe was not legally allowed to leave town. We all nodded like webelieved everything she said. Jerry was there promoting beer as the answer to a balanceddiet. He swears that he cannot be recognized without a beer canin his hand. I recognized him immediately, but then the pile ofbeer cans had shifted and his head was sticking out. Last year I received an invitation to Laurence and Wilma'swedding, of all things. Laurence and Wilma said they wereinviting me to attend because I am "an important part"of their lives. I wondered a long time what they meant by that.Then I realized Laurence had to be talking about the time we allgot drunk and trashed his apartment. When we left, Laurence wasstanding out on the balcony in his underwear, yelling somethingat us. If he had been sober enough to remember who we were, I amsure he would have made sense. It's times like those that make afamily. From what I could gather from the invitation, it seems thatLaurence actually asked Wilma to marry him some twenty-five yearsago or so, and it has taken this long to convince her that it isa good idea. He lies pretty good, but apparently not good enoughto put that one across right away. Ruthie and Tom were there. She wanted me to correct a minormisstatement that I made in a previous issue of the Reunion News.She said she wanted to make it clear that she did not sendme a picture of Tom bound and gagged in the trunk of her car.Apparently it was some other guy. Tom, who was pretty frisky the year before, looked a littletired at times, like someone who had just spent the last year asthe only rooster in a ten acre hen house. Ruthie, on the otherhand, says she loves married life. She explains that Tom is stillin shock from the last reunion, which is certainlyunderstandable. Maybe it was just more than he expected. Joanne was there, and managed to wrestle a few of the othergrandmothers to the ground to show them pictures of her accusedgrandchildren. She called me after the reunion with somegrandiose scheme to lure unsuspecting men into joining a computerdating service. I don't know why she wanted it on a computer, itwas pretty obvious which chick was going to get the date. The last I heard, Joanne said her son, Laurence Kramer, wasworking as a taste-tester on an alfalfa farm in Nevada. I asked Becky why Jamie has missed the last few reunions. Shesaid that the reunions are usually scheduled the same week as theGay Pride parade in San Francisco and Jamie goes to the paradeinstead of the reunion. That way, she says, she doesn't run intoquite so many oddballs. Don Morris says that Elinor does not write letters, but I gotone from her last year thanking me for all the nice things I saidabout Don in the last Family Doings. She was, however, a littlemiffed that I failed to mention two of her children, Bonzo andCheetah Morris. Don was there. It would purely amaze you, but he is just asgood-looking and charming as he ever was. He may have slowed downa step or two but any sudden body movements can still clear out acrowd just as quick as ever. Margaret and Vic thought ahead andchose a windswept beach for the reunion. Like all the Morrises,Don complained a lot about how hard it is to find comfortableshoes for feet with an opposing thumb. He says that Elinor"understood" all those little jokes I wrote in the lastReunion News but confessed that some of it was just toointellectual for him. I helped him count his bananas and told himI understood how confusing these letters can be. "You can't insult a Morris," Don said. It ain't forlack of trying. Some people disputed my previous statements about Don. Theythought I flattered him unnecessarily and said they did notbelieve he had ever been in church. I assert that he has,although (by mutual agreement with the minister) it never was aregular thing. "We love our Brother Don," the ministersaid, "but even Jesus has limits." "If they don't want you to fart, why do they call it apew?" Don asked indignantly. He does not understand muchabout religion. Did you ever wonder what happened to Baby Huey when he retiredfrom comic books? I met Jeff Morris when he was wandering arounddown on the beach, still wearing the radio tracking collar thegame wardens gave him. He was roaming around pretty freely so Iassumed he was out of range of their receivers. His fur is not aslong as Don's but the consensus of opinion is that they are thesame sub-species. "Cliffy," he said. "Long time, no see." "Most of the time, not long enough," I said. "Didn't you used to have long hair and a beard?"Jeff asked. "Nope, I always had a crew cut and I was clean-shaven.You must be thinking of your sisters. You remember." I toldhim. "Oh, yeah, now I remember," he said. "You looka lot different with a beard." "Say, Jeff, what are you doing these days?" "Being a bum, mooching off my Dad, getting intotrouble." I was surprised. He seems safe, though it's hard to tell withanything that big. "Say, Jeff," I asked, "how many tranquilizerdarts does it take to bring you down?" He said he didn't know for sure and then told me someoutlandish story about how some woman wanted him to come livewith her and just be a bum over at her place. It's the Morrisdream but he didn't have all the details consistent. I got some real nice pictures of Don and Jeff and I showedthem to the clerk in the drug store when I got them developed. "A friend of mine shot one of those things in NorthernWashington," he said. "His wife wouldn't let him bringit in the house." That confused me. "David Leard lives up that way, but no Morrises that Iknow of." I told him. He looked at the pictures again. "Coulda been a Leard Iguess." There was some discussion of the fact that the familygenealogy is, shall we say, subject to interpretation.Some went so far as to state that Don Morris is not, strictlyspeaking, a blood relative and, therefore, it is not necessary toclaim him, despite his obvious achievements. I feel that he mustbe included, if only because he has infested an unusually largeportion of the family and he seems to show up at the slightestmention of free food. There are, however, larger issues involved. Over the years, the Richardson-Taylor clan has acquiredmembers by a number of different methods, including adoption,acquisition by marriage, friends who just kept hanging around,(on a few occasions) actual "legitimate" births, andfrom other causes far too complicated to explain in ten or twelvepages. This can sometimes be confusing to children and others whoare not fully acquainted with the difference between admitted andactual history. I remember when I was growing up I used to ask my motherquestions like, "What relation is David Leard to me?" "He's your first cousin," she said. "Are you sure?" "Sure. Just check the tag on his ear." She handed mea code book from the Department of Fish and Game. "What is Steve Morris to me?" "He's your first cousin, too." "Are all the Morrises my first cousins?" "In general they are. There are a few exceptions, butthose are purely on scientific grounds." "What is Laurence?" "Laurence is best avoided," she said. "That's common knowledge," I said. "But whatrelation?" "Oooooh, he's just some kind of relative or other." "But what kind? Cousin? Uncle? Great-aunt? What?" "I'm sure that he is at least one or more of those,"she said. "Otherwise, it would be easier to get rid ofhim." "Well, then, what about Ruthie? What relation isshe?" I asked. "Do you think it will rain?" Some of you may have noticed that Mary avoided certainquestions with respect to the family history. I am sure theremust be a good, logical explanation. Since I started the newsletter, and will some day publish afamily tree, I have been informed that several members of thefamily were acquired by means which were, shall we say, notexactly standard. Let it suffice to say that a large portion ofthe family might not pass pedigree standards for the AmericanKennel Club. As some of you may know, there is even a branch ofthe family which is no blood relation at all, but was acquiredsolely because they smelled hamburgers on the grill. In any event, it shall be my policy to consider any familymember, however acquired, to be on a par with any other familymember who does not have quite so much to explain about theirbloodlines. How you got here (marriage, adoption, or factuallyrecorded birth) is basically irrelevant so, unless someoneinsists, I will not list details of how someone got to be at anyparticular branch on the family tree. Nor will I attempt to judgethe relative merits of anyone's lineage. Just take my word forit, that is who they are represented to be. See you at the reunion, (with the exception of the low-down,no-good Richardson individual who lives in Ohio and has neverattended a single family reunion). Sincerely, Clifford A. Schaffer 1992 Reunion Details When: June 20 & 21, 1992 Where: Mooney Grove, Visalia, California Arbor number 11 That's really good thinking, Becky -- inviting Don Morris to aplace called "Mooney Grove." Contribution: The standard contribution is again $8.00per household, giving the greatest benefit to those of you who breed likerabbits. Those of you who wish to send more may do so. The money goesinto a reunion fund which is used to pay for others who can'tmanage it, or it is carried forward to the following year. Beckysays that if you contribute enough money, she will investigatepossible campsites in Rio De Janeiro for our benefit. Send yourcash, check, or small items of jewelry to: Becky says that it would be helpful to know how manybottomless pits you will be bringing with you so she can havesome idea how many sides of beef she will need. Please reply by June 1 to let her know. Bring: Salads, beans (it's OK, it's outdoors - juststay upwind of the Leards), desserts, and munchies. Bring your own beverages and a healthy load of charcoal. Becky said to bring special dishes, gourmet cuisine, andsomething which will "suprise us all." Please don't. Idon't think she realizes what she is saying. Especially, pleasedon't bring anything you found in the park. How to Get There and Other Notes Becky has chosen Visalia for this year's reunion. As you cansee from the enclosed sheet, it is the "Jewel of theValley". Some of you may recognize it by other names. Shesays she chose it because it is the only place in the area with alow to moderate amount of gunfire in the city parks. Here is Becky's description of how to get to Mooney Grove: To get to Mooney Grove in Visalia, take the Hwy 198exit off Hwy 99. You will be turning east and the exit signs willindicate Visalia/Sequoia National Park. You will drive right pastthe majority of the motels as you head into town. Five milesafter you exit Hwy. 99 and are now heading east on Hwy. 198, takethe Mooney Blvd. exit and turn right (south). Aftercrawling about five miles through all the traffic, there will bea little open space and on the left (east) side will be MooneyGrove. There is an alternate route to get to Mooney Grove withoutusing the heavily trafficked Mooney Blvd. Take theTagus/Ave. 264 exit east off Hwy 99 (this will be south of theHwy 198 exit by 6 miles), continue east on Ave. 264 until MooneyBlvd. where you will turn left (North). Mooney Grovewill be on your right (east) real soon. What do you think the Morrises will be thinking about by thetime they get there? Let's just hope they don't get out of hand. Becky says this place is a county park (not unlike the placewhere some of you may be residing) with lots of tall trees,grass, kiddie play areas, and a duck pond where the Leards cangrab an occasional snack without bothering the rest of us. Aboutforty miles east of Visalia is the entrance to Sequoia NationalPark. You may want to plan to visit Sequoia during your trip. We have a large covered arbor -- number 11, on the leftafter you enter the park -- reserved for both days. There areelectrical outlets on the site so you all can bring you favoriteappliances. Mooney Grove has a $2.00 per vehicle entrance fee.There is NO parking around the outside of the park. Those whowish to save money and/or help relieve the parking gridlockwithin the park will need to leave extra vehicles and form carpools at the shopping center north of the park, or at lodgingsites. Of course, if you just hitchhiked down for the freehamburgers - even better. In keeping with tradition (tradition? When did we ever haveany tradition beyond petty theft?) we will slaughter the fattedcalf around noon and put bowls out for the Morrises and theLeards. We will have an early dinner on Saturday to try to gettheir bellies full before the sun goes down. There are two RV campgrounds nearby and campers need toreserve early as this area gets very busy with folks traveling toand from the National Parks. Motelers have a good variety of choices. Most of the motelsare along Hwy 198 between Hwy 99 and Visalia proper; these arerecommended. (Apparently Becky has some considerable experiencewith them.) There are also motels on Mooney Blvd. Mooney Blvd. isthe main commercial strip complete with six lanes of heavytraffic , all stop and go due to frequent traffic lights . Thisis also where the cruisers cruise. At one time, Visalia wasplanned as the site for the movie American Graffiti, untilthe producers decided to go to the more exciting town of Modesto. The Visalia KOA has a full range of sites offering no services(comparable to home) to full hook-ups and tent areas. It appearsto be clean and well-maintained. Amenities include a pool, gameroom, and a small playground. Becky says she was quoted $16.65for full hook-ups. Reserve early, their busy season starts inApril. See the enclosed sheets for location map and campgroundlayout.

The annual family reunion has come and goneagain. I believe it is caused by a chemical imbalance in thebrain. Well, for all of you who attended the reunion this year, youknow that Becky and Carl put on one of the better feeds of thepast few years. There was some really good steak, and everybodybrought a lot of other fixings which, luckily, we did not have toshare with any of the lower creatures such as Bill Henry. All inall, I would say it was successful. Only a couple of people tookshots at me, and both of those were deflected. Becky, being thegracious hostess that she is, offered to help them reload, butcooler heads prevailed. When we got to the reunion, Meta came running out to meet us.I am a good bit faster than she is, so I kept a good distancebetween us until I was sure she was in a good mood. I am sure youwill understand when I tell you that the sight of a smilingrelative fills me with mixed emotions. I never know whether theyare genuinely glad to see me, or just anticipating the pleasureof killing me. Meta is an especially dangerous relative becauseshe works at the Internal Revenue Service where she is themanager of Torture Chamber Number 3. She says that it is againstthe rules for her to look up any particular person's taxes, whichhelps to establish her alibi when you are suddenly picked for anaudit. Beware of anyone who claims innocence before your badluck. As usual, Bill Henry did not show up for the umpteenth year ina row. As you all know, I have no interest in trashing hisreputation, even if such a thing was possible. Therefore I shalltry to report only the most favorable things I heard about him. There were signs that Bill Henry would show up, but it turnedout to be a false alarm -- somebody ran over a skunk. Bud was notfooled, he knew right away it wasn't Bill Henry. "Ain't nearly as pungent as Bill Henry," he said."You'd have to have whole carload of skunks before I'd thinkBill Henry was coming." "Now Bud," Louise said, "I think you're goingto offend some skunks with that kind of talk." As it turned out, nobody had anything nice to say about thislow-down individual. Even Louise Leard, who normally comes to hisdefense, had to admit that Bill Henry and soapy water had neverbeen close companions. "You have to remember that it is notreally his fault that he has never attended a singlereunion," she said. "it is just that he is so obese nowthat he takes up two first-class seats on the airplane. He has tosteal an awful lot to get that much money." Ruthie tried to apologize for him. "I heard he tried tocome but his kids couldn't make it through the farm animalquarantine." "Talking about farm animals," Pete said,"Living with Bill Henry was kinda like living with a grandchampion Berkshire hog that eats nothing but chili beans." "Now, be careful there," Louise cautioned him."You might offend some Berkshire hogs that way." Don said the worst things about Bill Henry. "Me and BillHenry are buddies," he said, "like two peas in a pod.Bill Henry always looked up to me as a model of refinement andfine behavior. Of course, he never was quite the gentleman that Iam." Don was right about that. Bill Henry never was a highsociety character like Don, and was not nearly as good-looking,either. I called Bill Henry, just to see if he had any kind ofmiserable excuse for missing every single reunion that has everbeen held. He was his usual weasel self. He told me that the mostrecent lewd conduct charges were all a mistake, because he wasonly holding it for a friend. He told me he was coming to California in December to see somewoman named Nasa. He said Dawn knew nothing about it and tried toget me to believe that he and all his family are doing well. Markis either in college or in jail, and Craig is in his senior yearin high school and will soon be eligible to be tried as an adult.Dawn, he says, was recently arrested for a long string ofunsolicited good deeds. Bill says he has been doing a fair amountof running in 5K races lately and soon hopes to run asub-15-minute mile. He became concerned about his physicalcondition when some old lady ran him down and took her purseback. As usual, he gave me the mealy-mouth pretty bad about comingto the reunion. He said he would try but he could not promiseanything. (His wife hears that a lot.) He said he wanted to makeup for his thoroughly disgusting behavior, so he told me to telleveryone that he would give one hundred dollars to every personwho calls him collect to remind him to come to thereunion. He said to be sure to call between the hours of midnightand 2 AM, California time. If he seems a bit irritable when youcall, just hang up and try again in ten or fifteen minutes. James and Edna were there in fine form, and James spent a gooddeal of time telling me about one occasion when he did not go tojail even though, by his own admission, he thoroughly deservedit. Don Morris was there. More than anything else he reminds me ofa mountain gorilla with a good beer gut, wearing Frisco jeans anda long-sleeved shirt, desperately trying to pass for human. Youhave to give him credit because sometimes he almost makes it.Elinor came along, too, with no unrealistic expectations aboutDon's behavior. Jeff did not come along. Elinor explained that heslipped his collar and ran off to Sacramento. Elinor does notattend all that many reunions but it must be stated that herattendance record is a thousand times better than Bill Henry's. Iheard that Don was sick with a heart problem earlier this yearand, on one occasion, he actually passed on for a short time. TheLord, however, saw Don knocking on the pearly gates, thoughtbetter of His actions, and immediately sent Don back. Don says I"appreciate" him. I suppose that is one way of puttingit. I guess the Lord does too. Joanne was there with her new granddaughter. It looks as ifChristy's attempts to breed Andy have been successful. Theirdaughter is an absolutely stunning child, a fact which can beconfirmed by anyone who had the misfortune to wander too close toJoanne's new cub. I would send you all a picture of her but theonly picture I got shows Joanne proudly displaying her in theMorris Moon position, and you have all seen that before. HerGrandpa Don is justifiably proud. Pete and Sandy were there. Pete says I should go talk to Garyin Oregon. Ruthie says that she has the highest possible opinionof Sandy and explained that Sandy is Grade-A Certifiable. I thinkwe can believe Ruthie on this one. Ruthie was there but Tom was not. Ruthie explained that, inless than two years of marriage, Tom had come down with doublepneumonia so she thought it best to leave town while herecovered. Louise Leard wrote me a letter in which she told me that sheliked all the parts of these letters that I thought were thedullest. There is no accounting for taste, particularly inLouise's case. She says that she enjoys reading them aloud withthe other members of her family. Now that is something I nevereven contemplated -- Louise Leard telling fart jokes to hergrandchildren. Maybe she should ask Don to come over and share afew of his experiences with them. Louise said that she waspleased to see that I was able to talk about the Leards withoutusing swear words, because it is so seldom done. We missed Edith and Louise Taylor at the reunion for the firsttime in years. They are usually there every year, except forthose rare occasions when there are rumors that Bill Henry mightshow up. The last I heard they were both doing well and makinglots of money. Edith is probably organizing a marathon. Bud was the clear winner for bringing the most family membersto this reunion. I never thought he was that prolific, but fromthe looks of the crowd that he had, he must have been having awhole lot more fun than I thought. You could tell they were allrelated to him, too. They showed up and the food vanished. Several of you have complained about (among other things) thatI never say anything about myself and my family. Part of this isdue to the fact that I tend to be considerably more refined thanthe rest of you (especially the Ohio branch of the family) but,in deference to the unending stream of complaints about one thingor another, I shall try. What can I tell you about my family? You can't really hatesomebody until you marry them. There is no happiness in life thathaving children cannot cure. Serena and Alyssa (the twins) have both graduated from highschool, more or less on time. The Pope has declared it a miracleand will be erecting a small shrine in front of our house. Alyssais now going to the local junior college studying nothing inparticular, and works as a secretary for a real estate appraiser.Serena has been working full time for the last two years atPinkerton Detectives in the Employee Benefits Department, andwill begin college in January. They have matching worthlessboyfriends. Melissa is in high school, has not been arrested recently(last thirty days) and had a job over the summer doing telephonecanvassing for a real estate company. Her boss said she was goodat talking on the phone -- a real surprise for all of us. Courtney is now in junior high school and is wearing thebraces that could have been my new car. Anyone who thinks theyhave ever seen stubborn should meet Courtney. For years she hasinsisted that one of the Four Tops biggest hits was "I'll BeDarned". Bonnie works at Pinkerton as some kind of manager in thecomputer systems department, when she is not home complaining. Asa hobby, they all spend money. Now, I am sure that all of you with children feel that yourchildren are a very special brand of idiot. In the majority ofcases, I am sure you are right. That is, you spend a good deal oftime just staring in amazement and shaking your head at the dumbthings they do. Well, so do I, but yours probably don't make itinto the local newspaper. I have enclosed a copy of a newsarticle which appeared in our local newspaper. It seems that Courtney (our youngest) was accused of gamblingat school. One of her friends dropped a quarter, so Courtneypicked it up and handed it to her. One of the teachers (awell-known local nut) saw Courtney do it and assumed thatCourtney and her friend were gambling. Consequently, the teacherconfiscated the money, which was the friend's lunch money, andsaid Courtney must come in for Saturday school (their usualpunishment for schoolyard felonies). It was clearly a bum rapbecause neither one of them could even accurately describe theusual technique of gambling, because neither one of them had muchinterest in it until they got busted. We, as parents, took exception to a stupid situation andprotested the matter but, as long as Courtney didn't have to goto the Saturday school, we were ready to drop it. However, I amsure the school authorities had no idea they were messing withAlyssa. Alyssa is the kind of person who will tell people off justbecause they need to be told off. She sort of considers it as apublic service on her part. In fact, she goes out of her way tofind people who need this service. Since we have lived here shehas told off the neighbors, their kids, their pets, thehomeowners association, the gardeners, the security guards, themail man, the street sweeper, the sheriff, and the peoplebuilding the housing tract next door -- to name a few. Somehow,an issue always seems to come up which requires her input. She isoften the kind of person who makes you wonder if you can knockthem out with one punch. Alyssa could piss off the Pope. MotherTheresa would strangle her. I have disclaimed any knowledge ofher on many public occasions. Alyssa never seems to run short of things that she objects toand she likes nothing better than a good crusade, so when thishappened to her younger sister she was outraged and vowed to dosomething about it. I am not entirely sure why she felt she hadto do something because, on any other occasion, she wouldgleefully torment Courtney in any way she could, and I have hadto break up more than a few good fist fights between these two.If she could have personally arranged for Courtney to attendextra Saturday schools on any other occasion, I am sure she wouldhave done it in a heartbeat. I guess the injustice of thesituation was just too much for Alyssa to tolerate. Alyssa called the local newspaper and reported it to them,providing them with our correspondence with the school, the nameof the other girl, a few other pertinent facts, and a suitableamount of righteous indignation. They investigated and publishedthe enclosed article on page one of the Sunday paper. As result, the school authorities now eye Courtney with greatsuspicion, like Richard Nixon views reporters. No doubt they willtread lightly when they think of messing with Alyssa, or anyonewho might know her. Their policy of arbitrarily seizing moneyfrom kids has, however, stopped. As for me, I am doing itinerant computer consulting, somewriting on various subjects, and a good deal of rabble-rousingfor radical organizations such as the American Civil LibertiesUnion. I am the only member of the Los Angeles Chapter who isalso a member of the National Rifle Association. Even the ACLUthinks I am a radical. It makes me feel special to be a misfiteven among the misfits. My specialty is the legalization of drugs, although I willwillingly engage almost any conservative fool on almost anysubject. As some of you may already know I have spent the lastfew years debating everyone from local prosecutors to the DrugCzars on this issue and, to date, have never lost. The reason Idon't lose is simple enough -- any rational review of theevidence shows that legalization is a far better approach. Mostof the information I have is really surprising. Do you know why drugs were originally outlawed? Cocaine wasoutlawed because of the fear that superhuman Negro Cocaine Fiendswould drink large amounts of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola and go on aviolent sexual rampage and rape white women. Caffeine was almostoutlawed at the same time because of the same fear. Policenationwide switched from .32 caliber to .38 caliber pistolsbecause, as one police officer put it, "Those cocaineniggers sure are hard to kill." Opiates were outlawedbecause of racial prejudice against the Chinese, and marijuanawas outlawed as a legal weapon against Mexican laborers duringthe Depression. The laws never had anything to do with publichealth and safety. As some of you may know, this year there were three judgesfrom Orange County who publicly came out and said they supportedlegalization of drugs. I have been coaching these judges on howto debate the subject of drug legalization in media appearancesand there has been more than a little success. In any flat-footeddebate they are just about unbeatable. On one recent radio talkshow one of the judges I am coaching was supposed to debateSherman Block, the LA County Sheriff. The morning of the debate,Sheriff Block announced that he would have to release 20 percentof all of the prisoners in Los Angeles County because there wereno more jails to hold them. Sheriff Block failed to show up forthe debate and the radio station could not find any official inLA or Orange County who was willing to defend the criminal lawsagainst drugs. A recent survey showed that forty percent of allof the judges in Orange County now support legalization. (Can you imagine Louise Leard reading this propaganda aboutdrug legalization to her grandchildren? I'm gonna get scolded forsure. She already blames me for corrupting her youngest child,and still watches me warily when I talk to him.) Attached you will find the latest info on the next reunion.Pete says there will be more information later, presumably afterhe has already collected all the money. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night! Reunion Details Where:                  Merced River Resort, near Turlock                                                                     When:                   June 26 and 27, 1993                                                                                                           In the absence of further information from Pete,                           we should assume that the contribution will be                             the same, $8.00 per household or loosely                                   organized mob.                                     Important:              Pete says he needs to know who is coming by        January 15, 1993 in order to reserve the camp                              sites.  Reserved camp sites, tents, and trailers                           will need to be paid for by April 15, 1933.        The campground has camp sites, tents, trailers which may bereserved on a first-come, first-served basis. The camp sites andtents each rent for $15 per night, and you may have more than onetent per camp site. The trailers rent for $35 per night. The trailers, I am told,have three beds and will sleep up to six people, depending upontheir degree of familiarity. One bed is an actual bed, anotherbed is really a table, and a third is a sofa -- kinda like we allused to sleep when we lived on Fedora. The trailers are supposedto be 24 footers with all of the amenities of home. Those of youwho use linens on your bed will need to bring them with you. Pete says to get your reservations in early because there areonly six trailers and Pete and Laurence have already taken two ofthem. Ruthie will probably take another one, so anyone whodoesn't speak quickly is going to be sleeping in the park again. There is also a clubhouse which serves breakfast from 9 to 10AM (too early for me) for about two or three dollars per adult(too rich for most of us). Alternatively, they have largedumpsters available to feed the Morrises and the Leards. Additional accommodations are available in the motels inTurlock eight miles away, for $36 to $44 per night. Pete says hewill supply more information about these later.

As heclaimed before, it is being held at the Merced River Resortwhich, he further goes on to claim, is a luxurious private resortand park with numerous amenities such as a swimming pool, spa,enormous club house, and neighboring nudist camp. They havebreakfast in the morning for a nominal fee and kids can eat forhalf price. He says that it is so good that they guarantee goodweather. He also says that there are lots of things in the areasuch as the Museum at Castle Air Base, the Musuem of MercedCounty, some sort of Pioneer Exhibit, and the Yosemite WildlifeArea. Doug Leard wrote to commend me on my "internecineapprobation." (Douglas is sometimes excessivelysesquipedalian.) He went on to say that I should spread some moreof that condemnation on other people in the family, besides thelower-grade Ohio member, such as Robert and Richard Morris, whosecombined attendance record is nil and seldom. Robert is nowliving in Florida and I am of the belief that it is not goodpolicy to encourage any Morris to come out of a swamp. Richardlast attended at one of the Santa Cruz reunions where he got tooclose to the campfire and burned his fur pretty badly. I hearthat he still has a large bald spot on his back and is stillshaken up by the experience. Bud wrote to say that he has a new great-grandson named (ofall things) James Richardson, born January 23, 1993, weighing inat seven pounds, eleven ounces, and 21.5 inches long. As usual,Bud took more credit for this event than any three people wouldhave deserved, and says that one of his grandchildren played someminor role in helping to bring this about. We certainlycongratulate him but I think that, in view of the historicalrecord, his parents might have been more judicious in theirchoice of a name. I have heard that Edna took a nasty fall and broke her legpretty badly. She did not explain why she chose to do this, Iwould think that she would have wanted to avoid it. Anyway, Ialso heard that she seems to be recovering pretty well now butmay still have a slight limp when she gets to the reunion. I wassorry to hear about her getting hurt but I have to admit that Iam glad of any advantage I can get whenever she starts chasing me(her favorite nephew) around the table with a butcher knife. Alyssa, our eldest, appeared on the television game show,Scattergories, at the end of February, and will soon be appearingagain on April 19 or 20 because they screwed up the scoring thefirst time. She has completed her schooling to become a realestate appraiser and will soon be taking the licensing test. Ifshe passes the test, she will probably become the youngestcertified real estate appraiser in the state of California. Melissa took some career aptitude tests for high school and,overall, scored higher than the school administrators had everseen before. In fact, they said that she was probably qualifiedto become a research scientist, if she chose. (This is the samegirl whose head whistles when the wind blows.) They said shescored off the top of the scale on one particular aptitude -- theability to talk. That was a great surprise to all of us. Now to raise the hackles of a good number of you. The years ofFascist dictatorship under Reagan and Bush has finally overcomemy political apathy and I have resolved to do something about it.I had hoped that Bill Clinton would make some major changes onsome issues but he appears to be wimping out, so he will probablyhave to be pushed. I am opposed to abortion, for example, but feel that there arebetter ways than criminal laws to prevent or dissuade people fromhaving them. As in many other areas, the use of the police toenforce essentially private behavior does not add any realbenefit to the equation. Clinton appears to have wimped out on the issue of gays in themilitary, too. The fact is that there have been gays in themilitary since the days of Achilles and Patrocles. There were gayguys in my Army Intelligence unit in Korea and they did not seemto be a disruptive influence, except to those people that Ithought were a disruptive influence. They had the same kind ofhysterical talk about disorder in the barracks when they weregoing to racially integrate the armed services. It was balderdashthen and it is balderdash now. As I told you, I have been involved in a campaign todecriminalize drugs. I don't want to get too political here, butwe have people in this family who have suffered greatly, andcontinue to suffer, because of a terribly misguided war againstdrugs. Aside from the political aspects, this is an issue whichhas directly affected this family. Because of some recent eventsin the family, a few more of you have come around to my way ofthinking and specifically asked to hear more of what I had to sayabout the issue. Therefore, I have enclosed some of theliterature I have put together on the issue. I encourage you allto go to the library and read the evidence. No rational personcan support our current drug policy once they have read theevidence. Things seem to be coming to a head on this issue. I have had apretty fair number of speeches and debates, including some on theradio. The most interesting thing was a meeting we held at theHoover Institution at Stanford University on February 26. Themeeting was held at the offices of Dr. Milton Friedman, theNobel-prize winning economist, and included some of the mostprominent medical authorities on drugs in the world. Together, wedrafted a resolution calling for immediate public hearings toform a new drug policy. I have enclosed a copy of the resolutionand a partial list of the people who have signed it. The resolution was published across the nation. It immediatelyreceived the endorsement of Dr. Dean Edell, and the San JoseMercury, and made front-page news in Baltimore and other cities.In addition, the California Medical Association adopted aresolution which went even further and openly called fordecriminalization. We are now trying to sign up as many majorprominent people or organizations as we can and, in anotherninety days or so, we will carry the resolution to Bill Clintonto try to get him to act on it. We have already received atremendous response to our announcement and we are anticipatingmuch more. We believe that, in addition to Baltimore Mayor KurtSchmoke, we will soon have the signatures of several more mayorsof major cities. I have to say that the meeting was intensely interesting.There were nine doctors in attendance, including the Americandoctor who formed Britain's drug treatment plan in 1947, and thedoctor who was appointed by the state legislature to headCalifornia's Research Advisory Panel on Drugs. All of the doctorsagreed that medical patients are suffering unnecessarily becausethe war on drugs has limited doctors' ability to provide painrelief. Dr. Harvey Rose spent three years and more than $100,000fighting charges that he gave too much Darvon to a woman who wasin her 80's and had crippling arthritis. The war against drugshas gone so far overboard that doctors cannot prescribe adequatepain relief, even for people who are desperately ill. I described to them the medical problems of a few members ofthe family and they all agreed on the one thing that they wouldprescribe for severe pain -- heroin. They said it was a highlydesireable analgesic because it was safe, powerful, andshort-acting. They all agreed that, for severe medical pain,heroin is the drug of choice. What was most surprising to me wasthat they consistently used the same word to describe all of theillegal drugs in general, and heroin in particular. The word theyused was "harmless." Doctors are now coming tounderstand that drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and morphinehave very important medical benefits which are not provided byany other type of drug. Marijuana is the treatment of choice forconditions such as glaucoma and nausea from chemotherapy. Heroinand morphine help people heal much faster after severe injuriesor surgery because, by reducing pain, they reduce the stress onthe nervous system. It is with great regret that I must report that Wilma Taylorhas died. We will miss her. Reunion Details Where:                Merced River Resort.

Parallel Road                                                    Delhi,                                             When:                 June 26 and 27, 1993                                                                                                        Pete says that the party will really start Friday                        night, June 25, for all the really hard-core                             family members with a campfire, marshmallow                              roast, and the traditional Lewd, Obnoxious                               Behavior Contest. Pete said that he wanted to                            hold the contest on Friday night because there                           was a chance that Bill Henry might show up on                            Saturday and he wanted other people to have a                            fair chance.  He says that ten families are                              already signed up for Friday night.                                      Saturday will be the big day with hot dogs and                           hamburgers at noon, the Bill Henry Cursing                               Contest at two o'clock, and the main meal about                          four.                                                                    Sunday will be Alka-Seltzer, hotdogs, hamburgers,                        and scraps from the carnage of the previous                              night, starting at about 11 AM. Some of the truly                        hard-core will stay until Monday.                  Contribution:         $8.00 per household.                               Pete says that larger contributions will be                              gratefully accepted and will be used to install                          an underground beer vat at his home.                                     Contributions must be in by June 1 and the money                         will be all spent by June 21.  As usual, let us                          know if money is a problem.                        Bring:                Salads (for the grazing members of the family),    beans (here we go again)                           good desserts (as if anyone in this family would                         notice what they were inhaling)                    charcoal -- at least ten pounds per family.                              (Pete did not explain what he wanted to do with a                        fire that big.)                                    drinks (to keep the taylors out of the local                             bars)                                              bathing suits (don't use those same old excuses                          again)                                                                   There will be plastic silverware and plates                              provided.  If you need stronger stuff, bring your                        own.                                                Important:            Pete says he needs to know who wants camp sites    right away.  He said that there were two trailers  left and they are a fantastic deal.  He says the   camp sites can have more than one tent, with a     limit of 8 people per site, so families can share  a site if they want.  Money for camp sites and     trailers is not refundable after April 20.

Nobody of anyimportance is missing from this picture. The Reunion News is coming out a little early for a couple ofreasons. The first is that I got a call the other day fromLaurence. He left a message on my answering machine telling methat he was going to get "fixed" in January and hewanted to invite a whole bunch of people to watch. If it is goingto be held in Santa Rosa I may have to pass. He did not explainmuch about whether this was some kind of civil or criminalrequirement which had been imposed upon him, or whether hethought it would just be a fun way to spend the afternoon. Come to think of it, the tape was not very clear and he couldhave said either that he was going to get "fixed" orthat he was going to get "hitched." I figured the firstwas much more likely, and of far greater public benefit, sothat's how I will pass it on to the rest of you. The second reason I will explain a little later. As you all know (with the exception of those who have neverattended a single reunion), the last reunion was held on theMerced River where it was hotter than Hell most of the time. Youcould drink all day and never take a leak. When I arrived a rather strange looking person came runningtoward me. "Hi, Cliff!" he said. I always find it unnerving when eye-witnesses can identify me.I figured it was best to humor him. "Hi," I said. "Do you know who I am?" he asked. "Stranger," I told him, "I think you are in thewrong camp. We don't ask questions like that around here." "I'll give you a clue," he said, "I'm aTaylor," as if that would have narrowed down the field. "That may well be, but it's nothing to brag on," Itold him, "and taking your word for it, I would hate toguess." "I'm David Taylor," he said merrily, "and Ibrung my whole family with me," apparently not noticing thelook of shock and dread which crossed my face. Don Morris: Redefining handsome I had no reason to believe that this had any relation to thetruth but I decided to accept his story for two reasons. Thefirst is that it is my standing policy not to question anyone'stales of how they could be related to the family, no matter howremarkable the story might be. The second is that I quicklydecided that if anyone wanted to claim to be David Taylor, Iwould not dispute him for the honor of it. Pete's explanation for why he is unemployed. He told me how much he liked reading the Reunion News andassured me that, while some high-falutin' people may have beenoffended by some things I said, he certainly was not. He went onto assure me that he was just as hard to insult as any of theMorrises, and for pretty much the same reasons. It was acomforting thought. He spent the better part of half an hour introducing me to allthe people he had brought with him with the obvious expectationthat I might remember some of them the next time around. I havemade no such effort to remember anyone in the past and no oneshould expect that I would make such an effort now or in thefuture. It makes no difference in the conversation anyway. Fromthen on, he would pull me aside every couple of hours tointroduce me to some new "relative" of his (he claimedthat the majority of them were his children, though he was hazyon more than a few) who had shown up just in time to eat. Ifigure that the eight dollar contribution for his householdprobably worked out to about ten cents a head. David Leard and his wife, Pat, were there. She still uses hermaiden name, Lindsey, in order not to be too closely associatedwith him. They could be legally attached or just living in sin.She was suspiciously friendly and I wondered why until she pulledme aside and slipped me five dollars so I wouldn't say anythingbad about them. The going rate is ten -- each. Laurence under the influence again. Now I am going to tell you something that you probably wouldnot have believed even if you had been there and seen it withyour own eyes, but they decided that David Leard met the sanitarystandards to host a reunion, and that he and the woman who cleanshis cage would host the next family reunion in some place calledSeattle. I know that some of you will find this hard to believebut it is cold, hard fact. I can assure you that I had no part inthe transaction and I would have denied responsibility in anycase. The vote was made and carried entirely by the Alzheimer'scrowd, led by Margaret, whose mental state had apparently beenadversely affected by the long drive from New Mexico. Pete wentso far as to auction off fifteen pounds of perfectly goodhamburger rather than cart it up to Seattle for next year. Lunch wasn't quite enough for Richard and Pat. Laurence was there and spent some time telling me that heagreed with me wholeheartedly on legalizing drugs. "It istremendously important," he said, "that sick peoplehave a right to pain killers and anesthesia." Hedemonstrated the point by applying a liberal dose of anesthesiato himself. As many of you know, Laurence spent some time in the hospitalearlier this year and he says that, because of his emotionalcondition after Wilma's passing, the hospital staff labeled himas being under great stress and therefore allowed him to doanything he chose. "It was great," he said, "Icould cuss and scream and kick and rant and rave and piss on thefloor and they wouldn't do nothing. It was just like home."Despite his emotional stress he was on his best behavior, so mostof the time he actually left the crowd and went behind a trailerto relieve himself. When he was at least a couple of six packs into theconversation, he got into an argument with Dorothy aboutsomething to do with politics. I don't remember what it wasexactly, and I don't think you could have gotten a clearexplanation from either one of them. "Laurence, you are a stupid, ignorant, bigoted,illiterate, and disgusting idiot!" Dorothy told him. "So what's your point?" he asked. He is among thequicker of the Taylors. Louise Leard (my Aunt Polly) was there again. She said thatnothing much new has happened in her life, except that she has anew pair of stove lids for glasses. They look nice on her. Shesays that I should respect her more now that she is ahundred-and-something (or is it two hundred-and-something?) yearsold. I told her that if she had gotten to be that old she shouldstop expecting miracles. I am quite sure that some day Louisewill be just as old as she always wanted to be. Ruthie and Tom were there but Tom spent most of Saturday inthe trailer. Ruthie explained to me that he was laid up becauseof something that had happened between them the previous night.This was no great surprise to me and I would tell you what itwas, but there are some things that I prefer she didn't sharewith me. Ruthie spent the weekend burglarizing cars. James and Edna were there and Edna was sporting the latest inorthopedic appliances for her broken leg. She is doing betterthan anyone would have a right to expect after such an injury(she really did it good when she did it) although she passed up aperfectly good chance to get several cartons of pain-killers andother mind-altering drugs. She claims she likes it better thatway. Not me. I want morphine for paper cuts. Since the reunion there have been a number of interestingdevelopments on the drug legalization front. Judge James P. Grayand Joseph McNamara presented the resolution to Dr. Lee Brown,the current drug czar at a dinner meeting on August 4. The DrugPolicy Foundation in Washington has picked up the resolution as acause. They have already printed it once in their newsletter andwill soon print it again as a tear-out page that people can sendit to Clinton. Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein wrote a majorarticle about the resolution in the July 8 NY Times, it has beenon Nightline, in Newsweek, in High Times, and has received lotsof other media coverage. Dr. Dean Edell mentions the resolutionabout once a month on his radio show and Hugh Downs has done twoshows in which he has mentioned the resolution and quoteddirectly from the things I have written. (Oddly enough, he chosethe only facts in my little booklet which I cannot directlysupport with actual statistics. For example, he used my linethat, "More Colombians die from American tobacco than thenumber of Americans who die from Colombian cocaine." I don'thave any actual statistics for that one, although there is everyreason to believe it is true.) We have received literallythousands of signed resolutions from all over the world,including Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, England, and otherplaces. Unlike Bill Henry, David Taylor scrounged up the cash to makebail and came to the reunion. In one of the more interesting events, I appeared on the MoGaffney show (an Oprah-type talk show) against William Von Raab.Mr. Von Raab is the former Customs Commissioner under Reagan andBush and the father of the "Zero Tolerance" programwhere they confiscated millions of dollars worth of propertyunder the pretext that a marijuana seed was found. He quit theBush administration because he thought they were not tough enoughon drugs and has been one of the biggest campaigners for toughersentences and bigger prisons. James would love him. I had beenwaiting years to get somebody like him in front of an audiencewhere they could not run and could not hide. To make a long story short, I beat the snot out of him for anhour and he caved in and gave up. I did not even give him a breakduring the commercials. At the end of the hour he signed theresolution calling for an objective commission to rewrite ourdrug policy and admitted to me that he did not know anythingabout drugs and, therefore, was not qualified to speak on drugpolicy. He also told me that our previous Drug Czars, WilliamBennett and Bob Martinez, knew even less about drugs than he did,so there was no way they could have been qualified for theirjobs, either. (His words.) I do not believe that he will ever tryto speak out on this issue again. As a result of the resolution, on September 20, a bill wasintroduced into Congress, H.R. 3100, The National Drug ControlPolicy Act of 1993, by Representative Don Edwards of San Jose.This bill calls for a thirteen-member commission to review andrewrite our national drug policy, based on an objectiveevaluation of the evidence. Five members of the commission wouldbe appointed by the President, and four each by the Senate andthe House of Representatives. Currently elected or appointedgovernment officials would not be allowed as members of thecommission. The bill is being supported by the Drug PolicyFoundation, the National Organization for the Reform of MarijuanaLaws, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and others. I urgeeveryone to write to your elected officials and support H.R.3100. Anyway, I told you there is another reason why the reunionnews is coming out early this year. It is because David Leard hasput together the plans for the next reunion and, assumingeveryone agrees to it, it will be necessary to notify the placewhere it will be held by November, 1993. So you all have torespond fairly quickly to let him know. So here is David Leard's proposal for the next reunion,recited verbatim, with only minimal comments on my part. First, he wants to hold it at a place called the "IcicleRiver" in Washington. Pretty inviting, huh? Bring yourbathing suit and watch your body pucker. I guess he thinks thatis the only way he could top Becky after she invited the Morrisesto Mooney Grove. Here is what David had to say. Some corroboratingincriminating evidence is also enclosed. Because of the distance folks will have to travel, they won'tbe able to bring food as they normally do for the Californiareunions. That limited choices to places which could provide foodat reasonable cost, provide activities, have camping nearby andbe beautiful (not hot and dusty) We have chosen Mountain HomeLodge in Leavenworth, WA as the main location for lodging andmeals. There are many activities available here. Those who are driving or camping can plan on going straight tothe Lodge or rv/camping area described below. If you are flyinginto SEATAC airport, you will have to rent a car to drive toMountain Home Lodge. You will need a map of Washington. Detaileddirections to come later should there be enough interest. Mountain Home, Tel.(509) 548-7077, is a destination vacationlodge just outside Leavenworth, WA, approximately 2-2� hoursdrive from SEATAC and Seattle. We have arranged to have theentire lodge if we can book enough rooms in advance. Tentativelyplanned for weekend of Friday/Saturday, June 24, 25, Sundayoptional. We would have to reserve for Friday and Saturday nightsand anyone wishing more nights could do so. (rate sheet enclosed)The cost for entire lodge is $892 for lodging of 18 people, 24maximum. There are eight (8) rooms, each accommodating one tothree people. Rates range from $88 to $118 per night for twopeople. An addition person in a room is $15 more. A buffet dinneron Friday and Saturday would cost $15 per person, per night,Continental Breakfast is $3.50 ea. and big breakfast is $8.25.(Their continental breakfast is quite good and the regularbreakfast is more than ample). Lunch is $6.00; usually soup,sandwiches, lemonade, cookies. In order to guarantee that we are not sharing the loge, wehave to let them know by November. If we don't fill the lodge, wecould still use it as a base, but other guests would be therealso. That could mean younger children would not be allowed inmain lodge accommodations, but OK for day visits. i.e., childrenand pets normally not accepted at lodge. The accommodations aremuch better than average and the food is always good. The ownersare friendly and willing to work with us on the menu. Usuallydinner is BBQ salmon or steaks, done outside main lodge. Lots ofactivities, including: hiking, horseshoes, volleyball, tennis,swimming in the pool, and a hot tub located just off the largemain deck. Lots of things to do. There is the "best RV Park I have ever seen" just afew miles from the lodge. The Icicle River RV Park, 7305 IcicleRoad, Leavenworth, WA 98826. Tel. #(509) 548-5420 They are closedduring winter, open in April, a Good Sam Park, with 10% discountfor Good Sam members, AAA, Golden Age (62), and when taking 5unites or more, other discounts apply, please inquire ifinterested. Rates are: $22.50 per day for full hook up; $15.50per day for tent space. These rates apply to two people per unit.It's very clean, with facilities for laundry, showers, etc. Theyare the kind of place that fills early in the year, so makereservations as soon as possible. They do take reservationsduring the winter when closed. Keep trying if no answer. There is fishing right out your back door if you stay atIcicle River. It's a bit of a drive to Mountain Home from thepark, in the range of 20 -25 minutes because of the road toMountain Home. (A bit primitive, slow going, but it is kept ingood shape during most of summer. Can be muddy in spring if snowmelt is slow.) The Lodge will provide transportation to the Lodge from thebottom of Mountain Home Road, just outside Leavenworth, but theycharge a fee. In addition, if you are not staying at the Lodge,they charge a day use fee of $10 per person allowing access toall facilities at the lodge, this fee is reduced if you include ameal while there. We realize this is more expensive than reunions in the past.Although Margaret volunteered us, we accepted the challenge anddid our best. It was a difficult search because of the summerdemand for recreation and camping in this area. The close-inspots are taken years/months in advance or lease their bestfacilities by the month only and they are all taken. If thisdoesn't work for too many people, there is always the option ofreturning to somewhere in CA. We will be happy to follow throughwith the plan if the OK is given by enough folks to fill thelodge and others can stay in the camping area. Well, there you have it. This plan will probably require afair amount of decision-making so discuss it all among yourselvesand call David Leard Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | General and EntertainmentWT01-B39-53IA087-000632-B039-140http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/General/family10.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122071527 text/html 18334HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:15:15 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 06:30:50 GMTContent-length: 18116 Richardson-Taylor Reunion News February 13, 1994 Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | General and Entertainment Richardson-Taylor Reunion News February 13, 1994 David "Bigfoot" Leard wrote to me with a reunionupdate, so I thought I would pass it along. As you all may know, there was something of an earthquake downhere. Some people said it was God's reaction to the thought thatLaurence might reproduce but I take a more charitable view. Thatbig freeway overpass that collapsed that you saw on TV is aboutfive miles from where I live, and I go over that exact stretch ofroad every morning on the way to work. It woke us up (to be sure,it woke us up) at 4:30. The whole house was flying around and allthe lights were out, except for the flashes of the explosions inthe distance. We crawled over the junk to get out of our bedroomand located the kids and they were OK, except that Serena hadgotten buried by falling furniture but was none the worst forwear. Bonnie evidently got hit in the shoulder by a falling lamp.That is all we can figure anyway, because she did not notice itat the time and did not even report any pain until several hourslater. When these things happens, all the best laid plans go rightout the window. We had bought rechargeable flashlights for yearsand had them all over the house most of the time, in addition tonumerous regular flashlights of various types and sizes. In thefirst two hours we could not find any of them. After that, thesun was up. Luckily, however, we did happen to have adequatesupplies of food and drinkable water to last through the next fewdays. There were no utilities at all for about 24 hours, then wegot electricity, and two days later we got running water, but hadto boil it or put bleach in it to drink it for about three weeks.There were people passing out free bottled water all over theplace and the Miller beer company even bottled up a bunch ofwater in beer bottles and passed it out, two cases for eachperson, for free. There was a lot of damage to nearly everything. The roads werebuckled all over the place, and some had inch-wide cracks which Itracked for more than a mile. Water was seeping up through thepavement from the broken water mains and most of the concreteblock walls I saw had fallen down. There were several buildingsaround which suffered severe structural damage and there werethree people that Bonnie works with whose homes were destroyed. Basically, the whole house was trashed. All of the bookcases,entertainment centers, and cabinets in the house fell over. Thechina cabinet fell on the dining room table and pulverized ourcrystal, china, and miscellaneous other collectibles. Everytelevision in the house was face down on the floor and we lost afew VCRs and other appliances. We found out later that the fault ran from Northridge, rightup through the center of Santa Clarita and broke the surface justa little north of us. Considering the size of the quake and itsproximity to us we were pretty lucky. The freeway which collapsed was, of course, the only majorroad into Los Angeles, so that means, naturally, that there arehuge traffic jams at that point nearly all day long because theyhave to steer all that freeway traffic through a bunch of oldsurface roads. (Not real good planning, guys!) As a result,thousands of people who never would have dreamed of taking thebrand-new Metrolink commuter train are now taking it every day.As fate would have, among this crowd was my eldest daughterAlyssa. As a result of the earthquake, Alyssa was on nationaltelevision twice in the same day. The second time was when shegot back to the train depot in Santa Clarita on her way home.When she got off the train, she saw a Channel 7 KABC televisioncrew and recognized the cameraman as a guy who lives just downthe street from us. They interviewed her about the quake (One ofthose typical news interviews -- "You have just seen halfyour town destroyed in a few seconds -- how do you feel?")and what she was doing to solve her commuting problems. Theinterview wound up on the national news feed and was shown allover the US. But that wasn't the good one. It seems that, earlier in the day, Alyssa had been waiting onthe train platform in Burbank and there was a KNBC Channel 4 crewdown there doing a live remote. KNBC was showing the world howall these people were now crowding into the trains and all therest. While this was going on, the train people started makingannouncements to the crowd to tell them to move in back of theyellow line, because the training was coming. Alyssa said thetelevision lights were in everybody's eyes so they could notwhere the yellow line was. So she turned to the cameraman andasked him, "Would you please turn down the lights or pointthem in another direction? Because we can't see where the yellowline is." The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa tapped him on theshoulder (she said he was about 6-2, she says she is a full fivefeet) and said, "Could you please turn down the lights orpoint them in another direction? We can't see the yellowline." The cameraman did not respond, so Alyssa stuck her hand infront of the lens and said, a little louder this time,"Would you please turn down the lights or point them inanother direction?" At that point, the cameraman grabbed her hand and twisted itaway rather roughly which hurt her, so Alyssa gave him a fewchoice words but the crowd held her back from an all-out assault.A few minutes later, the camera crew and the dippy newscasterwere looking around for someone to interview and they walked overto Alyssa to interview her. Alyssa was pissed. "You want to interview something?," she said,"Why don't you interview this finger you almost broke?"And she presented it to them -- on live television. That's mylittle lady. The earthquake was quite a shaker but equally unnerving is thefact that ever since the big one we have had other earthquakes, 3to 5 pointers, several times a day. For the first few days wewere having them every five or ten minutes around the clock. Itmade it difficult to sleep because every time you would doze offanother one would come rolling around. It is slowing down latelythough. I can only recall a couple of earthquakes today. The roads were out, the utilities were out, and the phoneswere out so there was nothing left to do but party. A bunch ofSerena's friends came over because our house was in better shapethan their condo and they did not want to be in their condo whilethe rock and roll continued. So we all broke out just abouteverything drinkable, and barbecued all the fish and meat that wethought would spoil and partied hardy for a couple of days. Itwas a major inconvenience to be sure, but we'll make it. Anyway, David sent me a letter, reproduced below, which laysout most of his latest information on the reunion. David alwaystypes his letters on a computer, which makes them very neat. Heis different from Becky who is liable to write her letters acrossthe face of Ed McMahon to save paper, or Pete who has Sandy writehis letters so there will be no spelling errors, or Joanne, who .. . . well, we won't talk about Joanne's letters. Here's the latest on reunion bookings at Mountain Home Lodge.The Lodge's reservations have gone very well. The rooms at theLodge were all booked by January 3. I called them and arranged toalso use one of the owner's cabins. (They call it a cabin, it'sreally much more than a cabin.) There were four additional roomsavailable, now only three. Bud Richardson reserved one of therooms on January 4. If all the rooms at the cabin are taken, I have the names of aB&B and two motels in Leavenworth, WA "Run of the River", a Bed and Breakfast, just southof town, views of the river. 1-800-288-6491. Ritterhauf, Motel, 55 Units, lower cost, with kitchens in some1-800-255-5845 Leavenworth Village Inn, newer place, a little more expensivethat Ritterhauf. 1-800-343-8198. There are other motels in and around Leavenworth, I don't havespecific information on them. I have no new information on thecampground reservations of how they are going. But, thiscampground is really not any more expensive than others used inthe past that were in resort areas. The Icicle River RV Park,7305 Icicle Road, Leavenworth, WA 98826 (509) 548-5420 Now that the Lodge is filled (and possibly the extra cabin), Iam negotiating with the owners next week (January 15) toeliminate the day-use fees for family members who will be eatinglunch and/or dinner at the lodge. Drive your own vehicles to theLodge and save another few dollars. This will keep the costsdown. In addition, those folks who are flying up to the area, maybe able to share rental car expense by meeting at SEATAC Airportand driving together to the lodge. There is also the option ofsharing room(s) at the Lodge or the cabin. Another options ishelping out those who are have special financial difficultieswith money from the Reunion Kitty and any contributions fromthose willing to part with a dollar or two. Kids will be welcomenow that we have booked the entire lodge. Kids will be welcome as long as they are kept on chains. This reunion is a little different from past versions andproving to be more popular than first thought. Give it a try. Butmove quickly, the accommodations are going fast. After the letter came I got a call from Michael who said thatDavid had more news so I called him. When I first called he saidhe couldn't talk right then because Pat had broken her foot whiletrying escape back to her people and he had to go drag her backinto the house before the neighbors saw her, or something likethat. When he called back he told me this tremendously long taleabout how he was out of work because there had been a lot ofsecurities fraud, and embezzlement, and a couple of liquor storestick-ups by employees of the firm and the whole thing had beenshut down by various vice squads. He assured me that he did notsteal near as much as the other employees and, therefore,expected to be able to plea bargain his way out of it. As usual,I wish him the best and I will attempt to protect his rapidlydeteriorating reputation at every opportunity. Then he told me that Pete had sent him an ungodly sum of moneywhich was left over from the hamburger sales at the previousreunion. He asked me to tell everyone that being poor anddestitute and generally socially undesirable should be noimpediment to attending the reunion. He said that money isavailable to help out those who need it. Those who need helpshould just ask, he said. I immediately made a suggestion as tohow this money could be most constructively used but David,thick-headed as he is, did not go for it. He said also that, because the other paying customers hadcanceled all their reservations when they heard that we werecoming, the day use fee has been eliminated, and children will begranted free run of the facilities, including the deer-huntingrange next door. For those who have too much common decency too stay with therest of the group, David said that he had discovered a KOAcampground half a mile or so away from the road to the lodge, anda pretty dumpy RV place at the bottom of the hill. He alsomentioned the Linderhof motel and the Icicle Inn, a particularlyinviting place, just from its name alone. He says that thecampgrounds are going pretty fast up there so you better makeyour reservations fast or you will be sleeping by the side of theroad as usual. And now a spot of news for the drug legalizers among you. Youwill be pleased to know that our Resolution has recently receivedendorsements from, among others, the LA Times, the Mayor ofMinneapolis, the President of the Detroit City Council, a Senatorfrom Colombia, the entire staff of the San Bernardino CountyProbation Department, the entire staff of the Harbor/UCLA MedicalCenter, the Berkeley City Council, and every District Attorney inRotterdam, The Netherlands, just to name a few. Judge Gray and I have made numerous appearances on radio andtelevision down here and we almost never get even a singleopposing phone call. In fact, one of Judge Gray's appearances onradio brought so many favorable letters that the station decidedto run it again. Two weeks ago we appeared together on a TV talkshow in Palmdale. Prior to the show the producers had arrangedfor representatives of the Drug Enforcement Administration, theDistrict Attorney, and the Sheriff to come on the show and takethe other side. The morning of the show the producers got phonecalls from each of the groups and, when they heard who was goingto be on against them, they all suddenly remembered that they hadconflicting appointments, or could not find a baby-sitter, orsomething. The real problem, of course, is that they have beengetting the snot beat out of them every time they showed up. As aresult, the judge and I had about two hours of free TV air timeto say what we wanted. They did manage to find a drug abusecounselor to oppose us, but he wound up agreeing with us andvolunteered to help with the Resolution. The major national drug policy organizations such as the DrugPolicy Foundation, NORML, and various other groups are beginningto see the wisdom in our strategy and have adopted the proposalsI have outlined as their primary strategy. If you were readingthe news lately, you know that Surgeon-General Joycelyn Eldersstated that the issue of drug legalization should be studied.This remark was a direct result of our Resolution. You may notknow that, in a later interview she referred to some things I hadwritten (which someone else had sent her) and said that she hadread some of the research on the subject and was more convincedthan ever that legalization should be seriously considered. Youmay expect to hear more from her on this subject in the nearfuture. H.R. 3100, the bill which calls for a 13-member Federalcommission to study drug policy is alive and well and gainingsponsors in Congress. Basically, the bill calls for a panel ofthirteen people to be appointed, five by the President and foureach by the Senate and House. The panel is supposed to hear allof the relevant evidence on drug policy and make a report on thefindings within eighteen months. This is an intelligent,reasonable approach to solving the drug problem and I hopeeveryone will write to their Senators and Representatives and askthem to support this bill. We are also producing a television show for local access cableTV. I don't know if you know it or not, but if you have atelevision show that you think ought to be aired, the cable TVcompanies are required to show it at no cost to you. (Providedthe content is not obscene, etc.) As a result, we have people allover the country showing these shows on television. One of the most interesting shows is on the history ofmarijuana. It includes a United States Department of Agriculturefilm called "Hemp for Victory." The film was made in1942 and encourages farmers to grow hemp (marijuana) because theUS Navy literally could not sail without it. It was so vital tothe US military during World War II that farmers who grew hempwere exempted from military duty. Prior to 1937, marijuana wasgrown throughout the United States in industrial quantities. Itwas the primary source of durable cloth such as the sixty tons ofsail and ropes carried by the average large sailing ship, or thecanvas which covered the Conestoga wagons of the pioneers. It wasalso the primary source of oil-based fuels, paints, and otherproducts. "Hemp for Victory" really makes people wonderhow it came to be illegal in the first place. That's it for now. Call David if you have any questions.

I did not attend the last reunion inWashington myself and I understand that the turnout was lowerthan any time in recent memory, primarily because of a persistentrumor that Bill Henry would show up. He did not show up, to thegreat relief of everyone in the family and Washington's farmanimals, too. Laurence is the organizer of the 1995 reunion andsays that he has taken steps to have guards posted to preventBill Henry from showing up. Therefore, he says, we will not haveto worry about Bill Henry's ugly mug spoiling any of the grouppictures. He probably would have spent most of his time doing theMorris Moon anyway. Laurence, as you all know, is now a married man which justgoes to prove that the laws against such things are nottremendously effective. He wrote me to tell me that he had beenlaid up recently due to a heart bypass operation (apparently thedoctors found that his heart served no useful purpose) and anoperation for a blood clot in his leg. Both of these problems, hesaid, were the result of what could be politely described as anoverly strenuous honeymoon, which he related at great length, andwas obviously confused with some things which actually happenedin high school. Men really don't need drugs because they havewomen. Barbara, his bride tells a somewhat different story, withconsiderably fewer disgusting details. In any event, he says thathe is recovering nicely now and will be just as gross anddisgusting as we all have gotten used to, and even come tocherish. Like Don Morris, he is something of a gem in his ownright. I have not been in touch with many of you so I cannot relate alot of news about other people. I can assure you it is a greatrelief. However, on my own front, some significant things havehappened. As far as my campaign to get our drug laws changed,there has been more success than we had dared hope. Far too muchhas happened, even in the last six months, for me to relate itall so I will stick to some of the highlights. Both the California Medical Association and the Department of Health and Human Services have issued major reports stating that the undertreatment of pain in the United States is a major national tragedy. They said that narcotics such as morphine are the cheapest, safest, and most effective treatments for pain and the reason doctors do not prescribe them is because they are afraid of prosecution if they do. Both organizations recommended that narcotics be used as soon as the patients request them and that patients be allowed to control their own dose. They both said that the risk of addiction is so small that it is of no practical concern. As the Department of Health and Human Services said, "Addiction (as the result of medical use of narcotics) almost never happens." The head of Interpol, the British Association of Chiefs of Police, the Attorney-General of Colombia, and many other major law enforcement officials have called for either decriminalization or legalization of drugs and it is apparent that several law enforcement officials and organizations are now mounting a major push to get drugs decriminalized in all of Europe. There have been two TV specials and several radio shows in the last six months which were based at least in part on the things I have written, one by MTV which aired in September, and another by the BBC titled "The Drug War, R.I.P.", which aired on the Arts and Entertainment Channel in September. There will also be a one-hour television special coming up on ABC which, I understand, will be based largely on the points I have made and taught others to make. Our campaign for a Federal commission to review drug policy has been successful. Language establishing such a commission was included in the recent Crime Bill, which everyone made such a fuss about. In all the hullabaloo about banning guns, Representative Don Edwards of San Jose was able to slip the language in during the Conference Committee and it went unnoticed in the final vote, even though a number of members of Congress had said they were deadset against it. The commission is due to start its work in 1996 and is supposed to issue its report by 1998. A couple of years ago I published a pamphlet I called Persuasive Strategies. The purpose of it was to teach anyone how to beat the snot out of drug warriors in a debate and do it so completely that there would be no question in anyone's mind who won the debate. These strategies were probably the primary reason for the success of all the things we have done. A lot of other people saw them, liked them, and started using them, including a lot of fairly famous people. As a result, The Drug Enforcement Administration and their allies have found that they have been getting their butts kicked every time they showed up to discuss the subject in public -- all across the nation. They called an emergency meeting in August, calling in drug warriors from all across the country to discuss what to do about it. It must have been an interesting meeting. I can just imagine the conversation, "I got my butt kicked in LA." "I got my butt kicked in Buffalo", "I got my ass kicked in Albuquerque" and so forth. Unfortunately, they did not invite me or I could have given them a few tips myself. In order to try to combat what I have been doing they have issued a 40 page booklet called "How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate" which attempts to train their people how to debate people who are using my tactics. They even lifted paragraphs from my pamphlet and slightly altered the wording. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I thought one paragraph from their booklet was particularly flattering: Legalization proponents are formidable opponents. The groupacknowledged that proponents of legalization are generallywell-prepared and credible people whose arguments, thoughcompelling, are faulty. Proponents effectively use lawyers andpublic relations firms to espouse liberalization of drugpolicies. Shortly after their booklet was published I got a call from apublisher asking me to do a book in reply to theirs, which youshould see in the bookstores next year. But enough about politics. Now we will go on to the sordiddetails of the next reunion. Reunion Details When           July 8 and 9, 1995                                          Saturday and Sunday                                                                                                     Where          Picnic Area C                                                              Finley Park, at the corner of Stony Point Road and College                 Avenue                                                                     Santa Rosa, California                                      Directions:    From Highway 101, take Highway 12 west one mile and turn                   north on Stony Point Road.  The park is at the fourth stop                 light.                                                                     There is a map attached to this newsletter, but it was                     based on something drawn by Laurence so I cannot verify                    its accuracy.                                                               Any child who is not living within thirty feet of you is                   considered a separate household.  That's you, Alyssa.       Bring          Locals should bring one main dish such as beans, salad,                    etc.  Laurence always recommends that somebody bring beans                 and says that, despite his recent medical problems he will                 be "in tune".                                                              Out-of-towners should bring appetizers and desserts.

Other:         The park has swimming pools, which Laurence says cost a                    bundle.  It also has volley ball, horse shoes (for those                   of you who don't have your own shoes), tennis, covered                     pavilions with barbecues, handicapped access and restrooms                 (I'll bet you are all glad of that!)  It also has a very                   nice playground.

A few years ago my niece turned her father in for pot afterbeing interrogated by DARE officers in the principle' s office ather school in a very small town. My niece claims they told herthat her parents had a crack problem. She claims all she said was that she knew herparents smoked pot in college and once she thought she smelled itat home. Being a small town ... they ran out and got a searchwarrant and searched their home and their two adjoining homebusinesses a beauty salon and a green house/nursery. Afterripping apart their home and businesses they found nothing! But the trauma of being told their daughter turned them infor crack and having their home torn apart with about 6 officersin front of their neighbors has about destroyed that family andtheir businesses.

Calhoun. Ph.D. Historian Federal Law Enforcement Training Center This is Appendix G from the David Koresh Investigation. It isincluded because it contains interesting information on thebackground of Federal law enforcement. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is arelatively young law enforcement organization, having beencreated formally in 1972. Yet, measured by the federal lawsrelated to the regulation and taxing of alcohol, tobacco, andfirearms-the laws ATF now enforces-the history of the bureau'sduties and responsibilities stretches across the full twocenturies of American history. As early as 1791, revenue actstaxed both alcohol and tobacco and created the offices of taxinspector, collector, and supervisor. During the next century,the offices changed names as frequently as the tax rates changed,but the federal interest in raising revenues from alcohol andtobacco remained strong. Indeed, the formal organization of anindependent bureau within the Department of Treasury specializingin alcohol, tobacco, and firearms law enforcement belatedlyrecognized the distinct need for such an agency. After the Civil War, revenue agents battled moonshinersthroughout the South in some of the bloodiest opposition ever tofederal law enforcement. Revenue agents and deputy U.S. marshalsby the score were killed as they roamed the hills and hollowssearching out illicit stills. Prohibition changed thegovernment's focus from taxing whiskey to banning it, yet therevenue agent's job remained as dangerous. After experimenting insocial adjustment a dozen years, Prohibition was rescinded.Spawned by the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, the Alcohol Tax Unitwas established as a tax-collecting branch within the InternalRevenue Service (IRS). Continued concern over the violent,organized mobs that plagued the major cities compelled thefederal government to try to curb the gangsters' ability to armthemselves. Rather than ban outright the purchase of machine gunsand sawed-off shotguns-the weapons of choice for themobsters-Congress in 1934 simply imposed a tax those weapons.Paying the tax required registering the weapon. The registrationrequirement was intended to discourage ownership of such weaponswithout outlawing them. No self-respecting gangster would want toregister, much less pay the tax, on his Tommygun. Their evasionof the tax gave the government another legal tool to use inarresting the gangsters and breaking up the mobs. Because it was a tax rather than a prohibition, it fell toTreasury to enforce the law as part of Treasury's role incollecting all funds due the government. Within Treasury, theAlcohol Tax Unit seemed the logical branch to enforce the newlaw. Registering and taxing stills required many of the sameprocedures and investigatory talents that would be needed toregister and tax weapons. In the end, the new assignment provedcomparatively easy. The unit was not overwhelmed withregistrations nor by the 1940s were the investigations intoevasions of the tax very time-consuming. As the gangstersdeclined in number and power, so did their use of machine gunsand sawed-off shotguns. Enforcing the alcohol taxes againoccupied most of the unit's attention. In 1951, the Alcohol Tax Unit began enforcing federal taxes ontobacco, thus prompting a name change in 1952 to the Alcohol andTobacco Tax Division. Once again, the logic seemed to be thatcollecting the tax on tobacco closely resembled the worknecessary to collect the tax on alcohol, machine guns, andsawed-off shotguns. The 1968 passage of the Omnibus Crime Controland Safe Streets Act and the Gun Control Act expanded the IRSunit's jurisdiction to the criminal use of explosives and bombs.The new laws also defined specific federal offenses involvingfirearms, including transportation across state lines and use inorganized crimes. In recognition of this new enforcementresponsibility, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division changed itsname to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division (ATFD). Twoyears later, Congress passed the Explosives Control Act definingcertain bombings and acts of arson as federal crimes. It assignedjurisdiction for enforcing this new law to ATFD. With theseexpanded responsibilities. the Treasury Department on July 1,1972 created the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms underthe general oversight of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasuryfor Enforcement, Tariffs and Trade, and Operations. For the pasttwenty-one years, ATF has enforced the collection of federaltaxes on alcohol and tobacco and the federal controls andregulations on firearms, with particular attention to their useby criminals. Although on its face the bureau seems a discordant collectionof separate duties, the techniques for enforcing the taxes andferreting out the illicit products, whether cases of whiskey,cartons of cigarettes, crates of automatic weapons, or containersof bombs, are strikingly similar. Subsequent laws have expanded ATF's jurisdiction. The 1976Arms Export Control Act focused the Bureau's attention oninternational gun smuggling. The 1982 Anti-Arson Act gave ATFauthority to investigate the destruction of property by fire aswell as by explosives. Increased taxes on cigarettes and alcohol,and enhanced regulatory measures such as the 1978 ContrabandCigarette Act, have also enhanced the bureau's responsibility toensure the government receives its lawful taxes. The bureau has been an effective force in law enforcement.Supplies of illicit alcohol and smuggled tobacco have steadilydecreased, and tax revenues have risen. During 1991, for example,ATF collected $7.7 billion in alcohol taxes and $4.8 billion intobacco taxes. ATF agents have also focused on tracking downarmed career criminals and criminal gang members. Investigationsin Florida resulted in the arrest of 45 Warlock motorcycle gangmembers in 1991. Members of the Gullymen Posse, a gang ofJamaican drug dealers known for its propensity to commit murder,were arrested in New York by ATF agents in January 1991.Similarly, an ATF investigation into the activities of the Bornto Kill gang culminated in the arrest of a dozen gang members inAugust 1991. Sixteen members of the San Diego chapter of theHells Angels were convicted in 1992. As a result of these andsimilar investigations, ATF has become the nation's principalrepository for gang-related information and intelligence. The bureau has also earned an excellent reputation for workingwell with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. ATFagents also specialize in identifying anonymous bombers by their"signature" habits in making bombs. For example, in1990, the assassin of Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals JudgeRobert Vance was ultimately identified by ATF agents whorecognized the way the bomb was constructed. Similarly, in themidst of the tragedy in Waco, Texas, ATF agents investigating theWorld Trade Center bombing helped to identify the van that wasused to hold the bomb. This early identification led FBI agentsto the rental car company and thereafter to arrests of theterrorists before they could escape the country. The bureau has developed considerable expertise in arsoninvestigations. At the request of the National Fire ProtectionAgency, ATF began developing nationwide standards for fireinvestigators. The State Department's Diplomatic Security Serviceinvited ATF to develop a protocol establishing an InternationalResponse Team of investigators trained to search blast scenesinvolving U.S. property abroad. Despite a rather eclectic arrayof duties, ATF has succeeded in developing considerable expertisein each area of its enforcement responsibilities. The raid by ATF agents on the Branch Davidian compoundresulted from its enforcement of contemporary federal firearmslaws. In a larger sense, however, the raid fit within anhistoric, well-established and well-defended government interestin prohibiting and breaking up all organized groups that soughtto arm or fortify themselves. The 1934 law taxing weapons wasonly the first time the federal government addressed privateownership of weapons; it was not the first federal effort tocontrol firearms. From its earliest formation, the federalgovernment has actively suppressed any effort by disgruntled orrebellious citizens to coalesce into an armed group, howeversmall the group, petty its complaint, or grandiose its ambition.The collection of large arsenals by organized groups lent itself,ultimately, to the violent use of those weapons against thegovernment itself or portions of its citizenry. Indeed, federalagents who tried to disband the groups frequently became thetargets. The discomfort over armed organizations predated theConstitution. The outbreak of what became known as Shays' Rebellion in 1786gave added urgency to the establishment of a strong nationalgovernment. During the rebellion, hundreds of angry Massachusettsfarmers, most veterans of the Revolution and facing foreclosureson their farms, banded together to keep the courts from issuingany executions. Calling themselves Regulators, the farmersquickly organized into a small army. Significantly, their firstforay was to capture the arsenal at Springfield. Although theRegulators failed, the specter survived. Five months, delegatesfrom each of the thirteen states met in Philadelphia to design anew experiment in government. The lesson of Shays' Rebellion was not forgotten, even afterthe new government was formed. In 1792, Congress passed a lawempowering the president to call out the state militias tosuppress insurrections if either an associate justice of theSupreme Court or a local district court judge certified thatopposition to the laws was beyond the powers of the civilauthority to suppress. Ironically, the first occasion to resortto that law grew out of the violent, organized, and armedresistance to the federal government's whiskey tax. Thus, two ofthe duties that ATF would later inherent-enforcing alcohol taxesand controlling firearms-combusted in 1794 into the WhiskeyRebellion, the first violent opposition to the new federalgovernment.[1] Across the next century, succeeding presidents had sporadic,though no less fearsome, occasion to dispatch the Army and thestate militias to suppress various outbreaks of armed oppositionto federal laws, taxes. and interests. In 1799, Fries Rebellionagainst a federal tax on houses forced President John Adams tomuster the militia. Fugitive slave rescues during the 1850sprompted the government to call out the military. Organizedresistance in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, andWisconsin raised a troublesome specter. "The mainopposition," President Millard Fillmore warned Congress inDecember 1851, "is aimed against the Constitutionitself." At the end of the decade, John Brown's ill-fatedraid on Harper's Ferry,. Virginia, sparked the government todecisive action. Brown chose Harper's Ferry because of thefederal arsenal there. His intent was to distribute the weaponsamong Southern slaves and lead them in revolt for their freedom.Federal troops, however, thwarted the plan.[2] After the Civil War, the federal government battledunrepentant Southerners to protect the rights of the freedmen.Nonetheless. federal officials acted only after the innumerableKlan-style attacks were finally perceived as organized."Outrages of various descriptions." Attorney GeneralGeorge Williams advised southern U.S. Attorneys and Marshals in1874. "and in some cases atrocious murders have beencommitted in your district by bodies of armed men. sometimes indisguise and with the view it is believed of overawing andintimidating peaceable and law abiding citizens and deprivingthem of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution andlaws of the United States." The attorney general ordered hisattorneys and marshals "to detect, expose. arrest, andpunish the perpetrators of these crimes."[3] Throughout the western territories and along the Mexicanborder, the federal government found occasional need to suppressarmed bands of outlaws, ganged together to steal cattle or robthe mails. General William Tecumseh Sherman. sent to the Arizonaborder in April 1882 to investigate the outlaw troubles there,advised President Chester A. Arthur that "the Civil Officershave not sufficient forces to make arrests, to hold prisoners fortrial or punish when convicted." The President promptlyproclaimed on May 31 that the areas plagued by the outlaws werein a state of rebellion.[4] The federal government looked no more kindly on the laborstrikes that broke out in the closing years of the nineteenthcentury and the opening years of the twentieth. What seemed sodangerous about events such as the 1894 Pullman strike was notjust the disruption of he mails, which was the legal basis onwhich the government relied to break the strike, but the factthat the mails were being violently disrupted by organizedgroups. "We have been brought to the ragged edge ofanarchy," Attorney General Richard Olney franticallyexplained when he ordered that the trains be kept running.Eventually, Eugene Debs and his colleagues in the AmericanRailway Union, which took the lead in the strike, were indictedand convicted. Once again, it was the volatile mixture ofviolence and organization-combinations determined difficult tosuppress-that evoked the full power of the federal government.[5] The passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, the firstfederal effort to control private ownership of firearms, grew outof this historic fear of armed organizations. The variouscollections of gangsters that proliferated during Prohibitionwere the true targets of the law, which required a tax andregistration on the sale of their weapons of choice-machine gunsand sawed-off shotguns. Subsequent federal firearms laws havebeen of a piece. Oher than the 1968 ban on mail-order sales,which was in direct, though delayed, response to theassassination of President Kennedy, federal gun laws havetypically been concerned with the weapons of considerabledestructive power generally preferred by organized groups-bombs,machine guns, and automatic weapons. In recent times, the federal government has shown itself evenless patient with armed groups than it had historically. Radicalextremists of both the Right and the Left have been pursuedaggressively once they began breaking the law. For instance,after the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) launched itsself-styled "people's war" by kidnapping newspaperheiress Patty Hearst and committing a number of daring bankrobberies, the federal government dedicated its full resources totracking the group down. Within approximately three months, FBIagents and Los Angeles police closed in on the group at a housejust outside what was then known as Watts. During an intense gunbattle and fire, every member of the SLA in the house waskilled.[6] Gordon Kahl, who stood at the opposite end of the politicalspectrum from the SLA, met a similar end. Kahl belonged to thePosse Comitatus which refused to recognize the authority of anygovernment above the county level. Accordingly, Kahl consistentlyrefused to pay his federal taxes, even after he served time inprison for not doing so. When U.S. Marshals attempted to arresthim for violating the terms of his probation, Kahl killed two ofthem. For the next five months, Kahl hid among his friends andsympathizers until FBI agents located him in a farmhouse justoutside Smithville, Arkansas. After refusing to surrender, Kahlwas killed, and the farmhouse was burned down.[7] Robert Matthews, the head of a group of right-wing fanaticsknown as the Order, embraced many of Kahl's beliefs. Unlike Kahl,whose resistance was essentially passive until the marshals triedto arrest him, Matthews and the Order launched an aggressiveprivate war against the country. Like the SLA, the Ordercommitted a series of bank and armored car robberies, netting$3.6 million in one heist alone. The Order also assassinated AlanBerg, a radio talk show host in Denver, Colorado. The FBI began an equally aggressive pursuit. After a brief,violent skirmish in Idaho and another in Portland, Oregon, FBIagents finally closed in on Matthews hiding out among threeadjoining houses on Whidbey Island, some fifty miles north ofSeattle. After ngotiating his surrender for two days, Matthewsbegan firing on an FBI Hostage Response Team that attempted toenter the house. Protected by a full suit( of body armor,Matthews ran from the first floor to the second floor firingautomatic weapons. The FBI dropped a magnesium flare from ahelicopter. The flare landed on the roof of the house and burnedthrough it to the room where Matthews had stored his ammunitionand explosives. These ignited, setting off a roaring, explodingfire that consumed Matthews.[8] A year later, in the spring of 1985. ATF collectedconsiderable evidence that an 80-member group styling itself theCovenant of the Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) hadstockpiled a large arsenal at its fortified compound in Arkansas.The group had collected over 150 firearms, (including 35 machineguns), two anti-personnel mines, three anti-aircraft rockets, 50pounds of military plastic explosives, 300 blasting caps, 2,000feet of detonating cord, and around 100 explosive devices. CSAhad also stockpiled food, water, and supplies. TF led the assaulton the CSA compound on April 20, 1985. CSA members retreatedfarther into the compound, barricading themselves behind theirdefenses. The agents set up a siege perimeter and settled in towait. The group used the wait to destroy many of the weapons (andhence evidence) illegally obtained. Negotiators from the FBIarrived and began the tedious, frustrating process of talking thegroup out. Three days later, on April 22, 1985, James D. Ellisonand the 75 members of the CSA surrendered.[9] As both history and recent events clearly show, the UnitedStates has never tolerated armed groups residing within itsborders. The intent of the particular organization, whetherideological or criminal, mattered little. If the group wasbuilding an illegal arsenal, the group was subject to a federalenforcement action. To this day, ATF's enforcement focus retainsthe flavor of that historic concern with armed organizations. Theagency has developed considerable expertise and success ininvestigating the activities of motorcycle, street, and druggangs, all of which share in common a proclivity to amass largearsenals of powerful weapons. The raid on the Branch Davidiancompound occurred in the context of that historical background.

TheD.A.R.E. program, designed to prevent students' use of tobacco,alcohol, and other drugs, uses trained, uniformed police officersin the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum.Developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and the LosAngeles Unified School District (LAUSD) as a collaborativeventure, the primary or core D.A.R.E. curriculum is directedtoward pupils in the final grade of elementary school (usuallygrade 5 or 6). Additional curricula for students in kindergartenthrough fourth grade, junior high school, senior high school, andfor parents have been developed and implemented. Purpose of the Study D.A.R.E.'s popularity, as demonstrated by the extraordinarygrowth in its rate of dissemination and by abundant anecdotalreports of its success, is self-evident. In part because of itspreeminent position, policymakers, researchers, educators, andparents are asking a number of fundamental questions about theprogram: o How effective is D.A.R.E. in preventing drug use? o What are D.A.R.E.'s effects compared with those of otherschool-based drug prevention programs? o What are some of the basic features common to most D.A.R.E.programs? o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program? o How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide? o How do other alcohol and drug prevention programs comparewith D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? To address these and other questions, the National Instituteof Justice (NIJ) awarded the research team of the ResearchTriangle Institute (RTI) and the University of Kentucky's Centerfor Prevention Research (CPR) a grant to conduct an extensivereview of the D.A.R.E. program and to assess its place within thecontext of the broad spectrum of school-based drug preventionefforts. Study Objectives The research team proposed and carried out two distinct typesof assessments, the first pertaining to implementation and thesecond to outcomes or effectiveness. The primary objectives ofthe implementation assessment were to o assess the organizational structure and operation ofrepresentative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; o review and assess factors that contribute to the effectiveimplementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; and o assess how D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug preventionprograms are tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. The first two objectives for the implementation assessmentrelate exclusively to D.A.R.E. The third targets D.A.R.E. butalso includes other drug use prevention programs. The primary objectives of the outcome assessment were to o identify all outcome evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s corecurriculum conducted to date in the United States and Canada; o assess the methodological rigor of those evaluations; o examine the nature and extent of the effects of D.A.R.E.'score curriculum; and o compare the effectiveness of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculumwith that of other school-based drug use prevention programstargeting 5th- and 6th-grade pupils. Although the first three objectives of the outcome assessmentfocus exclusively on D.A.R.E., the fourth places D.A.R.E. in alarger context by comparing it with other drug preventionprograms. In this report, we synthesize the most important findingsfrom both of the assessments and present overall conclusions, andsome recommendations. Description of the Study To achieve the study's goals and objectives, the researchteam designed a set of research strategies that would yield datapertinent not only to a review and critique of D.A.R.E., but alsoto an assessment of how D.A.R.E. compares with other school-baseddrug prevention programs, and of future directions for theseprograms. For the implementation assessment, we collected original databy conducting o informal interviews and discussions with the coordinatorsand/or educational advisors of D.A.R.E.'s Regional TrainingCenters (RTCs); o a survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators; and a survey of drug prevention coordinators in a representative, stratified sample of school districts that included districts with and without D.A.R.E. We also conducted site visits to two pairs of schools (one school in each pair had D.A.R.E. and the other did not). We discuss the methodologies used for each component of the implementation assessment in Section II of this report. For the outcome assessment, the research team conducted areview and assessment of the published and unpublishedevaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum conducted to date. Wecollected no primary data, but instead studied prior D.A.R.E.evaluations using meta- analytic techniques. The methodologies weused for the outcome assessment are presented in Section III ofthis report. At the conclusion of our data collection and analysisefforts, the research team joined Tom Colthurst of the Universityof California at San Diego Extension Program in March 1993 tohost a conference in San Diego, California, titled"Evaluating School-Linked Prevention Strategies Alcohol,Tobacco, and Other Drugs." Almost an entire day of this3-day conference for policymakers, researchers, and practitionerscentered on the preliminary results from this study. Thisconference provided an opportunity to disseminate early studyfindings from both the implementation and outcome assessments,and to incorporate participants' responses (including responsesfrom D.A.R.E. America as well as D.A.R.E. and other drugprevention researchers) to the findings in this final report. Strengths and Limitations of the Study We believe our approach to this study was fully responsive toNIJ's solicitation. Among the many strengths of this approach arethe following: o a multifaceted study methodology that collected informationfrom the national, regional, State, and school district levels ofD.A.R.E. and reviewed all short- term evaluations of the D.A.R.E.core curricula conducted to date; o a rigorous examination and synthesis of the results ofprevious evaluations of D.A.R.E.; and o incorporation into this final report of both formal andinformal feedback from researchers and practitioners attendingthe dissemination conference. However, we recognize that there are limitations to ourstudy, due primarily to limitations in the resources available tous. For example, our study budget would not allow us to surveylocal D.A.R.E. officers and classroom teachers, or monitor thedelivery of D.A.R.E. in the classroom. Additionally, somequestions raised in NIJ's solicitation, such as issues relatingto the effectiveness of the regional and State D.A.R.E. trainingcenters, could be answered only in part. A complete answer wouldhave required a many-layered study that examined trainingcenters' objectives, how these objectives are put into effectthrough training received both by trainers and by D.A.R.E.officers, and ultimately how the officers perform in theclassroom. This was clearly outside the scope of this study. Wealso were limited in assessing certain questions, such asvariability in effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. curriculum by thesociodemographic characteristics of the respondents because ofthe lack of research in this area (see Chapter 8 for furtherdetails). Given the level of resources available for this study, theresearch design required some compromises among the multipleobjectives invoked in NIJ's stated purposes, goals, objectives,and program strategies. However, the research team believes that the study representsan optimal mix of data collection methods and sources.Discussions with members of the D.A.R.E. America RTC AdvisoryBoard and other officials associated with the D.A.R.E. trainingcenters, when combined with information gathered from the surveyof State D.A.R.E. coordinators, provided answers to the questionsrelating specifically to the structure and operations of theD.A.R.E. program. The survey of school district drug preventioncoordinators yielded information about D.A.R.E. and itsrelationship to other school-based drug prevention programs. Thesite visits provided an illustrative, if unrepresentative,snapshot of D.A.R.E.'s implementation in two schools. A rigorousexamination of past D.A.R.E. evaluations provided information onthe effects of the program on students. Overview of the Report This report is organized into four sections and fourappendices. Section I contains the first two chapters, whichprovide an overview and history of school-based drug preventionprograms, with detailed information about the curricula andteachers of D.A.R.E.

AppendixC presents a bibliography of comparison program evaluations, andAppendix D contains data collection materials for theimplementation assessment. CHAPTER 2 OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF SCHOOL-BASED DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMSAND D.A.R.E. History of School-Based Drug Prevention Programs School-basededucational programs are the most common approach to drugprevention aimed at young people. Prevention efforts are located in educational settings both because drug use typically begins during adolescence and because classrooms provide the best opportunity for reaching a large number of youth simultaneously.=20 Although rates of drug use among U.S. students generally have been declining over the past few years (University of Michigan, 1994), these rates are still higher than rates of all other Western industrialized nations. =20 The U.S. Congress reacted to concerns about youth drug use by enacting the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) of 1986. The DFSCA was designed to establish programs of drug abuse education and prevention throughout the Nation. A key part of the DFSCA is Subtitle B of Title IV, which provides Federal money to States, schools, and communities to initiate or expand drug prevention programs. Actions resulting from Subtitle B of Title IV quickly resulted in the single largest drug prevention activity offered by the Federal Government, reaching $498,565,000 in FY 1993.=20 Research conducted by RTI staff concerning the implementation of State and local programs of the DFSCA found that in the 1988-1989 school year all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have actively participated in programs funded by the DFSCA at the State and local levels. Of all the school districts in the Nation, 78% reported that they received DFSCA funding, either directly or through regional or county education organizations (Thorne, Holley, Wine, Hayward, & Ringwalt, 1991). The DFSCA funds appear to have had a positive effect on the school-based prevention programs of school districts. To be eligible for DFSCA funding, schools must implement a comprehensive drug prevention program.=20 More than half of the districts receiving DFSCA funding reported that since the advent of such support, they had been able to expand or increase numerous aspects of their programs, including=20 o number of grade levels with substance abuse curricula, o school-wide emphasis on substance abuse prevention,=20 o number of teachers and staff involved, and=20 o number of students involved. =20 A total of 25% of these districts had increased their curriculum development activities, and 48% had increased their degree of involvement with other groups in the community. The availability of DFSCA funds may be more limited in the future. Drug Use Prevention Strategies A variety of school-based intervention programs have been developed over the past three decades for preventing drug use among youth (Botvin, 1990; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, Malvin, Schaeffer, & Schaps, 1983; Tobler, 1986). The types of programs differ both in terms of what they teach as well as in how they are taught (Tobler, in press, 1994). Program content generally reflects assumptions about why young people use drugs. For example, activities to boost self- esteem reflect the belief that low self-esteem is a risk factor for drug use; strategies that teach youth how to refuse offers of drugs from friends assume that peer pressure leads to drug use. Similarly, teaching methods implemented in various strategies reflect beliefs about the most effective means for teaching young people not to use drugs. Programs that use didactic methods reflect a traditional expert model for learning; programs that emphasize group activities reflect the belief that participatory activities enhance understanding and learning more effectively. Although hundreds of individual school-based prevention programs have been developed, they generally fall into three broad categories:=20 (a) knowledge/information programs, (b) affective programs, and (c) social influences programs. A fourth category of prevention programs, alternative programs, includes those usually offered outside the school setting. Knowledge/information and affective education programs have sometimes been grouped together as more traditional approaches, while social influences programs represent newer approaches (Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, in press, 1994). These three types of programs tend to differ in content, in methods, and in their effectiveness. Even so, there is overlap among them. Knowledge/information programs were the earliest school-based prevention efforts to be developed. These strategies are based on the assumption that youth begin using drugs because they are not sufficiently knowledgeable about adverse consequences. Once youth have adequate and accurate knowledge about drugs, it is assumed that they will behave rationally and choose not to use drugs. It is also assumed that changes in knowledge about drugs will promote more negative attitudes toward drug use, which in turn will be a deterrent to using drugs. Knowledge programs typically present factual information about the legal, biological, and psychological effects of drug use. Some of these programs have adopted scare tactics to present the risks of drug use to youth in a dramatic fashion. The methods used by knowledge/information programs typically include didactic presentations, discussion, and audiovisual presentations. Affective programs were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and are based on the assumption that young people use drugs because of personal and social deficits. These programs emphasize increasing self- esteem, enhancing self-awareness, clarifying values, making responsible decisions, and improving interpersonal skills. Affective programs often do not mention drug use at all. By enriching personal and social development, it is assumed that youth will make responsible decisions about drug use. These programs typically are taught by the same types of methods as for knowledge/ information programs, but they also may include group activities. Social influences programs are the most recent approach to drug use among youth. These programs are based on the assumption that youth use drugs because they do not have the social competencies needed to resist social pressures to use drugs. Some programs focus specifically on teaching youth the skills needed for resisting drug use influences. Other programs emphasize developing more general social competencies, such as increasing decisionmaking, improving communication, and reducing anxiety, in addition to enhancing drug-specific social skills. They may also include activities to correct misperceptions about the prevalence and acceptability of drug use among peers, as well as activities that seek to establish conservative group norms about drug use. Social influences programs typically include active, participatory learning experiences, such as modeling, role-playing, and practicing behavioral skills. Social influence strategies also frequently and actively involve "peers leaders" as teachers, in role-playing, or to facilitate discussion. Despite the differences across program categories, there is actually much overlap among school-based prevention programs in their components. Affective programs share similarities with some social influences programs in their emphasis, for example, on developing personal competencies. Social influences programs frequently include information about drugs and adverse consequences. Some programs include elements of all three categories of programs and have been labeled comprehensive programs. Indeed, many school-based curricula, including D.A.R.E., combine strategies that reflect knowledge/information, affective, and social influences programs. Research on the effectiveness of school-based prevention programs suggests that all three program strategies are not equally successful in preventing adolescent drug use (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Knowledge/information programs generally have not been effective in preventing drug use among youth. The evidence suggests that, although information-based programs may increase students' knowledge of drugs, they are unlikely to result in positive changes in either attitudes or behavior. In fact, some research indicates that these programs may lead to undesirable changes in attitudes (Bruvold & Rundall, 1988). Affective strategies also have not performed well in previous evaluations and meta-analyses (Botvin, 1990; Tobler, 1986). For example, Hansen, Johnson, Flay, Graham, and Sobel (1988) found that students who received an affective education program reported significantly more drug use than students in a comparison group and that these differences increased over time. In contrast, the results of evaluation of social influences programs have been generally more positive (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993, 1986; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, 1989; Pentz et al., 1989; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). In comparison with knowledge/information and affective programs, social influences programs have been more effective at preventing adolescent drug use. History of D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is a school-based drug prevention program designed to prevent students' use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. Most D.A.R.E. activities are directed toward pupils in the last grade of elementary school (grade 5 or 6), which is thought to be the age at which youth are most receptive to an anti-drug message, and before they begin experimenting with drugs (Bureau of Justice Assistance [BJA], 1991b). The original D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which was implemented in 1983, was developed by Dr. Ruth Rich, health education specialist from the LAUSD. Dr. Rich based the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on a review of other prevalent drug prevention programs, particularly Project SMART (Self-Management and Resistance Training), a prevention program designed by the Health Behavior Research Institute of the University of Southern California. =20 From its inception, D.A.R.E. was designed to be a continuing education program for kindergarten through high school. To that end, junior high and senior high curricula were developed in 1986 and 1988, respectively.=20 Additionally, D.A.R.E. designers created a parent curriculum to teach parents how to recognize and prevent drug use among youth and to provide them with information about the program. D.A.R.E. is distinctive among school-based drug prevention programs in that it uses trained, uniformed police officers in the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum. D.A.R.E. officers enter the classroom not only because of a cooperative agreement between the local school district and law enforcement agency, but also because the community is willing to forgo or replace the time that D.A.R.E. officers lose to other police duties. During D.A.R.E.'s first year, 1983- 1984, 10 officers taught the curriculum to around 8,000 students in 50 Los Angeles elementary schools (BJA, 1991a). D.A.R.E. is now widely implemented throughout the Nation and parts of Europe and Asia. According to the BJA (1991b), some 6 million students in the United States received D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year, and D.A.R.E. is currently implemented in 8,000 cities across the Nation (Glenn Levant, personal communication).=20 Indeed, the D.A.R.E. workbooks are currently available in Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Braille. In addition, D.A.R.E. has been adopted by several governmental agencies that sponsor schools, including the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Capitol police, the National Park Service, and all overseas branches of the Department of Defense. D.A.R.E. combines an essentially local, grass-roots effort with a high degree of centralized program control asserted by coordinating mechanisms at the national, regional, and State levels. At the national level, D.A.R.E. America assumes the primary responsibility for implementing and managing D.A.R.E., assisted by five RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board.=20 A detailed examination of the roles of national, regional, and State D.A.R.E. organizations is presented in Section II, Chapter 3.=20 D.A.R.E. Curricula The primary purposes of all the D.A.R.E. curricula for students are to o teach students to recognize pressures to use drugs from peers and from the media, o teach students the skills to resist peer inducements to use drugs, o enhance students' self-esteem,=20 o teach positive alternatives to substance use, and o increase students' interpersonal, communication, and decision-making skills (BJA, 1991a). Each of the curricula is periodically updated; an updated version of the core curriculum is currently being pilot tested and will be implemented in September 1994. A brief summary of each of the five D.A.R.E. curricula follows. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is taught in the 5th or 6th grade, comprises 17 hour-long weekly lessons. The D.A.R.E. officers have sole responsibility for teaching all of the lessons, although classroom teachers are encouraged to participate. Officers use a variety of teaching approaches, including the presentation of facts, group discussions, role-playing, and workbook exercises. =20 The core curriculum was updated in 1993 and will be fully implemented in 1994. The updated curriculum differs from the previous version in a variety of ways.=20 The new curriculum, which has been renamed "D.A.R.E. to Resist Drugs and Violence," o includes specific lessons concerning tobacco and inhalants, o emphasizes normative beliefs and protective factors, o adds violence prevention/conflict resolution strategies, o uses more participatory learning activities, and o employs a more collaborative partnership between the D.A.R.E. officer and the teacher in the classroom (Charles Dunn, personal communication, June 22, 1993). In both the old and new versions of the core curriculum, the lessons are cumulative, building upon concepts introduced in previous lessons. With the exception of lesson 14 in both versions, the lessons are implemented in sequence and without variation. The data collection for the implementation assessment and the evaluations studied in the outcome assessment occurred before the introduction of the new curriculum. We, therefore, believe it is important to provide information on both versions. Exhibit 2.1 presents a summary of the original version of the core curriculum upon which the outcome evaluation was based, and Exhibit 2.2 displays a summary of the updated curriculum.=20 In elementary schools that receive the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, officers may also visit students in kindergarten through 4th grade to teach brief introductory (15- to 20- minute) lessons. Topics in this curriculum include personal safety, the consequences of taking medicine and using drugs, saying "no" whenasked to engage in antisocial activities, and learning about feelings. The D.A.R.E. junior high school curriculum was originally developed to provide or reinforce information and skills that help students resist pressure to use drugs. Revisions were made in 1989 to include violence reduction, conflict resolution, and anger management. The 10 lessons are taught cooperatively by the officer and the classroom teacher.=20 The lessons and activities (summarized in Exhibit 2.3) are implemented over a 10-day period as part of a required course, such as health, science, or social studies. The senior high school curriculum also focuses on drug abuse and its effect on communities and young people (see Exhibit 2.4 for a summary of the lessons). The senior high school curriculum was designed to be taught over an 11-day period during health or another appropriate class. Responsibility for teaching the lessons is divided between the officer and the classroom teacher. Officers and teachers are trained together and are encouraged to be present during the entire 11-day period. Because of the difficulties educators have continually faced persuading parents to attend school educational functions, the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum was designed to be implemented where parents live and work. This curriculum consists of four or five 2-hour Exhibit 2.1 D.A.R.E.'sOriginal Core Curriculum Session Topic Descript= ion 1 First visit/personal safety Introduction of D.A.R.E. and law enforcement officer; safety practices; discussion of personal rights 2 Drug use and misuse Harmful effects from misuse of drugs 3 Consequences Consequences of using and choosing not to use alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs 4 Resisting pressures Sources of pressure; types of pressure to use drugs 5 Resistance techniques Refusal strategies for different types of peer pressure 6 Building self-esteem Identifying positive qualities in oneself; giving/ receiving compliments; importance of self-image 7 Assertiveness Personal rights/respon sibilities discussion; situations calling for assertiveness skills 8 Managing stress without =20 Identification of sources of stress; when stress drugs can be helpful or harmful; ways to manage stress; deep breathing exercise 9 Media influences Media influences on behavior; advertising techniques 10 Decisionmaking and risk Risk-taking behaviors; reasonable and taking harmful risks; consequences of various choices; influences on decisions 11 Drug use alternatives Reasons for using drugs; alternative activities 12 Role modeling Meet older student leaders/role models who do not use drugs 13 Forming support system Types of support groups; barriers to friendships; suggestions for overcoming these barriers 14 Ways to deal with gang Types of gang pressure; how gangs differ from pressures groups; consequences of gang activity (optional) 15 D.A.R.E. summary D.A.R.E. review 16 Taking a stand Taking appropriate stand when pressured to use drugs 17 D.A.R.E. culmination Award assembly; recognition of participants Exhibit 2.2 D.A.R.E.'s Updated Core Curriculum Lesson TopicDescription 1 Introducing D.A.R.E.

provides an awareness of safety measures that can be used in the home to reduce likelihood of dangerous exposure to drugs; introduces strategies parents can use to reduce the likelihood that young children will be at risk of drug abuse (2B) Risk factors (early adolescents) Introduces risk factors of substance use in early adolescents; introduces parents to basic drug identification and stages of adolescent chemical dependency 3 Youth pressure resistance skills Helps parents in awareness and under- standing of life skills, particularly in areas dealing with peer pressure and media influence; assists in strengthening the family network 4 Panel discussion Initiates discussion by members of the community from a variety of backgrounds on the scope of local substance abuse; provides an exchange of ideas on resources and referrals sessions generally held in the evenings (see Exhibit 2.5 for a summary of these lessons). Topics covered in this curriculum include developing better skills to interact with children, learning about peer pressures, and identifying signs and reducing risks of potential substance abuse. D.A.R.E. Officers and Training Law enforcement agencies exercise considerable discretion in identifying qualified, motivated police officers to be trained as D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. officers must be full-time, uniformed officers with at least 2 years of experience. When selecting candidate officers, local police departments are encouraged to consider the officer's ability to interact with children, ability to organize, and ability to handle the unexpected, as well as whether the officer would provide an exemplary role model and refrain from sexual, racial, stereotypical, or inappropriate remarks (BJA, 1991b). =20 Selected officers undergo an intensive, 2-week course of at least 80 hours of training. Officers are trained not only in the core curriculum, but also in public speaking, teaching skills, and classroom management. Their performance is directly critiqued by assigned mentors, who are experienced and specially trained D.A.R.E. officers. Outside speakers and consultants are also used to instruct the officers in areas requiring special expertise (e.g., a psychologist may present information on the stages of child development). The core curriculum training course includes opportunities to practice lessons both with peers and in an actual classroom setting. =20 Additional training is provided for officers teaching the junior and senior high school and parent curricula. Officers teaching these curricula are required to be certified as a D.A.R.E. officer and to have taught the core curriculum at least two semesters.=20 In-service training is provided to review what officers have previously learned in light of their actual classroom experiences and to acquaint them with changes to the curricula. The time that D.A.R.E. officers commit to the program varies considerably from one law enforcement jurisdiction to the next. For some officers, particularly those in large urban departments, teaching D.A.R.E. is a full-time occupation. In departments that serve rural communities, D.A.R.E. officers administer the program on a part-time basis, devoting the remainder of their time to other law enforcement tasks. =20 Once in the field, D.A.R.E. officer performance is monitored by mentors who observe classroom presentations and evaluate performance. Mentors may also use input from school administrators, classroom teachers, health education coordinators, and advisory committees to provide officers with feedback on their presentations. =20 D.A.R.E. in the Context of Other School-Based Drug Use Prevention Programs Considering that the D.A.R.E. curricula were based on several preexisting school-based drug prevention curricula (primarily Project SMART), it is not surprising that the curricula closely resemble other programs in content. Exhibit 2.6 show that D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum includes lessons that represent all three curricular strategies discussed earlier.=20 D.A.R.E. differs from most other school-based drug prevention programs in the structure by which it is organized and implemented. First, D.A.R.E. is implemented by law enforcement officers; most other programs are taught by teachers. Second, D.A.R.E. officer training lasts 2 weeks and is highly intensive; most drug prevention program training for teachers is of a shorter duration. Third, D.A.R.E. officers are strongly encouraged to deliver their lessons in sequence, departing only minimally (if at all) from their lesson plans; teachers are much more free to adapt curricula at will, emphasizing those areas they believe to be most salient or useful or integrating the drug prevention material into their general education curriculum.=20 Fourth, D.A.R.E. officer performance is often carefully monitored and evaluated; generally, the accountability mechanisms for teachers' implementation of their curricula are less structured. Fifth, the mission of D.A.R.E. officers in the school is exclusively drug prevention; to most teachers, drug prevention is often only part of a larger curriculum.

In essence, it is a product of memoranda of understanding between community law enforcement and local public school districts across the Nation. The primary purposes of the D.A.R.E. hierarchy described in this chapter are to ensure the integrity of the D.A.R.E. curriculum and the fidelity with which it is delivered; to develop and uphold standards for the integrity, coordination, and quality of D.A.R.E. operations; and to provide support to D.A.R.E. at the community level. As we have said, in its degree of organization at the national and regional levels, D.A.R.E. differs greatly from other school-based drug use prevention programs, most of which limit their activities to delivering packaged curricula to school districts and offering some level of training to teachers. In contrast, the D.A.R.E. organization oversees all aspects of the prevention program, including the consistency with which it is implemented in the classroom. In this chapter, we discuss the functions of D.A.R.E. America, the preeminent D.A.R.E. organization, and its relationship with the o D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board; o State Training Centers, State Charter Organizations; and State D.A.R.E. Coordinators; o Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD); and o D.A.R.E. America Scientific Advisory Board. We obtained much of the information for this chapter from an interview conducted in August 1994 with Glenn Levant, Executive Director of D.A.R.E. America. This information is supplemented by relevant D.A.R.E. documents. We also summarize a series of loosely structured interviews conducted in 1992 with representatives of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. D.A.R.E. at the national, regional, State, and local levels is promoted, monitored, and overseen by D.A.R.E. America, which is chartered as a nonprofit organization. As specified in its charter, D.A.R.E. America has responsibility for a variety of key func- tions, including o administering the D.A.R.E. program, o providing educational materials to communities implementing D.A.R.E., o overseeing D.A.R.E. officer training and ensuring its consistency, o improving the curriculum, and o providing support to D.A.R.E. both nationally and internationally. =20 In 1988, the BJA awarded four grants to establish the RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board, and a fifth RTC was established the following year. The RTCs are located in Arizona, California, Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina, and the States associated with each are presented in Exhibit 3.1. The responsibilities of the RTCs include making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the accreditation of State-level training centers. In addition, the RTCs provide oversight to the local D.A.R.E. programs to ensure that the copyrighted curriculum is taught as specified. Educational specialists representing the five RTCs, together with staff of the LAUSD, are charged with curricular development, taking advice from the Scientific Advisory Board and other specialists. In Federal FY 1994, it is expected that the BJA grant, which in the past has flowed to the RTCs, will come directly to D.A.R.E. America to support the RTCs. D.A.R.E. is also organized at the State level. In more than one-third of the States, D.A.R.E. America has helped charter a nonprofit (501C3) organization, over which D.A.R.E. America has oversight, and which is designed to support the program in that State. The board of the chartered organization typically comprises the State's attorney general, the superintendent of education, and prominent business and education people.=20 The board of directors may also include a representative of the State's D.A.R.E. Officers' Association (described below) as well as, in some States, a D.A.R.E. coordinator whose prominence and position may vary considerably. It is expected that in time there will be D.A.R.E. charter organizations in the remaining States. In those States that currently lack a charter organization, there is typically some individual identified as the State D.A.R.E. coordinator who often is a State employee. This person's responsibilities include coordinating candidate selection and scheduling training for D.A.R.E. officers, obtaining State funds to support D.A.R.E. programs, providing local technical assistance, and overseeing policy development and implementation at the State level.=20 D.A.R.E. America meets with these individuals, and with the State charter organizations, on a quarterly basis. In addition to D.A.R.E. State charter organizations at the State level, a total of 42 States currently have developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. These centers are differentially accredited; all conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers in the core curriculum, while only some are accredited to teach the other curricula or to train D.A.R.E. mentors.=20 The STCs are supported both by the States and by D.A.R.E. America. The level of activity of these centers varies considerably given the size of the State and demand for D.A.R.E. officer training. At present, there are some 20,000 certified D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. America also owns and protects the copyright to the D.A.R.E. name, logo, and associated slogans. D.A.R.E.'s name is considered a valuable intellectual property. D.A.R.E. America approves all materials (e.g., bumper stickers) and celebrities used to promote the D.A.R.E. program. In addition, the organization screens sponsors for fund-raising events to exclude companies manufacturing alcohol or tobacco products. =20 Together with the LAUSD, D.A.R.E. America owns the copyright to the core curriculum. The superintendent of the LAUSD has been represented on the board of D.A.R.E. America since 1983. Through the RTCs, D.A.R.E. America monitors the implementation of D.A.R.E. in each community and may withdraw its permission to use D.A.R.E. if a local school district has improperly modified the curriculum. To fulfill its responsibility of improving the curriculum, D.A.R.E. America established in 1993 a Scientific Advisory Board, which is chaired by Dr. Herb Kleber of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University. Dr. Kleber was formally the chief official for demand reduction in the Bush Administration's White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The board includes prevention specialists from across the Nation. The National D.A.R.E. Officers' Association, which D.A.R.E. America helped to found in 1987, serves to improve communications among police officers within D.A.R.E. The association now has a State D.A.R.E. Officers' association in each of the 50 States. Each of the 18 other countries that have adopted the D.A.R.E. program also has an association of D.A.R.E. officers, although those association are not formally a part of the national association. However, all associations, both domestic and foreign, look to D.A.R.E. America for guidance in matters of policy. Finally, D.A.R.E. America provides considerable support to communities implementing D.A.R.E. in the form of the educational materials that support the curriculum.=20 In some cases, D.A.R.E. America offers communities direct financial support as well. We collected further information by means of informal interviews and discussions we conducted with the coordinators and/or educational advisors of each of the five RTCs in January 1992. The RTC coordinators/advisors discussed with us a number of their needs and recommendations for the D.A.R.E. program. Summaries of their discussions with us are presented below. An increasing need for in-service training. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that a substantial number of officers have received D.A.R.E. training in the past decade. However, they stressed that the original training of many officers may now be several years old.=20 RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that although mechanisms for providing in-service training do exist, these mechanisms may not be sufficient. Furthermore, they suggested that because training of new officers already stretches available resources, the increasing need for in-service training for existing D.A.R.E. officers will strain D.A.R.E.'s budget further.=20 Exhibit 3.1 Jurisdictions of D.A.R.E.'s Regional Training Centers Southeast Midwest =20 Southwest East RTC RTC RTC RTC West RTC Connecticut Alabama Arkansas =20 Alaska California* Delaware Florida Illinois* =20 Arizona* Hawaii District of Columbia Georgia Indiana =20 Colorado Idaho Maine Louisiana Iowa =20 Kansas Montana Maryland Mississippi Kentucky =20 Nebraska Nevada Massachusetts North Carolina* Michigan New Mexico North Dakota New Hampshire South Carolina Minnesota =20 Oklahoma Oregon New Jersey Tennessee Missouri South Dakota Washington New York Ohio Texas =20 Wyoming Pennsylvania Wisconsin Utah Rhode Island Vermont Virginia* West Virginia *Indicates location of Regional Training Center. The increasing need to train State D.A.R.E. coordinators. RTC coordinators/ advisors indicated that most States now have State D.A.R.E. coordinators (see Chapter 4). However, they reported that many are relatively new in these positions or have received little formal information about how to conduct their jobs. They stated that coordinator training should include the responsibilities and roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators, as well as how they can effectively interact both with their RTC and the schools in their States. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that plans are currently under way to establish procedures to accredit State D.A.R.E. coordinators. =20 The need to improve lines of communication and clarify lines of authority. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that because of the lack of formal training and the lack of communication among State coordinators, many State D.A.R.E. coordinators have had to learn their jobs by trial and error. They stated that although a certain amount of communication occurs among State D.A.R.E. coordinators (especially among coordinators in neighboring States), increasing communication would greatly enhance efficiency by enabling coordinators to draw on the experiences of others instead of"reinventing the wheel."=20 RTC coordinators/advisors also indicated that State coordinators may need assistance with getting local programs to recognize developing lines of authority. For example, they stated that in the past, local programs worked directly with RTCs; they said that many local programs will need to be prompted to now work with the STC instead. The need for increased D.A.R.E. officer mentoring.=20 At present, RTC coordinators/ advisors reported that there is a well-developed system for monitoring D.A.R.E. officer performance in the classroom. They reported that D.A.R.E. mentors periodically monitor and evaluate officer performance by observing classes taught by the officer. They also indicated that teachers are given the opportunity to rate officer performance. They reported that D.A.R.E. officers are informed of any problem areas, told how to correct these problems, and later reevaluated to ensure that the problem has been corrected. However, to be truly useful, RTC coordinators reported that these mentors should have the time and resources necessary to work closely with D.A.R.E. officers to improve their performance. The need for increased collaboration between education and law enforcement. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that because D.A.R.E. was created as a close partnership between the LAUSD and the Los Angeles Police Department, the program is dependent on a strong and continuing relationship between education and law enforcement at every level. At the State level, RTC coordinators/advisors see close collaboration between the department of education and the organization administering D.A.R.E. (typically related to law enforcement) as essential. They indicated that the institutional commitment of State Departments of Education to D.A.R.E. is essential, in part, to help resolve any community-level problems. Further, they indicated that as administrators of DFSCA funds, State Departments of Education have an increasing role to play in providing guidance concerning the various components of a school district's comprehensive K-12 curriculum (including D.A.R.E.) and how these components should be integrated to ensure a comprehensive approach. RTC coordinators indicated that ways in which State Departments of Education could play a role in assisting with the evaluation of D.A.R.E. officer performance should be examined. At the local level, RTC coordinators indicated that D.A.R.E. is initiated when a school district invites a police department to teach the program. They reported that the police department nominates a candidate for D.A.R.E. officer training, and the candidate must be acceptable to the school district administration. In the classroom, they stated, the role of the teacher is evolving from an observer and monitor of the officer's performance to an active partner in D.A.R.E. instruction.=20 The need to maintain limits to the D.A.R.E. "bureaucracy". RTC coordinators/ advisors stressed that pressures on D.A.R.E. to expand its operations are considerable. They indicated that as an institution, D.A.R.E. remains committed to maintaining high standards at the community level. They reported that as the role of the State coordinator continues to become more important in this regard, the need for the RTCs to provide technical assistance and to monitor State activities becomes even more crucial. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that because existing RTC resources are already strained by current demands, further growth at the national level seems inevitable.=20 They indicated that even if support for such growth exists, however, there is concern that a bureaucracy will develop that may weaken the "grass-roots" nature ofthe enterprise. Coordinators/advisors indicated that it will be a challenge to increase the size and capabilities of the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy to manage and control this burgeoning program with the need to keep the bureaucracy streamlined and responsive to the needs of the communities that D.A.R.E. serves. The need to locate permanent funding sources. RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that D.A.R.E. currently receives substantial support from DFSCA. However, they feel that Federal DFSCA funds appear to have reached a plateau in the past 3 years and are likely to be subjected to budget cuts in the future. RTC coordinators/advisors fear that D.A.R.E. could be reduced or even eliminated as a line item. Regardless, they reported that Federal funding may have been a mixed blessing, insofar as Federal support may displace local efforts to secure the resources necessary to implement the program.=20 Summary In this chapter, we focused on the national- and regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. We conducted unstructured interviews with the executive director of D.A.R.E. America and representatives from each of the RTCs. We also reviewed available documents. D.A.R.E. is a grass-roots program that operates through memoranda of understanding between community law enforcement agencies and local schools. D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization, coordinates, promotes, monitors, and assumes ultimate responsibility for the D.A.R.E. program at all levels. The D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board, which is composed of staff from the RTCs, serves in an advisory capacity to D.A.R.E. America. In addition to making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America, RTCs are responsible for oversight of the local D.A.R.E. programs and coordinating and conducting D.A.R.E. officer training. Organizations and individuals working to promote and coordinate the D.A.R.E. program at the State levelinclude State-chartered nonprofit organizations, State D.A.R.E. officers' associations, and State D.A.R.E. coordinators. Also at the State level are STCs that provide training to D.A.R.E. officers. Curriculum development and changes are the responsibility of educational specialists from each of the RTCs, together with staff from the LAUSD. A Scientific Advisory Board, composed of leading prevention specialists, assists in these endeavors. Our interviews with the RTC coordinators indicated the following key issues: a need for increased in- service training and mentoring, providing training to State D.A.R.E. coordinators, improving communication and collaboration between agencies, maintaining limits on the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy, and locating permanent funding sources. Findings from this chapter and resulting recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 4 STATE-LEVEL OPERATIONS In this chapter, we present the second component of the implementation assessment, a survey of those individuals who generally manage the State-level D.A.R.E. operations: the State D.A.R.E. coordinators. This component was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information concerning: o features common to most D.A.R.E. programs, o funding arrangements for D.A.R.E., o management of D.A.R.E. and supporting organizations, and o availability of the D.A.R.E. curricula. The primary objective of this component was, of course, to provide information concerning D.A.R.E.'s State-level operations. As a secondary objective, we collected preliminary information to facilitate sample selection for the school district drug prevention coordinators survey, the results of which we present in Chapter 5. This chapter covers both the methodology for and findings from the survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators.=20 The findings section presents data concerning the administration, funding, implementation, challenges, and problems of State-level D.A.R.E. operations. Methodology Instrument Design We based the content of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators' survey on the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the literature on D.A.R.E.'s structure and operations, and an examination of prior studies of school-based drug education conducted at RTI.=20 Recognizing that State D.A.R.E. coordinators have considerable demands on their time, we designed the instrument to be as brief and straightforward as possible. To minimize ambiguity and burden, we used mostly close-ended items. A few open-ended questions were included to encourage respondents to provide detailed information. =20 The survey instrument was composed of two parts: a questionnaire and a list of school districts. The questionnaire contained items concerning administration, funding, and implementation of the State D.A.R.E. program. The list of school districts contained those districts we selected from that State for the first-phase sample of the school district drug prevention coordinators' survey (see Chapter 5). We asked State coordinators to indicate whether each district on their list used D.A.R.E., and we then used this information to draw the second-phase sample for the school district survey. We pretested the instrument on three State D.A.R.E. coordinators in early February 1992. We also shared the instrument with all five RTC coordinators and requested their feedback. We incorporated the responses of pretest participants, as well the comments of the RTC coordinators, the NIJ program manager, and other alcohol and drug prevention program experts into the final draft of the data collection instrument. A copy of the survey instrument and other data collection materials can be found in Appendix D. Data Collection In January 1992, the RTC coordinators provided us with lists of names and addresses of State D.A.R.E. coordinators. Based on this information, we identified 44 States with D.A.R.E. coordinators. We mailed each coordinator a package containing cover letters from the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and RTI, a questionnaire, and a list of school districts in the coordinator's State. The cover letter from the RTC Advisory Board expressed support for the research effort and encouraged participation. The cover letter from RTI explained the study, provided assurances that all information would be kept strictly confidential, and requested copies of any pertinent State documents concerning the organization and/or administration of D.A.R.E. =20 We mailed the packages to the State D.A.R.E. coordinators on February 18, 1992. Two weeks after the initial mailout, we contacted nonresponders by telephone.=20 We made repeated attempts by mail and telephone to secure the return of completed materials or to collect the information by phone. The RTCs were again of great assistance to us in urging coordinators to return surveys. Of the 44 respondents identified by the RTC coordinators, 39 completed the instrument. For purposes of verification, one question in the survey asked respondents to confirm that the State had a D.A.R.E. coordinator. Although four States responded that they did not have such a position, we determined after some investigation that they did have a person who performs a coordinator's role. Respondents from all four of these States reported that administration of the State D.A.R.E. program was one of several roles they performed as supervisors or directors in law enforcement agencies.=20 We, therefore, did not delete these responses from our analysis. It should be noted, however, that because of skip patterns in the survey instrument, these four respondents did not complete survey items specifically directed to the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. =20 Findings Administration To address issues raised in the NIJ solicitation concerning management of the D.A.R.E. program, we asked a series of questions about the agencies involved in D.A.R.E.'s administration at the State level, the functions of each agency, and the relationships among them. Findings from these questions are presented below. Agencies Involved. We first asked respondents to report the agency with primary responsibility for managing the State D.A.R.E. program. As shown in Exhibit 4.1, the great majority of States indicated that a law enforcement or criminal justice agency was entrusted with this responsibility. =20 Exhibit 4.1 Percentage of State D.A.R.E.

We asked coordinators if the State had a policy advisory board (PAB), and 15 States (38%) reported affirmatively. To explore PAB membership, we asked the 15 coordinators with PABs to indicate the agencies/individuals who held memberships on these boards and to indicate the representative who chaired it.=20 Exhibit 4.2 shows that 65% or more of the States with PABs listed State and local educational agencies, local law enforcement agencies, and State D.A.R.E. officer associations among their members. The leadership role of the PABs was primarily held by law enforcement representatives. The board was chaired by State law enforcement agencies in six States, by local law enforcement in three States, by local education agencies in two States, by the State Department of Education in one State, by another State agency in one State, and by an Association of Chiefs of Police in one State. =20 Exhibit 4.2 Percentage of States with D.A.R.E.

Yet another agency encouraged to become involved in D.A.R.E. is the State Department of Education. States are encouraged to retain an educational consultant to act as a liaison between the State Department of Education, local school administrators, and D.A.R.E. instructors (BJA, 1988). We, therefore, asked if the State had an educational consultant. Twenty-five (64%) of the 39 respondents reported having an educational advisor, and two States reported two advisors. Further, we inquired about the employers of these consultants and found that educational systems employed 17 of the 27 educational advisors and law enforcement agencies employed 4 (Exhibit 4.3). Exhibit 4.3 Percentage of States with D.A.R.E.

Functions. Next, we sought to examine the responsibilities of both the State D.A.R.E. coordinators and the PABs by asking respondents to indicate the functions of each agency (Exhibit 4.4). The most fre- quently mentioned roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators were D.A.R.E. advocacy and officer training within the State. The most frequently mentioned roles of PABs were formulating State policy, exploring funding sources, and advocating for D.A.R.E.=20 We also asked respondents to list functions performed by the State D.A.R.E. coordinators and the PABs that were not provided as close-ended response options.=20 Additional duties mentioned for State D.A.R.E. coordinators included=20 o acting as liaison to other D.A.R.E. agencies (three States), o distributing D.A.R.E. materials (three States), o making and managing grant applications (two States), o training D.A.R.E. officers for schools on military bases (one State), o recertifying officers (one State), o selecting officers (one State), and o serving as a clearinghouse for information (one State). Other duties performed by the PABs included long-term planning (two States) and the selection and supervision of the State D.A.R.E. coordinator (one State). Exhibit 4.4 Percentage of State D.A.R.E.

As mentioned earlier, State D.A.R.E. programs are strongly encouraged to develop relationships with State Departments of Education.=20 Having an educational consultant, however, does not guarantee communication between the agencies. We, therefore, asked the State coordinators about how well they communicate with the Department of Education. Most of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported having a great deal (35%) or some (47%) communication with the State Department of Education. In six States, coordinators reported little communication, and only one reported none. Seven coordinators (20%) reported having a signed agreement between the State D.A.R.E. coordinator and the Department of Education. =20 We also asked coordinators about the level of communication between the PABs and the State Department of Education. Most of the coordinators reported that PABs had a great deal of communication with the Depart- ment of Education. Eight of the 15 States with PABs reported that their boards had a great deal of communication, three reported some communication, three reported little, and one reported none. =20 Only one State reported that both the State D.A.R.E. coordinator and the PAB had little communication with the Department of Education. Funding The NIJ solicitation also requested information on funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. To this end, we asked respondents to report the amount of funding received by the primary managing agency. Exhibit 4.5 presents ranges of funding received for D.A.R.E. at the State level. Four States reported that no funds were received for State-level D.A.R.E. operations, and two State coordinators were unable to provide this information. =20 The mean amount of funds received by the primary managing agency for operating D.A.R.E. at the State level in the 1991-1992 school year (excluding $0 values) was $273,657; funding ranged from $25,000 to $2,635,000. The total amount received by the responding States was $9,260,700. Exhibit 4.5 Funding Received in 1991-1992 School Year for State-Level D.A.R.E. Operations Funding Range (N=3D39) % $ 0 10.3 $ 25,000 - 49,000 12.8 $ 50,000 - 99,999 28.2 $100,000 - 299,999 25.6 $300,000 + 17.9 Data Unavailable 5.1 We asked the 33 respondents who reported the amount of funding for State-level operations to identify the sources of this funding (Exhibit 4.6). Four of the 33 respondents did not answer this question. We also asked coordinators to indicate the percentage of funds received from each source. Fifteen States indicated that all funds were received from one source (six from the BJA, four from State governors' grants, two from the State Department of Education, two from legislative funds, and one from other sources). Eight States reported that funding was received from two sources, and eight States reported receiving funding from three or more sources. =20 Additionally, we asked respondents to report other sources of funding not mentioned in the close-ended response options. Responses included State and local matching funds, special education trust funds, State penalty assessment funds, funds from the Exhibit 4.6 Numberof States Receiving Funds for State- Level Operations from Sources in 1991-1992 School Year Funding Source (N=3D31) % Bureau of Justice Assistance Grant 58.1 Grant from Governor's Office 29.0 State Department of Education 12.9 Legislative Funds 25.8 Grant from Other State Agency 29.0 Local Funds 9.7 Corporate Donations 9.7 Individual Donations 3.2 Civic or Community Groups 3.2 D.A.R.E.

America has informed us that all State-level programs receive support from D.A.R.E. America (Glenn Levant, personal communi- cation, August 9, 1994). Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), fund-raisers, and Federal forfeiture funds. State Training Centers As mentioned in Chapter 3, one goal of the RTCs has been to develop STCs in their geographic areas.=20 Increasingly, RTCs have adopted a "train thetrainer" model to prepare STCs in their jurisdiction to conduct their own D.A.R.E. officer training and certification procedures. We, therefore, asked coordinators whether their State had its own STC. About 87% (34 States) reported affirmatively. One of the five States without a training center reported that the State was in the process of establishing a training center. Implementation To obtain a general idea of the level of implementation of each of D.A.R.E.'s curricula, we asked respondents to indicate each curriculum used in the State during the 1991-1992 school year. All respondents reported that the core curriculum and the K-4 visitations were used in at least one school in the State.=20 Furthermore, 28 States (72%) implemented the junior high curriculum, 26 States (67%) implemented the senior high school curriculum, and 9 States (23%) implemented the parent curriculum in at least one school. Challenges and Problems To acquire an understanding of the challenges and problems facing D.A.R.E. and the State D.A.R.E. coordina- tor in the coming years, we asked two open-ended questions about these issues. We categorized the responses and counted the number of State coordinators indicating each category. (We advise caution in using these findings to make recommendations given the small number of coordinators mentioning each category.) =20 First, we asked respondents to identify the most significant issues they face in working with the State's Department of Education. The two most common responses were improving communication between agencies (mentioned by eight States) and acquiring a full-time educational advisor (mentioned by seven States). Most of the other responses were specific actions that coordinators wanted the State Department of Education to undertake, such as o assisting with program evaluation and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers (six States), o formally mandating the D.A.R.E. program (three States), o understanding the role of law enforcement in education (three States), o assisting with funding for D.A.R.E. (three States), o providing greater support for the D.A.R.E. program (two States), o assisting in training programs (one State), and o helping resolve problems between officers and teachers (one State). We then asked respondents to indicate the most significant issues facing the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. It should be noted that most of these issues could be mentioned by coordinators of other drug prevention programs, as well as coordinators of D.A.R.E.=20 Most of the responses centered on funding, communication, evaluation, and training. The responses, by category, were as follows:=20 Funding o maintaining or increasing funding (13 States) o locating funding sources (8 States) o locating funding specifically for training (6 States) Communication o increasing communication between D.A.R.E. agencies at the local, regional, and national levels (10 States) o improving relations with State Department of Education (4 States) o coping with the disorganization of the program (4 States) o improving public relations (3 States) o keeping up with constantly shifting policies of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board (2 States) Evaluation o monitoring officers in the classroom (8 States) o evaluating the program (4 States) Training o improving training (3 States) o handling problem officers (2 States) o obtaining STC certification (1 State) Staffing o increasing staffing (6 States) o formally establishing a State D.A.R.E. coordinator position (2 States) o forming a PAB (2 States) Expansion o expanding D.A.R.E. to other grades or schools (7 States). Summary This chapter focused on a survey of the administrators of the State D.A.R.E. programs. Thirty- nine of the 44 States with State D.A.R.E. coordinators responded to the survey. =20 We found that most of the State D.A.R.E. programs are managed by law enforcement or criminal justice agencies and that most retain educational consultants.=20 About two-fifths of the States had PABs. Most of the coordinators reported high levels of communication between themselves and the State Department of Education.=20 They also reported high levels of communication between the PABs and the Department of Education. Most States received at least $50,000 in funding for training and administrative purposes, and most States had their own STC. Findings from this chapter and resulting recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 5 SCHOOL DISTRICT DRUG PREVENTION COORDINATOR SURVEY A survey of school district drug prevention coordinators was the main component of our implementation assessment. This component of the assessment was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information about the implementation of D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug prevention programs at the local level. NIJ specifically requested information on the following questions: o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program at the local level? o How involved in D.A.R.E. are classroom teachers, churches, and community groups? o How extensively are D.A.R.E. and other school-based alcohol and other drug (AOD) prevention programs implemented nationwide in terms of geography, target populations (such as ethnic groups, economic strata, and urbanicity), and grade levels? o How do other AOD programs compare with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? o What are local funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs? How do these resources affect implementation? A careful reading of these questions reveals that NIJ had three primary objectives: (a) to secure information about the administration of D.A.R.E., (b) to develop estimates of the national prevalence of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs, and (c) to make comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. =20 RTI staff developed and conducted a comprehensive survey of school district drug prevention coordinators that addressed each of the above-mentioned objectives and questions. We selected drug prevention coordinators as respondents, as opposed to classroom teachers or police officers, because we believed that drug prevention coordinators were the school district staff members best able to provide us with a broad perspective on all drug prevention activities in the district, including both D.A.R.E. and other AOD prevention programs. This chapter presents the methodology and findings for this survey. We should note that for this chapter the results we display will be descriptive, as opposed to explanatory, in nature. That is, our purpose is to report what the school district drug prevention coordinators have told us, and not attempt to explain why they responded as they did. Although efforts to explain our respondents' answer are feasible, we believe they would ultimately prove unsatisfactory because our explanatory variables (e.g., the school districts' racial balance or percentage of youth in poverty) are very limited, and any differences we find may be misleading. The findings section first presents information we received from districts with D.A.R.E., followed by estimates of the numbers of districts with D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs, and comparisons of D.A.R.E. with other AOD programs. At the end of the findings section, we also provide some general information about drug policies in all the districts surveyed. Methodology Sample Design The sample design for the school district drug prevention coordinators' survey was a two-phased stratified random sample. The two-phases of the sample design was necessary to meet the multiple goals of this survey. The goal of the first-phase sample was to produce estimates by region, district size, socioeconomic status (SES) categories, ethnicity categories, and urbanicity. The goal of the second-phase sample was to enable comparisons between districts with and without D.A.R.E. A detailed discussion of each phase of the sample design is discussed below. Sampling frame. The first step in our sampling design was to obtain a list of public school districts nationwide. We obtained such a list from Quality Educational Data (QED) Inc., of Denver, Colorado. The QED file, which is updated every summer, lists all public school districts nationwide and contains a wealth of useful information for each school district. We used this file as our sampling frame. Information that we used from this file included the school district's o SES (defined as the percentage of children in the district below poverty level), o urbanicity (defined as urban, suburban, or rural), o ethnicity (defined as the percentage of children in the district who were black or Hispanic), and o district size (defined as the number of students enrolled in the district). =20 For each of the 14,715 districts on the QED file, we created five new variables that we later used for stratification and weighting purposes. First, we created a region variable that was based on the jurisdictions of D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs (see Chapter 3, Exhibit 3.1). Next, to keep the total number of stratum cells within reasonable bounds, we dichotomized urbanicity, SES, ethnicity, and district size. We first collapsed the urban and suburban categories on the QED file into one category. We computed percentiles for minority status, SES, and district size within each region-by-urbanicity group. We then used the median of each variable to define two categories (low/high) for each of the three variables. The number and percentage of school districts in the sampling frame in each of the strata are presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.1. First-Phase Sampling. The goal of the first-phase of our sampling design was to ensure that we selected a nationally representative sample of school districts.=20 Additionally, we wanted to ensure that districts in each region, urbanicity category, SES category, minority status category, and district size category were adequately sampled. Therefore, our first-phase sample was a stratified random sample. =20 The first step in selecting our first-phase sample was to define each strata. We initially constructed 10 region-by-urbanicity strata by crossing the 5 regional strata with the 2 urbanicity strata. We then crossed each of these 10 strata with 2 SES categories (resulting in 20 strata). We then crossed each of those 20 strata by minority status (resulting in 40 strata). Finally, we crossed each of those 40 strata by district size (resulting in 80 strata). The number of school districts in the sampling frame in each of the 80 strata is presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.2. The next step in our sampling design was to determine how districts from each strata would be selected for inclusion in the first-phase sample. We assayed two methods of allocating the sample to strata.=20 In the first method, we assigned equal sample sizes across strata (i.e., we sampled 15 districts from every stratum regardless of whether the stratum in the sampling frame contained 15 or 200 districts). This method would have ensured good precision across strata. In the second method, we assigned sample sizes proportional to the frame size within each stratum. For example, if 5% of the districts in the sampling frame were in a particular stratum, proportional sampling would have ensured that 5% of the first-phase sample would be allocated to that same stratum. Unlike equal allocation, proportional allocation yields approximately equal sampling weights, reduces variance, and thus provides better precision for overall survey estimates. =20 Because of its clear advantages, we chose proportional sampling. Thus, we randomly selected a proportional number of school districts within each of the 80 strata. The first-phase sample consisted of 1,500 school districts. Exhibits displaying the sample allocation to strata are provided in Appendix A, Exhibits A.3 and A.4. Second-Phase Sampling. The goal of the second- phase of our sampling design was to ensure that the second-phase sample included both D.A.R.E. and non- D.A.R.E. school districts. To make this determination, we asked State D.A.R.E. or DFSCA coordinators to classify the 1,500 school districts in the first-phase sample as either D.A.R.E. or non-D.A.R.E. districts (see Chapter 4). Because some State coordinators did not return this information or only partially completed the information, we created a third category of school districts with an unknown D.A.R.E. status. State coordinators reported that 43% of the sampled districts used D.A.R.E. and 40% did not; D.A.R.E. status was unknown for 17% of the districts. Exhibit A.5 in Appendix A displays the responses of the State coordinators on the D.A.R.E. status of the first-phase sample by region. The next step in selecting our second-phase sample was to determine the number of districts to be selected.=20 Calculations to determine the number of districts needed in the second-phase sample were based first on the type of analysis we planned to conduct and second on an anticipated 80% response rate. Because we calculated that 400 responding school districts were necessary to achieve sufficient statistical power and precision, we selected a second-phase sample of 500 school districts. Finally, we used the classifications provided by the State coordinators to select proportional numbers of school districts with D.A.R.E., without D.A.R.E., and with unknown D.A.R.E. status across the five regions.=20 Thus, we selected 215 school districts with D.A.R.E., 200 without D.A.R.E., and 85 with unknown D.A.R.E. status.=20 Exhibit A.6 in Appendix A displays the second-phase sample by region and D.A.R.E. status. Survey Estimation. All survey estimates were computed using software developed at RTI specifically for the analysis of surveys based on complex sample designs.=20 We computed analysis weights that took into account the two-phase stratified sample design. Weighted data provides a less biased estimate than unweighted data because the weighted data more accurately represents the true population. The weights varied across strata based on region, ethnic composition, urbanicity, SES, and size of the school district. Analysis weights were computed as the product of the first-phase sample weight and the second-phase sample weight. Sampling weights were also adjusted for nonresponse. We performed quality checks on the analysis weights to ensure that the sum of the analysis weights coincides with the number of districts in the frame. We also examined the variability of the analyses weights and their impact on survey variances. Instrument Design RTI staff determined the contents of the school district drug prevention coordinators' survey based on the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the literature, and examination of the studies of drug education programming previously conducted at RTI. We used close-ended items whenever possible to minimize ambiguity and burden. A few open-ended questions were included to encourage respondents to provide detailed information. =20 All drug prevention coordinators completed a set of core items that were designed to provide background information about the district and about the specific drug prevention curricula used. Additionally, coordinators in districts using D.A.R.E., alone or in combination with other drug prevention curricula, completed a set of items concerning the D.A.R.E. program only. Coordinators in districts using other AOD prevention programs, alone or in combination with D.A.R.E., completed a set of items concerning other AOD (i.e., non-D.A.R.E.) programs only. Therefore, school districts implementing D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of items. After submitting the data collection instrument to our NIJ program manager for comment and discussion, we formally pretested all data collection materials and procedures. Both regional and State DFSCA coordinators assisted in identifying pretest subjects. Seven school district drug prevention coordinators (two in New York, two in South Dakota, one in North Carolina, one in Rhode Island, and one in South Carolina) completed a pretest questionnaire in early April 1992. We used the responses of pretest participants, as well as the comments of our NIJ program manager and other AOD prevention program experts, to make final decisions on the data collection procedures and instruments. A copy of the survey instrument and other data collection materials for this component of the study can be found in Appendix D. Data Collection On May 1, 1992, we mailed a cover letter, questionnaire, and prepaid return envelope to school district drug prevention coordinators in each of the 500 selected school districts. The cover letter included a brief statement of study objectives, information on how the data would be used, and confidentiality assurances.=20 Approximately 2 weeks after the initial mailing, we sent postcards to coordinators who had not responded. The postcard asked if the initial packet had been received, reminded the coordinator of the importance of the study, and offered the RTI toll-free number in case assistance was needed. Upon request, we provided duplicate mailouts. Four packages were returned as undeliverable. Each of these was followed up by telephone inquiry to ascertain the correct address. We obtained correct addresses for three of the four returned packages and remailed the material. The remaining school district had recently merged with another school district. Because this merged district was already included in the sample, the duplicate was dropped. We began making follow-up telephone calls to nonresponders approximately 2 weeks after the reminder postcards were mailed. Follow-up phone calls were made by trained RTI telephone interviewers between June 2 and July 15, 1992. Interviewers encouraged coordinators to complete and return their instruments as soon as possible. Those coordinators who indicated to interviewers that they would not otherwise complete the instrument were asked to complete the survey over the telephone. The survey instrument was exactly the same for both telephone and mail administration. The final response rate was 85.6%, which considerably surpassed our expected response rate of 80%. The final sample disposition is presented in Exhibit 5.1. Exhibit 5.1 Final Sample Disposition N % Completed by phone 289 57.8 Completed by mail 139 27.8 Refused 8 1.6 No response 63 12.6 Duplicate 1 0.2 As indicated, we completed almost twice as many interviews by phone as by mail. We attribute this to several factors. First, phone surveys traditionally have higher response rates than mail surveys. Second, the questionnaires were not mailed until late in the school year; therefore, coordinators may have had end-of-the- year obligations that limited the amount of time they could spend on additional duties. Third, the part of the instrument that asked about each of the packaged drug prevention curricula was imposing; we believe that having the interviewers read these questions to the respondents may have made answering them less burdensome. Because the information gathered in this survey was not sensitive in nature, we believe that data obtained via both methods of administration are comparable. Returned questionnaires were delivered to a check-in station where they were logged in, coded, manually edited, keyed, and key verified. We implemented machine-editing procedures to verify and correct skip patterns and logical inconsistencies. We recontacted a few school district drug prevention coordinators to resolve problematic responses, such as incomplete or contradictory information. Findings Administration of D.A.R.E. The first objective of this survey was to obtain information about the administration of D.A.R.E. at the local level. This section presents findings concerning the implementation, administration, participation of teachers and the community in the D.A.R.E. program, integration and coordination of D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug prevention efforts, problems with D.A.R.E., and future plans for the use of D.A.R.E. Data from survey items asked only of the districts with D.A.R.E. are presented in this section. =20 Implementation. In the 1991-1992 school year, D.A.R.E. was implemented in 51.8%, or 222, of the school districts surveyed. Some 42% of all school districts surveyed used the core curriculum, 17% used K-4 lessons, 11% implemented the junior high school curriculum, 3% used the senior high school curriculum, and 3% used the parent curriculum. =20 Of the 222 school districts with D.A.R.E., the great majority (81%) implemented the core curriculum, around 33% used the K-4 visitations, 22% used the junior high school curriculum, 6% implemented the senior high school curriculum, and 5% used the parent curriculum. We further asked the respondents to indicate every grade in which the D.A.R.E. curricula were used. Exhibit 5.2 displays the percentage of school districts with D.A.R.E. implementing the program at each grade. Almost 70% of the districts with D.A.R.E. implemented the curriculum in 5th-grade classes, and almost 60% used it in 6th-grade classes. Thus, a substantial number of districts implemented the core curriculum in both grades, which probably reflects the different cutoff grades separating elementary from junior high or middle schools in that district. Administration. One objective of NIJ's solicitation was to ascertain what agencies usually manage D.A.R.E. and have responsibility for various aspects of the program at the local level. To address these issues, we first asked coordinators to report all agencies managing D.A.R.E. Around 81% of the districts with D.A.R.E. reported that a single agency administered the D.A.R.E. program, while 16.3% reported that two agencies and 2.3% reported that three or more agencies administered the program (Exhibit 5.3). Almost 34% of the school districts with D.A.R.E. reported that the county sheriff's department alone administered the program, and about 34% reported city/town police departments administered it.=20 We next asked coordinators to report whether law enforcement or education was responsible for various activities. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. most frequently reported that law enforcement agencies were responsible for selecting D.A.R.E. officers and determining classroom activities (Exhibit 5.4). They reported that responsibility for selecting schools to receive D.A.R.E., selecting classrooms to receive D.A.R.E., and assigning extracurricular D.A.R.E. activities were performed by education. Participation of Teachers and Community. NIJ's solicitation also requested an examination of the extent of involvement of classroom teachers. About 84% of the coordinators reported that classroom teachers were actively involved in the program. We also asked coordinators about classroom teachers' level of participation during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 21% reported a great deal of participation, 46% reported some participation, 28% reported little participation, and 5% reported no participation by the classroom teachers. =20 Exhibit 5.2 Use of D.A.R.E., by Grade Note: Based on responses of coordinators in school districts with D.A.R.E.

Most of the school district drug prevention coordinators (89%) reported that teachers remain in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 72% reported that classroom teachers integrate the D.A.R.E. message into other activities, 39% said that teachers collect D.A.R.E. homework, and 15% reported that teachers assign D.A.R.E. homework. The NIJ solicitation also requested that we examine the extent to which members of community groups (e.g., church or youth groups) participate in the D.A.R.E. program. Indeed, recent research suggests that linking school-based interventions with the larger community strengthens their effectiveness (Pentz et al., 1989; Perry & Tobler, 1992). Therefore, we asked the prevention coordinators to specify members of the community who were actively involved in D.A.R.E. About 51% of the coordinators said that parents were actively involved, 22% indicated that civic groups were so involved, 13% said that youth groups were so involved, and 5% said that church groups were so involved. Integration and Coordination. Another objective of this study was to examine the extent of D.A.R.E.'s integration and coordination with other school-based drug prevention efforts. To address this issue, we first asked coordinators to indicate the level at which D.A.R.E. was integrated with other AOD programs. About 63% of the prevention coordinators reported D.A.R.E. was very well integrated, 31% reported it was well integrated, and 7% reported it was poorly integrated. To determine whether D.A.R.E. was better integrated in some types of school districts than in others, we examined the differences in the percentages of coordinators reporting that D.A.R.E. was very well integrated by minority status, SES, urbanicity, and district size. No statistically significant differences were found.=20 D.A.R.E. was equally well integrated with other AOD programs across different types of school districts. One type of mechanism for coordinating the D.A.R.E. responsibilities of law enforcement with those of education agencies are written agreements that solidify commitment, define roles and duties, and establish sound working relationships. We asked coordinators about the existence of such agreements and found that approximately 44% of the coordinators reported that their district had a written agreement. We asked those coordinators with written agreements about the contents of these agreements. The following components of the agreements were mentioned by the accompanying number of coordinators: o the responsibilities of all parties (23 coordinators); o time (21 coordinators); o funding/fees (20 coordinators); o scheduling (15 coordinators); o curricula (10 coordinators); o schools to be offered in (9 coordinators); o grades used in (6 coordinators); o general use of D.A.R.E. (6 coordinators); o length of program (5 coordinators); o school policies (4 coordinators); o sequence of lessons (3 coordinators); o materials (3 coordinators);=20 o graduation program (3 coordinators); and o "don't know" (4 coordinators). Problems. We asked school district drug prevention coordinators to provide information concerning problems with implementing and coordinating D.A.R.E., and to suggest how the effectiveness of D.A.R.E. might be improved.=20 We asked coordinators to indicate whether there were any barriers to implementing D.A.R.E. and then to specify these barriers. Only 26% of the school district drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned any barrier to implementing the program. Some 16% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned inadequate funding as a barrier to implementation, 13% mentioned too few officers, and 11% mentioned scheduling difficulties (Figure 5.5). The two most frequently mentioned barriers were in areas over which the school system has little control (funding and number of officers). Exhibit 5.5 Problem Areas That Are Barriers to Implementing D.A.R.E. in All Schools Note: Based on responses of coordinators using D.A.R.E. (N=3D222). Next, in an open-ended question, we asked coordinators to elaborate on any problems with the coordination of D.A.R.E. The responses of those with problems were o lack of time (19 coordinators); o insufficient funding/staff (12 coordinators); o scheduling problems (9 coordinators); o officers not good teachers (5 coordinators); o difficulties getting program started (4 coordinators); o inadequate officer/teacher interaction (4 coordinators); o officer scheduling problems/absences (4 coordinators); o other officer problems (4 coordinators); and o lack of coordination between school and police (3 coordinators). Finally, we asked coordinators what, if any, changes they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective in their district, and then to elaborate on these changes. About one-third of the coordinators mentioned that there was at least one change that they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective. The following responses were the changes they mentioned: o expand to other grade levels (26 coordinators); o increase staff/officers (11 coordinators); o increase parental participation (7 coordinators); o increase funding (6 coordinators); o increase community involvement (6 coordinators); o increase teacher training and involvement (5 coordinators); o improve quality/dependability officers (4 coordinators); o increase integration with other curricula (4 coordinators); o increase time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 coordinators); o decrease time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 coordinators); =20 o increase publicity (2 coordinators); o adapt curriculum to grade level (2 coordinators); o change curricula (2 coordinators); o teach officers to be teachers (2 coordinators); o increase refresher training for officers (2 coordinators); o include D.A.R.E. as part of student assistance program (1 coordinator); o increase D.A.R.E.'s availability in rural/isolated areas (1 coordinator). Future Use of D.A.R.E. To examine whether the demand for D.A.R.E. is going to increase or diminish over the next few years, we asked coordinators about their future plans for D.A.R.E.=20 Some 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. planned to expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, and 55% planned to maintain the current level (only 2% planned to decrease use). Of the 208 school districts without D.A.R.E., 38% had not considered using D.A.R.E., 21% planned to implement D.A.R.E. in the future, 20% were undecided, 15% reported they definitely will not use D.A.R.E., and 6% had discontinued use of D.A.R.E. Further, to determine whether any particular type of school district was more likely to expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, we examined the differences in the percentages of districts planning to increase their use of D.A.R.E. by minority status, SES, or urbanicity. No statistically significant differences were found. Plans for the expansion of D.A.R.E. were fairly equal across different types of school districts.=20 National Prevalence Estimates of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs The second objective of this survey was to develop national estimates of the prevalence of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. To accomplish this objective, we asked coordinators to indicate all published drug prevention curricula used by the school district in the 1991-1992 school year. Based on previous research and discussions with school-based drug prevention curricula experts, we provided a list of 13 published curricula that we thought coordinators would mention most often.=20 In addition, we provided ample space for open-ended responses concerning other published curricula. We used this information in combination with the sample stratification variables to develop estimates by geographical area, ethnicity, SES, and urbanicity. We also asked respondents to complete a series of questions concerning grade levels and substances targeted, as well as type of teachers for each of these curricula.=20 Based on the number of school districts in our sample using the three most frequently mentioned curricula, we estimated the number of school districts nationwide using these curricula. These prevalence estimates and other findings concerning the three most frequently mentioned published drug prevention curricula used in the 1991-1992 school year are presented below. Prevalence. According to our estimates, the published curricula used most often by our respondents in the 1991-1992 school year were D.A.R.E., Quest, and Here's Looking at You. Exhibit 5.6 presents the estimated numbers and percentages of school districts nationwide using these three curricula overall and by the districts' region, urbanicity, SES, minority status, and district size. Urban/suburban school districts were significantly more likely than rural districts to use D.A.R.E.

Due to sampling variability, stratum-level estimates will not coincide exactly with the corresponding stratum counts in Exhibit A.1 in Appendix A. at You (HLY) (p<.05). Large school districts were significantly more likely than small school districts to use D.A.R.E. (p<.01). =20 Grade Levels Targeted. To determine grade levels targeted by each of the three most frequently used curricula, we asked coordinators to indicate which curricula were used in the school district at each grade level. Grade levels targeted by coordinators with D.A.R.E. were presented in Exhibit 5.2. Around 46% of the school districts with Quest targeted the program to the elementary school level, 81% to the middle/junior high school level, and 12% to the senior high school level. Almost 89% of the school districts with HLY targeted the program to the elementary school level, 55% to the middle/junior high school level, and 35% to the senior high school level. Coordinators reported that all three curricula were more likely to target elementary or middle/junior high school levels. Substances Targeted. To determine whether the three most frequently mentioned curricula differed in substances targeted by the program, we asked the school district drug prevention coordinators to indicate which substances each of the prevention curricula targeted. We found no significant differences in substances targeted among D.A.R.E., Quest, and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). All three of the packages were comprehensive in targeting all substances.=20 Exhibit 5.7 Substances Targeted by, and Types of Instructor of, the Three Most Frequently Mentioned Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs (%) Here's Looking at D.A.R.E.

Type of Instructor. We also asked coordinators to indicate who taught each of the prevention curricula. As expected, almost all school district drug prevention coordinators reported that police officers were responsible for teaching the D.A.R.E. curricula.=20 Classroom teachers were primarily responsible for teaching Quest and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). More than one- fifth of the coordinators reported that classroom teachers were also involved in teaching D.A.R.E. =20 Comparison of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs The final objective of this study was to make comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. Comparison data are presented in this section. Topics include funding, satisfaction with the curricula, support for the curricula, and adaptations to curricula. We asked respondents to report on other AOD curricula in general because it would have been too burdensome and time-consuming for them to answer each of the questions for every curricula in use during the 1991- 1992 school year. =20 We first asked school district drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. (222 of the 429 respondents) to answer a set of survey items concerning their D.A.R.E. programs only. We asked all coordinators using other (non-D.A.R.E.) AOD programs (406 of the 429 respondents) to answer an identical set of items concerning their other AOD curricula only. The respondents using both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of items. Information gathered from these matched sets of questions allowed a direct comparison of responses about the D.A.R.E. curricula with responses concerning other AOD curricula. Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. Funding. The first comparisons we examined were comparisons of funding. We asked respondents to indicate all sources of funding for the districts' D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs (Exhibit 5.8). The most frequently mentioned sources of funding for D.A.R.E. were law enforcement agencies and DFSCA education funds. The most frequently mentioned sources of funding for other AOD programs were DFSCA education funds and school district funds. D.A.R.E. programs were more likely than other AOD programs to receive funding from city/county funds, corporate donations, and individual donations. Satisfaction with Curricula. Next, we compared satisfaction ratings for each of the curricula. We asked the school district drug prevention coordinators to rate five program components as very satisfactory, satisfactory, unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory. The five components were curriculum, teaching, administrative requirements, student receptivity, and effects on students. None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. rated any of the five components as very unsatisfactory.=20 Approximately 1% of the respondents with other AOD programs rated teaching, administrative requirements, or effects on students as very unsatisfactory. D.A.R.E. was much more likely than other AOD programs to be viewed by the school district drug prevention coordinators as very satisfactory on each of the five components (Exhibit 5.9). Well over half of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated each of the components as very satisfactory. Between 23% and 35% of the coordinators with other AOD programs rated each of the components as very satisfactory. Students' receptivity was the component with the highest percentage of coordinators rating it as very satisfactory for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. =20 Exhibit 5.8 Sources of Funding for D.A.R.E. and Other Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs in the 1991-1992 School Year (%) D.A.R.E.

Among coordinators with D.A.R.E., those in high-percentage minority districts were significantly more likely than those in low- percentage minority districts to rate student receptivity as very satisfactory (p<.05) (Exhibit 5.10). Among coordinators with other AOD programs, those in urban districts were significantly more likely (p<.05) than those in rural districts to rate student receptivity and effects on students as very satisfactory (Exhibit 5.11).=20 There were no significant differences in components rated as very satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in low and high SES districts or between other AOD programs in low and high SES districts. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in components rated as very satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in small and large districts or between other AOD programs in small and large districts. Support for Curricula. We also asked the school district drug prevention coordinators to indicate how supportive they perceived the community, school personnel, students, parents, law enforcement, and civic groups to be of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs.=20 Response options for these questions were very supportive, somewhat supportive, and not supportive.=20 None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. perceived students or law enforcement as unsupportive of the program (data not shown). The percentages of coordinators who perceived any of the listed individuals or agencies as unsupportive were very small for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs.=20 Exhibit 5.10 Components of D.A.R.E. and Other Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs Rated as Very Satisfactory, by Minority Status of School District (%) D.A.R.E.

Coordinators with D.A.R.E. were most likely to report law enforcement as being very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, followed by students and school personnel (Exhibit 5.12). Coordinators with AOD programs other than D.A.R.E. were most likely to report law enforcement and school personnel as being very supportive of other AOD programs. =20 Exhibit 5.12 Individuals, Groups, and Agencies Very Supportive of D.A.R.E. and Other Alcohol and Drug Prevention Programs (%) D.A.R.E.

Furthermore, there were no significant differences in support between D.A.R.E. programs in urban and rural districts or between other AOD programs in urban and rural districts. Adaptations of Curricula. Some drug prevention curricula, such as D.A.R.E., require instructors to strictly adhere to the curricula and established procedures. Other curricula allow instructors to adapt the curricula to meet their particular needs. However, little is known about how prevention curricula are actually adapted. We asked the school district drug prevention coordinators whether D.A.R.E. or other AOD programs were adapted in any way as a result of gang activity, drug availability, the racial/ethnic composition of the district, student or community poverty, urbanicity, or for some other reason. About 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported adapting D.A.R.E. for at least one of these reasons, while about 54% of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting for one of these reasons. Exhibit 5.15 presents the percentage adapting D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula as a result of the above-mentioned issues. The most frequently mentioned reasons for adapting both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs were drug availability and student/community poverty.

Adaptations mentioned by the coordinators included: o targeting particular drugs prevalent in the area; o making adaptations for the physically and mentally handicapped; o adding more information on violence prevention; o discussing drug abuse in the home environment; o teaching students to be more tolerant of others; o discussing local drug arrests; o involving high school students as role models; o communicating with families of youth to gain familial support and ensure attendance at graduation; o taking field trips; and o omitting lessons. General Drug Policies In this final section of Chapter 5, we present information from responses to questions that were designed to examine general drug policies in the school districts. All coordinators responded to these questions regardless of whether they used D.A.R.E. or any other drug prevention curricula. =20 Anti-Drug Policies. We first asked whether the school district had a written anti-drug policy. We found that 96% did have such a policy. Student Assistance Programs. One type of drug prevention program that many schools have adopted is the student assistance program (SAP). Modeled after employee assistance programs (EAPs) in businesses, SAPs conduct such activities as screening for alcohol and drug involvement, making referrals, and developing and coordinating early intervention plans for youth with problems that could lead to substance abuse. =20 Almost 55% of the school district drug prevention coordinators reported that their districts had SAPs in place during the 1991-1992 school year. Of the 237 districts with SAPs, 51% targeted these programs to the elementary school level, 78% focused on the middle/junior high school level, and 81% targeted the senior high school level. We asked the school district drug prevention coordinators using SAPs to indicate what types of individuals were trained to participate in these programs (Exhibit 5.16). Almost 89% of the coordinators mentioned that teachers had been trained, and nearly 75% mentioned that principals and guidance counselors had been trained to participate in SAPs. We also asked the coordinators using SAPs to indicate the types of individuals who actually implemented the programs and how effective they were (Exhibit 5.17). Coordinators most frequently mentioned that teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and students implemented SAPs. However, they perceived guidance counselors, D.A.R.E. officers, and district/school nurses as the most effective at implementing these programs. Coordinators most frequently mentioned that community professionals and community volunteers were not effective.=20 Exhibit 5.16 Individuals Trained to Participate in Student Assistance Programs Individual/Agency (N=3D237) % Teachers 88.6 Principals 74.9 Guidance Counselors 74.7 District/School Nurses 49.7 Community Professionals 42.5 Students 37.3 D.A.R.E.

A total of 429 school district drug prevention coordinators responded to the survey. Data presented in this chapter were weighted to take into account the complex sample design. Over half of the school districts in the United States used D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year.=20 Additionally, demand for the program is going to increase over the next few years; two-fifths of those with the program planned to expand its use and one-fifth of these without the program plan to begin use. The two other most frequently used packaged curricula were Quest and Here's Looking at You, both used by about one-fourth of the districts. Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. Most of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported receiving funding for the program from law enforcement and/or DFSCA funds. Most of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported receiving funding for these programs from DFSCA and/or district funds. D.A.R.E. was more likely than other AOD programs to be rated very satisfactory in terms of curriculum, teaching, administrative requirements, student receptivity, and effects on students. Furthermore, coordinators were more likely to indicate that the community, school personnel, students, parents, law enforcement, and civic groups were very supportive of D.A.R.E than of other AOD programs. Around two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over one-half the coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting the program to meet their needs. The most common reasons for adaptation for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs were drug availability and student/community poverty. Most of the D.A.R.E. programs were administered at the local level by a single law enforcement agency (i.e., sheriff's department or city/town police department). In most districts, coordinators reported that officer selection and classroom activities were the responsibility of the police, while school and classroom selection were the responsibility of education. Findings from this chapter and resulting recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 6 SITE VISITS The final component of the implementation assessment consisted of site visits to school districts.=20 We designed these visits to obtain a snapshot of the organization and operations of D.A.R.E. and other school- based drug prevention programs. The site visits also gave us an opportunity to speak with the officers, teachers, and students directly and to see the D.A.R.E. program in action.=20 For the site visits, we selected four schools in three school districts. Two of the school districts were adjacent to one another in a northern inner-city environment, with a large minority population and a substantial drug problem. The third school district was located in a rural area in the South; it also had a substantial minority population but less of a drug problem. The school in one urban school district had D.A.R.E., and the school in the other urban district did not have D.A.R.E. In the rural district, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did not. Because the school districts and schools were limited in number and purposively, rather than randomly, selected, the information gathered from these sites is not representative of schools in general. We present data gathered from this component of the assessment to illustrate and complement findings from other components of the implementation assessment. We recognize the need to exercise caution in interpreting site visit findings and encourage readers to use similar discretion. For the site visit interviews and observations, we developed site visit protocols that were based on issues raised in the previous components of the implementation assessment. The protocols were designed to elicit general, open-ended, and free-flowing discussions. We used protocols instead of structured surveys because we believed the structured format would inhibit the exploration of schools' individual characteristics.=20 Further, we expected respondents would provide us with a wealth of information that a structured format might have prevented. We often departed from the protocols to follow up any line of inquiry that appeared of potential interest. As a result, the reports from our sites are in some ways dissimilar. Copies of the protocols can be found in Appendix D. =20 Site visits were conducted by two teams. Each team included at least one senior investigator with considerable experience in conducting site visits. A two-person team conducted a 2-day site visit in the urban schools, and a four-person team conducted a 1-day site visit in the rural schools. Two or more site visitors jointly interviewed key individuals, and each interviewer took notes to reduce the chances of missing key information. When appropriate, we interviewed up to four individuals at the same time. Each team conducted interviews with a variety of individuals, including o the coordinator responsible for the development and implementation of drug prevention efforts in the school district; o individuals teaching drug prevention curricula to students (including D.A.R.E. officers at schools with D.A.R.E.), o their supervisors (if any), and o teachers in whose classes D.A.R.E. officers teach (at D.A.R.E. sites). When available, we also interviewed others involved in drug prevention program planning, delivery, or referral (e.g., representatives of community advisory or drug action groups). =20 In each of the two D.A.R.E. schools, the site visit team monitored a D.A.R.E. lesson and the officer's activities in the school outside the classroom. We also observed a drug prevention lesson in both of the schools without D.A.R.E. We note that both of the classroom observations in the non-D.A.R.E. schools were conducted in special education classes. The selection of classes to be monitored was based on what teacher was teaching drug prevention the day of our site visit and the discretion of the school district drug prevention coordinator. This chapter contains two sections. In the first, we discuss drug prevention programming in the urban schools; and in the second, we describe drug prevention programming in the rural schools. Within each section, we present information about the D.A.R.E. school, followed by information about the non-D.A.R.E. school. Urban Schools Urban School with D.A.R.E. The school we selected received D.A.R.E. after being on a waiting list for approximately 1 year; all 5th-grade classes and one 6th-grade class in the school received D.A.R.E. We interviewed three individuals involved in the D.A.R.E. program: o the police administrator in charge of the local D.A.R.E. program (an officer with many years of experience who had administered D.A.R.E. for 5 years); o a D.A.R.E. officer (involved with D.A.R.E. for 5 years and currently teaching 16 classes a week); =20 o the school district drug prevention coordinator.=20 The following summarizes our discussions with these respondents. =20 Administration. According to the police administrator, the D.A.R.E. program in this city follows the same procedures employed nationally. He stated that the local police, State police, and Board of Education work together to provide the D.A.R.E. program. He further indicated that this coordination has ensured the integrity of D.A.R.E.'s implementation, D.A.R.E.'s consistency with drug education required by the State, and smooth integration with other drug education initiatives. =20 Implementation. Initial steps in the implementation of the D.A.R.E. program, as reported by the police administrator, are as follows. The local police department conducts initial screening of candidate officers for the D.A.R.E. program. Potential D.A.R.E. officers are interviewed by the local police department, and then by the State police. Successfully screened candidates are sent for a 2-week training program offered by the State police. After completing the training, officers are assigned to particular schools or sets of schools by the local police department. The D.A.R.E. officer who was interviewed indicated that he is assigned a general target area and allowed to select the schools in that area in which he wishes to teach. He indicated that he and other officers are provided with a list of schools that have requested D.A.R.E. to guide their selections. He further reported that no more than 20% of the schools he selects can be private. According to the police administrator, a limited attempt is made to match officer and student characteristics. For example, he stated that in the Hispanic community, the local police department attempts to provide D.A.R.E. officers who can speak Spanish.=20 Beyond this, however, he indicated that little matching occurs. =20 The police administrator said that the D.A.R.E. program is monitored by both the State and local police departments. He reported that a staff member from the State police visits each D.A.R.E. instructor during the year to observe and assess teaching skills and students' receptiveness to the program, as well as to solicit feedback from classroom teachers. The administrator also stated that he monitors classroom activities as part of his supervisory responsibilities. According to the police administrator, school personnel are very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, in part because the program is free to the school. The schools are, thus, able to use their drug prevention resources for additional drug prevention purposes. The police administrator indicated that some teachers get involved in the D.A.R.E. program because of personal interest, but that most do not. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that although State policy requires teachers to remain in the classroom during the lesson, they assist him only in disciplinary matters. The drug prevention coordinator indicated that although teachers do not participate in teaching the lessons, they have been very receptive both to the program and the officers.=20 The coordinator noted that teachers cannot be required to allow D.A.R.E. into their classrooms, and the fact that no teacher has refused D.A.R.E. indicates the degree of acceptance that the program enjoys. When asked about problems between regular teachers and D.A.R.E. officers, the police administrator reported that although there are some individuals who do not get along, it is not a system-wide problem. The D.A.R.E. officer stated that although principals are supportive of the program, he has yet to see one in his classes, and that no other school staff participate in the program. The police administrator indicated that parental involvement generally has taken the form of assistance from the PTA in co-sponsoring D.A.R.E. graduation ceremonies. However, he stated that the level of parental involvement varies substantially from one school to another. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that in his experience parents generally do not show an active interest in D.A.R.E. According to the police administrator, the investment of the community in the D.A.R.E. program is limited. He further indicated that D.A.R.E. officers have little time to seek community involvement: "The reality is that the D.A.R.E. instructor has a full day teaching classes; there isn't time to do anythingelse."=20 The D.A.R.E. officer also reported that community groups have little participation in the program. Funding. The police administrator reported that when the D.A.R.E. program began in this city, much of the funding came from the Federal Government (i.e., from BJA through a grant to the State police). He reported that support received from the State police is currently limited to training and materials. Salaries of officers and supervisors are paid by the local police department, and limited contributions are provided by the community.=20 According to the police administrator, there is real danger of D.A.R.E. becoming a victim of budget cuts because of the current budget crisis; he indicated that implementation has already been severely restricted because of lack of resources. Curriculum. We asked the police administrator whether the D.A.R.E. curriculum was adapted to meet the special needs of his area. He responded, "We teach D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is D.A.R.E. Once you decide to use a program that is administered throughout the country, then you do not tailor it." When asked about addressing the needs resulting from gang activity, he indicated that officers incorporate their own street experiences and information they received from the police academy into the D.A.R.E. gang lessons. He reported that local gangs and their behaviors are discussed. =20 The police administrator stated that local D.A.R.E. advocates believe that classroom activity should be supported by parental involvement. He, however, did not express interest in the parent curriculum at this time.=20 The reasons he gave were that the program is still experimental and has not been evaluated, the supply of officers is already inadequate to meet the demand, and the cost of the parent program would dramatically increase overall costs (i.e., because the parent curriculum is generally offered in the evening, officers would be paid time-and-a-half). The police administrator stated that "If more money was available, this (parent curriculum) would certainly be an option the local department would look into." Problems and Improvements. The police administrator stated, "One of our major problems is that we have so few officers and so many schools." He indicated that the department tries to "keep D.A.R.E. moving through the schools" and to cover as manystudents as possible. The administrator reported that although this rotation policy maximizes the number of schools reached within the department's limited resources, it also creates problems (i.e., just about the time the school becomes accustomed to D.A.R.E., the program is discontinued and moved to another school). The administrator reported that many school officials are angry about this policy. The police administrator also indicated the need for more evaluation. He stated, "Evaluation is the only way to find out what works and what doesn't. I don't think we're ever going to find that D.A.R.E. solves the drug problem in the United States, but that it is a first step. Evaluation must be written into everything. It has taken too long for evaluations to come about." He said that he would at least like to have information on how effective the program is in suburban, rural, and inner-city areas. He asked, "If we find the program is working in a certain area, that's great, but what can we do in the other areas to enrich the program and diversify it to meet those needs?" =20 The D.A.R.E. officer mentioned several problems areas. First, he indicated that although one of his schools is heavily Hispanic, it does not have D.A.R.E. books in Spanish. Second, he stated that the program was designed for the officer to stay in contact with the school and that in his current situation, he is in and out of the school with little chance for further contact with the students. Finally, he reported the need for greater recognition of graduates of the program.=20 "Something should be done to get the parents and principals more involved so that students feel they have really accomplished something that has meaning." The only problem mentioned by the drug prevention coordinator was the need for a bilingual officer. Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade classroom of 25 students, composed of 6 Hispanics, 4 African Americans, and 15 Caucasians. Two of the students spoke limited English and needed translations of the D.A.R.E. lesson.=20 The D.A.R.E. instructor was a white male police officer in his forties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The officer presented himself to the class as a friend. The officer's teaching style was very straightforward and "streetwise," and he was bothgruff and engaging. He was very knowledgeable about the material and taught the whole lesson without notes. The interaction between officer and students was an easy, bantering one. The 40-minute lesson that we observed focused on the media and how advertisement can be used to persuade consumers and children to purchase and use different products. The lesson began with a short introductory lecture on the influences of advertising and the goals of the media. The officer then asked students questions about different products to show them how much they have learned from the media. The officer gave examples of different types of advertisements (e.g., "personal testimony," "bandwagon") and also used adsfrom magazines to illustrate his point. Most of the class period (30 minutes) was spent in interaction. =20 During the class, the students were rowdy but attentive. They called out answers to the officer's questions and felt free to make comments. The students treated the officer with genuine respect. The interest and interaction level in this particular lesson was high.=20 The classroom teacher was present during the lesson, leaving only once to go to the principal's office. The teacher sat at the back of the room grading papers; however, he had a D.A.R.E. book and followed the lesson as it progressed. Most of the teacher's input occurred in the beginning of the class before the lesson got started. The only other time the teacher spoke was to maintain discipline in the classroom, and then he only reprimanded talkers. Once the lesson was completed, the officer left immediately. There was no evidence of any outside contact with students. =20 Urban School Without D.A.R.E. We interviewed two individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. school, the drug prevention coordinator for that school district and the classroom teacher who taught the drug prevention lesson that we observed. The following summarizes the discussions with these individuals. Administration. The drug prevention coordinator reported that there is no specific drug prevention program in place. She indicated that drug prevention textbooks are used and, at times, individuals from outside the school make presentations at drug prevention assemblies. According to the coordinator, a teacher might incorporate a drug prevention lesson into a reading class or show a video. She stated, "We put together lots of little things that add up to something you might call a program, but we don't have a structured program." =20 Implementation. The coordinator indicated that each student at the school receives drug education information at least on a monthly basis. However, she reported that lower grades receive less and in a more loosely structured format. The teacher reported that he makes sure his students receive some drug prevention education every week. According to the coordinator, classroom teachers do not have specific times set aside for drug prevention, but rather fit it in when they can.=20 The seventh and eighth graders do use and follow a drug prevention textbook and have regular discussions. =20 The coordinator indicated that teachers' support for the drug prevention program depended on which teacher you were talking about. She indicated that all teachers think that drug prevention education is important, but that some are far more committed than others to incorporating drug prevention lessons into their curriculum. The classroom teacher stated that most of his fellow teachers support the school's drug prevention efforts, but that some teachers just did not know how to talk to students about issues like drugs and gangs. He stated, "Some either don't know what to say or justdon't care enough." =20 The coordinator reported that law enforcement personnel have been sporadically involved in the school's drug prevention activities and have attended local school council meetings and conducted in-service training with teachers about drug awareness. She noted that 2 years ago law enforcement officials came into the school to work with students targeted as high risk. She stated that "the success of that program depended upon whether or not the student accepted the officer." =20 When we asked the coordinator about the involvement of individuals from the community in the school's drug prevention efforts, she responded that no person from the community has been involved in implementing the school's drug prevention program. She indicated that most of the community has no idea about what the school is doing in terms of drug prevention education. She stated, "I don't think the community feels that it is their place to be involved." =20 Funding. According to the drug prevention coordinator, there were virtually no drug prevention activities until the school began receiving money specifically designated for drug prevention education (DFSCA) about 3 or 4 years ago. She reported that the school was currently in its third year of receiving DFSCA funds and that the amount of funding had steadily increased over those years. She noted, however, that this funding cannot be counted on from year to year, and it is difficult for the school to make long-term plans.=20 According to the coordinator, the lack of resources prevents consistency in the school's drug prevention program. =20 Curriculum. The drug prevention coordinator indicated that although all drugs are covered by their drug prevention efforts, alcohol is targeted. The coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that alcohol is the most widely abused drug among children and adults in their community. The teacher indicated that he spends a great deal of time on this issue and that he spends more time teaching students about self-esteem and resisting peer pressure than teaching specifically about drugs. The classroom teacher stated it is a mistake to spend too much time educating students about the types of drugs and their effects unless a strong foundation of self-esteem has first been created. When we asked whether the school drug prevention program had been adapted to meet the needs of ethnic minorities, the coordinator indicated that stereotypes about who is on drugs and who is selling drugs are reflected in the materials she has purchased; that is, many of the pictures are of minorities. If anything, she felt that white suburbs would have to work more with adapting materials to fit their population. The classroom teacher indicated that he was aware of the cultural diversity in his school and addressed it on an individual basis with students and their parents. The teacher expressed frustration about the difficulty of teaching drug prevention when many of the students live in homes where the norm is to "drink heavily and abuse family members." =20 Problems and Improvements. The drug prevention coordinator said that in the future she would like to purchase a packaged curriculum=FEpossibly D.A.R.E. She indicated that she did not know very much about D.A.R.E., but would like information about how to get the program.=20 One negative factor she reported having heard about D.A.R.E. is that there is a long waiting list for the program. She stated, "When you first called and asked if we had D.A.R.E., I got excited and thought that someone was going to give us D.A.R.E.; I don't really know what D.A.R.E. is, but I assume that because it is in other schools, it is good."=20 The drug prevention coordinator also indicated that she would like to increase the amount and consistency of delivery of the drug prevention education program, and to bring greater structure to. The coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that they want to have the drug prevention program administered by one person who would come in and take responsibility for the program. =20 Classroom Observation. We observed a special education class of 22 students. It was a remedial class comprising 14 Hispanics, 6 African Americans, and 2 Caucasians. There were 12 girls and 10 boys. =20 The teacher was a white man in his forties, dressed in a suit and tie. He encouraged the students and drew on their strengths. He often called on students who would not otherwise volunteer answers and helped them formulate answers. When an answer was not exactly correct, he encouraged the student to think further about the question asked. The teacher carefully and adequately answered students' questions. The topic of the observed lesson concerned the functioning of the lung and heart. This was a lesson designed to provide students with background information about the human body, before the impact of drugs on the body's major organs were discussed. The teacher followed the textbook closely. Because the students were slow learners, he altered the lesson slightly by asking the students to read sections aloud and then immediately asking questions about the section just covered. Most students appeared interested in the lesson. They followed along in the textbook and answered questions with sincerity. A few students consistently put their hands up to answer questions, but most were quiet. There were no discipline problems during the class. After class, we asked the teacher whether he ever used group discussions. He reported that this group of students was too remedial to use a discussion format. =20 Rural Schools Rural School with D.A.R.E. The D.A.R.E. program in the rural district employed four D.A.R.E. officers. We interviewed five individuals, including: o the police administrator in charge of the D.A.R.E. program, o a D.A.R.E. officer, o the school district drug prevention coordinator, o the school guidance counselor, and o the teacher in whose class the D.A.R.E. officer taught. The following summarizes our discussions with these respondents. Administration. The police administrator indicated that the D.A.R.E. program was administered by the city police department. He reported that this was the first semester that D.A.R.E. had been offered in this particular school. He stated that the agreement between the school and police department is informal. Implementation. The police administrator reported that the initial steps in implementing the D.A.R.E. program include selection of a D.A.R.E. officer by the local police department, approval of the officer by the State police, and training for the officer at a D.A.R.E. training course. The officer reported that there are no problems coordinating D.A.R.E. activities. He stated that there is "eagerness from all sides to make the programwork."=20 According to the officer, some classroom teachers participate in the lesson, but most do not. He further indicated that much of the time students are just as receptive without the teacher present. The D.A.R.E. officer indicated that parents are becoming more involved in the program. He stated that they are very interested and supportive of D.A.R.E., and that his attendance at nonclassroom school functions, such as Friday night dances, has greatly improved his relationships with parents. He reported that he hopes to receive training on the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum as soon as possible. According to the officer and the police administrator, there was little community involvement.=20 They attributed this to the program being new and hoped that there would be more community involvement in the coming semesters. However, the coordinator did report that D.A.R.E. is well received by the "educated" community. He indicated that churches in the community have not been particularly receptive and simply do not want to get involved. The coordinator and the guidance counselor saw the lack of involvement by churches as a loss to the program. According to the school counselor, students' attitudes toward police had changed considerably since the D.A.R.E. lessons began. She stated that "students now see the officer as a friend instead of someone to avoid." Funding. The police administrator reported that the police department funds the salary of the D.A.R.E. officer, while the school pays any costs for the curriculum (i.e., books, materials). The school district coordinator indicated that the school did not have the funds to purchase D.A.R.E. T-shirts and related paraphernalia. He further stated that the district is seeking a State grant for additional supplies. Curriculum. The guidance counselor reported that D.A.R.E. classes are a "wonderful way of teaching students to say no" and that the self-esteem modules are particularly valuable and effective. According to the district coordinator, D.A.R.E. complements all their other drug prevention programs, but that unfortunately there was little coordination between different curricula.=20 The D.A.R.E. officer reported that he does not target the curriculum to any particular substances and does not adapt the curriculum to specific ethnic needs.=20 He indicated that he does teach the gang lesson (as do most D.A.R.E. officers in the State), even though in this community there is little gang activity. Problems and Improvements. The guidance counselor indicated that she would like the school to provide D.A.R.E. in all classrooms in grades 5 through 7. The guidance counselor and the classroom teacher indicated the need for the school to offer D.A.R.E. or some other drug prevention education at earlier grade levels.=20 According to the counselor, "Trying to teach drug prevention education in high school is futile." The classroom teacher indicated that D.A.R.E. and other programs need to focus more on at-risk children.=20 She indicated that there are some 15- and 16-year-olds still in the 6th grade. She reported that these students usually have poor attendance records, are poorly motivated, and are frequently in trouble. She stated that current prevention programs, including D.A.R.E., are not adequately meeting the needs of these students.=20 The district coordinator indicated that one problem has been the lack of ongoing evaluations of D.A.R.E. Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade class of 22 students, 12 boys and 10 girls. Twenty students were African American, and two students were Caucasian. The D.A.R.E. officer was a white man in his thirties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The officer presented himself as a "big brother,"someone whom the students could seek out if they needed guidance or assistance. The officer brought the D.A.R.E. mascot-- the D.A.R.E. bear--with him to class. The lesson that we observed focused on alternatives to drug use. The officer discussed how athletics could be used as an alternative to drug involvement. He used examples of well-known, drug-free athletes. The officer encouraged students to ask questions. He also used a "D.A.R.E. question box." In the previous week,students had been asked to write questions for the officer and place them in the box. During the lesson, he drew a question from the box and answered that question. For the remainder of the lesson, the officer took the students outside to play games to illustrate alternatives to drug use. He also involved the school's gym teacher in supervising the games. During the class, students were interested and inquisitive. They seemed to feel free to ask the officer questions. There were no disciplinary problems. The classroom teacher remained present during most of the lesson, sitting at the back of the room and grading papers. =20 The officer seemed to spend a great deal of time in the school. After the lesson was over, he talked to students in the hallway. Indeed, almost all students seemed to know him. When an emergency occurred (a student fell and broke his arm) and the principal was not present, the staff sought the officer's assistance. This was not the first such occurrence, and we learned that the school staff relied frequently upon the D.A.R.E. officer to act as a sort of assistant principal.=20 Clearly, he was viewed as an integral--and important-- part of the school staff. Rural School Without D.A.R.E. We interviewed four individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. school, including the school district drug prevention coordinator (who was the same for both rural schools), the supervisor of health services, and two members of a local advisory board for substance abuse. The following summarizes discussions with these individuals. Administration. Coordination of the drug prevention efforts in the observed non-D.A.R.E. school and other such schools in the community rests with the school district drug prevention coordinator. He indicated that there are a variety of programs currently available to schools but that implementation and coordination are sporadic. Implementation. According to the coordinator, parents in this school are becoming more aware of the drug problem and are beginning to ask what they can do to get involved. He stated that many parents are realizing that they cannot "send their kids to school to get fixed," and so are starting to take responsibility for their children's problems. He also indicated that school personnel are becoming more involved.=20 Funding. According to the district coordinator, the school receives most of its drug prevention funds from DFSCA. He also indicated funds were provided by the school board and a local university, as well as the Indian Education Act. These latter resources, however, could only be spent on programs delivered to Native American children. Curriculum. According to the coordinator, a variety of curricula are available to teachers at this school, but not all teachers use the same curriculum, and some do not provide drug prevention education at all.=20 The coordinator reported that Here's Looking at You 2000 is one package available to teachers in this school.=20 However, he indicated that only about half the teachers had been trained to teach this program. The advisory board members informed us of a community drug abuse treatment program currently in use in this and other area schools that follows the"12-step" model. This program offers intervention, education, and prevention to youth who have been suspended for substance use, as well as to their families. One board member stated that suspended youth must attend this program before returning to school. The coordinator indicated that the SAP is just now being implemented in this school. The health supervisor reported that the school also sponsors Red Ribbon week, a program sponsored by the National Federation of Parents that invites youth and community members to pledge their support for drug-free lives by displaying red ribbons. Problems and Improvements. All individuals interviewed indicated the need for greater coordination between the different types of drug prevention programs, as well as assessments of drug prevention efforts. The coordinator reported that he would like to have someone responsible for the delivery of drug prevention programs in the school and someone responsible for evaluation. He said that "a lot of people are working very hard, but have little idea of whether or not their efforts are successful." The coordinator indicated that time is also a major problem in the delivery of drug prevention education. He stated that preparing students for end of the year testing takes up most of the classroom teachers' time and allows them little time to teach drug prevention. Classroom Observation. We observed a 5th grade class of three girls and seven boys. This was a class for exceptional children that included students with emotional and behavioral problems. Five of the students were Caucasian, three were African-American, and two were Native American. The instructor was an African-American woman in her twenties. She used an approachable and upbeat teaching style. She was careful to include all of the students in the lesson. Because this was a class for exceptional children, the teacher tailored the drug lesson to the students.=20 The teacher drew her lesson from health textbooks used in regular classes. The lesson lasted approximately 1 hour.=20 The teacher indicated that the length of the class and how much time she spends on the drug lesson generally depends both on her assessment of how much of the lesson the students are absorbing and their interest level. She indicated that drug prevention lessons are usually taught two or three times a week. The observed lesson was about learning how to make healthy choices. Topics included why people smoke and use drugs, how magazine advertisements promote smoking and drinking, and the differences between drugs that are helpful and harmful. The teacher covered a wide range of concepts, including how self-esteem and peer pressure contribute to drug use, the importance of reading warning labels on medications, and techniques advertisements use to glamorize drug use. The class format was primarily question and answer, and the teacher encouraged each student to participate. The teacher used a variety of visual aids, including charts, examples of magazine ads, and a collection of common medications that can be inappropriately used. For the most part, the students were very attentive. Most were eager to be called on and to participate in the class. The teacher encouraged participation by all the students. Summary This chapter focused on site visits to four schools in three school districts. Two of the schools were located in one rural school district; one of these schools had D.A.R.E. and one did not. The other two schools were located in adjacent school districts in an urban area; again, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did not. In both of the schools with D.A.R.E., limited participation of teachers, parents, and the community were reported. Both schools also mentioned having inadequate resources for the program. Neither school reported adapting the curriculum for any reason. In both schools, the need for ongoing, long-term evaluations was stressed. Neither of the non-D.A.R.E. schools had a specific drug prevention program. Both reported that implementation and coordination was sporadic. Both schools reported wanting one person who would be responsible for administering the drug prevention program in the school. CHAPTER 7 D.A.R.E. OUTCOME ASSESSMENT Project D.A.R.E. is a drug use prevention program with curricula targeted at elementary, middle, and senior high school students. The original core curriculum used in elementary schools is the subject of this review (a revised core curriculum will be implemented in September 1994). The junior and senior high school curricula are not included in the review because they are more recent, not as prevalent, and generally have not been evaluated.=20 Future evaluation efforts should focus on these curricula, as well as on the cumulative effects of the comprehensive program. The purpose of the current review is to assess the short-term effectiveness of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum by using meta-analytic techniques to synthesize the evaluation findings of several studies.=20 We searched for all D.A.R.E. evaluations, both published and unpublished, conducted over the past 10 years (i.e., since D.A.R.E. originated) and selected for further review those studies that met specified methodological criteria. To establish a comparable measure of effectiveness across studies, we calculated effect sizes for each study. In addition, to put D.A.R.E. in the context of other school-based drug use prevention programs, we compared the average magnitude of the effect sizes for D.A.R.E. with those of other programs that target youth of similar age. This chapter covers six topics. First, we briefly summarize the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Second, we provide some general background on meta-analysis and describe the methodological criteria used to select evaluations for the review. Third, we identify the eight studies that met the criteria and provide an overall description of these studies. Fourth, we examine the reported immediate effects of D.A.R.E., based on these studies. Fifth, we compare the D.A.R.E. effect sizes averaged across studies with the average effect sizes of other drug use prevention programs. Finally, we discuss several methodological considerations related to the evaluations included in our review that are important to interpretation of the results. Further discussion of the results is included in Chapter 8 of this report. The D.A.R.E. Core Curriculum The D.A.R.E. core curriculum is offered to pupils in the last year of elementary school, typically fifth or sixth grade. The 17 lessons in the core curriculum are usually offered once a week for 45 to 60 minutes. The lessons focus on teaching pupils the skills they need in order to recognize and resist social pressures to use drugs. In addition to information about drugs, lessons emphasize decisionmaking skills, building self-esteem, and choosing healthy alternatives to drug use. Officers use a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, group discussions, question-and-answer sessions, audiovisual materials, workbook exercises, and role- plays. Several aspects of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum suggest that it should be successful as a drug use prevention curriculum. First, the curriculum includes elements of prevention strategies generally thought to be effective, such as emphasis on peer resistance and social competence skills (Botvin, 1990; Hansen, 1992). Interac- tive programs have shown more promise than those using more traditional teaching methods (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994), and at least some of D.A.R.E.'s teaching strategies encourage role-playing and interactions among pupils. Also, the core curriculum is offered to children at the age when they are believed to be most receptive to antidrug use messages, which is just before experimenta- tion with drugs begins (BJA, 1988; Oetting & Bauvais, 1990). In addition, the program targets cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana--the "gateway drugs" thatchildren tend to experiment with first (Ellickson, Hays, & Bell, 1992; Kandel, 1975). Finally, the structured nature of the curriculum and extensive training of the officers helps ensure that the program is implemented as designed (BJA, 1988). Meta-Analysis Background and Study Selection Criteria Meta-analysis is a methodology for integrating the research findings of a body of studies (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Cook et al., 1993). The purpose of meta-analysis is to discover whether some pattern of results is discernible in a set of studies pertaining to the same research question (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Glass, McGaw, & Smith, 1981; Rosenthal, 1991). Meta-analysis differs from a traditional narrative review of studies by providing statistical techniques for summarizing the research findings from the studies. By quantifying outcomes across studies and making them comparable with each other, meta-analysis provides an objective rather than subjective basis for drawing conclusions about patterns of study results. Three basic steps are commonly followed in conducting meta-analyses (Bangert-Drowns, 1986). First, all relevant studies are collected, and some studies are selected for inclusion according to a set of a priori defined methodological criteria. Second, effect sizes are calculated for each study. Effect sizes represent the statistical outcomes of each study transformed to a common metric. This transformation allows comparisons across different scales of different outcome measures.=20 Third, effect sizes for the set of studies are averaged.=20 In addition, explanations for variability in effect sizes across studies usually are tested. We followed these three steps in conducting our assessment of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum; we did not, however, examine possible causes of differences in outcomes across the D.A.R.E. studies (e.g., differences in D.A.R.E. outcomes by the racial/ethnic composition of the study samples). The relatively small number of D.A.R.E. studies precluded this type of analysis. In selecting studies, our review focused on student-based, quantitative evaluations of D.A.R.E. that measured program effects on drug use behavior and/or other outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, such as attitudes about drug use. Evaluations that reported only subjective assessments or satisfaction ratings are outside the scope of this review. We also did not consider the results of parent, teacher, administrator, or D.A.R.E. officer surveys, which sometimes were conducted as part of the total evaluation effort. (For information about the opinions of school district drug prevention coordinators concerning D.A.R.E., see Chapter 5.) It should be noted that there are many possible D.A.R.E. outcomes of importance other than the ones we examined in this meta-analysis, such as improved school and police relations and greater trust in law enforcement among youth. We attempted to locate all the quantitative evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum conducted to date through a survey of D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs, telephone interviews with individuals known to be involved with D.A.R.E., and computerized searches of the published and unpublished literature using several data bases. The computerized data bases included ERIC, PsychINFO, and Dissertation Abstracts Online.=20 Through the combined sources, we identified 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluations conducted in 12 States and one Canadian province. The location and primary reference for each evaluation are shown in Exhibit 7.1.=20 Several of the evaluations were reported in multiple reports or papers; we generally used the final, most complete report or the published paper for our review. From the 18 studies, we selected studies to include in our meta-analysis that met the following criteria:=20 (a) use of a control or comparison group; (b) pretest- posttest design or posttest only with random assignment; and (c) use of reliably operationalized quantitative outcome measures. Quasi-experimental studies were excluded if they did not control for preexisting differences on measured outcomes with either change scores or covariance adjusted means (Tobler, in press, 1994). In addition, to ensure the comparability of results, we used only results based on immediate posttest. There were an insufficient number of long-term evaluation studies to adequately assess the longer-term effects of the core curriculum. We selected these criteria because they help to ensure confidence in the study results by removing a number of alternative explanations, other than true D.A.R.E. impact, that could account for outcomes observed. For example, the first criterion, a comparison group made up of schools and/or subjects that did not receive the curriculum, makes it possible to determine whether changes in the D.A.R.E. youth are unique to them or are shared by other youth. If youth receiving and not receiving D.A.R.E. change on some outcome of interest, then the cause is due to some other factor, such as maturation, rather than to D.A.R.E. Pretest measures (the second criterion) are neededExhibit 7.1 D.A.R.E.Evaluation Studi= es (N=3D18) Location References British Columbia* (BC) Walker, 1990 California-A Becker, Agopian, & Yeh, 1992 California-B DeJong, 1987 California-C Evaluation and Training Institute, 1990 Colorado Dukes & Matthews, 1991 Hawaii* (HI) Manos, Kameoka, & Tanji, 1986 Illinois-A Kethineni, Leamy, & Guyon, 1991 Illinois-B Earle, Garner, & Phillips, 1987 Illinois-C* (IL) Ennett et al., 1994; Ringwalt, Curtin, & Rosenbaum, 1990; Rosenbaum et al., 1991, 1992 Indiana Aniskiewicz & Wysong, 1987,=20 1990 Kentucky-A* (KY-A) Clayton et al., 1991a, 1991b Kentucky-B* (KY-B) Faine & Bohlander, 1988, 1989 Minnesota* (MN) McCormick & McCormick, 1992 North Carolina* (NC) Ringwalt, Ennett, & Holt, 1991 Pennsylvania Anonymous, 1987 South Carolina* (SC) Harmon, 1993 Tennessee Faine & Bohlander, 1989 Virginia McDonald, Towberman, & Hague, 1990, 1991 *Study selected for further review (with State abbreviation). for testing the assumption that the D.A.R.E. and comparison groups are equivalent at the outset. In the absence of random assignment, this assumption must be tested. In addition, pretest measures provide a benchmark for evaluating changes in outcome measures after program implementation. Reliably operationalized measures of the outcomes of interest (the third criterion) are important for ensuring that the constructs intended to be measured are the ones actually measured.=20 For example, for assessing outcomes related to knowledge, attitudes, and skills, we considered multiple item scales to be more reliable than single-item measures. We also examined a number of other methodological features, such as the correspondence between the unit of assignment and unit of analysis, whether a panel design was used, whether schools in the intervention and comparison conditions were matched, and whether attrition rates were reported and examined. Although these factors were considered in assessing the overall methodological rigor of the studies, no evaluations were eliminated on the basis of these criteria. Studies Selected Eight of the original 18 evaluation studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. One additional study met the methodological criteria but did not administer the first posttest until 1 year after D.A.R.E. implementation and so could not be included in the analysis of immediate effects (Nyre & Rose, 1987; Nyre, Rose, & Bolus, 1987). The eight evaluations are indicated by an asterisk (*) in Exhibit 7.1.=20 Characteristics of the studies are summarized in Exhibit 7.2. A more complete description of each study is provided in Appendix B. Each of the evaluations represented a State or local (e.g., city, school district) effort using either the entire population of schools in a locale or a convenience sample. The number of student subjects in all studies was large; each study included at least 10 schools and approximately 500 to 2000 students in the combined D.A.R.E. and control groups. Demographic information about each sample, including gender, race/ethnicity, SES, and metropolitan status, was not consistently given across studies. Based on the information available, the samples were about equally divided between girls and boys; included white, black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian-American youth, with whites usually in the majority; and represented urban, suburban, and rural areas.=20 Information was generally not given on the SES of the sample. Assignment of D.A.R.E. to intervention and control groups was by school for all eight studies. In one study, D.A.R.E. was also assigned by classroom in certain schools (Manos et al., 1986). Because the control group classrooms in that study were potentially contaminated by their close proximity to D.A.R.E. classrooms, these control classrooms were eliminated; only control schools with no D.A.R.E. classes were included. Two of the studies used a true experimental design in which schools were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. or control conditions; a third study used random assignment for two-thirds of the schools. The remaining five evaluations used a nonequivalent control group quasi-experimental design.=20 For these, assignment was based on some other criterion; if the criterion was stated, usually it was the administrative convenience of either the school district or law enforcement agency.=20 A fundamental consideration in reviewing the studies was the equivalence of the D.A.R.E. and control groups before the intervention. Because there were relatively few sampling units across studies (ranging from 11 to 63 schools, with under 40 schools in all except one study), it is unlikely that equivalence between groups was obtained without prior matching or blocking of schools, even with randomization. Only half the studies matched comparison schools on selected demographic characteristics. The majority of studies (75%), however, assessed the equivalency of the comparison groups at pretest and made adjustments for pretest differences on demographic characteristics. All studies adjusted for pretest differences on outcome measures. Exhibit 7.2 Sample and Methodological Characteristics of theD.A.R.E.

All but one of the studiesused a pan= el design that matched subjects from pretest to posttest using a unique identification code. Outcome measures used in the studies were based on responses to self-administered questionnaires. Seven of the eight studies used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; six studies reported scale reliabilities (usually Cronbach's alpha) that were generally high. Validity information, however, was rarely reported, and none of the studies used either a biochemical indicator or "bogus pipeline"technique to validate self-reports of drug use. Informing youth that their self-reports of drug use will be verified by a biological specimen (e.g., saliva) or a purported lie detector (i.e., bogus pipeline) is believed to enhance the validity of their responses (Bauman & Dent, 1982). As is unfortunately typical of school-based evaluation studies, most (75%) of the D.A.R.E. evaluations did not use a data analysis strategy appropriate to the unit of assignment. Because schools, not students, were assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, it would have been appropriate to analyze the data by schools with subjects' data aggregated within each school or to use an analysis strategy that accounts for clustered data (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray & Hannan, 1990). Six of the studies ignored schools altogether and analyzed individual subjects' data, thereby violating the statistical assumption of independence of observations.=20 The result of ignoring schools as the unit of analysis is a positive bias toward finding statistically significant program effects (Murray & Hannan, 1990). Five of the studies reported attrition rates, which generally were small. None of the three studies that analyzed attrition rates found that attrition differed significantly across experimental and control conditions.=20 In addition, subjects absent from the posttest were not more likely to be drug users or at risk for drug use.=20 Although attrition usually is greater among drug users (Biglan & Ary, 1985), given the young age of the sample, when dropping out of school is unlikely and drug use prevalence is low, these results are not surprising. D.A.R.E. Effect Sizes To assess the impact of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum on youth drug use, as well as on other outcomes targeted by the curriculum, we calculated effect sizes. An effect size (ES) is defined as the difference between the mean for the intervention group (MeanI) and the mean for the control group (MeanC), standardized by dividing by the pooled standard deviation (SD): [ES =3D (MeanI - MeanC)/ SD] (Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Perry & Tobler, 1992; Rosenthal, 1991). If means and standard deviations are not available, effect sizes can be calculated using formulae developed to convert other test statistics (such as, t or F), as well as percentages, to effect sizes (Perry & Tobler, 1992). Effect sizes are expressed as standard deviation units and may be positive or negative. A positive effect size indicates an effect in the desired direction as a result of the intervention. An effect size of 1, for example, indicates that the intervention group performed one standard deviation unit better than the control group on some outcome of interest. Although there are no clear conventions for defining "small,""medium," and "large" effect sizes in the context of drug use prevention programs, review of several meta-analyses of adolescent drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1992 ) suggests that effect sizes below .15 reflect a small effect; effect sizes between .15 and .30 indicate a modest effect; and effect sizes above .30 reflect stronger program effects. For each of the eight D.A.R.E. studies, we calculated effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to six outcomes that reflect the aims of the D.A.R.E. curriculum. The six outcomes were knowledge about drugs, attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and self-reported drug use. We calculated effect sizes using the procedure appropriate for the summary statistics reported. In all cases, we used statistics reflecting covariance-adjusted means, with pretest values as covariates, rather than unadjusted means so that any differences between the comparison groups prior to the intervention would not be reflected in the effect sizes (Tobler, in press, 1994). Where possible, we used statistics that also were adjusted for sample demographic characteristics (six of eight studies). Some studies did not include all six outcomes of interest, and some outcomes were measured by more than one indicator. When multiple indicators were used, such as two measures of social skills, we calculated separate effect sizes and then averaged them. This procedure yielded one effect size per study for each type of measured outcome. In the one study that reported only that a measured outcome was not statistically significant and did not provide any further statistics, we assigned a value of zero to that effect size. To calculate effect sizes for reported drug use, we considered only alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use; we averaged effect sizes across these substances. In a supplementary analysis, we also considered use of these substances separately. Use of other drugs, such as cocaine, was measured by some studies, but the prevalence of use was too small to produce meaningful effects. The unweighted effect sizes at immediate posttest for each outcome for each study are shown in Exhibit 7.3.=20 Several of the effect sizes are .30 or higher, although most are less than .20. The largest effect sizes are for knowledge (that was only measured by three of the eight studies) and social skills. The effect sizes for self- esteem, attitudes about drug use, and attitude toward police tend to be smaller. The smallest effect sizes are for drug use, with none being greater than .11. The higher effect sizes for knowledge compared with drug use is consistent with other studies and supports the conclusion that knowledge is easier to change than behavior (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986).

In addition to calculating one effect size for each outcome for each study, we calculated the weighted mean effect size and 95% confidence interval for each type of outcome across the eight studies. The weighted mean provides a summary measure across the eight studies that is useful for indicating D.A.R.E.'s general effectiveness with respect to each outcome. The weighted mean provides a less biased estimate than the simple unweighted mean because estimates from larger samples are given more weight. It is computed by weighting each effect size by the inverse of its variance, which is a reflection of the sample size (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). The effect size estimates from larger studies are generally more precise than those from smaller studies (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). The 95% confidence interval provides an upper and lower bound for the estimate; in 95% of samples drawn, the estimate would fall within these bounds. To calculate the 95% confidence interval, 1.96 multiplied by the square root of one divided by the sum of the study weights is added to or subtracted from the mean (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). The weighted mean effect size at immediate posttest and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome are depicted in Exhibit 7.4. The largest weighted mean effect size is for knowledge about drugs (0.42), followed by social skills (0.19), attitude toward police (0.13), attitudes about drug use (0.11), self-esteem (0.06), and drug use (0.06). The weighted mean effect sizes for knowledge, social skills, attitude toward police, attitudes about drug use, and self-esteem are statistically significant. The statistical significance of these D.A.R.E. effect sizes, however, should be interpreted cautiously because the significance may be positively influenced by the failure of most studies to account for data Exhibit 7.4 Magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s WeightedMean Effect Size (and 95% Confidence Interval), by Outcome Measures at Imme- diate Posttest clustered by school. The confidence interval for the weighted mean effect size for drug use overlaps with zero, meaning than it is not significantly different from zero. Because averaging alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use for the drug use effect size could obscure substantial differences among substances, we calculated D.A.R.E.'s weighted mean effect sizes separately for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. None of the individual effect sizes for any of the three substances from any study is larger than 0.15. The mean immediate effect size for alcohol use is 0.06 (95% CI: .00, .12); for tobacco use, 0.08 (95% CI: .02, .14); and for marijuana use, =FE0.01 (95% CI: =FE.09, .07). Only the mean for tobacco use is statistically significant. =20 The range of effect sizes, both individually by study and averaged across studies, suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective at immediate posttest in influencing some outcomes than others. The core curriculum has been most effective in increasing knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills.=20 Although some studies reported fairly large effect sizes for attitudes about drugs and attitude toward police, overall the studies show less D.A.R.E. success in influencing these factors and self-esteem. Based on these eight studies, the core curriculum has been least effective at immediate posttest at influencing drug use outcomes: alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. The small effect sizes for drug use and attitudes about drugs and police reflect, at least in part, the low levels of drug use by this age group and their already negative attitudes about drugs and positive attitude toward police. Comparison of D.A.R.E.'s Effectiveness to Other Drug Use Prevention Programs for Youth To see how D.A.R.E. compares with other school- based drug use prevention programs, we compared the weighted mean D.A.R.E. effect sizes with weighted mean effect sizes computed for similar programs. For comparison, we used the effect sizes reported in Tobler's recent meta-analysis of school-based drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). To allow the most appropriate comparisons with D.A.R.E. effect sizes, we obtained Tobler's results for only those programs, excluding D.A.R.E., aimed at fifth and sixth graders.=20 Although pupils in the comparison programs were in the fifth and sixth grade, some sixth graders were in middle school, whereas all D.A.R.E. sixth graders were in elementary school. Like the D.A.R.E. studies, the interventions analyzed by Tobler were implemented in geographically diverse areas. Also similar to the D.A.R.E. studies, demographic information was not reported across all studies. The available data suggest that the studies in Tobler's review represented both white and minority populations and included urban, suburban, and rural areas with urban areas predominating.=20 These programs are a subset of 25 from the 114 programs included in Tobler's meta-analysis. The studies from Tobler's meta-analysis are referenced in Exhibit 7.5 and listed in Appendix C. We selected Tobler's meta-analysis for comparison because it is more similar to our review than other meta- analyses of drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986). Tobler's meta-analysis and ours used similar processes and criteria to identify and select program evaluations for examination and included both published and unpublished studies. Like the D.A.R.E. criteria, Tobler selected student-based quantitative evaluations that included a control or comparison group and used a pretest-posttest sign or posttest only with random assignment. In addition, Tobler reported separate weighted mean effect sizes for four categories of outcome measures that are comparable to four of our outcome measurements: knowledge, attitudes toward drugs, social skills, and drug use. The meta-analyses differed, however, in that Tobler excluded studies that did not measure drug use and that included results from later posttests. In addition, some of Tobler's programs focused on a single drug rather than on multiple drugs as in D.A.R.E.

Overall, the D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies are highly comparable in terms of program focus, study methodology, and target audience. In assessing the magnitude of the effect sizes reported for the Tobler studies, it should be noted that the studies typically did not correct for the correlation among students in the same school. As explained for the D.A.R.E. studies, this may produce inflated effect sizes.=20 Because neither the D.A.R.E. nor Tobler studies generally made adjustments for this interdependence of observations, the net effect on the comparison of effect sizes should be minimal. The evaluation studies included in Tobler's meta- analysis are classified into two broad categories based on typical combinations of program content and program process (process describes the teaching approach, or how the content is delivered): noninteractive (N=3D9) and interactive programs (N=3D16). =20 Noninteractive programs emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional teaching approaches.=20 Activities typically are designed to increase knowledge about drugs, boost self-esteem, promote self-awareness, increase problem-solving skills, and promote values clarifications. These activities, in turn, are expected to encourage youth to make a personal decision to abstain from using drugs. Program content is usually introduced by the teacher in a didactic manner, and participatory activities often involve teacher-led discussions. Interactive programs emphasize interpersonal factors and use a participatory teaching approach.=20 Activities are designed to counter peer pressure to use drugs through developing drug refusal skills, promoting general social competencies, and correcting beliefs about the prevalence of drug use among peers. Program process emphasizes the interaction and exchange of ideas among peers, and it encourages active participation of all students in the classroom, particularly in small groups. Consistent with other meta-analyses showing that programs emphasizing social skills tend to be the most effective at achieving their outcomes (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986), Tobler's interactive programs produced larger effect sizes in all four outcome measures than noninteractive programs. Because D.A.R.E. has features of both noninteractive and interactive programs, we compared D.A.R.E. with both categories of programs.=20 The weighted mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals by outcome for the D.A.R.E. studies and the two types of comparison programs are shown in Exhibit 7.6.=20 To test whether the mean effect sizes differed significantly between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive programs and between D.A.R.E. and the interactive programs, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval around the difference between the means. If the confidence interval spans zero, this indicates that the difference between the two effect size means is not statistically significant. Conversely, if the confidence interval does not include zero, then the means are determined to be significantly different; that is, the D.A.R.E. mean is significantly greater or less than the mean for the comparison programs. The difference between the weighted mean effect sizes for D.A.R.E. and both noninteractive and interactive programs and 95% confidence intervals are shown in Exhibit 7.7. In addition, Exhibit 7.7 indicates whether the difference favors D.A.R.E. or the comparison programs.

For knowledge about drugs, the mean immediate effect size achieved by D.A.R.E. (0.42) is substantially and statistically significantly higher than the mean effect size for noninteractive programs (0.16). The D.A.R.E. effect size is lower than that of interactive programs (0.53), but the difference is not significant. For attitudes about drugs, the mean immediate effect size achieved by D.A.R.E. (0.11) is larger than the mean achieved by noninteractive programs (0.06); the difference is not statistically significant. The D.A.R.E. effect size is significantly less than the mean for interactive programs (0.33). The same pattern is observed for skills. The mean D.A.R.E. immediate effect size (0.19) is larger than for noninteractive programs (0.08) but smaller than for interactive programs (0.76). The difference in means between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive programs is not statistically significant, whereas the D.A.R.E. mean is significantly less than for interactive programs. For drug use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana averaged together), the mean immediate effect sizes achieved by D.A.R.E. (0.06) and noninteractive programs (0.08) are not significantly different. The D.A.R.E. mean is significantly smaller than the mean for interactive programs (0.18).

The D.A.R.E. effect sizes for all three substances are significantly smaller than the comparable effect sizes for interactive programs. A comparison of D.A.R.E. effect sizes with effect sizes of noninteractive and interactive drug use prevention programs for fifth and sixth graders reviewed by Tobler suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective in influencing knowledge, attitudes, and skills outcomes than noninteractive programs, although only the knowledge difference is statistically significant. D.A.R.E. has been less effective, however, than interactive programs across all outcome measures, most prominently for social skills and drug use. The only difference in effect size means between D.A.R.E. and interactive programs that was not statistically significant was for knowledge. For drug use, the average effect size for interactive programs was three times greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times greater than D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times greater. These findings suggest that greater effectiveness is possible with school-based drug use prevention programs for fifth- and sixth-grade pupils than is achieved by the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Methodological Considerations Several methodological considerations relating to the evaluations included in our review and to the approach we used in conducting our review bear on the interpretation of the results. Fundamental considerations are whether the D.A.R.E. evaluations selected for review are methodologically strong and are sufficient in number. As is appropriate for meta-analysis, we used stated and objective criteria to select D.A.R.E. evaluations for review. Because the evaluations we selected had a comparison group, administered both pretests and posttests, used quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures, we can be reasonably confident in their findings. Eight evaluations were included in the review; this is not a large number compared with the vast number of sites where D.A.R.E. has been implemented. It far exceeds, however, the number of evaluations of any other widely available drug use prevention program. Most prevention programs developed and evaluated by researchers have been much less widely implemented, and have received less scrutiny, than D.A.R.E. More important, however, when considering the adequacy of the number of studies, are the uniformity of D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content and method of delivery across implementation sites, and the consistent results found across geographically heterogeneous studies. This uniformity and consistency suggest that a sufficient number of evaluations were identified for assessment of the original core curriculum's immediate effects. Even so, we would have preferred a full set of eight effect sizes for each outcome. The immediate effect sizes for the D.A.R.E. studies may have been attenuated compared with the comparison drug use prevention programs because the control groups were not pure "no treatment" groups. As documentedby Tobler (1986, in press, 1994), effect sizes are lower when the control group receives some sort of drug education. Information generally was lacking from the D.A.R.E. evaluations on alternative interventions received by the control groups, but it is likely that most control groups received some drug education because the studies occurred after the passage of the 1986 DFSCA.=20 However, approximately half (54%) of the comparison programs used for Tobler's study also were conducted between 1986 and 1990, suggesting that they also may suffer from the same effect. Nevertheless, the lower effect sizes of the D.A.R.E. programs compared with the interactive programs in Tobler's study could be due in part to the likelihood that the control groups for the D.A.R.E. studies received a stronger intervention than did the control groups in the studies reviewed by Tobler. Most of the drug use prevention programs evaluated by Tobler are smaller-scale university research-based evaluation studies, while D.A.R.E. is a widely available curriculum. In both cases, however, the interventions were implemented by service providers and the evaluations were conducted by researchers. Even so, the intensity of efforts devoted to interventions conducted for evaluation research may be greater, the implementation conditions more optimal, and the possibility for scrutiny and control greater than would be the case for a program that is widely disseminated. Some diminished effectiveness may be inevitable once programs are implemented under real-world conditions. This could be an important factor in explaining some of the differences in effect sizes between D.A.R.E. and the comparison programs. Differences in the studies selected for our D.A.R.E. review and selected by Tobler could also contribute to the relative differences in effect sizes between these programs. The differences include the exclusion of studies by Tobler that did not evaluate drug use behavior and the inclusion of outcomes from later posttests. In addition, some sixth graders in the programs reviewed by Tobler were in middle rather than elementary school, and some programs focused on a single drug, such as tobacco, rather than multiple drugs as is the case with D.A.R.E. It is possible that these differences could decrease, increase, or not change the relative differences in effect sizes. For example, differences might have been less if programs focused on a single substance were not included in Tobler's meta- analysis. It is possible that single substance programs have greater impact on use of that substance than generic drug education programs, although study of this possibility is limited and findings are mixed (Tobler, 1994). On the other hand, differences might have been greater had Tobler excluded results from posttests beyond immediate follow-up because curriculum effects tend to decay rather than increase with time (Ellickson, Bell, & McGuigan, 1993; Murray, Pirie, Luepker, & Pallonen, 1989). The limited number of programs precluded assessment of these possibilities, as well as whether program effects differ, and in what direction, for sixth graders in elementary versus middle school. Finally, it is possible that our results might have differed if there had been sufficient numbers of D.A.R.E. evaluations and studies in Tobler's analysis to analyze effect sizes while controlling the effects of other factors. In addition to the differences between the D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies described above, it is possible that other factors may have varied across the intervention programs and associated evaluation studies that contributed to the observed differences in effect sizes. For example, substantial variation in characteristics of the students (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- experimental design) could have contributed to the differences in program effects. In other words, some of the differences in effect sizes observed between the D.A.R.E. studies and Tobler's studies could have been due to other factors than the type of program.=20 Unfortunately, these possibilities could not be tested because of the small number of studies. Further testing is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. Summary From a pool of 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluation studies identified by this review, eight met specified methodological criteria and were selected for further review. Each of these eight evaluations had a control group, administered both pretests and posttests, used quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures.=20 Effect sizes for these studies at immediate posttest, both individually by study and averaged across studies, showed that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum had strong and statistically significant effects on knowledge about drugs. The curriculum also had a positive and significant impact on social skills. The core curriculum had smaller, although statistically significant, effects on attitudes about drug use, attitude toward the police, and self-esteem. The curriculum had limited immediate effects on use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.=20 Although the effect on tobacco use was small, it was statistically significant. Weighted mean effect sizes were used to compare D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug use prevention programs targeted at same-age youth. The original D.A.R.E. core curriculum compared favorably with noninteractive drug use prevention programs, which emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional teaching methods. The original core curriculum compared less favorably, however, with interactive drug use prevention programs. Interactive drug use prevention programs, which emphasize interpersonal skills and an interactive teaching style, have been shown to be the most successful drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). Several methodological considerations should be noted in interpreting the results of this review. These include the number of methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies in our review; the purity of the control groups in the D.A.R.E. evaluations compared with those in the comparison programs; and the relative impacts of commercial programs such as D.A.R.E. and smaller scale research-based interventions; and the small number of D.A.R.E. and comparison studies available for assessing other potential explanations for differences in program effectiveness. The findings of the D.A.R.E. outcome assessment are discussed fully in Chapter 8. CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS In preceding chapters, we presented data acquired from our implementation and outcome assessments of D.A.R.E. Information about D.A.R.E.'s operations, prevalence, and effectiveness was collected from a variety of sources. Given the complex nature of the D.A.R.E. organization, it is not surprising that the findings are voluminous. Nor is it surprising that although some findings attest to the strengths and robustness of D.A.R.E., others indicate limitations.=20 This final chapter presents a discussion of these findings. In the course of this discussion, we highlight the key findings and, where appropriate, make recommendations for programmatic changes and additional research. =20 This chapter is organized into three sections.=20 Highlights from the implementation assessment are presented in the first section, followed by key findings from the outcome assessment. To facilitate a review of the study's many and sometimes disparate findings, our discussion is organized by some of the questions that guided these study components. In the final section, we attempt to synthesize the most important findings and present overall conclusions derived from the study. Implementation Assessment As discussed in Chapter 1, we conducted an implementation assessment of D.A.R.E. that had two primary objectives. These were, first, to conduct an assessment of the organizational structure and operation of representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide to learn what factors contribute to the effective implementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide and, second, to determine how D.A.R.E. is tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. To address these issues, we collected data from sources at all levels of the multi-layered D.A.R.E. institution. We presented information concerning operations at the national and regional level of D.A.R.E. in Chapter 3, State-level operations in Chapter 4, and local-level operations in Chapters 5 and 6. We obtained information from interviews with Glenn Levant of D.A.R.E. America and with coordinators and/or educational advisors from each of the five Regional Training Centers (RTCs), a review of available BJA documents, a survey of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators, a survey of a nationally representative sample of school district drug prevention coordinators, and site visits to four purposively selected schools (two with D.A.R.E. and two without). How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide, and how does D.A.R.E.'s prevalence compare with that of other curricula? One of the most important findings of this study was the extraordinary prevalence of D.A.R.E. In the 1991-1992 school year, 44 of the 50 States had State coordinators fortheir D.A.R.E. programs. Based on our sampleof school districts, we estimate that over half the districts in the country implemented at least one of the D.A.R.E. curricula in one or more of their schools. In comparison, the two other most prevalent prevention programs, Quest and Here's Looking at You (HLY), were used in at least one school in about 27% and 24% of the districts, respectively. Another important finding is that the demand for D.A.R.E. over the next 5 years is going to increase substantially. Over 40% of the districts with D.A.R.E. planned to expand its use. Of those districts without D.A.R.E., 21% expressed the intention to institute it, and 20% reported that they were as yet undecided about using D.A.R.E. Slightly over half of all school districts implemented D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum, which is targeted at 5th- and 6th-grade pupils; around 17% implemented the K-4 curriculum, 11% the junior high school curriculum, and 3% the senior high curriculum. Around 12% of the school districts used Quest at the elementary level, 22% at the middle/junior high school level, and 3% at the senior high school level. Around 22% of the school districts used HLY at the elementary level, 14% at the middle/junior high school level, and 9% at the senior high level. =20 Does the extent of D.A.R.E. implementation vary by demographic characteristics of school districts, such as geographic region, urbanicity, SES, and minority status? How does D.A.R.E. compare with other curricula in this regard? The Midwest region had the highest percentage of districts using D.A.R.E. (59.9%) , followed by the Southeast (56.8%), East (55.8%), West (48.8%), and Southwest (37.1%). Use of Quest was highest in the Midwest region (35.8%) and use of HLY was highest in the East (46.4%). Use of all three prevention programs was lowest in the Southwest region. The lower rates of program use in the Southwest can probably be largely attributed to its rural nature, and thus the greater difficulties in fielding D.A.R.E. officers to geographically dispersed schools. There were no statistically significant differences in the use of D.A.R.E., Quest, or HLY by either the minority status or SES of the school districts.=20 Urban/suburban school districts were, however, significantly more likely to use D.A.R.E. and HLY than rural districts. Further, large districts were significantly more likely than small districts to use D.A.R.E. We suspect that these findings may be attributed to the relatively greater resources available to urban and large law enforcement agencies. In the case of D.A.R.E., these agencies may be at greater liberty to free up their officers' time to teach D.A.R.E. It is difficult to determine what adjustments might make D.A.R.E. more accessible to rural and small school districts. We believe that ways of improving access to D.A.R.E. in rural and small districts should be examined.=20 For example, methods for distributing DFSCA funds to favor rural and small school districts instead of distribution solely on a per capita basis could be explored. =20 How well integrated is D.A.R.E. with other drug use prevention programs offered in schools? Neither D.A.R.E. nor any other drug prevention program can or should stand alone in a school district; instead, such programs should be integrated into a comprehensive curriculum that is developmentally appropriate and implemented at every grade level.=20 Indeed, all school districts receiving DFSCA funds must implement a comprehensive K-12 drug prevention program.=20 Even were a school district to implement all four of D.A.R.E.'s student curricula, additional drug prevention programming would still be required in the grades to which D.A.R.E. was not directed. Our survey showed that only 2% of the school districts used only D.A.R.E. and no other drug prevention program. Almost two-thirds of the school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported that the program was "very well" integrated with other prevention programs. How does D.A.R.E. compare with other alcohol and other drug (AOD) programs in terms of support and satisfaction for the programs? The school district drug prevention coordinators indicated that support for D.A.R.E. is very strong not only among students and school staff=FEwhose support the coordinators rated as very high=FEbut also among parents and the community. These ratings were also markedly higher than those for other AOD programs.=20 The responses of the coordinators also indicated the high regard in which the D.A.R.E. curricula are held.=20 Two-thirds of the school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated the curricula, as well as how it is taught, as "very satisfactory"; over three-quartersgave the same rating to how students receive it. This endorsement is all the more vivid when contrasted with coordinators' ratings of other AOD prevention programs; only one-third of coordinators with other AOD programs rated these programs as highly. =20 A close examination of these findings reveals that coordinators in districts with a high percentage of minority students were more likely to rate students' receptivity to D.A.R.E. as very high than those in districts serving predominantly white students. This finding is not confounded by the district's urbanicity or SES because comparisons between coordinators from these pairs of districts (i.e., by high and low SES and by rural and urban/surburban) were not statistically significant. =20 Of even greater importance are the satisfaction ratings that the prevention coordinators gave to D.A.R.E.'s effects on students. Almost two-thirds of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. indicated that they were very satisfied with D.A.R.E.'s effects; less than one-quarter of those with other AOD programs reported that they were very satisfied with the effects of these AOD programs.=20 Are D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs adapted to a community's particular needs? D.A.R.E. is distinguished by the integrity and consistency with which its curricula are administered.=20 During their training, D.A.R.E. officers are instructed not to deviate in any substantive fashion from the curriculum. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum allows only one modification--a gang activity lesson that can be added in schools where gangs are perceived to be a problem. Over two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over half of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported that the curriculum had been adapted at least to some degree, however modest. The most frequently mentioned reason for adaptation of both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs was drug availability at their schools. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. provided some hints as to the types of topics introduced, which included discussing specific locally prevalent drugs, drug abuse at home, and local drug arrests. During the site visit to the urban school district, we learned that some police officers incorporate their own street experiences into their lessons. The second and third most frequently mentioned reasons for adaptation for D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs were student/community poverty and racial/ethnic composition. Although we recognize that some tailoring of D.A.R.E. to the needs of a particular audience may be appropriate, we encourage fidelity to the curricula and careful monitoring of officer presentation. We strongly suggest that current procedures of notifying the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board curriculum committee of limitations in the curricula and of substantive modifications of the curricula originating from that agency be continued. Allowing officers to modify the program at will would quickly result in disintegration of the curriculum and the program. To what extent are classroom teachers and other community members or agencies involved in D.A.R.E.? The original core curriculum, which was in use when the survey was conducted, encouraged classroom teachers to remain in the classroom and to communicate D.A.R.E.'s objectives to students. However, teachers played little active part in the actual instruction. Teachers and D.A.R.E. officers together teach the junior and senior high curricula; at the senior high level, they are even trained together. According to the drug prevention coordinators, teachers in almost 90% of the districts remained in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons, and in 84% teachers were reported as "actively involved"in D.A.R.E. The revised core curriculum encourages classroom teachers to take a more active role. D.A.R.E. officers already are expected to meet for an hour or so with the classroom teachers in a brief, structured orientation and discussion. To the extent that time and resources permit, we encourage the co-training of teachers and officers at every curricular level because we believe that such training would enhance effective communication and coordination between the two.=20 =20 One of D.A.R.E.'s strengths is the active involvement of individuals in D.A.R.E., both within and outside of the school. Half of the prevention coordinators reported that school staff, other than classroom teachers, were actively involved in D.A.R.E., and almost one-quarter reported that civic groups were actively involved. This level of involvement surely makes a major contribution to the high level of enthusiasm that D.A.R.E. generates. We note that only a relatively few coordinators reported that "youthgroups" were involved in D.A.R.E. We recommend increasing the involvement of both youth and church groups as a way to reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message and to help establish anti-drug use norms throughout the school and community.=20 About half of the coordinators reported that parents were actively involved in D.A.R.E. Our site visits, however, suggested that parents tend to be rather detached. D.A.R.E.'s efforts to reach out to parents through the parent curriculum are commendable and, we hope, will prove successful. Many such efforts in the past have proved futile because the parents who are most in need of educational intervention are also the most difficult to reach and most resistant to attending meetings. One additional method to involve parents more directly in D.A.R.E. is to assign specific parent-child homework exercises that, at the very least, will open vital lines of communication between parent and child concerning drug use. A second method that could supplement the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum would be to develop a freestanding, 1-hour video. This video could be used to provide an introduction to D.A.R.E. and a synopsis of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, as to well as provide information about how to effectively reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message. It might, for instance, include advice about how to talk to youth about drugs and stress the importance of serving as a model for a drug-free life. We, thus, recommend that D.A.R.E. consider and weigh the relative merits of a variety of strategies designed to reach parents who may not respond to the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum. What role, if any, do D.A.R.E. officers have in treatment referral for students who already have substance abuse problems? An additional role that D.A.R.E. officers can undertake is to serve as members of student assistance program (SAP) teams. Of the school districts that had both SAPs and D.A.R.E., 37% had D.A.R.E. officers who had been trained to participate in the district's SAP. Most of the coordinators rated D.A.R.E. officers as highly as they did guidance counselors (and much higher than teachers) in effectiveness in implementing SAPs. We recommend that D.A.R.E. officers become familiar with SAPs in their schools and, when feasible, become involved in these programs. We also recommend that the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board establish procedures for officers to follow when their work with SAPs comes in conflict with their duties as a police officer, so that the confidentiality of youth and their parents who have drug problems may be maintained. How is D.A.R.E. managed at the national, regional, and State level, and what are the major responsibilities of the governing bodies? At the national level, all D.A.R.E. operations are overseen by D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization that bears ultimate responsibility for promoting, monitoring, and overseeing the program. In this capacity, D.A.R.E. America is assisted by a number of regional and State organizations. These include five RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the accreditation of State-level training centers and monitor the fidelity with which the D.A.R.E. curriculum is taught at the local level. Educational specialists representing the RTCs, together with staff from the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) and assisted by a Scientific Advisory Committee, also make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning modifications to the various D.A.R.E. curricula. State-level D.A.R.E. entities include chartered nonprofit D.A.R.E. organizations designed to support the program in that State; such organizations currently exist in over one-third of the States, and it is expected that they will be chartered in all 50. In those States that currently lack such an organization, there is typically a State employee designated as a D.A.R.E. coordinator. In addition, 42 States currently have developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. Updating and improving curricular materials and teaching strategies is a difficult task. We commend D.A.R.E. America for convening a Scientific Advisory Committee, and for choosing Dr. Kleber as committee chair. It is our understanding that the committee's charge is an expansive one and includes reviewing current and ongoing D.A.R.E. evaluations, and integrating relevant findings from other evaluations of school-based drug prevention programs. We recognize the constraints that D.A.R.E. faces in updating the curricula, given the considerable costs required to retrain D.A.R.E. officers appropriately. Hence, it is probably not feasible to make substantive changes to the curricula more frequently than once every 5 years, at a minimum. Another source of expertise that should be tapped as input for curricular changes is the U.S. Department of Education. Various D.A.R.E. materials encourage the establishment of strong ties between D.A.R.E. and education at both the State and local levels. At the national level, an educational consultant from each of the five RTCs make suggestions concerning the curricula.=20 However, it is our understanding that this group lacks representation from a national-level education agency.=20 We thus recommend thatthe D.A.R.E. America request anappropriate member of= the U.S. Department of Education to serve as an ex officio member, who should represent the department's extensive drug prevention program. Such an individual would be able to provide D.A.R.E. America with guidance as to how effectively to integrate D.A.R.E. into the Department of Education's comprehensive, K-12 drug prevention strategy.=20 Furthermore, the inclusion of a U.S. Department of Education staff member seems particularly appropriate as long as D.A.R.E. continues to be mentioned as a specific line item on the DFSCA budget. =20 State coordinators informed us that over one-third of the States had policy advisory boards (PABs), a proportion that may have increased in the 2 years since our survey. Because PABs can be instrumental in developing and maintaining communications and positive relationships among the various agencies involved in D.A.R.E., we recommend that all States establish such boards. The great majority of the PABs comprise representatives of both State and local law enforcement and education. Other key individuals from the community who have a stake in the success of D.A.R.E. or who could provide different and valuable perspectives on D.A.R.E. were less well represented. These include parents, members of community-based organizations, citizens-at- large, members of associations of educators, and business representatives. The latter could be particularly helpful in securing resources for D.A.R.E. We thus recommend that State-level PABs systematically examine their representation and seek ways to reach out to new and potentially useful constituencies by expanding their membership. Because of the unique partnership between D.A.R.E. and education, it is critical that State-level D.A.R.E. operations have strong ties to education at the State level. Around one-third of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported a great deal of communication with the State Department of Education, and another 50% reported having at least some communication. We also note that one State D.A.R.E. coordinator was affiliated with a State Department of Education, and that three PABs were chaired by staff members from State or local education departments. The need to improve communication with their State's education departments was mentioned by several State D.A.R.E. coordinators. One way to improve communication between D.A.R.E. and education is for State D.A.R.E. programs to retain educational consultants to act as liaisons. Two-thirds of the State coordinators reported employing such a consultant, and almost all of the States without educational consultants considered acquiring a full-time educational consultant to be priority. We recommend that all State D.A.R.E. programs secure educational consultants. In a few States, the State D.A.R.E. programs employed their own educational consultants. In most States, however, educational consultants were employed by education departments. We believe the liaison between law enforcement and education will be most effective if the consultants are based in the State Departments of Education. Ideally, to ensure a maximum level of coordination both with the State Departments of Education as a whole and with their drug-free schools program in particular, these consultants should be members of the departments' alcohol and drug prevention offices.=20 Certainly, regardless of whether the education consultants are employed by education or directly by the State D.A.R.E. program, they should seek all appropriate means to establish meaningful affiliations with State- level educational agencies. By the same token, education agencies should be apprised of=FEand take seriously=FEtheir responsibility to include D.A.R.E. representatives in planning statewide drug prevention activities. To be truly effective, education and law enforcement need to work together in a partnership at the national and State levels as well as at the local level. Educational consultants' roles may vary, but besides providing a "bridge" between the two organizations, the consultants should help ensure that D.A.R.E.'s multiple curricula fit into a comprehensive, developmentally appropriate drug prevention program.=20 Several coordinators mentioned that consultants could assist with program evaluation and with monitoring officer performance in the classroom. It may be appropriate to consider expanding the roles of educational consultants further, perhaps to provide assistance in these areas. =20 How is D.A.R.E. managed at the local level? At the local level, the majority of the D.A.R.E. programs were managed by a single law enforcement agency, primarily the sheriff's or city/town police department.=20 Officer selection and classroom activities was most frequently mentioned as the responsibility of the police department, selection of D.A.R.E. classrooms was the responsibility of the school administration and staff, and responsibility for selection of D.A.R.E. schools was shared by the police department, school administration and staff, and the school superintendent.=20 In a number of places throughout this report, we have mentioned that D.A.R.E. is a collaborative venture between a local school district and a law enforcement agency, and we have emphasized the importance of developing a positive relationship between the two from the outset. One way to foster this relationship at the local level is with written agreements that clearly state the roles and responsibilities of each. Less than half of the drug prevention coordinators mentioned that their districts had such an agreement. We recognize that some of the coordinators responding to our survey may simply not have known that a written agreement existed, particularly if they were new in their position and the agreement had been written before they were employed. We recommend that the law enforcement agencies without such agreements secure them. Furthermore, we recommend that the agreements be reviewed with school administration/ staff at least every other year. This biennial review would ensure that all parties are aware of their responsibilities and could also serve as forums to discuss issues relating to D.A.R.E.'s implementation and to develop additional ways in which the D.A.R.E. officer can serve the schools. They could also provide opportunities for the school district to recognize the officer's contribution. Another way to engender a positive collaboration between law enforcement and education is by developing close liaisons between the D.A.R.E. officer and classroom teacher. Such liaisons have obvious benefits, including providing a role model for new officers, sharing the burden of difficult classes or difficult students, and increasing the likelihood that the teacher will reinforce the D.A.R.E. message in other areas of instruction. We learned from the drug prevention coordinators' survey that classroom teachers in almost three-quarters of the school districts with D.A.R.E. now integrate the D.A.R.E. message into their other activities in the classroom, so that the program has a strong foundation in this area on which to build. We thus recommend that D.A.R.E. officers spend more time consulting with classroom teachers, both formally at the beginning of the semester and informally as the semester progresses. Topics for conversation should include both the content of the D.A.R.E. curriculum and how teachers can effectively articulate an anti-drug message. What funding mechanisms are at the national/regional, State, and local levels? At the national/regional level, funding is received primarily from BJA. The RTC coordinators mentioned the need to find permanent funding sources that will supplement Federal support and make D.A.R.E. less vulnerable to the vicissitudes of such funding. One solution to this issue is to establish or strengthen reliance on State or local support, particularly the latter. =20 The majority of State D.A.R.E. programs receive funding from BJA grants; around one-fourth of the States received funding from governors' grants, grants from other State agencies, and legislative funds. Four States reported that they received no funding for their State- level operations, and around one-third mentioned that maintaining and increasing their funding or locating new funding sources were among the most significant issues facing them. If they are to discharge multiple responsibilities for developing and managing their D.A.R.E. programs successfully, the States must have sufficient support. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board explore further the various sources of support used by the State programs, and how these have been obtained, and then provide technical assistance to those States that currently operate with either no funding or whose funding is precariously low.=20 D.A.R.E. America could perhaps play a role in assisting the development and maintenance of the STCs by providing modest grant programs to assist States. =20 At the local level, the cost of assigning a police officer to deliver D.A.R.E. is assumed by the local city or county law enforcement agency, and thus, ultimately, by the community. Only a small minority of prevention coordinators (one in six) indicated that program costs were a barrier to implementation. D.A.R.E. America assumes the costs of program curriculum materials. The coordinators also informed us that primary support for D.A.R.E. came from law enforcement, but that DFSCA funds also played a major role in supporting D.A.R.E., as did (to a lesser extent) school district funds. We note that non-D.A.R.E. drug prevention programs appear much more dependent on DFSCA funds than does D.A.R.E. Given projected cuts in the DFSCA budget, which we understand may amount to as much as 25% in the near future, D.A.R.E.'s relative lack of reliance on DFSCA funds will prove beneficial. We also note that D.A.R.E. is relatively less dependent on local funds than are non- D.A.R.E. programs, which also decreases D.A.R.E.'s vulnerability to cuts as competing demands increase ever tighter budgets. How adequately does D.A.R.E. training meet the needs of an expanding and changing program? As noted earlier, the core curriculum has recently been revised, and the new version is currently being implemented. Because of D.A.R.E.'s magnitude, curricular changes are far-reaching and, thus, expensive and time- consuming to implement. Therefore, modifications to any of the D.A.R.E. curricula must necessarily be weighed against the substantial costs associated with updating and distributing material, as well as retraining D.A.R.E. officers. Nevertheless, modifications to the curricula will need to be made periodically if D.A.R.E. is to remain on the "cutting edge" of drug prevention programming.=20 To reduce the burden on D.A.R.E. of keeping officers up-to-date with modifications to the curriculum, the RTCs should explore novel means to provide officers with curriculum and teaching updates and to provide formal in-service training on a periodic basis. One in- service training method that should be considered is the use of the Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN).=20 Because a substantial and growing number of police and sheriffs' departments are linked to this network, it could be an effective and cost-efficient means of providing high-quality in-service programming to D.A.R.E. officers around the country. Ideally, such a system should be interactive to allow for discussions between officers and trainers. Another less costly and more accessible method that could be explored is the use of videotaped programs to explain and demonstrate changes to curricula and teaching methods. Still another alternative is to use an on-line computer billboard to distribute the latest D.A.R.E. information. This method could be made available at very low cost to all police departments with computers and modems. We learned from the January 1992 D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board minutes that such a system was being developed by D.A.R.E. America and indeed may now be in place. In-service training should clearly not be restricted to teaching D.A.R.E. officers how to implement modifications to existing curricula. Such training could also serve to increase the competence of newly minted officers over their first semester. Regardless of how powerful and effective the initial 80-hour introduction to D.A.R.E. is, D.A.R.E. officers are bound to forget some of what they have been taught when, 3 months later, they are teaching one of the final D.A.R.E. lessons for the first time. One potentially useful device would be to develop and distribute taped versions of an expert D.A.R.E. officer delivering the curriculum to real classrooms, which new officers could be encouraged to review immediately prior to the first time they teach the lesson. Such tapes could serve several purposes: to reinforce the content of what should be taught, to model how the lesson should be taught, and to teach classroom management techniques. Each videotape might highlight dealing with a special problem (e.g., how to generate a discussion when students tend to be silent; how to draw out a shy or largely silent child; and how to respond when a child discloses drug use by a peer, friend, or family member). Each of these tapes should be relatively short (or they will not be viewed) but could be followed by a summary of the key points the officer should keep in mind in teaching the next lesson. The tapes would also help ensure that a primary goal of D.A.R.E. be reached-- that lessons be taught uniformly. Another training issue confronting the RTCs is the development and maintenance of STCs. As D.A.R.E. continues to grow=FEand our study has demonstrated that demand for D.A.R.E. shows no signs of abatement=FEthe RTCs will become increasingly challenged to meet the training and monitoring needs of their constituent States. The development and maintenance of STCs is critical because the RTCs cannot assume the multiple burdens of training, mentoring, and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers, as well as assisting local law enforcement in developing and maintaining effective ties with school districts. RTC coordinators indicated that training and monitoring officers already strain the capacities of the RTCs. We recommend that sufficient funding be appropriated to establish and/or maintain an STC in every State. =20 D.A.R.E. officers are not the only D.A.R.E. staff in need of ongoing training and technical assistance; several RTC coordinators indicated that many of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators have a similar need. RTC coordinators also indicated that State coordinators need support in developing lines of communication and authority with local-level law enforcement agencies and school districts, many of which have been operating with a fair degree of autonomy or have been used to dealing directly with the RTCs. It might be helpful if the RTCs brought together their constituent State coordinators at least yearly to discover and discuss common needs and concerns and provide technical assistance to the coordinators as a group as appropriate. However, the need will still exist for resources to support individual consultation between the RTCs and their respective State coordinators. As we mentioned earlier, the demand for D.A.R.E. in school districts that currently lack the program is likely to be exacerbated by the lack of available D.A.R.E. officers. Fully 60% of the school districts indicated that they want either to begin or increase their use of D.A.R.E. Some of the RTC staff indicated training may not be able to keep up with the demand for D.A.R.E. Almost 15% of the drug prevention coordinators identified lack of sufficient officers as a barrier to implementing D.A.R.E. This problem was illustrated in the urban D.A.R.E. school district we visited, where lack of available officers led to dissatisfaction on the part of school officials as officers were moved from one school to another to accommodate demand. Clearly, those communities in which D.A.R.E. is a high priority but which lack sufficient D.A.R.E. instructors should provide greater support to their law enforcement agencies to recruit and train additional officers. Further, the surprisingly high prevalence of the relatively new junior and high school D.A.R.E. curricula suggests that each community should examine the extent of the perceived need for each D.A.R.E. curriculum and develop a long-range plan to identify and fund additional officers as necessary. Any substantive curricular changes affecting what, and especially how, D.A.R.E. officers teach, should be accompanied by a determined effort to ensure that these changes are fully reflected in officer behavior in the classroom. The RTC coordinators clearly stressed the need for increasing officer monitoring in the field as well. Monitoring officers, however, is only part of the task. Adequate resources should also be made available to allow mentors to work closely with officers whose performance needs improvement. Outcome Assessment The D.A.R.E. outcome assessment, described in Chapter 7, had four primary objectives. These were (a) to identify prior studies of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness as a drug use prevention program, (b) to assess the quality and adequacy of the methodologies of these studies, (c) to summarize D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness based on this research, and (d) to compare D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs. We focused our assessment on the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is the heart of the D.A.R.E. program. We did not include the junior high school, senior high school, and other D.A.R.E. curricula in the outcome assessment because they are more recent, not as prevalent, and generally have yet to be evaluated.=20 Future evaluation efforts should focus on these curricula, as well as on the revised core curriculum implemented in September 1994. Questions that guided the outcome assessment are discussed in this section. What were the scope, reliability, and technical quality of the D.A.R.E. assessments? A number of States and smaller localities have been actively involved in assessing the D.A.R.E. core curriculum since 1983, when the program was initiated in Los Angeles. By using multiple sources to identify studies, we obtained reports of 18 outcome studies in twelve States and one Canadian province. These studies collected data from students concerning D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness in influencing outcomes the curriculum seeks to change. We defined a set of methodological criteria to use in assessing the quality and adequacy of the study methodologies. The criteria, based on review of the evaluation methodology literature, were (a) that the study compared students who received D.A.R.E. to students in a control or comparison group who did not receive D.A.R.E.; (b) that outcomes of interest, such as drug use, were measured both before D.A.R.E. was implemented and after the program ended; (c) that measures of the outcomes were constructed so as to ensure reasonable certainty that they were measured accurately; and (d) that in the absence of random assignment, the analysis strategy adjusted for any initial differences on outcome variables between D.A.R.E. and comparison students. Half of the 18 studies met these methodological criteria; however, one study was not considered further because the children were tested 1 year later rather than immediately after the program. That 50% of the studies were of this technical quality suggests that a high level of effort has been invested in carefully evaluating D.A.R.E. Because these studies avoid many of the problems that commonly undermine evaluation studies, reasonable confidence can be placed in their findings.=20 Some of the studies exceeded our criteria, for example, by randomly assigning D.A.R.E. to schools, by analyzing attrition effects, by statistically adjusting differences in students' background characteristics, or by using an analysis strategy appropriate to the research design. We recommend that these features be incorporated into future studies. In assessing the findings of the eight methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies, it should be noted that the studies are not a national sample of representatively selected sites. It is reassuring, however, that the findings tended to be consistent across studies, indicating that the conclusions they suggest about the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum are reliable. What gaps in the D.A.R.E. assessments merit attention? Our review of studies suggested several methodological issues that should be addressed directly and critically by future studies. These include the complete and careful reporting of the research design and results, contamination of the comparison group, the appropriateness of the analysis strategy, and the control and analysis of attrition. Although most of the studies we reviewed documented the research procedures and methods, some did not provide sufficient detail. Thorough documentation is needed for assessing and interpreting the results; information was most often lacking in the description of the study sample. In addition to the exact sample sizes of the D.A.R.E. and comparison groups, sociodemographic information such as whether recipients live in urban, suburban, or rural areas, their racial/ethnic composition, and their SES, should all be reported. This information is needed for assessing the degree to which study results may be generalized. It also can be used to test whether D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness varies by characteristics of the sample. For example, is D.A.R.E. equally effective among inner-city, suburban, and rural students and among white, African American, and Hispanic students? Almost none of the studies we reviewed made these sorts of assessments. Sociodemographic information also is relevant when making comparisons between studies (as we did between D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug use prevention programs) in order to assess the similarity of the recipients of programs being compared. An issue related to the completeness of reporting is the need for reports of research to be accessible to all those interested in D.A.R.E., including sponsors, educators, parents, police officers, other researchers, and concerned citizens. Most of the studies we identified were not reported in the published literature, and therefore are not easily accessible. It is vitally important that reports be made quickly and widely available. As we have suggested earlier, we recommend that a library of D.A.R.E. evaluation reports and associated summaries of key findings be maintained by the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. The extensive communication channels between local, state, and national D.A.R.E. entities should facilitate the prompt identification and dissemination of evaluation studies. One of the most important methodological issues raised by our review is the potential contamination of the control group by exposure to D.A.R.E. or to other drug use prevention programs. Although none of the comparison groups in the methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies was exposed to D.A.R.E. between pretest and immediate posttest, contamination was an issue for some studies conducting longer-term evaluations. This contributed to our inability to evaluate D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness beyond immediate posttest. Ironically, contamination is particularly problematic for D.A.R.E. evaluations because of the rapid dissemination of the program and because of the various curricula now prevalent for students at different grade levels. It is increasingly possible, for example, for a control group not receiving the D.A.R.E. core curriculum to receive the junior high school curriculum, effectively reducing its utility as a control group. A larger, but more subtle comparison group problem is that the prevalence of school-based drug use prevention programs in general makes it virtually impossible to find a true "no treatment" controlgroup.=20 Hence, when comparing D.A.R.E. to another drug education program, effectiveness is determined on a comparative rather than an absolute basis. For example, a finding of little difference in effectiveness may indicate that both programs are effective rather than that D.A.R.E. is of limited effectiveness or both programs are ineffective.=20 None of the studies we reviewed indicated whether the control group received any drug use prevention programming, much less provided information about it.=20 Future studies should describe any prevention interventions being delivered to the comparison group and discuss the implications for the results. An increasingly recognized methodological concern in the evaluation of school-based interventions is the importance of following an analysis strategy that is appropriate to the study design (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray & Hannan, 1990). Only two of the methodologically rigorous studies addressed this issue in the statistical analyses. When D.A.R.E. is assigned by schools, which is usually the case, or by classrooms rather than by individuals, the analysis strategy must take into account the correlations among students in the same school or classroom. This requires performing analyses at the aggregate level (e.g., through comparison of school or classroom means) or by statistically correcting for within-school or within-classroom correlations. Analyses that do not account for the correlations among subjects tend to underestimate the variability in outcomes across schools and therefore overstate the statistical significance of treatment effects (i.e., the difference between the D.A.R.E. and control schools). Because statistical significance is often used as an indicator of effectiveness, this can artificially inflate the effects and thus unfairly bias interpretation of the results. Related to this issue is the need for sufficiently large samples to provide adequate statistical power for detecting significant differences between D.A.R.E. and comparison groups. Most of the D.A.R.E. studies reviewed had large numbers of students. However, because the sample of interest, as described above, usually revolves around schools as opposed to students, it is important that sample size determinations in future studies be based on analysis of the number of schools needed in treatment and control conditions. The final methodological issue raised by our review of studies concerns the careful control and analysis of study attrition. Attrition can affect both the external and internal validity of the study. Attrition rates were usually reported in the D.A.R.E. studies selected for review. However, data on demographic and pretest differences in drug use and other predictor measures between those who remained in and those who dropped out of the study were less frequently reported. Attrition analyses can reveal whether subjects who were lost to follow-up disproportionately represent drug users or those at risk of drug use. When this is the case, it compromises the external validity of the study by limiting the population to which the study results may be generalized. When differential attrition occurs by experimental condition, for example, such that a larger proportion of drug users is lost from the intervention than the control group, the internal validity of the study is undermined. That is, the extent to which either positive or negative outcomes can be attributed to the intervention is limited. We recommend that all future D.A.R.E. evaluations not only meet, but also exceed each of the methodological criteria used for our review by addressing these methodological issues. Specifically, in addition to meeting the criteria used for this review, we recommend that studies report sample demographics, draw a sample with sufficient statistical power to detect differences in outcomes, use an analysis strategy appropriate to the way D.A.R.E. is assigned, minimize attrition, and analyze differential attrition across treatment groups. In addition, we strongly recommend the use of an experimental research design, in which schools are randomly assigned to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions. It is probably insufficient to assign classrooms at random within schools, because the activities of D.A.R.E. officers outside the classroom may affect (or "contaminate") other classes. Althoughthere frequently are difficulties inherent in using an experimental design, results from experimental studies always will be subject to fewer questions about validity than those of quasi-experimental studies. A small set of the D.A.R.E. evaluations studies we reviewed used an experimental study design and incorporated other methodological features into the design. This level of rigor is needed if future D.A.R.E. evaluation research is to contribute further to knowledge about D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness. What overall assessment of D.A.R.E. do the study findings suggest? As described in Chapter 7, we used meta-analytic techniques to synthesize and assess the findings of eight methodologically rigorous studies of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Our approach required calculating individual study effect sizes for drug use and other outcomes targeted by the core curriculum and then averaging effect sizes across studies. Effect sizes facilitate comparing and summarizing results across studies because they transform the results of the studies, which may have been derived from a wide variety of statistical tests, to a common metric. Hence, in terms of statistical output, the results of one study are comparable with those of another study. Furthermore, effect sizes are a more useful indicator of effectiveness than comparing whether results are statistically significant from one study to another. This is because statistical significance can be influenced by such factors as sample size and analysis strategy, making comparisons problematic. The magnitude of the effect sizes, when considered both within each study and averaged across studies, indicated that D.A.R.E. was most effective at immediate posttest in increasing knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills. The average effect sizes reported for these outcomes were statistically significant and larger than for other outcomes. It is consistent with other meta-analyses for the largest effect sizes to be associated with knowledge change, supporting the general observation that knowledge is more amenable to change than attitudes or behavior. Averaged across studies, D.A.R.E. also had statistically significant effects on attitudes about drugs, attitude toward the police, and self-esteem. The effect sizes were smaller, however, than for knowledge and social skills, indicating fewer meaningful changes in these areas. The smallest immediate effect sizes were for drug use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana separately and averaged together), and except for tobacco use, none was statistically significant. In interpreting the small magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to drug use behavior, it is important to note that the immediate effect sizes may reflect, at least in part, the relatively low frequency of drug use by the elementary school pupils targeted by the original core curriculum.=20 The effect sizes probably also reflect the short time interval from pretest to immediate posttest for behavior change to occur. D.A.R.E. was more effective at influencing factors believed to mediate drug use. It is most noteworthy that D.A.R.E. had positive effects on social skills because it is widely believed that children with greater social competencies are more able to resist social pressures to use drugs. Long-term impact of D.A.R.E., therefore, may result from D.A.R.E.'s immediate impact on social skills. As described earlier, few longer-term longitudinal studies have been conducted, and some have been compromised by contamination of the control group. However, based on two experimental studies for which reliable information 1 and 2 years after implementation is available, there is no evidence that D.A.R.E.'s effects are activated when subjects are older (Clayton et al., 1991b; Ennett et al., 1994). Most long-term evaluations of drug use prevention programs have shown that curriculum effects decay rather than appear or increase with time (Ellickson et al., 1993; Murray et al., 1989). Future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies should continue to assess drug use, attitudes about drug use, social skills, and attitude toward police. Drug use indicators should include tobacco (cigarettes and smokeless tobacco), alcohol (particularly beer, wine, and wine coolers), and marijuana. In addition, use of inhalants and any other drugs that are locally prevalent should be monitored. It is also important to continue to measure outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. curriculum, such as social skills, that are believed to indirectly influence drug use. This requires linking outcome measures to specific objectives addressed by the various lessons of the curriculum. These data are needed for measuring a variety of potentially important program effects other than drug use behavior, and for testing assumptions about the means by which the D.A.R.E. curriculum influences drug use.=20 For maximal usefulness, we further recommend that effect sizes be routinely reported with the study results to facilitate comparison both to the results of this meta-analysis and those of future studies. As demonstrated by this meta-analysis, effect sizes can be readily calculated from a variety of statistical tests, so this should not place an undue burden on researchers. When the results of future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies become available, they should be carefully studied and compared with the results of the studies reviewed here. As we recommended earlier, the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board could coordinate periodic reviews of the evaluations. It is likely that ongoing review of evaluation results will suggest areas where the curriculum might need modification. How well does D.A.R.E. address drug involvement by youth in general? The effect sizes discussed above indicate the extent to which the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum influenced drug use by youth and other outcomes at immediate posttest. To put the D.A.R.E. results in context, we compared D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs to determine whether D.A.R.E. had greater, smaller, or similar effects. Hence, we compared the average D.A.R.E. effect sizes for drug use, knowledge, attitudes, and skills to average effect sizes calculated for other methodologically strong school-based drug use prevention programs. We restricted the comparison programs to those for upper elementary school pupils to make the comparisons most meaningful. We compared D.A.R.E. to two broad categories of prevention programs, namely "interactive" and "noninteractive" programs (Tobler, in press,1994).=20 These two program categories cover most types of current school-based prevention efforts described in Chapter 2.=20 Interactive programs generally are the same as the social competence programs described in that chapter. These programs represent the most recent advances in drug use prevention strategies, and emphasize social competencies and interactive teaching methods. Noninteractive programs generally include knowledge and affective programs, also described in Chapter 2. These programs represent earlier approaches to drug education that emphasize changing knowledge and attitudes about drug use through more traditional learning styles. Interestingly, D.A.R.E. shares similarities with both noninteractive and interactive programs. The original core curriculum was developed when prevention efforts were in transition between noninteractive programs (knowledge and affective education programs) and the emergence of interactive programs (these emphasizing social influence). Average D.A.R.E. immediate effect sizes were greater, except for drug use, than the comparable average effect sizes for noninteractive programs. The D.A.R.E. effect sizes were smaller, however, than the effect sizes for interactive programs. For drug use, the average effect size for interactive programs was three times greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times greater than for D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times greater. Interactive programs have been shown to be the most promising drug use prevention programs; noninteractive programs generally have been shown to be less effective (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Because D.A.R.E. shares features of both interactive and noninteractive programs, it is perhaps not surprising that the effect sizes we reported should fall somewhere between. In Chapter 7, we described several methodological reasons that could help account for the differences in effect sizes between the D.A.R.E. studies and the interactive comparison programs. These included the possibility that the control groups in the D.A.R.E. studies were exposed to some sort of alternative drug education programs, whereas the control groups for the various interactive studies were not. Another possibil- ity is that because the interactive programs were primarily university research-based evaluation studies, the evaluations--and programs themselves--may have been more stringently implemented and more closely monitored.=20 Under these conditions, greater effectiveness might be expected than in real-world conditions, such as those surrounding D.A.R.E. Other possibilities include factors that may have varied across the intervention programs and associated evaluation studies that contributed to the observed differences in effect sizes. For example, substantial variation in characteristics of the studients (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- experimental design) could have contributed to differences in program effects. Such possibilities could not be tested because of the small number of studies.=20 Further testing is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. It is also important to consider substantive reasons that could account for the differences. Possible explanations include the content of the original core curriculum, the use of law enforcement officers as instructors, and the more didactic approach of the instruction. Consideration of each of these explanations suggests areas for future research and possibly for programmatic change. As we have indicated, D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content has similarities with both noninteractive and interactive programs, although it has more of an intrapersonal focus than most interactive programs and, conversely, more of a skills focus than most noninteractive programs. Perhaps greater emphasis in the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on social influences, and less emphasis on affective factors, might result in effect sizes nearer to those reported from interactive programs. However, it is difficult to speculate on the effect of altering the D.A.R.E. curriculum by adding or subtracting particular lessons. Most evaluations of school-based prevention programs have assessed the effectiveness of overall programs rather than of the various program components or combinations of components. Future research in this area might suggest particular curriculum changes. D.A.R.E. instruction offers another possible area of explanation for D.A.R.E.'s relatively poorer performance compared with interactive programs. Although instruction by police officers is the sine qua non of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, their effectiveness may be less than other possible program providers. For example, despite the extensive D.A.R.E. training received by law enforcement officers, they may not be as well equipped to lead the curriculum as classroom teachers are. No studies have been reported in which the D.A.R.E. curriculum was offered by anyone other than a police officer; examination of the results from such a study might suggest whether police officers are as effective as other possible instructors. Regardless of the leader, however, the generally more traditional teaching style used by D.A.R.E. has not been shown to be as effective as an interactive teaching mode (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Traditional didactic approaches that involve teachers delivering information, with little response from students, are increasingly recognized as undesirable. More effective are strategies that engage students in a dialogue with the teacher; more effective still are cooperative or participatory learning approaches in which the teacher serves as a facilitator or catalyst to generate discussions and other interactions among students.=20 Although some D.A.R.E. activities encourage pupil interaction, the original core curriculum relies heavily on the officer as expert and makes frequent use of lectures and question-answer sessions between the officer and pupils. In fact, it is in teaching style, not curriculum content, that D.A.R.E. differs most from the interactive programs examined by Tobler. In the revised D.A.R.E. core curriculum, there is greater emphasis on such cooperative learning experiences. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. training programs urge officers to employ more interactive methods and provide specific guidance on how they can do so. What are the intended and unintended consequences of D.A.R.E.'s approach to drug abuse prevention? None of the studies we reviewed examined consequences of the D.A.R.E. program, either intended or unintended, other than those related directly to the curriculum. However, a number of consequences can be envisioned. These include effects related to other behaviors than drug use (e.g., effects on violent and delinquent behavior). More likely, perhaps, may be consequences related to the relationship that develops between the D.A.R.E. officers and students, which may in turn have positive consequences for police and community relations in general. Research indicates that the effects on police officers through their exposure to students and the problems they face may also be substantial and beneficial (D.A.R.E. Southeast Regional Training Center, 1992). It is possible, in fact, that some of D.A.R.E.'s most important effects are related to the relations between students and police officers. The studies we reviewed provided little insight into these areas. This suggests the importance of research to explore other consequences related to D.A.R.E.'s approach to drug use prevention. Conclusion As might be expected of an institution as large as D.A.R.E., our implementation and outcome assessments present an array of findings and raise a number of issues deserving of consideration by the D.A.R.E. organization and all those concerned with this program. Perhaps most prominently, the findings show a program that has been extremely successful at placing drug education in our Nation's schools. Indeed, D.A.R.E. is now implemented in the majority of school districts in the country and is expected to grow substantially in coming years. At the same time, however, as our findings confirm D.A.R.E.'s prevalence and popularity, they also suggest that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum has not been as successful in accomplishing its mission to prevent drug use among fifth and sixth graders as have interactive programs. Review of the rigorous evaluations of the original core curriculum, the heart of D.A.R.E., showed that D.A.R.E. had only limited immediate effects on students' drug use. Although the curriculum was more successful in influencing other outcomes, such as social skills, more work is needed to make D.A.R.E. more effective as a drug use prevention program. Given D.A.R.E.'s strengths, the task of increasing the effectiveness of the core curriculum is feasible.=20 D.A.R.E. has achieved its accomplishments to date through building a complex and solid organizational structure that reaches from local to national levels, by forging close partnerships between education and law enforcement, and by winning substantial community support for the program. In no other program of this magnitude have school districts welcomed into the classroom outsiders who lack traditional educational credentials to replace teachers as instructors of a major curriculum. These resources, as well as the dedication of the D.A.R.E. officers in the classroom, should enable D.A.R.E. to move forward more effectively to meet the challenges of drug use prevention. In this final section of our assessment, we briefly recapitulate our major findings and recommendations. =20 D.A.R.E. 's prevalence. D.A.R.E. is now implemented in over half the school districts in the country and is expected to grow substantially in the coming years. Because it is least prevalent in small and rural school districts, we believe that ways for these school districts to increase access to D.A.R.E. should be examined. =20 D.A.R.E. 's organization. D.A.R.E. is at once both hierarchical and community-based. Although it is carefully controlled, monitored, and overseen at the national, regional, and State levels, it is also very much a grass-roots movement, dependent on local initiatives to form partnerships and secure support. At the State level and above, we suggest that sufficient resources be made available to support this burgeoning organization to ensure adequate authority, communication, technical assistance, and oversight. At the local level, we believe that alternative sources of support should be explored so that D.A.R.E. can be freed as much as possible from dependence on public funds. =20 =20 D.A.R.E. 's partnership with education. Law enforcement's relationship with education is the cornerstone of D.A.R.E. We believe that at all levels a variety of mechanisms could be instituted to strengthen this critical partnership. This includes improving methods for co-teaching D.A.R.E. at the local level, as well as increasing where possible the already multifaceted involvement of D.A.R.E. officers in school life. We also suggest ensuring adequate representation on advisory boards by staff of departments of education at the State and national levels. =20 Popular support for D.A.R.E. Anecdotal evidence of grass-roots support for D.A.R.E. is abundant and is fully confirmed in our study. School-based drug prevention coordinators tended to rate school staff's attitudes toward D.A.R.E. as well as those of students, the parents, and the community as very supportive. The D.A.R.E. curriculum and students' receptivity to the program, and perhaps most important, D.A.R.E.'s effects on students were rated as very satisfactory. This persuasive evidence suggests that whatever modifications and enhancements may be made to the D.A.R.E. curriculum and how the program is taught, D.A.R.E.'s organization and structure at the local level is sound and should be preserved. =20 The original D.A.R.E. core curricula. Drug prevention coordinators' endorsements of D.A.R.E.'s positive effects on students are generally not supported by the results of the methodologically sound short-term evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum we summarized. As indicated earlier, D.A.R.E. demonstrated somewhat greater effects than those of didactic school-based drug prevention methods that are based on affective approaches, but considerably fewer effects than those of interactive methods that use social influence approaches. Because D.A.R.E. already incorporates many interactive features, we believe that appropriate modifications can be made both to the core curriculum and to the way D.A.R.E. is taught that are well within the context of the institution as a whole. These modifications should be made periodically (perhaps every 2 years), as refinements are suggested by evaluations of drug prevention programs in general, and of D.A.R.E.inparticular. We comm= end D.A.R.E. for convening a Scientific Advisory Committee that comprises drug prevention specialists who will review relevant drug prevention research findings and make recommendations concerning improvements to the curricula.=20 In conclusion, D.A.R.E. represents an institution that is unique in the area of drug use prevention: a partnership between law enforcement and education that has the substantial support of children, parents, and the community at large. Not unexpectedly, along with this highly visible profile come high expectations. Our report demonstrates D.A.R.E.'s success in meeting many of these expectations, as well as challenges that lie ahead.=20 Key to the continued growth of D.A.R.E. will be careful monitoring of the effectiveness of the various curricula, coupled with the willingness to make and assess modifications that could enhance effectiveness. D.A.R.E. has already demonstrated its responsiveness to change by the introduction of new curricula, revisions to the core curriculum, and expanded roles for D.A.R.E. officers.=20 Equally important to D.A.R.E.'s viability will be its continued coordination of the roles and responsibilities of the many D.A.R.E. players. In both of these efforts, we recommend that D.A.R.E. seek to strengthen its partnerships with individuals and institutions outside its bounds. The advice, support, and perspectives of those who are not part of the D.A.R.E. structure but who are equally committed to drug use prevention will enhance the vitality and integrity of the program. We believe these efforts will result in a program that maintains its unique identity and place in drug education, while meeting more effectively the challenge of reducing drug use among youth.

Appendix B Individual Study Descriptions Brief descriptions of the eight methodologically rigorousstudies selected for the meta-analysis are given below in alphabetical order by the location of the study. The research design, sample size and characteristics, and results for drug use knowledge, attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and drug use behavior are reported. Additional information and greater detail about the study methodologies and results are available in the reports or papers issued by each study. 1.British Columbia The British Columbia evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Walker, 1990)used a quasi-experimental design in which seven schools were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and four schools with similar demographic characteristics were selected for the comparison condition. The study administered an anonymous pretest and immediate posttest; assessed pretest equivalence on some demographic variables and all outcome variables; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables by analyzing change scores at the aggregate level. The sample included 463 fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grade pupils. No information was given on the ethnic composition of the sample. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statisticallysignificant effect on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have a statistically significant effect on attitudes about drug use or on drug use behavior (use of tobacco, beer, pop, marijuana, acid, valium, wine, aspirin, uppers, downers, heroin, crack, liquor, candy, glue, and PCP). 2. Hawaii The Hawaii evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Manos, Kameoka, &Tanji, 1986) used a quasi-experimental research design in which 23 schools were assigned to either D.A.R.E. or comparison conditions. In three other schools, some classrooms were assigned to D.A.R.E. and other classrooms to the comparison condition; data from these comparison classrooms were not included in our analysis. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used some measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables. The sample included 2,009 fifth-grade pupils (not including the pupils in comparison classrooms in the D.A.R.E. schools). No information was given on the ethnic composition of the sample. Attrition was not analyzed but was approximately 6%. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statisticallysignificant effect in the desired direction on one social skills indicator (choices in a risk situation). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on another social skills indicator (assertiveness) or on subjects' attitudes about drug use. 3. Illinois-C The Illinois-C evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ennett, Rosenbaum, Flewelling, Bieler, Ringwalt, & Bailey, 1994) used both an experimental and quasi-experimental design: 12 pairs of schools serving urban and suburban areas were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, while 6 pairs serving rural areas were assigned using a nonrandom procedure. The study matched schools on metropolitan status, ethnic composition, number of students with English proficiency, and percentage of pupils from low- income families; administered a pretest and three posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted for school effects with a nested cohort strategy; and assessed attrition. The sample included 1,323 subjects who were fifth and sixth graders at pretest; 54% were white, 22% were African American, 9% Hispanic, and 15% were American Indian, Asian American, or "other." The attritionrate over the three posttests was 26% and did not differ across experimental conditions. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statisticallysignificant effects in the desired direction on subjects' self- esteem, attitude toward police, and increased use of cigarettes at immediate posttest. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude toward use of specific drugs, perceived benefits of cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived costs of cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived media influence on smoking and beer drinking); social skills (assertiveness and peer refusal skills); or on other drug use behavior (initiation of alcohol, cigarettes, or heavy drinking; increased use of alcohol or heavy drinking; or quitting alcohol). 4. Kentucky-A The Kentucky-A evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Clayton, Cattarello,Day, & Walden, 1991a; Clayton, Cattarello, & Walden,1991b) used an experimental design employing random assignment of 31 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions.=20 The study administered a pretest and three posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition. The sample included 1,925 subjects who were sixth graders at pretest; 76% were white and 21% were African American.=20 The attrition rate over the three posttests was approximately 21% and did not differ across experimental conditions. The results showed that, at immediate posttest, D.A.R.E. had statistically significant effects in the desired direction on some indicators of subjects' attitudes about drugs (general attitudes about drugs and negative attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana).=20 D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects at immediate posttest on other indicators of subjects' attitudes about drug use (positive attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), social skills, self- esteem, or drug use behavior (use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana). 5. Kentucky-B The Kentucky-B evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Faine & Bohlander1988, 1989) used a quasi-experimental research design in which 16 schools, stratified by school type (rural, inner-city, suburban, and parochial), were randomly selected among schools assigned to receive D.A.R.E. immediately or at a later semester (a delayed intervention comparison group).=20 The study administered a pretest and two posttests (immediately and one year after implementation); matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and type of school. The sample in the first year included 783 fifth-grade pupils; sample demographic characteristics were not given. Attrition information was not given. By year 2, all the comparison groups had received the D.A.R.E. program. The immediate posttest results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically significant effects in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs, attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, and attitude toward police. 6. Minnesota The Minnesota evaluation of D.A.R.E. (McCormick &McCormick, 1992) used a quasi-experimental research design in which D.A.R.E. was implemented by semester in 63 schools; random samples of D.A.R.E. participants and pupils who would receive D.A.R.E. in the next semester (a delayed intervention comparison group) were drawn. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; assessed pretest equivalence on selected demographic variables; and controlled for pretest values on outcome variables. The sample included 943 fifth graders; 62% of the D.A.R.E. group participants were white; 18% Asian Americans, 12% African American, and 7% Native American or Hispanic (demographic information on the comparison group was not given). The attrition rate was 9%. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statisticallysignificant effect in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, or attitude toward police. 7. North Carolina The North Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ringwalt, Ennett,& Holt, 1991) used an experimental research design employing random assignment of 20 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted for school effects; and assessed attrition. The sample included 1,270 fifth- and sixth-grade students; 50% were African American, 40% were white, and 10% were American Indian, Asian American, or Hispanic. The attrition rate was 9% and did not differ across experimental conditions. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statisticallysignificant effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude toward use of specific drugs, perceived peer attitude toward drug use, perceived costs of using alcohol and cigarettes, and perceptions of the media portrayal of beer drinking and cigarette smoking) and social skills (assertiveness). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' drug use behavior (alcohol, cigarettes, or inhalant use). 8. South Carolina The South Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Harmon, 1993) useda quasi-experimental research design in which five schools were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and six schools matched on demographic characteristics were selected for the comparison condition. The study administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition.=20 The sample included 602 fifth-grade pupils. The attrition rate was 13.5% in the D.A.R.E. group and 16.3% in the comparison groups. The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statisticallysignificant effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes about drugs, social skills (assertiveness), and initiation of alcohol use in the past year. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects on subjects' self-esteem, attitude toward police, or other drug use behavior indicators (previous year tobacco and marijuana use, and previous month cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use).
