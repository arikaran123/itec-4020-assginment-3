That's usually the bottomlinefor investors.But the actual annual return on your invested dollars may nevermatch the annual total returns that you read in the newspaperor even in your fund's shareholder report. Remember that yourinvestment's progress will be the result of many factors. We've prepared the following hypothetical illustration to explainthe difference between the published return and an individual'sactual experience. In each of the scenarios shown, the shareholdershad a total of $10,000 in the same hypothetical fund on the lastday of the one-year period from April 30, 1995, through April30, 1996. Yet, the actual returns on their investments variedsignificantly. To produce the returns presented below, we've used Towers DataSystems data based on the actual performance of the Standard &Poor's 500 over a recent one-year period (April 30, 1995, throughApril 30, 1996). The S&P 500 is an unmanaged index of commonstocks that is generally considered representative of the U.S.stock market. Investments cannot be made directly in this index.As you know, the stock market enjoyed a generally upward performanceduring this one-year period. The high point of the period wasreached on February 12, 1996, and the low point reached on January10, 1996. For this illustration, however, absolute performanceis not relevant, and we could have used any one-year period todemonstrate how returns vary according to several factors. Hypothetical illustration News item: XYZ Equity Fund today reported a total return of 30.14%for the one-year period that ended April 30, 1996. The calculation of this return used the same assumptions thatyour account statement, shareholder report and most publishedlistings use: That the full sum was invested on the first dayof the one-year period, that the shareholder did not add to orsubtract from the invested amount and that all income and capitalgain dividends were reinvested. The following illustrate how theactual returns earned by various XYZ Equity Fund shareholdersmight have been quite different from the published 30.14% return. The above hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposesonly and are not intended to represent performance of any specificinvestment, which may fluctuate. Today, the best measure of your investment progress is the portionof your quarterly account statement that details the change inthe total value of your invested dollars. But Kemper Funds recognizesthat you need to evaluate your investment's long-term performance,taking into consideration your individual account activity. Towardthat end, we are working on developing an account statement withannual total return figures that reflect your activity.

Total return and average annual total return are a measure of netinvestment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments,assuming that dividends are reinvested.

Diversification - investment in a variety ofmutual funds, for example - is a time-tested way of reducing the riskassociated with the often unpredictable financial markets. As a shareholder in the Kemper family of funds, you have lots offlexibility to diversify your holdings. Before taking any action,however, be sure to consult with your financial representative. (If you know your representative's e-mail address, click here to send him or her an e-mail now.) These shareholder privileges support diversification: You can exchange funds. You can move all or a portion of your sharesfrom one Kemper fund to another fund within the same class of shareswithout incurring additional sales charges (except as noted below). Fund exchanges are subject to the following conditions - and pleasenote that Kemper's exchange privilege may be modified, suspended orterminated at any time. If you exchange shares into a Kemper fund in which you do not currently have an open account, the minimum exchange is $1,000. Shares purchased by check or ACH transaction may be exchanged after they have been owned for at least 15 days. Once shares are exchanged, they must remain in the fund for a minimum of 15 days before they can be exchanged again. This latter rule does not apply to Kemper Money Funds or Kemper Cash Reserves Fund. Your exchange from shares of Kemper Money Funds into any other Kemper mutual fund will be subject to an applicable sales charge. However, exchanges of shares that you acquired through reinvesting your dividends are not subject to any sales charge upon exchange. To find out the amount of your Kemper Money Funds investment attributable to reinvested dividends, call Shareholder Services. Fund exchanges are taxable transactions. The Internal Revenue Service considers an exchange to be the redemption of shares of one fund (a sale) and a new investment (a purchase) into another fund. You can arrange to exchange an amount systematically from one fundinto another fund* each month. In order to exercise the SystematicExchange Privilege, the accounts you are exchanging to and from musteach have a value of at least $1,000. There is a $100 minimum that canbe automatically exchanged each month. You can arrange to have dividends from one fund automatically investedinto shares of another Kemper fund*. You must have a minimum balance of$1,000 in the account from which you are moving dividends and $1,000 inthe account into which you are investing the dividends. Shares purchasedby reinvested dividends are always bought at net asset value - you donot pay a sales charge. You can arrange to have a certain amount (a minimum of $50 each month)invested into a Kemper fund account each month**. Call ShareholderServices to learn more about Kemper's three automatic investment plans(Bank Direct Deposit, Payroll Direct Deposit and Government DirectDeposit). An automatic investment plan does not guarantee a profit orprotect against a loss in a declining market. * This privilege is not available to Kemper Retirement Fund Series andKemper Worldwide 2004 Fund shareholders. ** Investment may be subject to a sales charge.

Butif you have share certificates for your funds, you should knowthat your flexibility to move your shares is limited. The traditional purpose of share certificates - which was to provideproof of ownership - has been rendered almost obsolete. Today, thesecurities industry has the capability to settle trades and maintaininvestors' positions electronically. The existence of the paperdocuments and your possession of them, though, can keep you from takingfull advantage of your privileges. Some examples: You cannot redeem shares by telephone or wire transfer oruse the telephone exchange privilege if share certificates have beenissued. The systematic exchange and the systematic withdrawal plan aretwo privileges that cannot be established for fund accounts whose sharesare held in certificate form. If you want to exchange shares that youhold in certificate form, you must first return them to Kemper. Considering these limitations and the risks involved if a certificate islost or destroyed - a bond worth 2% or more of the certificate value isnormally required to replace the certificate, Kemper strongly recommendsthat you not request your shares in certificate form and that you returnany certificates you may have. Please return your certificates by registered mail to thefollowingaddress: Kemper Service Company Special Functions Department 811 Main Street Kansas City, MO 64105 Please do not endorse your certificates or sign them in any way.

(continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) October 21,1996 At present, there appear to be only three events which couldjeopardize investor confidence in the 1997 outlook. The firstrisk would be a resurgence of output growth during the fourthquarter that also revived expectations of Federal Reserve tightening.The second risk would be a surprise slowdown in the economy sosevere and protracted that it encouraged a sharp downward revisionof 1997 profit forecasts. The third risk would be a Democraticvictory in the congressional elections on a scale which gave themthe capacity to enact new legislation despite defections by somemembers of their dwindling band of southern conservatives (saya majority over 25). The dominant economic risk in the outlook continues to be thepotential for a resurgence of output growth during the next fewquarters. On the basis of preliminary data, it appears thatreal GDP growth slowed to only 1.5-2.0% during the third quarterbecause of a pause in consumer spending during the summer. Butthe economy has experienced such pauses in the past and it isdifficult to imagine the recent one being sustained when the financialenvironment is so supportive of employment and income growth.Consumer spending expanded at a 3.5% annual rate during the firsthalf of 1996 and nothing has happened during the interim to suggestit should remain subdued for longer than one quarter. The Universityof Michigan survey of consumer confidence held at 94.8 in earlyOctober compared to an average of 91.5 during the second quarterand 94.9 during the third quarter. The Conference Board surveyof confidence also held at 111.8 during September compared to112 in August and an average of 102.8 during the second quarter.Households are upbeat because of optimism about their personalfinancial situation and the labor market. In September, 26.7%said jobs were plentiful compared to 24.6% in June and 21.3% inJanuary. As a result of the stock market boom, the demand for discretionarygoods and luxuries is very robust at present. The FinancialTimes reports that the most recent issue of Vogue had over 700pages of advertisements, the highest number in over a decade.While stock ownership is concentrated among the top decile ofAmerica's population, other income groups can benefit from wealthcreation in the equity market through a declining cost of capitaland increased business investment, not just luxury goods consumption.The volume and value of equity IPO offerings this year could exceedthe 1993 record of $56 billion. Moody's recently reported thatthe number of credit upgrades during the third quarter exceededdowngrades by 80%, the highest ratio of upgrades to downgradesin two decades. There were 60 upgrades accounting for $39 billionof debt in the industrial sector compared to 14 downgrades covering$14.2 billion of debt. Consumer optimism also should benefit from the Federal Reserve'sdecision to leave interest rates unchanged at the latest FOMCmeeting. According to the University of Michigan survey of consumerconfidence, most households had been expecting a modest interestrate hike to occur this autumn. The decision of the Federal Reserveto take chances on the side of growth should reassure householdsthat the risks of recession during the next twelve months is minimal. The primary risk to consumer spending during the next few quartersis that banks will react to rising loan losses on credit cardoperations by imposing tougher quality standards on new applicantsand reducing the credit lines of existing customers. But surveysof bank lending policies suggest that they are making only modestchanges in credit access. The U.S. banking sector is currentlyenjoying such robust profits that few institutions will want tosacrifice market share by significantly curtailing lending volume.In the August survey of lending conditions, for example, 90.9%of banks said their credit policies for small business were unchangedcompared to 5.5% which said they were easing and 3.6% which saidthey were tightening. The large expansion of the U.S. trade deficit during July andAugust is encouraging many analysts to shave their third quartergrowth forecasts but the surge of imports will be partly offsetby increased inventory building. Inventories were very low atthe end of the second quarter and firms had to expand them duringthe third quarter in order to get ready for the fourth quarterretail season. If there is a rebound in consumer spending during the fourth quarter,total output growth will probably rise back into the 3.0-3.5%range from only 1.5-2.5% during the third quarter. As such a highlevel of output growth would probably push the unemployment ratebelow 5.0%, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve would respondby raising interest rates during late 1996 or early 1997. Whatremains unclear is whether the FOMC will have sufficient informationby its November 14th meeting to act shortly after the presidentialelection. If the upcoming government reports on employmentcosts and labor market conditions show further signs of wage accelerationas well as renewed job creation, the odds are high that the hawkson the FOMC will revive their demands for an interest rate hike.The demands for tightening at the late September FOMC meetingwere subdued because of Mr. Alan Greenspan's anger about the leakto the Reuters news service of proposals from eight district banksfor a hike in the discount rate. But with unemployment well below5.0% in regions accounting for 45% of the national labor market,many district presidents will continue to advocate a tighter monetarypolicy at the next FOMC meeting. At the recent IMF meeting, Mr. Greenspan assured many foreigngovernment officials that the U.S. inflation rate is still undercontrol despite the country's low level of unemployment. Buthe also qualified his statement by stressing the unusual natureof the current equilibrium in the labor market. He said thatthe traditional relationship between unemployment and wages hadbroken down because of the great concern about employment stabilityamong American workers. The obsession with job security has greatlylessened demands for pay growth compared to past business cycles.But Mr. Greenspan stressed there is no way of telling how longthis job security obsession will restrain wages in the face ofa prolonged period of low unemployment. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1024320 WT01-B14-14IA018-000197-B002-57http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/howlong2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172457 text/html 10121HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:20:57 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 30-Oct-96 15:14:23 GMTContent-length: 9936Content-type: text/html How Long Can the Federal Reserve Delay Tightening? (continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 26, 1996 According to Lindsey, the number of credit card delinquencieshas increased sharply during the past two years but the volumeof loans which is delinquent has increased by much less. Thehousehold sector has also been experiencing a sharp rise in itsasset values, not just its leverage. Since 1991, the householdsector has enjoyed a $4.75 trillion capital gain on its equityportfolio and $9.5 trillion gain on its total assets while liabilitieshave increased by only $1.5 trillion. The major risk in the debtexpansion is its concentration among lower income Americans. As Lindsey explained, "We estimate, that on average, the household sector increasedits debt-to-income ratio about 5 percentage points between 1992and 1995. This was the result of a 2 percentage point increasein mortgage debt, from 59.8 percent of income to 61.9 percentof income and a 3 percentage point increase in non-mortgage consumerdebt, from 16.9 percent of income o 19.8 percent of income." "Nevertheless, the survey does suggest some interestingtrends in the distribution of this debt. Typically, householdsearning more than $100,000 per year sharply reduced their debtlevels between 1992 and 1995. The share of total household debtheld by these households fell from one-third to one-quarter andthis decline was particularly concentrated among households earningmore than $250,000 per year. These upper income groups experienceda decline in both the mean and median absolute level of debt outstanding,while all other income groups increased their debt." "The decline in the debt levels for these groups makesthe rise in debt levels for other groups more striking. For example,households with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 increasedtheir rates of aggregate mortgage debt to aggregate income byabout one-sixth and their corresponding consumer debt to incomeratio by roughly 50 percent." "Of course, some households increased their debt substantiallymore than this, some not at all. The Survey of Consumer Financedoes indicate a striking increase in the willingness to go intodebt in the $50,00 to $100,000 income group. The proportionof survey households in this income group reporting credit carddebt rose 13 percentage points, from 51% in 1992 to 64% in 1995,compared to a 4 point increase, from 44 percent to 48 percentfor the whole population. Those holding installment debt suchas auto loans increased from 52 percent to 59 percent in thisincome group while the proportion in the overall population withthis type of debt was unchanged. Nearly 60 percent of the totalincrease in non-mortgage debt outstanding was assumed by householdsin this income group." "Debt increases for households earning under $50,000 werealso sizable. The increasing attractiveness of various typesof financing tied to one's home produced a particularly largeincrease in the ratio of mortgage debt to income. It should benoted that although the mortgage debt to income ratio increasejust 7 percentage points for households earning under $25,000,compared to 10 to 11 percentage points for households earnings$25,000 to $100,000, home ownership rates are much lower amongthis segment of the population. Adjusted for the lower levelof home ownership rates among this income group, mortgage debtto income ratios increased more for these lower income groupsthan for the $50,000 to $100,000 income group. I might add thatthe rapid expansion of mortgage financing among low and moderateincome groups is borne out by other data as well. We will notknow for some time what he overall effect of this lending willbe on default and delinquency rates." "But these data also show that while some of the addedcredit extension during this period is to people in income groupsthat traditionally haven't owed much debt, the bulk is not. Whileoverall debt levels increased for all groups earning under $100,000,the only group to increase its relative share of such non-mortgagedebt was the $50,000 to $100,000 income group. Thus, it isreasonable to conclude that the main reason for the householddebt expansion of recent years is not so much an extension ofdebt to new households, but an increase in the debt levels takenon by fairly well-to-do segments of the population to whom beingin debt (albeit not at these levels) is not an unusual experience." Governor Lindsey's testimony on the debt issue is important becausein previous speeches he has warned about the risk of leverageexcesses in the household sector. His September testimony suggeststhat consumer debt will pose risks for middle income familiesduring future recessions but that there will not be an abruptdecline of borrowing or suspension of credit access by banks largeenough to trigger a business downturn during the twelve months. The disagreements which exist in both the private sector and theFed about the economy's optimal growth rate will not be resolvablefor some time. If the economy can continue to enjoy output growthof 2.5-3.5% with no upward pressure on inflation, there will beincreasing support for the view that government data underestimatesproductivity growth as well as the economy's effective capitalstock. But as adopting such a position today would require theFed to take risks on the side of inflation without totally conclusiveproof that the economy's optimal growth rate is higher than 2.0-2.5%,it is doubtful that they will remain passive if output growthrebounds to the 3.0-3.5% range during the fourth quarter. Theywould probably tighten by at least 50 basis points during Novemberand December. The American forecasting community has a generally pessimisticview of the outlook for both output growth and the resilienceof corporate profit margins next year. In the most recentBlue Chip survey of the economic consensus, forecasters projectedoutput growth of 2.2% and CPI inflation of 3.0% during 1997 comparedto 2.4% for growth and 3.0% for inflation this year. The greatcontrast in the 1996 and 1997 forecasts centers on corporate profits. American forecasters are projecting only 3.1% profit growth nextyear compared to 9.0% during 1996. The pessimism about profitssuggests that analysts expect rising wages to come at the expenseof corporate profit margins rather than higher inflation. If the U.S. forecasting consensus is correct, the Fed should beable to fine tune another year of modest growth during 1997 withonly modest interest rate hikes or even with a stable monetarypolicy. The problem with such forecasts is that it is difficultto believe that business or household psychology will remain staticin the face of a sixth and seventh year of uninterrupted economicexpansion. If everyone concludes that the risk of a recessionis minimal, it is difficult to believe that investment plans,hiring intentions or wage expectations will remain consistentwith output growth of only 2.2% and real interest rates of 2.0-2.5%against the backdrop of an unemployment rate in the 4.5-5.0% range. As a result, the odds are high that there will be more cyclicalvolatility in the economy during the year ahead than is currentlybeing reflected in the forecasting community. Either the economywill lose momentum on a sustained basis this autumn or outputgrowth will rebound and set the stage for a monetary policy adjustmentwhich will reduce output growth to only 1.0-1.5% for two quartersduring the second half of 1997or early 1998. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1023160 WT01-B14-15IA018-000197-B002-68http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/risingbondyields2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172509 text/html 7312HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:21:09 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 13-Sep-96 20:34:02 GMTContent-length: 7130Content-type: text/html Will Rising Bond Yields Force The Fed To Tighten? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 2, 1996 As domestic final sales grew at a 4.5% annual rate during the first quarter and 4.8% during the second quarter, the optimists are far more likely to be right than the pessimists. The economy does not suddenly fade when final demand is resilient and there are no major policy shocks to depress confidence. The August purchasing agent survey confirmed that the July pause in output was temporary and there is no reason for output growth to slow during September unless there is a strike in the auto industry. As a result, the odds are high that U.S. forecasters will soon revise up their fourth quarter forecasts to the 2.5-3.5% range from the current range of 1.5-2.2%. Such revisions will then set the stage for Fed tightening of at least 25 basis points by late September. If the August employment report shows robust gains in job creation, the Fed could tighten even sooner but such a dramatic gesture will probably require the unemployment rate to drop to 5.2% or less. The minutes of the early July FOMC meeting depicted the divergences which exist both in the Fed and private sector forecasting community very accurately. The majority believed that ... " The most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation. Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation. While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures. However, inflation had remained relatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other factors was expected to curb demand. Moreover, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. The current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accommodative. While the federal funds rate had been reduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current level on an inflation-adjusted basis seems to be only marginally below its peak prior to mid-1995. In the circumstances, the Committee could afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional inflation pressures were like to develop" The dissidents from the majority view warned that continued strong output growth would undermine the Fed's inflation targets. The minutes noted, "A differing view gave more emphasis to prospects for rising inflation and the need for immediate action to forestall a buildup of cost and price pressures before they undermined the expansion. There was little firm evidence that economic growth was slowing and reports of appreciable wage pressures were increasing. Inflation expectations persisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor markets as well; if they were allowed to worsen the Committee's long-run goal of price stability would become much more difficult to achieve. Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in policy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy" The committee decided to approve only a change in their policy bias, not an actual interest rate hike, because of the psychological impact of raising interest rates. The minutes said "Some noted that a policy tightening action would tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening". At the FOMC meeting in late September, the Fed will probably have new evidence of the economy expanding at a rate close to 3.0% but few signs of accelerating inflation at the retail level. The factors which will force the Fed to hike interest rates will be concern about the intermediate term inflation consequence of the unemployment rate dropping close to 5.0% and large increases in long-term bond yields. The fact that the two dissenting votes on monetary policy during the past nine months have come from district presidents in the middle west (Minneapolis, Kansas City) also suggests that the district presidents could play a more important role than usual in the conduct of monetary policy this autumn. As a result of their location in strong growth regions such as the middle west, the rocky mountain states and California, they are more aware of how low unemployment and aggressive bank lending practices are affecting business behavior than the Washington based governors who depend upon government statistical reports and staff forecasts which often lag behind developments in the private sector. The fact that the Fed's own staff has greatly underestimated the economy's growth rate this year will probably also increase the determination of the district presidents to become more vociferous about the potential inflation risks of the economy expanding at an above trend growth rate for another year. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1021740 WT01-B14-16IA018-000197-B002-78http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/greensp2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172516 text/html 11485HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:21:17 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:21:43 GMTContent-length: 11302Content-type: text/html Is Wall Street Experiencing a Greenspan or Gephardt Correction? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) July 29, 1996 The slowdown in the high technology sector is of greater important than in thepast because of the role which it has played in sustaining growth since 1994 asdemand for autos and housing slowdown. Business expenditures on office and computer machinery now accounts for about1.8% of real GDP compared to 0.6% during 1990 and less than 0.2% during theearly 1980's. Its nominal share of GDP is about 1.0% compared to 0.7% in 1990and 1.1% in 1984. According to Hewlett Packard, the nominal growth rate ofcomputer spending could slow to 0-5% by the first quarter of 1997. Under sucha scenario, the real growth rate would drop to about 5-10% from 30-40% during1995 and early 1996. While such a slowdown will represent a major negativeswing from the sector's previous growth rate, it is by no means anunprecedented adjustment. During the mid-1980's, the growth rate of office andcomputer equipment spending fluctuated in a range of plus 80% at annual ratesto only slightly positive growth. In the 1990 recession, real spendingactually fell by over 20%. The other investment sector which has enjoyed buoyant during recent years iscommunications equipment. It's share of real GDP has expanded to .95% from.7% during 1992 and a previous peak of just under 1.0% during the mid-1980's.The growth rate of communications equipment investment has already slowed from25% during mid-1994 to 6-7% recently. Since the economy's two most vulnerable high technology sectors account forless than 3.0% of GDP, they will not be able to change the economy's overalldirection if other sectors are enjoying moderate growth. The correctionoccurring in high technology capital investment is a far more importantphenomena for the stock market than for the economy because of the leadershiprole which technology companies have played in the market during recentyears. As a result of the buoyant outlook for corporate profits and the high level ofcapacity utilization rates, other capital spending sectors should continue toenjoy moderate growth this year. Industrial equipment accounts for about 1.8%of both nominal and real GDP. It has already slowed from a growth rate of over15% during late 1994 to about 6-7% recently. The truck and bus sector ofequipment investment is highly cyclical and has already experienced a majoradjustment. Its growth rate has dropped from a peak of nearly 40% in late 1993to only 2-3% recently. The sector has a history of experiencing sub-cyclecontractions even during periods of steady growth in the economy, so it couldcontinue to decline during the second half of 1996 and then could reboundduring 1997 (as it did during the sub-cycle of the mid-1980's). The arguments for the Fed to tighten in the face of these risks to final demandgrowth center on inflation expectations in the private sector and theuncertainty which exists about the magnitude of any late 1996 slowdown in themidst of a financial environment which appears to be highly supportive ofgrowth. The Fed has been able to fine tune the economy during the 1990's withoutrisking a recession in part because of the confidence which it enjoys amonginvestors and business decision makers. If they saw the Fed remaining passivein the face of rising wages in order to sustain a prolonged period of fullemployment, they would start to increase their forecasts of the intermediateterm inflation outlook. While the adjustments might be small at first, therewould be a clear and increasing tendency for analyst to assume a core inflationrate closer to 4.0% than 3.0% by late 1997. While there are numerous reasons why final demand could slow in some importantsectors during the next nine months, the financial environment in the U.S.remains so buoyant that it is difficult to imagine a prolonged period of outputgrowth below 2.0%. Banks are competing so aggressively to make loans thatmost small business owners can now chose between four and five potentiallenders if they have to finance a new investment or a sale of their business.The boom in the stock market and the expansion of the mutual fund industry hasproduced a very buoyant environment for new equity IPO's and the sale ofnon-investment grade bonds. The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during thefirst half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994, and apeak of 665 during 1993. These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during thefirst half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion last year, $22.9 billion during1994 and $34.0 billion during 1993. The peak for I.P.O. financing during the1980's, by contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986. The search for higheryields also has helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market. In thefirst half of 1996, Wall Street sold 92 new non-investment grade bond offeringcompared to 159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993. The fundsraised were $17.1 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during1995, $31.5 billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993. The previouspeak in non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billionduring 1986. It is difficult to imagine a self-reinforcing slowdown when capital is soreadily available to the entrepreneurial companies responsible for most ofAmerica's job creation. Meanwhile, the appreciation of the stock market hasboosted the net worth of the household sector by almost $2 billion since 1994.If the household sector spends only 5% of its capital gains, the potentialboost to consumer spending is $100 billion. The correction now occurring inthe equity market will inhibit new wealth creation but the market has beenrobust for so long that wealth losses are unlikely to be a depressing influenceon household spending until next year. Are the Financial Markets Focusing on the Election? The major focus of media commentary about the stock market during July was therisk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. But equityinvestors were probably also concerned about the continuing poor performance offormer Senator Robert Dole in the presidential opinion polls. Dole hasperformed so poorly in the polls that there is growing concern about theability of the Republican Party to retain control of Congress. Wall Street haslong perceived the president to be a superior campaigner but investors hadexpected Dole to benefit from the conviction of the Governor of Arkansas forcorruption in June as well as his resignation from the Senate. Clinton'sseeming immunity to his scandals has so unnerved the Republicans that they areabout to announce a major tax cut program in order to bolster Dole's electoralappeal. As Dole has devoted his whole career to reducing federal deficits andcriticizing supply side economists, it is far from clear that the new strategywill work but his new tax proposals will at least allow him to reinvoke theoptimistic message of Ronald Reagan during the early 1980's. The August political conventions will provide the next important test ofinvestor sentiment about the election. As political conventions focusgreat media attention on candidates, they typically give a boost to thechallenger who is attempting to establish credibility as an alternative to theincumbent. As Clinton is already 15-20 points ahead, investor concern aboutDole will evolve into alarm about both the presidential and congressional racesif he does not emerge from the convention narrowing the gap with Clinton by atleast 10 points. The prospect of the Republicans losing control of Congress is potentiallydisturbing to Wall Street for three reasons, First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for bothparties. No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections sinceFranklin Roosevelt in the 1930's. The Republican Party has not controlled theCongress for two consecutive terms since the 1920's. If the Republicans losecontrol again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away fromtheir themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, andpromoting lower marginal income tax rates. Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the DemocraticParty in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories. TheRepublican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southernConfederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960. On the basisof pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claimcontrol over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if theylose their overall majority. As a result of the Republican takeover of thesouth, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of thenortheast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that futureDemocratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spendingprograms and other forms of government intervention in the economy than boththe current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1019990 WT01-B14-17IA018-000197-B002-90http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/delayed2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172533 text/html 12348HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:21:26 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:21:57 GMTContent-length: 12165Content-type: text/html Will Delayed Fed Tightening Set the Stage For An October StockMarket Crash? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) June 21, 1996 While the government's newly revised labor market data point toa much stronger economy than analysts anticipated a few monthsago, not every survey of labor market conditions is as robust.Dun and Bradstreet recently published the results of its latestsurvey of business hiring intentions for 1996. The survey is projectingthat firms will create only 1.4 million new jobs this year comparedto 3 million jobs in last year's survey. The survey reports thatsmall firms will hire more cautiously but that large firms willexpand their hiring -- a reversal of the trend which has prevailedduring recent years. It said, "About 21 percent of the nation's smallest businesses expectto add jobs this year. As a group, mid-sized firms were slightlymore optimistic, with roughly 28 percent predicting higher employmentlevels. However, the 199,000 jobs expected among firms with 20to 99 employees is down 56 percent in comparison with last year.Firms with 100 to 999 employees expect to add about 387,000 jobs,down 43 percent from last year. Businesses with between 1,000and 9,999 employees say they will hire 185,000 new employees,down form 268,000 last year." "Only the nation's largest employers predict faster job growthin 1996 than in 1995, a significant reversal of the downsizingtrend of the past decade. Businesses employing more than 10,000workers expect to add about 113,000 jobs this year. That representsan increase of 47 percent from last year's survey." As the payroll survey of employment has already increased by 1.8million jobs this year, the D&B survey is either wrong orthe economy is poised for a sudden slowing of employment growth.But the survey may be misleading this year because firms appearto be concerned about labor shortages, not just concerns overslower growth of the economy. As the survey noted, "A high percentage of U.S. employers are finding it difficultto locate qualified workers. Thirty-six percent of all firms saythey have trouble finding qualified workers. High-tech and skilledlabor markets are reporting the most serious labor shortage. Fifty-twopercent of construction firms, for instance, reported troublefinding qualified workers, and 41 percent of manufacturers haddifficulty. Among the transportation/public utilities, retailtrade and services sectors, 38 percent, 37 percent and 34 percent,respectively, of all firms surveyed said they had trouble findingqualified workers." It is also possible that American firms have underestimatedtheir employment needs because they have been influenced by theconsensus among U.S. forecasters that 1996 would be a year ofsluggish output growth. According to the June 10th Blue Chipsurvey of the U.S. forecasting community, forecasters have increasedtheir expectations for second quarter growth to 3.3% from 2.1%during March and 2.7% during May, but they continue to projecta sharp slowing to growth rates of only 2.3% and 2.0% during thefinal two quarters of the year. Those forecasts are no higherthan March's despite the fact that first half growth will be twiceas high as most forecasters projected in January. The surprising resilience of the U.S. economy since January createssome potentially challenging questions for the Federal Reserve.Should it reverse its January easing move with a 25 basis pointrate hike at its July third FOMC meeting? Should it delay anytightening move until it has more clear-cut evidence on the thirdquarter outlook and tighten at the late August meeting, whichwill coincide with the Democratic national convention? Shouldit wait until the July employment report in early August and changeits recent custom of adjusting policy only at FOMC meetings bymaking an adjustment in response to new information appearingbetween the FOMC meetings? As inflation has remained remarkablysubdued despite the economy's strong performance this year, shouldthe Fed simply revise up its estimate of the economy's optimalpotential growth rate and not tighten until there is clear-cutevidence of accelerating inflation? The odds are high that the Fed will raise interest rates atsome point this summer. The big questions center on whetherthe policy adjustment will occur in July or August and whetherthey will occur on the actual day of FOMC meetings. As inflationhas been well behaved and there is still no consensus in the privatesector about the second half outlook, the Fed can rationalizeremaining passive at its July meeting. But if the July data appearingin early August suggests output growth will remain close to 3.0%during the third quarter, bond yields will rise to at least 7.50%and intensify pressure on the Fed to hike short-term interestrates. As the Fed will probably not want its tightening actionto coincide with a major political convention, it could take advantageof the early August data reports to act a few weeks ahead of theFOMC meeting. With an election looming for both the White House and the Congress,there will be political criticism of any Fed tightening this summer,but Mr. Greenspan will have little problem justifying his action.If output growth remains at 3.0% or higher during the secondhalf of 1995, the unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% by yearend. Despite the recent turmoil in the copper market, therewill also be a firming of industrial commodity prices and thepurchasing agent price index will probably climb back into the60-70 range from 50 during May and 40 during April. While it would be natural for the administration to frown uponFed tightening during the summer before a presidential election,the fact is it would be far more prudent for the Fed to movequickly this summer than to delay policy adjustments until theautumn. As the Fed is still in a fine turning mode, any policyadjustment this summer would only have a marginal impact on thegrowth rate of output and real income this autumn. But procrastinationby the Fed could set the stage for large and destabilizing fluctuationsin bond and equity prices. If the Fed adheres to a passive policythis summer, the Dow Jones Industrial Index could shoot up to6,000 and push the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDPto 92-93% compared to its previous peak of 81.0% in 1929. If theFed continued to be surprised by the economy's resilience duringthe third quarter, it could feel compelled to tighten by 50 basispoints or more during the autumn and set the stage for a majorequity market correction. If the equity market correction waslarge and compressed into a few days (as it was in October, 1987),it could have a far more damaging impact on the economic credibilityof the Clinton administration than modest Fed tightening thissummer. Fed officials are reluctant to comment in public about the stockmarket but they are privately apprehensive about both the levelof equity prices and the extraordinary flow of retail money intoequity mutual funds. As a result, they should understand thelogic of adjusting interest rates this summer rather than delayingpolicy changes in a way which might maximize the risk of a financialaccident later this year. Fed fine tuning will not eliminateall stock market risk in the outlook. If the economy continuesto expand at a rate of 3.0-4.0% despite the Fed hiking short-terminterest rates by 25-50 basis points, the Fed could feel compelledto push short-term interest rates all the way back to 6.0% oreven higher. In such a scenario, it would be difficult to avoida major stock market correction during the fourth quarter. Butas the Fed tightening would be spread over a period of three tosix months, investors would have time to adjust to the policychange and the risk would diminish of a 1987 style stock marketcrash. Tobin's Q and Market Prices There has been extensive media discussion during recent weeksabout the risk of a large stock market correction occurring autonomouslyfrom any monetary tightening because of the current ratio of shareprices to asset replacement costs. The so-called Tobin's Q ratioof share prices to asset replacement costs is now at 1.7 comparedto a range of 0.3 to 1.4 before 1994. The Tobin Q ratio is computedon the basis of Federal Reserve data which shows that the U.S.corporate sector has a current net worth value of just under $4trillion compared to a stock market which is now capitalized atover $7 trillion. In 1994, the components of net worth were equipmentvalued at $2.009 trillion, inventory valued at $1.037 trillionand real estate valued at $2.1702 trillion. The real estate valueincludes buildings worth $2.078 trillion and land worth $92.2billion. The Fed is still compiling data for 1995 but on a preliminarybasis it is projecting that corporate current value net worthwill rise to $4247.3 billion, with the components consisting of$2.233 trillion of real estate, $2.089 trillion of equipment and$1.145 trillion of inventory. The equipment and building components of the current value estimatesof corporate net worth are computed with broad indices of inflationin the capital goods sector. The estimates of land value are basedon national surveys of real estate prices. As there has been deflationin many high technology capital goods industries during the 1990's,the value of non-residential plant and equipment has increasedby only 12% since 1990 despite large increases in capital investment.The corporate sector's land values, by contrast, have fallenby almost 90% from their peak of $940 billion in 1989. While thereis no doubt that land values have fallen during the 1990's, itis far from clear that the decline has been as steep as the FederalReserve data suggests. If land values were restated to showa decline of only 50%, corporate net worth would increase by $380billion and the Tobin Q ratio would decline to 1.58 from 1.7.If land values were still at 1989 levels, corporate net worthwould increase by almost $900 billion and Tobin's Q would declineto 1.42. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1018480 WT01-B14-18IA018-000197-B002-104http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/tighten2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172544 text/html 10119HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:21:44 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:22:15 GMTContent-length: 9937Content-type: text/html Will the Fed Tighten in July or August? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) May 29, 1996 The Dollar Remains Firm The prospect of the U.S. being the first G-7 country to raiseinterest rates this year suggests that the dollar will retainthe bias towards firmness which has been apparent during recentweeks. The German economy should improve during the summer but the Bundesbankis unlikely to tighten until mid-1997 at the earliest. Germanyhas a large output gap and Bundesbank officials favor a weak D-markin order to discourage support from German industry for the introductionof a new European currency. The major constraint on further easingthis spring is the industrial unrest now occurring in Germany'spublic sector as well as Bundesratt opposition to Chancellor Kohl'sproposed cuts in government expenditure. In Japan, there are increasing signs of economic recovery butofficials are downplaying the possibility of monetary tighteningbecause of the lingering credit quality problems of the financialsystem. Tokyo journalists also report that recent bureaucraticshuffles at the Ministry of Finance have increased the odds ofDr. Eisuke Sakakibara being reappointed for another year as theDirector General of the international finance bureau. As Dr.Sakakibara has been a strong promoter of a firm dollar with bothJapanese investment firms and the New York hedge funds, his reappointmentshould be a psychological plus for the U.S. dollar. He does notfavor pushing the dollar all the way to 130 yen, as some pressreports have suggested, but he will certainly try to hold theyen dollar rate in a trading range of 105-110 in order to promotefurther improvement in Japanese corporate profitability. The only potential negative factor for the dollar during the nextfew quarters is increasing political risk in the U.S. and reducedpolitical risk in other countries. It now appears that Mr. Yeltsinwill win the Russian presidential election and lessen the dangerof investors selling the currencies of Germany and other centralEuropean countries because of a communist victory. In the U.S.,by contrast, the opinion polls suggest that President Clintoncould win such a large victory in this November's presidentialelection that he might be able to pull many new Democrats intoCongress with him. According to some pollsters, the Republicanshave potentially thirty vulnerable House freshmen while the Democratsare likely to lose about four to six open seats in the south. If there is a net swing of 24 seats, the Democrats would be ableto retake control of the House and elect their majority leader,Rep. Richard Gephardt, as Speaker. The market would be concernedabout a Democratic recapture of the House for three reasons. First, Rep. Gephardt has often been an advocate of protectionisttrade policies in the past and was hostile to the administration'sfinancial rescue program for Mexico. Secondly, the Democratic Party has lost so many of its traditionalsouthern seats that it is a party increasingly dominated by thebig cities of the northeast, the middle west, and California aswell as their lower middle class suburbs. Whereas the DemocraticParty had over 95% of the southern Congressional delegation asrecently as the early 1960's, it now has only one quarter of theseats in the old Confederacy and could emerge from the next electionwith only 10-15%. As a result, many of the new committee chairmanin a Democratic controlled Congress would be from poor urban districtsin cities such as Detroit, New York and Los Angeles. Theywould be far more left of center on many economic policy issues,such as public spending and labor market regulation, than boththe current Republican chairmen and the past Democratic committeechairmen. Finally, many investors would view a Democratic victory as a majorlost opportunity for structural reform of social security, Medicareand other federal programs. As the Republicans have not controlledCongress for two consecutive terms since the 1920's and mightwell engage in a demoralizing fratricidal conflict if they losecontrol again after only one term, it is unclear when an opportunityfor structural reform would re-emerge. In fact, the markets areconfronted with a unique set of historical circumstances thisyear. No Democratic President has won re-election for two consecutiveterms since the days of Franklin Roosevelt while the Republicanshave not controlled Congress for two consecutive terms since the1920's. Hence, if one were to extrapolate on the basis of history,they would project that Senator Robert Dole would emerge as thenext president and that Richard Gephardt would be the new HouseSpeaker. The odds of such an outcome appear modest today becausea Dole victory would probably guarantee Republican retention ofthe Congress while a Clinton victory would not insure a Democratictakeover of the House unless he won by a landslide. But unlessSenator Dole rallies in the polls, the markets could become alarmedabout the prospect of the Republicans suffering an electoral debaclethis November. Despite the current wide gap in the opinion polls, it wouldbe premature for investors to conclude that the President is assuredof re-election. The Dole campaign is currently sufferingfrom money problems and his responsibilities in the Senate, butfour factors suggest that Senator Dole should enjoy a significantimprovement during the autumn. First, the Republicans have astrong hold on several southern and western states with about160-170 electoral votes. Secondly, the President has been pursuingre-election by emphasizing Republican themes, such as a balancedbudget and family values. While the strategy has worked so far,the media could ultimately portray him as such a cynical manipulatorof public opinion that it will backfire. Thirdly, the recentconviction of the Governor of Arkansas and Mr. Clinton's formerreal estate partners on various allegations of fraud will forcethe media to probe further into allegations of corruption duringhis tenure as Governor of Arkansas. As Arkansas has many of thecharacteristics of an emerging market, press scrutiny of the statecoupled with the Starr investigations of the first family's financialaffairs could easily revive doubts about the president's character. Finally, despite Mr. Dole's long history in U.S. public life,pollsters working with voter focus groups have discovered thatmost Americans know very little about him. At one Republicanfocus group, for example, only 25% of the voters were aware ofMr. Dole's record during World War Two. As the presidential campaignintensifies and the media focuses more closely on the characterof the candidates, Senator Dole is likely to benefit at the expenseof the president. To summarize, the U.S. economy is likely to expandat a 3.0-4.0% annual rate during the second quarter because ofsteady growth of consumption and investment as well as corporaterestocking of inventories. There is still widespread disagreementabout the outlook for third quarter growth but recent reportson employment intentions and capital goods demand suggest thatoutput growth should remain close to 3.0%. As a result, therewill be further increases in the economy's level of resource utilizationwhich could encourage the Federal Reserve to tighten monetarypolicy at the FOMC meeting in early July or late August. Therecovery now underway in the economies of Latin America, Chinaand other developing countries, coupled with the cyclical upturnprojected for Europe and Japan also suggest that world outputgrowth could exceed 4.0% this year and next year for the firsttime since 1988. The dollar should remain firm because of thestrength of the U.S. economy and the desire of government officialsin both Germany and Japan to encourage depreciation of the D-markand the yen. (D.

(continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) May 6, 1996 The performance of the financial markets will also play an important role in the FOMC thinking. If bond yields rise well above 7.0% while the stock market remains firm, more governors will be willing to tighten policy in order to restrain investors' inflation expectations. Conversely, if rising bond yields produce a large stock market correction, there will be more reluctance to tighten because of concern about household wealth losses. The personal savings rate has begun to decline after rising sharply last year, but it could easily change direction if households become pessimistic about the economy because of falling equity prices. If the Federal Reserve does raise interest rates this summer, it will be the first G-7 central bank to break with the pattern of global easing which has prevailed since early 1995. Japanese interest rates have fallen to such low levels that the next policy change has to be a rate hike, but such a hike is unlikely to occur until late this year because of the credit quality problems of the Japanese financial system. Monetary policy in Germany is likely to remain easy because of the government's moves towards fiscal restraint, the weakness of the German economy, and the moral hazard problems created by the increasingly probable replacement of the D-mark by a new European currency in the year 1999. Since Chancellor Kohl's coalition won a decisive victory in the German lander elections during late March, both financial markets and European central bank officials have begun to assign a much higher probability to the introduction of a new European currency in the year 1999. French bond yields have fallen sharply in relation to German bond yields while the German yield curve has remained positively sloped because of investor apprehension about the loss of the D-mark. Bundesbank officials have many doubts about the viability of a new European currency, but they cannot stop Chancellor Kohl from going forward unless there is some exogenous political shock which erodes his power. Instead of actively resisting the introduction of the Euro, many Bundesbank officials have decided to encourage a gradual devaluation of the D-mark in order to lessen the support of German industry for switching to a new European currency. As foreign investors own nearly 40% of Germany's public debt, the Bundesbank cannot push this devaluation strategy too far, but there is little doubt that they would be willing to accept a 10-15% decline against the U.S. dollar and the yen as well as smaller corrections against other European currencies. The prospect of Germany and other European countries pursuing an easy monetary policy in order to weaken their currencies, coupled with the likelihood of Japanese monetary policy remaining on hold through the autumn, increases the possibility of a positive growth surprise occurring in the G-7 countries next year. The easy monetary conditions in the G-7 countries are also reviving capital flows to the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa and thus increasing the odds that they will enjoy stronger recoveries as well. A few developing countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, are raising interest rates in order to constrain domestic inflation pressures, but they are still likely to experience growth rates in excess of 7.0%. The Yeltsin government is pursuing such populist fiscal policies in order to win the upcoming Russian presidential election, it will certainly have to reverse course if it wins, but the emergence of a large private sector in Russia should still permit positive output growth in the future after a long period of contraction. After three years of tightening monetary policy in order to restrain inflation, China also has begun to relax monetary policy during recent days. On May 1st, it announced a reduction in the cost of working capital loans from 12.06% to 10.98%. These interest rate adjustments also followed a selective easing of credit rationing policies late last year. If we measure GDP on the basis of purchasing power parity adjustments to compensate for price differentials, Europe accounts for about 25% of world output, the U.S. for about 22%, Japan for about 9%, and China for about 8%. Monetary policy has therefore shifted towards an expansionary direction in about two-thirds of the world economy during the past four quarters and the shift is not yet completed in several countries. This monetary policy bias suggests that the world economy will become increasingly buoyant during the next six quarters, even if the U.S. economy enjoys only a moderately positive sub-cycle recovery during the second half of 1996. As a result, the IMF is predicting 4.3% growth in world output during 1997 compared to 3.8% this year, and 3.5 % in 1999. To summarize, the surprising resilience of final demand in the first quarter is provoking new discussion about Fed tightening during the summer, but the FOMC is unlikely to support such tightening unless it sees clear evidence that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and industrial commodity prices start to rise more sharply. The best leading indicators of a monetary policy change will be the performance of the purchasing agent price index, retail sales, and the bond market. The generally accommodative tone of monetary policy in Europe and Japan suggests that the odds are increasing of a positive growth surprise in the world economy during 1997 and 1998. (D.

(continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) March 25, 1996 While central bank policy is likely to remain passive in the face of a moderate rebound in U.S. output growth, there is a risk that bond yields could be more volatile. The growth of hedge funds and other leveraged investors has given the bond market a far more speculative flavor than the equity market during recent years and thus bond prices often react far more violently to new economic information than other financial assets. In 1996, the U.S. bond market will also have to contend with volatility in the political outlook of investors, not just fluctuations in the business cycle. On the basis of 30 year bond yields, real long-term interest rates are currently just under 4.0% in the U.S., 5.0% in Britain, and well over 5.0% in France and Germany. The ten-year bonds of Japan yield about 3.0% in real terms while in Switzerland they yield about 3.5%. In late December 1995, by contrast, real and nominal long-term interest rates were about 100 basis points lower in the U.S. and Europe. The one event still capable of producing a positive bond market surprise in the face of stronger output growth during the second quarter would be a successful U.S. budget compromise. The White House is sufficiently concerned about the large rise in U.S. bond yields since January that is has been putting out feelers to Senator Robert Dole about pursuing a new budget agreement. The White House has long viewed him as a more amenable to a compromise than the House Republican leadership and his success in the Republican primaries has greatly increased his potential freedom of action. But despite the opportunity for new negotiations created by the Dole victory, there are still major hurdles to an agreement. The major case for the Republicans to accept a compromise is that they have fallen sharply in the opinion polls and many voters now perceive their attempt at confrontational budget negotiations to have been a failure. The barriers to a budget agreement are congressional and White House perceptions of the tradeoffs between improving the performance of the economy and achieving no deal. The Republicans fear that a budget agreement could help the president more than them by lowering bond yields and boosting the housing market. The White House fears that any compromise which trims Medicare spending will deny them the opportunity to engage in demagogic attacks on the Republicans in states with large populations of retired people, such as Florida. In short, neither side perceives overwhelming advantages to a deal while both sides perceive potential downside. As a result of these constraints, the odds of a deal will probably remain below 50% unless the economy is so strong during the second quarter that bond yields shoot over 7.0% and equity prices fall sharply. In such a scenario, the president would offer major concessions to obtain a deal. While most investors are relieved that Senator Robert Dole has won firm control of the Republican nomination and thwarted the challenge posed by Patrick Buchanan, they are not optimistic about his prospects in November. They perceive him to be an older and less dynamic campaigner than the president. They also perceive that a third party candidacy by Ross Perot or Patrick Buchanan will draw votes largely at the expense of Dole. They believe that Dole has a solid base of about 150 electoral votes in the South and West but they do not think that he will be able to carry California or the Great Lakes states unless the economy deteriorates sharply, there is a foreign policy disaster, or the various investigations of the first family's financial affairs in the 'emerging market' state of Arkansas produce a formal indictment of Mrs. Clinton, not just press stories about sleazy business relationships. The special federal prosecutor, Mr. Ken Starr, has indicted the Governor of Arkansas and may obtain new evidence to use against the first family if he can obtain a conviction which encourages other Arkansas politicians to plea bargain at the expense of the president. But as the president has already survived four years of rumors about his personal life and financial affairs in Arkansas, the markets will remain skeptical about his vulnerability without major new disclosures. While the president is clearly ahead at the present time, there are several factors which could still produce a Dole victory. First, the president received only 43% of the vote in 1992 and thus would have lost if Ross Perot had not taken 19% of the vote largely at the expense of the Republicans. Secondly, as the American president is both head of state and head of government, the issue of character looms large in public perceptions of the office. Senator Dole can campaign as a World War Two veteran who has devoted a lifetime to public service while nearly half of the electorate perceives the president to be a decadent, if not corrupt, member of the most self-indulgent generation in American history (the baby boomers). Thirdly, it is doubtful that Ross Perot will be able to come anywhere close to matching the 19% share of the vote which he received four years ago. In 1992, he was a new face and the opinion polls briefly suggested that he might win the election. In 1996, it is widely accepted that a vote for Ross Perot is ultimately a vote for Bill Clinton. Nor can Perot attract the support of people who voted for Patrick Buchanan because of his clear uncompromising position on abortion. Ross Perot supports the right to abortion, so the pro-life movement has no alternative but to return to the Republican Party. Finally, in contrast to George Bush four years ago, Dole should be able to attract the support of most conservatives because he provides them with an unprecedented opportunity to influence U.S. public policy through Republican control of both the White House and the Congress for the first time since the era of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. The fact that Dole comes from a tradition of political moderation may offend some conservatives but the fact is the American people would probably not support the election of an ultra-conservative President and Congress at the same time. They like the checks and balances which come from dividing power between executive and legislative branches of different political persuasions. In fact, the president himself has effectively co-opted much of the Republicans' rhetoric so that he can campaign as the candidate who will eliminate the budget deficit in a humane way, not through savage cuts in popular middle class entitlement programs. It will be far easier for Senator Dole to portray himself as the president who can achieve his party's agenda without threatening ordinary people than it would have been for some of his party's other candidates. As a result of these factors, the American presidential race is still wide open. The President's lead should narrow during the next few months but could re-open if the Republicans permit their convention to be dominated by extremist rhetoric or if Patrick Buchanan joins Ross Perot on a third party ticket which captures a large share of the Christian evangelical vote. The Republicans are aware of these risks, so they should be able to avoid the mistakes which plagued them at the 1992 convention but Senator Dole will still have to demonstrate far more skill at coalition building with his party's right wing populists than was possible for George Bush. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013820 WT01-B14-21IA018-000197-B002-143http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/usyieldcurve2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172615 text/html 11700HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:22:15 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:22:47 GMTContent-length: 11517Content-type: text/html Is The U.S. Yield Curve Discounting Increased Political Risk? (continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) February 29, 1996 The stagnation of real wages also has coincided with a dramatic expansion of pay among many senior executives as well as a stock market boom which has produced large gains for them on their stock option programs. Popular magazines, such as Newsweek, have played upon class resentments over such differentials in pay by running front page stories about the rise of the "Overclass" (the technocratic elite profiting from the new world economic order) and "Corporate Killers" (a recent cover story on chief executives responsible for large layoffs). In the mid-1980's, there also was considerable media discussion about the social side-effects of corporate restructuring through takeover activity but the restructuring of that era did not provoke as much resentment because the overall growth rate of the economy and real income was much stronger. As many of the takeover artists of the mid-1980's violated federal security laws, the public also derived some satisfaction from watching some of the most prominent players go to jail. The corporate restructuring of the 1990's is being driven by factors very different from the takeover boom of the mid-1980's. As U.S. equity price/earnings multiples are much higher today than they were ten years ago, the dominant factors driving the restructuring are technology, international competition and the cumulative impact of several years of low inflation on corporate cost control strategies, not Wall Street's search for new transaction fees. As a result of the explosive growth of mutual fund ownership, a far larger share of the American population is benefiting from the impact of company rationalization on profits and share prices than ever before but the linkage between share ownership and employment is much weaker among ordinary corporate employees than among senior executives. According to Labor Department data, only 13% of U.S. employees participated in deferred profit sharing plans during 1993 while just 3% of this group belonged to employee stock ownership programs (ESOPS) and less than 1.0% received stock bonuses. The low level of stock ownership among company employees has helped to enhance the appeal of the Buchanan attack on corporate America despite the tremendous growth occurring in public equity ownership through mutual funds, individual retirement accounts and other tax deferred family savings programs. In a few weeks, a special White House taskforce will issue a report examining the feasibility of investing some portion of the social security trust fund in the equity market. Such a development would create practically universal equity ownership in the U.S. but it is unlikely to occur for at least three years. The OECD recently published a study on income distribution in the major industrial countries. The OECD data suggests that the U.S. has significantly more income inequality than other industrial countries primarily because of the very small share of income accruing to people in the bottom quintile of the population. In the U.S., the bottom 20% of the population received about 5.7% of income in 1986 compared to 7.8% in Canada, 10.6% in Sweden and 7.0% in Britain. The share of income accruing to the wealthiest 10% of the population in the U.S. was about 24% in 1986 compared to 22% in Canada, 23% in Britain, 18% in Sweden, and 22% in Australia. In developing countries, such as Brazil and Mexico by contrast, the top 10% of households receive over 40% of personal income while the bottom 20% received only about 2.0-3.0%. The offset to this inequality is that affluent Americans pay high effective marginal income tax rates by international standards. In 1986, people in the top quintile of U.S. income paid 53% of all taxes compared to 3.8% for people in the bottom quintile. In Canada, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 3.6% for the bottom quintile. In Britain, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 4.5% for the bottom quintile. The U.S. also enjoys remarkable social mobility between income classes. According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, only about 5.1% of the people in the bottom income quintile of the population during 1975 were still in that quintile by 1991. Instead, 29% had moved to the top income quintile, 30% to the second income quintile, 21% to the third highest income quintile, and 14.6% to the fourth. Among people in the fourth income quintile, 37.0% also had moved to the highest income quintile while another 32.6% had moved to the second highest income quintile. The fact is that many of the people in the bottom income quintile are elderly and living on savings income, not wages, or young and thus poised to increase their income sharply as they gain work experience. The marital status of people also has a major impact on their income rankings. Among white people, 25% of households headed by single females have income below $10,000 compared to 4.7% for married couples. Among black people, 44% of households headed by single females have incomes below $10,000 compared to 9.8% for married couples. The factor which appears to explain the magnitude of American income inequality compared to other industrial countries is the low level of transfer payments to the poor. In 1986, transfer payments accounted for only 13.7% of median income in the bottom quintile of the U.S. population compared to 32.4% for Britain, 18.3% for Canada, 27.0% for Sweden and 22.5% for Australia. The recent upsurge of spending on the Earned Income Tax Credit may have altered this ratio but with the exception of the EITC program the U.S. has far less generous transfer payment programs for the non-elderly than most other industrial countries. No presidential candidate is currently advocating an expansion of transfer payment programs because most middle class Americans perceive transfer payments other than social security to be give-aways to low income minority groups. In other industrial countries, by contrast, there is much less racial polarization than in the U.S. and thus much greater willingness to use the government as an engine for income redistribution. As a result of the racial constraints on popular support for using the federal government to promote income redistribution, it is not surprising that right wing populists, such as Patrick Buchanan, have focused so heavily on themes such as foreign competition and corporate greed to explain falling living standards. Such issues permit him to play upon the theme of economic insecurity without offering any detailed program for increasing public expenditure to promote job training or redistribute income. The Buchanan themes played well in New Hampshire because that state has had one of the most volatile economies in the nation during the past decade. In the 1980's, New Hampshire enjoyed an economic boom because of the impact of strong employment growth in New England's computer and defense industries, a flight of tax refugees from Massachusetts, and a real estate development boom financed by the state's newly privatized mutual savings banks. In the early 1990's, the boom turned to a bust as the New England high tech sector suffered from a slump in defense spending and demand for micro computers while vacancy rates for real estate reached such high levels that many of the state's banks failed. As a result of these upheavals, New Hampshire has not been immune to the problem of job insecurity and eroding real wages despite a low unemployment rate. According to one consultant's report, median family income in new Hampshire fell by 14.7% between 1989 and 1994 compared to 4.7% for the nation. In 1996, Buchanan received only 27% of the primary vote in New Hampshire compared to 37% when he challenged George Bush in 1992. But while the 1996 primary vote was more fragmented because of the large number of candidates, the profile of the Buchanan vote clearly reflected the theme of economic insecurity. His voters were more heavily male, poorly educated and young than the voters for other candidates. According to surveys, he received the votes of 31% of male voters compared to 26% for Dole, 21% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes while among women he received only 25% of the vote. He obtained 31% of the votes of people aged 18-29 years compared to 18% for Dole, 29% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes. Among people over the age of 60, he received only 25% of the vote compared to 39% for Dole, 19% for Alexander, and 10% for Forbes. He received 43% of the votes of non-college graduates compared to 21% for Dole, 22% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes whereas among college graduates he had only 23% of the vote compared to 27% for Dole, 23% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes. Buchanan's voters also had strong ideological views. He collected the votes of 59% of people who described themselves as very conservative compared to 13% for Dole and 9% for Alexander while among moderates he obtained only 18% of the vote compared to 26% for Dole and 30% for Alexander. Buchanan received one third of the votes of people who said the economy mattered most compared to 25% for Dole and 23% for Alexander but his voting group was very much biased towards people with bad economic experiences. He received the votes of 27% of the people who said their personal financial situation had deteriorated compared to 19% for Dole, 24% for Alexander, and 14% for Forbes. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013070 WT01-B14-22IA018-000197-B002-149http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/feddev3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172623 text/html 10214HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:22:23 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:20:23 GMTContent-length: 10031Content-type: text/html Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued page 3) Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued) As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, itis doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets mightfear this autumn. But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised bythe upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries duringearly 1996. With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such arapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary. Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politicsof the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income. Hesuggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusingon the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which hadhelped to produce the Buchanan primary victories. If the Democrats regaincontrol of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in theirlegislative agenda for 1997. The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints. First, real wageshave been stagnant for several years. Secondly, there is growing incomeinequality on the basis of differentials in education. Thirdly, corporationsprovide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same timethat they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle incomeworkers. There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to thegrowth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's. But it isfar from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are agood proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation. There isconsiderable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation. If we adjustwages with the new measures of the CPI being developing to measure inflationmore accurately or deflators of prices being charged by U.S. companies, therehas been modest growth of real wages during the past decade, not a decline.Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in order toavoid taxes, including pensions and health care. Such benefits are now equalto about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late 1940's. There is growing income inequality based on education because new developmentsin technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workerscompared to people with fewer skills. With the economy now close to fullemployment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity toimprove their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost onehalf of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment hasalways encouraged faster wage growth in the past. Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for theirexecutives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices haverisen sharply. The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13%of U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belongto ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership). As a result, there is a weak linkin the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership. About 51million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but theydo not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives inmost corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has beenmagnified in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980. Duringthe past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced theiremployment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact thattotal U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million. The high visibilityof the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense ofinsecurity among American workers than than can be justified by the economy'soverall employment performance. While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock optionprograms and insensitive public relations in the way it conductsrestructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labormarket for job creation in the industrial world. Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor forceof 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor forceentrants. About 20 million American also change their job every years. Since1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a laborforce of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor forceentrants. As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt digitlevels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people. The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility. Among those in the bottom incomequintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to the top income quintile, 30% to thesecond and 21% have moved to the third. The number of American householdsearning over $100,000 per annum in 1994 dollars has risen from 1.0 million in1967 and 2.7 million in 1980to over 6 million today. Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S. labor market.In April, a German business magazine published a cover story about how Germanyshould regard the U.S. economy as a role model for labor market reform. Thecover showed a picture of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200pounds) trying to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume. Shortly after the articleappeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage job creation,including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to abolish many expensivegovernment regulations on firms which employ ten workers or less. Under theprevious law, such rules applied to firms employing more than 5 people. Inthe U.S., by contrast, firms are not subject to many federal labor laws untiltheir total employment exceeds 50 workers. However envious Europe may be of the U.S. labor market, though one of the riskspoised by this autumn's election is that the voters will believe politicianswho say that it is malfunctioning. In politics, perceptions are reality andmany Americans perceive that the U.S. economy is producing unfair outcomes byredistributing income from the poor to the rich. The Democratic congressional leadership has announced a variety of proposals topromote "stakeholder capitalism" and protect employment through new corporatesubsides and labor market regulations. While such proposals are wellintentioned, the experience of Europe suggests that they would be highlycounter productive over the long-term. They would produce a more rigid labormarket and discourage hiring without necessarily reducing wage inequality. While politicians in Washington have dominated the debate about incomeinequality and social fairness, the politicians who actually have the greatestcapacity to promote a more just society in the U.S. are state and localgovernment politicians. They have a major role to play because they areresponsible for the nation's educational system. The U.S. spends about 6.5% ofits GDP on education and Washington is responsible for only about $40 billionof the expenditures. The only effective way to reduce income inequality in anera rapid of technological change is to ensure that everyone has effectiveaccess to a good education. Yet, real education spending has been stagnant andeven declining in some states despite the growing public concern about incomeinequality. Attempts to promote more effective use of education dollarsthrough vouchers and other forms of school choice also have been stymied byopposition from teachers unions. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1020000 WT01-B14-23IA018-000197-B002-164http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/mutualfundboom3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172639 text/html 14071HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:22:35 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:20:36 GMTContent-length: 13888Content-type: text/html Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued page 3) Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued) The growth of the mutual fund industry has had several effects on the economy. First, it has encouraged the household sector to boost its equity market exposure to the highest level since the 1960's. Household ownership of equities and mutual funds now exceeds 25% of all households financial assets compared to 15.5% in 1995, 13.5% in 1975, and a previous peak of 36.0% in 1968. Mutual funds now also represent about 25% of total household equity portfolios compared to 14% in 1985, 6% in 1968 and less than 4% in the 1960's. Second, the growth of the mutual fund industry is broadening the number of households with exposure to the equity market. According to data from Federal Reserve surveys of household finances, about 17.8% of U.S. households owned equities directly in 1992 compared to 19.l1% in 1983 and 17.2% in 1962. But if we include mutual funds, the share of households owning equities rises to 22.0% from 20.1% in 1983 and 19.0% in 1962. If we include IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans, the share rises to 37.4% from 33.2% in 1983. There is no comparable data for the 1960's because IRA's and defined contribution pension plans were non-existent before the 1970's. While the share of the population owning equities has been expanding steadily during recent years, the great bulk of U.S. equity continues to be owned by high income people. According to the Federal Reserve survey of household finances, people with incomes above $250,000 (1.2% of total households) own 29.11% of all publicly traded stock compared to 20.78% for the income group earning $100,000-250,000 (5.9% of total households), 8.76% for the income group earning $75,000-100,000 (5.51% of total households) and 15.16% for the income group earning $50,000-75,000 (13.38% of total households). If we divide the population on the basis of wealth, the ownership of equity appears to be even more concentrated. According to the Fed surveys, the wealthiest 0.5% of U.S. households own 58.6% of all publicly traded stock compared to 11.74% for the second 0.5%, 24.18% for the next 4% of households, 4.62% for the next 5% and less than 1.0% for the remainder of the population. In the case of housing equity, by contrast, the bottom 80% of the population owns 28% of residential housing stock compared to just under 16.0% for the top 1.0% of the population.Age also plays an important role in equity ownership. In the 1992 Fed survey, households with ages above 65 owned 41.36% of all publicly of traded stock compared to 19.25% for the age group 55-64 years, 18.07% for the age group 45-54 years, and 17.01% for the age group 35-44 years. But while U.S. equity ownership is highly concentrated among older high income people, it is becoming more diffuse. The share of publicly traded equity owned by people with incomes above $250,000 fell from 50.60% in 1983 to 29.11% in 1992. If we broaden the measure of equity ownership to include mutual funds, IRA's, Keoghs and defined contribution plans, the share of the top income group drops from 43.06% in 1983 to 22.72% in 1992. The major gainers are groups with incomes below $100,000. The group with incomes of $75,000-100,00 per annum has expanded its share of all equities including mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh's defined contribution pension, to 12.1% from 7.28% in 1983. The $50,000-75,000 group has boosted its share from 12.63% in 1983 to 16.75% in 1992. The group earning $25,000-50,000 has boosted its share of equity from 8.08% in 1983 to 18.39% in 1992. The group earning under $25,000 has boosted its share from 3.06% in 1983 to 7.07% in 1992. Stock ownership is also becoming less concentrated on the basis of age, not just income. In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.35% of U.S. publicly traded equity compared to 49.24% in 1983. The age group 35-44 years, by contrast, has increased its share of publicly traded equity from 6.83% in 1983 to 17.01% in 1992. Share ownership is also far more diffused when mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans are included. On this basis, the share of equity owned by households over 65 years of age falls from 43.14% in 1983 to 30.71% in 1992 while the share of households aged 35-44 years rises from 9.13% to 16.97%. Equity ownership on the basis of wealth continues to be highly concentrated but it is becoming gradually more diffuse. In 1992, the top 1.0% of households owned over 70% of publicly traded U.S. equity compared to 78% in 1983 and 75.07% in 1962. The next 4% of the population owned 24.18% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 17.38% in 1983 and 20.4% in 1962. The next 5% of the population owned 4.62% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 3.58% in 1983 and 3.77% in 1962. The bottom 80% of the population continues to own an insignificant share of publicly traded stock compared to 13.7% of all non-equity financial assets, 28.07% of the national housing stock and 19.2% of total household net worth. What has changed dramatically as a result of the mutual fund boom is the distribution of bond ownership by wealth class. In 1992, the wealthiest 1.0% of the U.S. population owned 41.6% of all bonds compared to 78% in 1989. The next 9% of the population has expanded its share of the bond market from 16.1% to 46.3% while the other 90% of the population has boosted its share from 5.9% to 12.0%. Thirdly, the growth of the mutual fund sector is altering the ownership structure of the U.S. corporate sector. In 1994, mutual funds owned 13.6% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 7.1% in 1990, 5.0% in 1985 and 4.5-5.5% during the 1960's. During the modern era, the dominant trend in equity ownership has been a steady decline in the household share and a steady increase in the pension fund share. In 1951, households owned 90% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 1.1% for pension funds, 3.1% for mutual funds, 3.5% for insurance companies, and 2.2% for foreign investors. The household share remained high through the 1950's but plunged to 55.0-60.0% by the early 1970's while the pension fund share grew to 15.0-16.0% and bank personal trusts expanded to 11.0-12.0%. The household share of corporate equity continued to erode during the 1980's and is now only 47.7%. The bank trust account share also has slid to 2.7% while the pension fund share has been stable in the 24-26% range since the mid-1980's. The growth of defined contribution pension plans, individual retirement accounts, and 401-K plans will probably continue to boost the mutual fund share of U.S. corporate equity during the late 1990's at the expense of direct household ownership. But since households own two thirds of mutual fund assets as well as most trust fund and defined benefit pension plans asssets, analysts estimate that households still control about two thirds of all U.S. corporate equity on a direct and indirect basis. Fourthly, the growth of mutual fund assets has helped to encourage a tremendous boom in securitized finance by companies. The number of initial equity public offerings has risen to record high levels during recent years partly because of the demand for new securities from the mutual fund sector. The number of equity IPO's was 582 in 1995, 646 in 1994, 471 in 1993, 447 in 1992, 330 in 1991 and only 150 in 1990. These IPO's raised about $34 billion of new capital for companies in 1995, $30 billion in 1994, $25 billion in 1993, $19.4 billion in 1992, and $13.8 billion in 1991 compared to only $4.2 billion in 1990. The search for higher yields also revitalized the so-called "junk bond market". In 1993, Wall Street sold about $60 billion of non-investment grade bonds compared to $42 billion in 1992, $16.9 billion in 1991, and $2.9 billion in 1990. The improved access to equity and debt finance for small and medium sized companies is important to job creation because practically all of America's employment growth since 1980 has been concentrated in that sector. Between 1979 and 1994, the Fortune 500 companies reduced their employment from 16.2 million to 11.8 million. In the 1980's, the employment losses at large firms were offset by job creation at small firms, but during the early 1990's the economy stalled in part because the small firms lost access to the credit market. In 1993, by contrast, the mutual fund boom provided small firms with unprecedented access to the debt and equity markets while the recovery in bank profitability encouraged banks to ease their lending conditions as well. The securitization boom has even had a benign effect on the U.S. real estate market. During 1992 and 1993, Wall Street sold retail investors about 100 new Real Estate investment Trusts worth $12 billion. These trusts permit investors to invest in real estate without being subject to double taxation of income. They became popular as interest rates fell because commercial property still offered yields in the 10-12% range. As a result of the IPO boomlet for real estate, the market capitalization of the REIT sector now exceeds $60 billion compared to less than $10 billion during 1990. Fifth, the growth of the mutual fund industry is helping to encourage an unprecedented outflow of capital from the U.S. to foreign security markets. The number of purely international equity funds has expanded from 13 in 1984 to 367 while the number of global equity funds (including U.S.) has grown from 16 to 176. Meanwhile, the population of global bond funds has shot up from 1 in 1985 to 145 today. International and global equity funds have expanded their assets from $37 billion in 1992 to $212 billion recently while global bond funds grew from $27.6 billion to a peak of $40 billion in early 1994 before rising interest rates caused an upsurge of net redemptions which reduced assets to $33 billion in late 1995. The creation of this new infrastructure for retail diversification into foreign securities has made New York a far larger market for international bonds and equities than it has ever been before. But the retail demand for foreign securities is volatile. The share of money flows into international mutual funds peaked at 44% in early 1994 and then slumped to less than 20% during much of 1995 as Wall Street boomed. The assets of international money market funds have slumped from a peak of $21.4 billion during the period of high European interest rates after German unification to only $3.7 billion recently. In January, 1996, money flows into international and global equity funds shot up to over $6 billion from only $1-2 billion in mid-1995 but their share of total equity sales was still only 25%. Finally, the mutual fund boom is forcing banks to introduce new fund products in order to retain their share of household savings flows. In 1994, 2072 banks sold mutual funds and 46% of them were proprietary funds compared to 31.5% in 1991. In the early 1990's, banks primarily offered money market funds but they are also now actively promoting equity and bond funds. Such products accounted for over 70% of their money flows in 1994 compared to only about one half in 1991. Government officials are concerned that households may confuse mutual fund products with government insured deposits, so they are encouraging banks to carefully explain to customers that their mutual fund products do not enjoy FDIC protection but surveys indicate that bank customers do not always fully understand the distinction. The growth of bank sponsored mutual funds is also complicating the task of the Federal Reserve in monitoring the growth of the nation's monetary aggregates. The Fed includes money market funds in its measure of M2 but it does not include any share of bond and equity funds despite the fact that such funds often have check writing privileges. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013370 WT01-B14-24IA019-000202-B031-96http://www.kemper.com:80/holiday/ournewhome.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181008 text/html 3138HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:06:11 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Dec-96 15:21:40 GMTContent-length: 2956Content-type: text/html  Our New Home Cutting the ribbon at Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.'s new headquarters are (from left) Ed Noha, chairman, Chicago Economic Development Commission; Chicago Mayor Richard Daley; ZKI President, Chief Executive and Chief Investment Officer Stephen B.

For the one-year period, the fund received four stars and was rated among 1,654 fixed-income funds. In addition to its five-star overall rating, Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund received five stars for the one-, three- and five-year periods. It was rated among 2,864, 1,724, 1,031 and 575 domestic equity funds for the one-, three- and five-year periods, respectively. Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund also received five stars for the three-year period in the small company category. For the one-year period, the fund's rating is four stars or "above average." Ten percent of the funds in a rating category receive five stars, and the next 22.5 percent receive four stars. Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance through October 31, 1996. Ratings are calculated from the funds' three-, five-, and, where applicable, 10-year returns (with fee adjustments) in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns. The one-year rating is calculated using the same methodology, but is not a component of the overall rating. Ratings are subject to change every month.

(continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) October 21,1996 At present, there appear to be only three events which couldjeopardize investor confidence in the 1997 outlook. The firstrisk would be a resurgence of output growth during the fourthquarter that also revived expectations of Federal Reserve tightening.The second risk would be a surprise slowdown in the economy sosevere and protracted that it encouraged a sharp downward revisionof 1997 profit forecasts. The third risk would be a Democraticvictory in the congressional elections on a scale which gave themthe capacity to enact new legislation despite defections by somemembers of their dwindling band of southern conservatives (saya majority over 25). The dominant economic risk in the outlook continues to be thepotential for a resurgence of output growth during the next fewquarters. On the basis of preliminary data, it appears thatreal GDP growth slowed to only 1.5-2.0% during the third quarterbecause of a pause in consumer spending during the summer. Butthe economy has experienced such pauses in the past and it isdifficult to imagine the recent one being sustained when the financialenvironment is so supportive of employment and income growth.Consumer spending expanded at a 3.5% annual rate during the firsthalf of 1996 and nothing has happened during the interim to suggestit should remain subdued for longer than one quarter. The Universityof Michigan survey of consumer confidence held at 94.8 in earlyOctober compared to an average of 91.5 during the second quarterand 94.9 during the third quarter. The Conference Board surveyof confidence also held at 111.8 during September compared to112 in August and an average of 102.8 during the second quarter.Households are upbeat because of optimism about their personalfinancial situation and the labor market. In September, 26.7%said jobs were plentiful compared to 24.6% in June and 21.3% inJanuary. As a result of the stock market boom, the demand for discretionarygoods and luxuries is very robust at present. The FinancialTimes reports that the most recent issue of Vogue had over 700pages of advertisements, the highest number in over a decade.While stock ownership is concentrated among the top decile ofAmerica's population, other income groups can benefit from wealthcreation in the equity market through a declining cost of capitaland increased business investment, not just luxury goods consumption.The volume and value of equity IPO offerings this year could exceedthe 1993 record of $56 billion. Moody's recently reported thatthe number of credit upgrades during the third quarter exceededdowngrades by 80%, the highest ratio of upgrades to downgradesin two decades. There were 60 upgrades accounting for $39 billionof debt in the industrial sector compared to 14 downgrades covering$14.2 billion of debt. Consumer optimism also should benefit from the Federal Reserve'sdecision to leave interest rates unchanged at the latest FOMCmeeting. According to the University of Michigan survey of consumerconfidence, most households had been expecting a modest interestrate hike to occur this autumn. The decision of the Federal Reserveto take chances on the side of growth should reassure householdsthat the risks of recession during the next twelve months is minimal. The primary risk to consumer spending during the next few quartersis that banks will react to rising loan losses on credit cardoperations by imposing tougher quality standards on new applicantsand reducing the credit lines of existing customers. But surveysof bank lending policies suggest that they are making only modestchanges in credit access. The U.S. banking sector is currentlyenjoying such robust profits that few institutions will want tosacrifice market share by significantly curtailing lending volume.In the August survey of lending conditions, for example, 90.9%of banks said their credit policies for small business were unchangedcompared to 5.5% which said they were easing and 3.6% which saidthey were tightening. The large expansion of the U.S. trade deficit during July andAugust is encouraging many analysts to shave their third quartergrowth forecasts but the surge of imports will be partly offsetby increased inventory building. Inventories were very low atthe end of the second quarter and firms had to expand them duringthe third quarter in order to get ready for the fourth quarterretail season. If there is a rebound in consumer spending during the fourth quarter,total output growth will probably rise back into the 3.0-3.5%range from only 1.5-2.5% during the third quarter. As such a highlevel of output growth would probably push the unemployment ratebelow 5.0%, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve would respondby raising interest rates during late 1996 or early 1997. Whatremains unclear is whether the FOMC will have sufficient informationby its November 14th meeting to act shortly after the presidentialelection. If the upcoming government reports on employmentcosts and labor market conditions show further signs of wage accelerationas well as renewed job creation, the odds are high that the hawkson the FOMC will revive their demands for an interest rate hike.The demands for tightening at the late September FOMC meetingwere subdued because of Mr. Alan Greenspan's anger about the leakto the Reuters news service of proposals from eight district banksfor a hike in the discount rate. But with unemployment well below5.0% in regions accounting for 45% of the national labor market,many district presidents will continue to advocate a tighter monetarypolicy at the next FOMC meeting. At the recent IMF meeting, Mr. Greenspan assured many foreigngovernment officials that the U.S. inflation rate is still undercontrol despite the country's low level of unemployment. Buthe also qualified his statement by stressing the unusual natureof the current equilibrium in the labor market. He said thatthe traditional relationship between unemployment and wages hadbroken down because of the great concern about employment stabilityamong American workers. The obsession with job security has greatlylessened demands for pay growth compared to past business cycles.But Mr. Greenspan stressed there is no way of telling how longthis job security obsession will restrain wages in the face ofa prolonged period of low unemployment. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1024320 WT01-B14-32IA018-000197-B002-186http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/howlong2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172704 text/html 9954HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:23:05 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 30-Oct-96 15:14:23 GMTContent-length: 9769Content-type: text/html How Long Can the Federal Reserve Delay Tightening? (continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 26, 1996 According to Lindsey, the number of credit card delinquencieshas increased sharply during the past two years but the volumeof loans which is delinquent has increased by much less. Thehousehold sector has also been experiencing a sharp rise in itsasset values, not just its leverage. Since 1991, the householdsector has enjoyed a $4.75 trillion capital gain on its equityportfolio and $9.5 trillion gain on its total assets while liabilitieshave increased by only $1.5 trillion. The major risk in the debtexpansion is its concentration among lower income Americans. As Lindsey explained, "We estimate, that on average, the household sector increasedits debt-to-income ratio about 5 percentage points between 1992and 1995. This was the result of a 2 percentage point increasein mortgage debt, from 59.8 percent of income to 61.9 percentof income and a 3 percentage point increase in non-mortgage consumerdebt, from 16.9 percent of income o 19.8 percent of income." "Nevertheless, the survey does suggest some interestingtrends in the distribution of this debt. Typically, householdsearning more than $100,000 per year sharply reduced their debtlevels between 1992 and 1995. The share of total household debtheld by these households fell from one-third to one-quarter andthis decline was particularly concentrated among households earningmore than $250,000 per year. These upper income groups experienceda decline in both the mean and median absolute level of debt outstanding,while all other income groups increased their debt." "The decline in the debt levels for these groups makesthe rise in debt levels for other groups more striking. For example,households with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 increasedtheir rates of aggregate mortgage debt to aggregate income byabout one-sixth and their corresponding consumer debt to incomeratio by roughly 50 percent." "Of course, some households increased their debt substantiallymore than this, some not at all. The Survey of Consumer Financedoes indicate a striking increase in the willingness to go intodebt in the $50,00 to $100,000 income group. The proportionof survey households in this income group reporting credit carddebt rose 13 percentage points, from 51% in 1992 to 64% in 1995,compared to a 4 point increase, from 44 percent to 48 percentfor the whole population. Those holding installment debt suchas auto loans increased from 52 percent to 59 percent in thisincome group while the proportion in the overall population withthis type of debt was unchanged. Nearly 60 percent of the totalincrease in non-mortgage debt outstanding was assumed by householdsin this income group." "Debt increases for households earning under $50,000 werealso sizable. The increasing attractiveness of various typesof financing tied to one's home produced a particularly largeincrease in the ratio of mortgage debt to income. It should benoted that although the mortgage debt to income ratio increasejust 7 percentage points for households earning under $25,000,compared to 10 to 11 percentage points for households earnings$25,000 to $100,000, home ownership rates are much lower amongthis segment of the population. Adjusted for the lower levelof home ownership rates among this income group, mortgage debtto income ratios increased more for these lower income groupsthan for the $50,000 to $100,000 income group. I might add thatthe rapid expansion of mortgage financing among low and moderateincome groups is borne out by other data as well. We will notknow for some time what he overall effect of this lending willbe on default and delinquency rates." "But these data also show that while some of the addedcredit extension during this period is to people in income groupsthat traditionally haven't owed much debt, the bulk is not. Whileoverall debt levels increased for all groups earning under $100,000,the only group to increase its relative share of such non-mortgagedebt was the $50,000 to $100,000 income group. Thus, it isreasonable to conclude that the main reason for the householddebt expansion of recent years is not so much an extension ofdebt to new households, but an increase in the debt levels takenon by fairly well-to-do segments of the population to whom beingin debt (albeit not at these levels) is not an unusual experience." Governor Lindsey's testimony on the debt issue is important becausein previous speeches he has warned about the risk of leverageexcesses in the household sector. His September testimony suggeststhat consumer debt will pose risks for middle income familiesduring future recessions but that there will not be an abruptdecline of borrowing or suspension of credit access by banks largeenough to trigger a business downturn during the twelve months. The disagreements which exist in both the private sector and theFed about the economy's optimal growth rate will not be resolvablefor some time. If the economy can continue to enjoy output growthof 2.5-3.5% with no upward pressure on inflation, there will beincreasing support for the view that government data underestimatesproductivity growth as well as the economy's effective capitalstock. But as adopting such a position today would require theFed to take risks on the side of inflation without totally conclusiveproof that the economy's optimal growth rate is higher than 2.0-2.5%,it is doubtful that they will remain passive if output growthrebounds to the 3.0-3.5% range during the fourth quarter. Theywould probably tighten by at least 50 basis points during Novemberand December. The American forecasting community has a generally pessimisticview of the outlook for both output growth and the resilienceof corporate profit margins next year. In the most recentBlue Chip survey of the economic consensus, forecasters projectedoutput growth of 2.2% and CPI inflation of 3.0% during 1997 comparedto 2.4% for growth and 3.0% for inflation this year. The greatcontrast in the 1996 and 1997 forecasts centers on corporate profits. American forecasters are projecting only 3.1% profit growth nextyear compared to 9.0% during 1996. The pessimism about profitssuggests that analysts expect rising wages to come at the expenseof corporate profit margins rather than higher inflation. If the U.S. forecasting consensus is correct, the Fed should beable to fine tune another year of modest growth during 1997 withonly modest interest rate hikes or even with a stable monetarypolicy. The problem with such forecasts is that it is difficultto believe that business or household psychology will remain staticin the face of a sixth and seventh year of uninterrupted economicexpansion. If everyone concludes that the risk of a recessionis minimal, it is difficult to believe that investment plans,hiring intentions or wage expectations will remain consistentwith output growth of only 2.2% and real interest rates of 2.0-2.5%against the backdrop of an unemployment rate in the 4.5-5.0% range. As a result, the odds are high that there will be more cyclicalvolatility in the economy during the year ahead than is currentlybeing reflected in the forecasting community. Either the economywill lose momentum on a sustained basis this autumn or outputgrowth will rebound and set the stage for a monetary policy adjustmentwhich will reduce output growth to only 1.0-1.5% for two quartersduring the second half of 1997or early 1998. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1023160 WT01-B14-33IA018-000197-B002-190http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/risingbondyields2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172711 text/html 7165HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:23:13 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 13-Sep-96 20:32:56 GMTContent-length: 6983Content-type: text/html Will Rising Bond Yields Force The Fed To Tighten? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 2, 1996 As domestic final sales grew at a 4.5% annual rate during the first quarter and 4.8% during the second quarter, the optimists are far more likely to be right than the pessimists. The economy does not suddenly fade when final demand is resilient and there are no major policy shocks to depress confidence. The August purchasing agent survey confirmed that the July pause in output was temporary and there is no reason for output growth to slow during September unless there is a strike in the auto industry. As a result, the odds are high that U.S. forecasters will soon revise up their fourth quarter forecasts to the 2.5-3.5% range from the current range of 1.5-2.2%. Such revisions will then set the stage for Fed tightening of at least 25 basis points by late September. If the August employment report shows robust gains in job creation, the Fed could tighten even sooner but such a dramatic gesture will probably require the unemployment rate to drop to 5.2% or less. The minutes of the early July FOMC meeting depicted the divergences which exist both in the Fed and private sector forecasting community very accurately. The majority believed that ... " The most likely outcome was a slowing of the expansion to a more sustainable pace and a continuation of subdued inflation. Nevertheless, they were concerned that the risks to that outcome were tilted toward higher inflation. While a strong economy generally was a welcome development, at current levels of resource use a continuation of rapid growth was not likely to be sustainable because it would have the potential for adding significantly to inflation pressures. However, inflation had remained relatively damped thus far and the rise in interest rates among other factors was expected to curb demand. Moreover, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment. The current stance of monetary policy could not be described in this view as clearly accommodative. While the federal funds rate had been reduced appreciably in nominal terms over the past year, its current level on an inflation-adjusted basis seems to be only marginally below its peak prior to mid-1995. In the circumstances, the Committee could afford to wait for more evidence to see whether additional inflation pressures were like to develop" The dissidents from the majority view warned that continued strong output growth would undermine the Fed's inflation targets. The minutes noted, "A differing view gave more emphasis to prospects for rising inflation and the need for immediate action to forestall a buildup of cost and price pressures before they undermined the expansion. There was little firm evidence that economic growth was slowing and reports of appreciable wage pressures were increasing. Inflation expectations persisted in financial markets, and probably in product and labor markets as well; if they were allowed to worsen the Committee's long-run goal of price stability would become much more difficult to achieve. Delaying action risked the need for a greater adjustment in policy at a later date with possible disruption to the economy" The committee decided to approve only a change in their policy bias, not an actual interest rate hike, because of the psychological impact of raising interest rates. The minutes said "Some noted that a policy tightening action would tend to have a more pronounced effect than usual because it would indicate a shift in the direction of policy and might generate expectations of further tightening". At the FOMC meeting in late September, the Fed will probably have new evidence of the economy expanding at a rate close to 3.0% but few signs of accelerating inflation at the retail level. The factors which will force the Fed to hike interest rates will be concern about the intermediate term inflation consequence of the unemployment rate dropping close to 5.0% and large increases in long-term bond yields. The fact that the two dissenting votes on monetary policy during the past nine months have come from district presidents in the middle west (Minneapolis, Kansas City) also suggests that the district presidents could play a more important role than usual in the conduct of monetary policy this autumn. As a result of their location in strong growth regions such as the middle west, the rocky mountain states and California, they are more aware of how low unemployment and aggressive bank lending practices are affecting business behavior than the Washington based governors who depend upon government statistical reports and staff forecasts which often lag behind developments in the private sector. The fact that the Fed's own staff has greatly underestimated the economy's growth rate this year will probably also increase the determination of the district presidents to become more vociferous about the potential inflation risks of the economy expanding at an above trend growth rate for another year. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1021740 WT01-B14-34IA018-000197-B002-200http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/greensp2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172725 text/html 11362HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:23:20 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:24:48 GMTContent-length: 11179Content-type: text/html Is Wall Street Experiencing a Greenspan or Gephardt Correction? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) July 29, 1996 The slowdown in the high technology sector is of greater important than in thepast because of the role which it has played in sustaining growth since 1994 asdemand for autos and housing slowdown. Business expenditures on office and computer machinery now accounts for about1.8% of real GDP compared to 0.6% during 1990 and less than 0.2% during theearly 1980's. Its nominal share of GDP is about 1.0% compared to 0.7% in 1990and 1.1% in 1984. According to Hewlett Packard, the nominal growth rate ofcomputer spending could slow to 0-5% by the first quarter of 1997. Under sucha scenario, the real growth rate would drop to about 5-10% from 30-40% during1995 and early 1996. While such a slowdown will represent a major negativeswing from the sector's previous growth rate, it is by no means anunprecedented adjustment. During the mid-1980's, the growth rate of office andcomputer equipment spending fluctuated in a range of plus 80% at annual ratesto only slightly positive growth. In the 1990 recession, real spendingactually fell by over 20%. The other investment sector which has enjoyed buoyant during recent years iscommunications equipment. It's share of real GDP has expanded to .95% from.7% during 1992 and a previous peak of just under 1.0% during the mid-1980's.The growth rate of communications equipment investment has already slowed from25% during mid-1994 to 6-7% recently. Since the economy's two most vulnerable high technology sectors account forless than 3.0% of GDP, they will not be able to change the economy's overalldirection if other sectors are enjoying moderate growth. The correctionoccurring in high technology capital investment is a far more importantphenomena for the stock market than for the economy because of the leadershiprole which technology companies have played in the market during recentyears. As a result of the buoyant outlook for corporate profits and the high level ofcapacity utilization rates, other capital spending sectors should continue toenjoy moderate growth this year. Industrial equipment accounts for about 1.8%of both nominal and real GDP. It has already slowed from a growth rate of over15% during late 1994 to about 6-7% recently. The truck and bus sector ofequipment investment is highly cyclical and has already experienced a majoradjustment. Its growth rate has dropped from a peak of nearly 40% in late 1993to only 2-3% recently. The sector has a history of experiencing sub-cyclecontractions even during periods of steady growth in the economy, so it couldcontinue to decline during the second half of 1996 and then could reboundduring 1997 (as it did during the sub-cycle of the mid-1980's). The arguments for the Fed to tighten in the face of these risks to final demandgrowth center on inflation expectations in the private sector and theuncertainty which exists about the magnitude of any late 1996 slowdown in themidst of a financial environment which appears to be highly supportive ofgrowth. The Fed has been able to fine tune the economy during the 1990's withoutrisking a recession in part because of the confidence which it enjoys amonginvestors and business decision makers. If they saw the Fed remaining passivein the face of rising wages in order to sustain a prolonged period of fullemployment, they would start to increase their forecasts of the intermediateterm inflation outlook. While the adjustments might be small at first, therewould be a clear and increasing tendency for analyst to assume a core inflationrate closer to 4.0% than 3.0% by late 1997. While there are numerous reasons why final demand could slow in some importantsectors during the next nine months, the financial environment in the U.S.remains so buoyant that it is difficult to imagine a prolonged period of outputgrowth below 2.0%. Banks are competing so aggressively to make loans thatmost small business owners can now chose between four and five potentiallenders if they have to finance a new investment or a sale of their business.The boom in the stock market and the expansion of the mutual fund industry hasproduced a very buoyant environment for new equity IPO's and the sale ofnon-investment grade bonds. The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during thefirst half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994, and apeak of 665 during 1993. These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during thefirst half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion last year, $22.9 billion during1994 and $34.0 billion during 1993. The peak for I.P.O. financing during the1980's, by contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986. The search for higheryields also has helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market. In thefirst half of 1996, Wall Street sold 92 new non-investment grade bond offeringcompared to 159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993. The fundsraised were $17.1 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during1995, $31.5 billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993. The previouspeak in non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billionduring 1986. It is difficult to imagine a self-reinforcing slowdown when capital is soreadily available to the entrepreneurial companies responsible for most ofAmerica's job creation. Meanwhile, the appreciation of the stock market hasboosted the net worth of the household sector by almost $2 billion since 1994.If the household sector spends only 5% of its capital gains, the potentialboost to consumer spending is $100 billion. The correction now occurring inthe equity market will inhibit new wealth creation but the market has beenrobust for so long that wealth losses are unlikely to be a depressing influenceon household spending until next year. Are the Financial Markets Focusing on the Election? The major focus of media commentary about the stock market during July was therisk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. But equityinvestors were probably also concerned about the continuing poor performance offormer Senator Robert Dole in the presidential opinion polls. Dole hasperformed so poorly in the polls that there is growing concern about theability of the Republican Party to retain control of Congress. Wall Street haslong perceived the president to be a superior campaigner but investors hadexpected Dole to benefit from the conviction of the Governor of Arkansas forcorruption in June as well as his resignation from the Senate. Clinton'sseeming immunity to his scandals has so unnerved the Republicans that they areabout to announce a major tax cut program in order to bolster Dole's electoralappeal. As Dole has devoted his whole career to reducing federal deficits andcriticizing supply side economists, it is far from clear that the new strategywill work but his new tax proposals will at least allow him to reinvoke theoptimistic message of Ronald Reagan during the early 1980's. The August political conventions will provide the next important test ofinvestor sentiment about the election. As political conventions focusgreat media attention on candidates, they typically give a boost to thechallenger who is attempting to establish credibility as an alternative to theincumbent. As Clinton is already 15-20 points ahead, investor concern aboutDole will evolve into alarm about both the presidential and congressional racesif he does not emerge from the convention narrowing the gap with Clinton by atleast 10 points. The prospect of the Republicans losing control of Congress is potentiallydisturbing to Wall Street for three reasons, First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for bothparties. No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections sinceFranklin Roosevelt in the 1930's. The Republican Party has not controlled theCongress for two consecutive terms since the 1920's. If the Republicans losecontrol again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away fromtheir themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, andpromoting lower marginal income tax rates. Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the DemocraticParty in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories. TheRepublican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southernConfederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960. On the basisof pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claimcontrol over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if theylose their overall majority. As a result of the Republican takeover of thesouth, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of thenortheast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that futureDemocratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spendingprograms and other forms of government intervention in the economy than boththe current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1019990 WT01-B14-35IA018-000197-B002-217http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/delayed2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172759 text/html 12191HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:23:53 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:24:34 GMTContent-length: 12008Content-type: text/html Will Delayed Fed Tightening Set the Stage For An October StockMarket Crash? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) June 21, 1996 While the government's newly revised labor market data point toa much stronger economy than analysts anticipated a few monthsago, not every survey of labor market conditions is as robust.Dun and Bradstreet recently published the results of its latestsurvey of business hiring intentions for 1996. The survey is projectingthat firms will create only 1.4 million new jobs this year comparedto 3 million jobs in last year's survey. The survey reports thatsmall firms will hire more cautiously but that large firms willexpand their hiring -- a reversal of the trend which has prevailedduring recent years. It said, "About 21 percent of the nation's smallest businesses expectto add jobs this year. As a group, mid-sized firms were slightlymore optimistic, with roughly 28 percent predicting higher employmentlevels. However, the 199,000 jobs expected among firms with 20to 99 employees is down 56 percent in comparison with last year.Firms with 100 to 999 employees expect to add about 387,000 jobs,down 43 percent from last year. Businesses with between 1,000and 9,999 employees say they will hire 185,000 new employees,down form 268,000 last year." "Only the nation's largest employers predict faster job growthin 1996 than in 1995, a significant reversal of the downsizingtrend of the past decade. Businesses employing more than 10,000workers expect to add about 113,000 jobs this year. That representsan increase of 47 percent from last year's survey." As the payroll survey of employment has already increased by 1.8million jobs this year, the D&B survey is either wrong orthe economy is poised for a sudden slowing of employment growth.But the survey may be misleading this year because firms appearto be concerned about labor shortages, not just concerns overslower growth of the economy. As the survey noted, "A high percentage of U.S. employers are finding it difficultto locate qualified workers. Thirty-six percent of all firms saythey have trouble finding qualified workers. High-tech and skilledlabor markets are reporting the most serious labor shortage. Fifty-twopercent of construction firms, for instance, reported troublefinding qualified workers, and 41 percent of manufacturers haddifficulty. Among the transportation/public utilities, retailtrade and services sectors, 38 percent, 37 percent and 34 percent,respectively, of all firms surveyed said they had trouble findingqualified workers." It is also possible that American firms have underestimatedtheir employment needs because they have been influenced by theconsensus among U.S. forecasters that 1996 would be a year ofsluggish output growth. According to the June 10th Blue Chipsurvey of the U.S. forecasting community, forecasters have increasedtheir expectations for second quarter growth to 3.3% from 2.1%during March and 2.7% during May, but they continue to projecta sharp slowing to growth rates of only 2.3% and 2.0% during thefinal two quarters of the year. Those forecasts are no higherthan March's despite the fact that first half growth will be twiceas high as most forecasters projected in January. The surprising resilience of the U.S. economy since January createssome potentially challenging questions for the Federal Reserve.Should it reverse its January easing move with a 25 basis pointrate hike at its July third FOMC meeting? Should it delay anytightening move until it has more clear-cut evidence on the thirdquarter outlook and tighten at the late August meeting, whichwill coincide with the Democratic national convention? Shouldit wait until the July employment report in early August and changeits recent custom of adjusting policy only at FOMC meetings bymaking an adjustment in response to new information appearingbetween the FOMC meetings? As inflation has remained remarkablysubdued despite the economy's strong performance this year, shouldthe Fed simply revise up its estimate of the economy's optimalpotential growth rate and not tighten until there is clear-cutevidence of accelerating inflation? The odds are high that the Fed will raise interest rates atsome point this summer. The big questions center on whetherthe policy adjustment will occur in July or August and whetherthey will occur on the actual day of FOMC meetings. As inflationhas been well behaved and there is still no consensus in the privatesector about the second half outlook, the Fed can rationalizeremaining passive at its July meeting. But if the July data appearingin early August suggests output growth will remain close to 3.0%during the third quarter, bond yields will rise to at least 7.50%and intensify pressure on the Fed to hike short-term interestrates. As the Fed will probably not want its tightening actionto coincide with a major political convention, it could take advantageof the early August data reports to act a few weeks ahead of theFOMC meeting. With an election looming for both the White House and the Congress,there will be political criticism of any Fed tightening this summer,but Mr. Greenspan will have little problem justifying his action.If output growth remains at 3.0% or higher during the secondhalf of 1995, the unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% by yearend. Despite the recent turmoil in the copper market, therewill also be a firming of industrial commodity prices and thepurchasing agent price index will probably climb back into the60-70 range from 50 during May and 40 during April. While it would be natural for the administration to frown uponFed tightening during the summer before a presidential election,the fact is it would be far more prudent for the Fed to movequickly this summer than to delay policy adjustments until theautumn. As the Fed is still in a fine turning mode, any policyadjustment this summer would only have a marginal impact on thegrowth rate of output and real income this autumn. But procrastinationby the Fed could set the stage for large and destabilizing fluctuationsin bond and equity prices. If the Fed adheres to a passive policythis summer, the Dow Jones Industrial Index could shoot up to6,000 and push the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDPto 92-93% compared to its previous peak of 81.0% in 1929. If theFed continued to be surprised by the economy's resilience duringthe third quarter, it could feel compelled to tighten by 50 basispoints or more during the autumn and set the stage for a majorequity market correction. If the equity market correction waslarge and compressed into a few days (as it was in October, 1987),it could have a far more damaging impact on the economic credibilityof the Clinton administration than modest Fed tightening thissummer. Fed officials are reluctant to comment in public about the stockmarket but they are privately apprehensive about both the levelof equity prices and the extraordinary flow of retail money intoequity mutual funds. As a result, they should understand thelogic of adjusting interest rates this summer rather than delayingpolicy changes in a way which might maximize the risk of a financialaccident later this year. Fed fine tuning will not eliminateall stock market risk in the outlook. If the economy continuesto expand at a rate of 3.0-4.0% despite the Fed hiking short-terminterest rates by 25-50 basis points, the Fed could feel compelledto push short-term interest rates all the way back to 6.0% oreven higher. In such a scenario, it would be difficult to avoida major stock market correction during the fourth quarter. Butas the Fed tightening would be spread over a period of three tosix months, investors would have time to adjust to the policychange and the risk would diminish of a 1987 style stock marketcrash. Tobin's Q and Market Prices There has been extensive media discussion during recent weeksabout the risk of a large stock market correction occurring autonomouslyfrom any monetary tightening because of the current ratio of shareprices to asset replacement costs. The so-called Tobin's Q ratioof share prices to asset replacement costs is now at 1.7 comparedto a range of 0.3 to 1.4 before 1994. The Tobin Q ratio is computedon the basis of Federal Reserve data which shows that the U.S.corporate sector has a current net worth value of just under $4trillion compared to a stock market which is now capitalized atover $7 trillion. In 1994, the components of net worth were equipmentvalued at $2.009 trillion, inventory valued at $1.037 trillionand real estate valued at $2.1702 trillion. The real estate valueincludes buildings worth $2.078 trillion and land worth $92.2billion. The Fed is still compiling data for 1995 but on a preliminarybasis it is projecting that corporate current value net worthwill rise to $4247.3 billion, with the components consisting of$2.233 trillion of real estate, $2.089 trillion of equipment and$1.145 trillion of inventory. The equipment and building components of the current value estimatesof corporate net worth are computed with broad indices of inflationin the capital goods sector. The estimates of land value are basedon national surveys of real estate prices. As there has been deflationin many high technology capital goods industries during the 1990's,the value of non-residential plant and equipment has increasedby only 12% since 1990 despite large increases in capital investment.The corporate sector's land values, by contrast, have fallenby almost 90% from their peak of $940 billion in 1989. While thereis no doubt that land values have fallen during the 1990's, itis far from clear that the decline has been as steep as the FederalReserve data suggests. If land values were restated to showa decline of only 50%, corporate net worth would increase by $380billion and the Tobin Q ratio would decline to 1.58 from 1.7.If land values were still at 1989 levels, corporate net worthwould increase by almost $900 billion and Tobin's Q would declineto 1.42. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1018480 WT01-B14-36IA018-000197-B002-237http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/tighten2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172811 text/html 9929HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:24:10 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:25:03 GMTContent-length: 9747Content-type: text/html Will the Fed Tighten in July or August? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) May 29, 1996 The prospect of the U.S. being the first G-7 country to raiseinterest rates this year suggests that the dollar will retainthe bias towards firmness which has been apparent during recentweeks. The German economy should improve during the summer but the Bundesbankis unlikely to tighten until mid-1997 at the earliest. Germanyhas a large output gap and Bundesbank officials favor a weak D-markin order to discourage support from German industry for the introductionof a new European currency. The major constraint on further easingthis spring is the industrial unrest now occurring in Germany'spublic sector as well as Bundesratt opposition to Chancellor Kohl'sproposed cuts in government expenditure. In Japan, there are increasing signs of economic recovery butofficials are downplaying the possibility of monetary tighteningbecause of the lingering credit quality problems of the financialsystem. Tokyo journalists also report that recent bureaucraticshuffles at the Ministry of Finance have increased the odds ofDr. Eisuke Sakakibara being reappointed for another year as theDirector General of the international finance bureau. As Dr.Sakakibara has been a strong promoter of a firm dollar with bothJapanese investment firms and the New York hedge funds, his reappointmentshould be a psychological plus for the U.S. dollar. He does notfavor pushing the dollar all the way to 130 yen, as some pressreports have suggested, but he will certainly try to hold theyen dollar rate in a trading range of 105-110 in order to promotefurther improvement in Japanese corporate profitability. The only potential negative factor for the dollar during the nextfew quarters is increasing political risk in the U.S. and reducedpolitical risk in other countries. It now appears that Mr. Yeltsinwill win the Russian presidential election and lessen the dangerof investors selling the currencies of Germany and other centralEuropean countries because of a communist victory. In the U.S.,by contrast, the opinion polls suggest that President Clintoncould win such a large victory in this November's presidentialelection that he might be able to pull many new Democrats intoCongress with him. According to some pollsters, the Republicanshave potentially thirty vulnerable House freshmen while the Democratsare likely to lose about four to six open seats in the south. If there is a net swing of 24 seats, the Democrats would be ableto retake control of the House and elect their majority leader,Rep. Richard Gephardt, as Speaker. The market would be concernedabout a Democratic recapture of the House for three reasons. First, Rep. Gephardt has often been an advocate of protectionisttrade policies in the past and was hostile to the administration'sfinancial rescue program for Mexico. Secondly, the Democratic Party has lost so many of its traditionalsouthern seats that it is a party increasingly dominated by thebig cities of the northeast, the middle west, and California aswell as their lower middle class suburbs. Whereas the DemocraticParty had over 95% of the southern Congressional delegation asrecently as the early 1960's, it now has only one quarter of theseats in the old Confederacy and could emerge from the next electionwith only 10-15%. As a result, many of the new committee chairmanin a Democratic controlled Congress would be from poor urban districtsin cities such as Detroit, New York and Los Angeles. Theywould be far more left of center on many economic policy issues,such as public spending and labor market regulation, than boththe current Republican chairmen and the past Democratic committeechairmen. Finally, many investors would view a Democratic victory as a majorlost opportunity for structural reform of social security, Medicareand other federal programs. As the Republicans have not controlledCongress for two consecutive terms since the 1920's and mightwell engage in a demoralizing fratricidal conflict if they losecontrol again after only one term, it is unclear when an opportunityfor structural reform would re-emerge. In fact, the markets areconfronted with a unique set of historical circumstances thisyear. No Democratic President has won re-election for two consecutiveterms since the days of Franklin Roosevelt while the Republicanshave not controlled Congress for two consecutive terms since the1920's. Hence, if one were to extrapolate on the basis of history,they would project that Senator Robert Dole would emerge as thenext president and that Richard Gephardt would be the new HouseSpeaker. The odds of such an outcome appear modest today becausea Dole victory would probably guarantee Republican retention ofthe Congress while a Clinton victory would not insure a Democratictakeover of the House unless he won by a landslide. But unlessSenator Dole rallies in the polls, the markets could become alarmedabout the prospect of the Republicans suffering an electoral debaclethis November. Despite the current wide gap in the opinion polls, it wouldbe premature for investors to conclude that the President is assuredof re-election. The Dole campaign is currently sufferingfrom money problems and his responsibilities in the Senate, butfour factors suggest that Senator Dole should enjoy a significantimprovement during the autumn. First, the Republicans have astrong hold on several southern and western states with about160-170 electoral votes. Secondly, the President has been pursuingre-election by emphasizing Republican themes, such as a balancedbudget and family values. While the strategy has worked so far,the media could ultimately portray him as such a cynical manipulatorof public opinion that it will backfire. Thirdly, the recentconviction of the Governor of Arkansas and Mr. Clinton's formerreal estate partners on various allegations of fraud will forcethe media to probe further into allegations of corruption duringhis tenure as Governor of Arkansas. As Arkansas has many of thecharacteristics of an emerging market, press scrutiny of the statecoupled with the Starr investigations of the first family's financialaffairs could easily revive doubts about the president's character. Finally, despite Mr. Dole's long history in U.S. public life,pollsters working with voter focus groups have discovered thatmost Americans know very little about him. At one Republicanfocus group, for example, only 25% of the voters were aware ofMr. Dole's record during World War Two. As the presidential campaignintensifies and the media focuses more closely on the characterof the candidates, Senator Dole is likely to benefit at the expenseof the president. To summarize, the U.S. economy is likely to expandat a 3.0-4.0% annual rate during the second quarter because ofsteady growth of consumption and investment as well as corporaterestocking of inventories. There is still widespread disagreementabout the outlook for third quarter growth but recent reportson employment intentions and capital goods demand suggest thatoutput growth should remain close to 3.0%. As a result, therewill be further increases in the economy's level of resource utilizationwhich could encourage the Federal Reserve to tighten monetarypolicy at the FOMC meeting in early July or late August. Therecovery now underway in the economies of Latin America, Chinaand other developing countries, coupled with the cyclical upturnprojected for Europe and Japan also suggest that world outputgrowth could exceed 4.0% this year and next year for the firsttime since 1988. The dollar should remain firm because of thestrength of the U.S. economy and the desire of government officialsin both Germany and Japan to encourage depreciation of the D-markand the yen. (D.

(continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) May 6, 1996 The performance of the financial markets will also play an important role in the FOMC thinking. If bond yields rise well above 7.0% while the stock market remains firm, more governors will be willing to tighten policy in order to restrain investors' inflation expectations. Conversely, if rising bond yields produce a large stock market correction, there will be more reluctance to tighten because of concern about household wealth losses. The personal savings rate has begun to decline after rising sharply last year, but it could easily change direction if households become pessimistic about the economy because of falling equity prices. If the Federal Reserve does raise interest rates this summer, it will be the first G-7 central bank to break with the pattern of global easing which has prevailed since early 1995. Japanese interest rates have fallen to such low levels that the next policy change has to be a rate hike, but such a hike is unlikely to occur until late this year because of the credit quality problems of the Japanese financial system. Monetary policy in Germany is likely to remain easy because of the government's moves towards fiscal restraint, the weakness of the German economy, and the moral hazard problems created by the increasingly probable replacement of the D-mark by a new European currency in the year 1999. Since Chancellor Kohl's coalition won a decisive victory in the German lander elections during late March, both financial markets and European central bank officials have begun to assign a much higher probability to the introduction of a new European currency in the year 1999. French bond yields have fallen sharply in relation to German bond yields while the German yield curve has remained positively sloped because of investor apprehension about the loss of the D-mark. Bundesbank officials have many doubts about the viability of a new European currency, but they cannot stop Chancellor Kohl from going forward unless there is some exogenous political shock which erodes his power. Instead of actively resisting the introduction of the Euro, many Bundesbank officials have decided to encourage a gradual devaluation of the D-mark in order to lessen the support of German industry for switching to a new European currency. As foreign investors own nearly 40% of Germany's public debt, the Bundesbank cannot push this devaluation strategy too far, but there is little doubt that they would be willing to accept a 10-15% decline against the U.S. dollar and the yen as well as smaller corrections against other European currencies. The prospect of Germany and other European countries pursuing an easy monetary policy in order to weaken their currencies, coupled with the likelihood of Japanese monetary policy remaining on hold through the autumn, increases the possibility of a positive growth surprise occurring in the G-7 countries next year. The easy monetary conditions in the G-7 countries are also reviving capital flows to the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa and thus increasing the odds that they will enjoy stronger recoveries as well. A few developing countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, are raising interest rates in order to constrain domestic inflation pressures, but they are still likely to experience growth rates in excess of 7.0%. The Yeltsin government is pursuing such populist fiscal policies in order to win the upcoming Russian presidential election, it will certainly have to reverse course if it wins, but the emergence of a large private sector in Russia should still permit positive output growth in the future after a long period of contraction. After three years of tightening monetary policy in order to restrain inflation, China also has begun to relax monetary policy during recent days. On May 1st, it announced a reduction in the cost of working capital loans from 12.06% to 10.98%. These interest rate adjustments also followed a selective easing of credit rationing policies late last year. If we measure GDP on the basis of purchasing power parity adjustments to compensate for price differentials, Europe accounts for about 25% of world output, the U.S. for about 22%, Japan for about 9%, and China for about 8%. Monetary policy has therefore shifted towards an expansionary direction in about two-thirds of the world economy during the past four quarters and the shift is not yet completed in several countries. This monetary policy bias suggests that the world economy will become increasingly buoyant during the next six quarters, even if the U.S. economy enjoys only a moderately positive sub-cycle recovery during the second half of 1996. As a result, the IMF is predicting 4.3% growth in world output during 1997 compared to 3.8% this year, and 3.5 % in 1999. To summarize, the surprising resilience of final demand in the first quarter is provoking new discussion about Fed tightening during the summer, but the FOMC is unlikely to support such tightening unless it sees clear evidence that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and industrial commodity prices start to rise more sharply. The best leading indicators of a monetary policy change will be the performance of the purchasing agent price index, retail sales, and the bond market. The generally accommodative tone of monetary policy in Europe and Japan suggests that the odds are increasing of a positive growth surprise in the world economy during 1997 and 1998. (D.

(continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) March 25, 1996 While central bank policy is likely to remain passive in the face of a moderate rebound in U.S. output growth, there is a risk that bond yields could be more volatile. The growth of hedge funds and other leveraged investors has given the bond market a far more speculative flavor than the equity market during recent years and thus bond prices often react far more violently to new economic information than other financial assets. In 1996, the U.S. bond market will also have to contend with volatility in the political outlook of investors, not just fluctuations in the business cycle. On the basis of 30 year bond yields, real long-term interest rates are currently just under 4.0% in the U.S., 5.0% in Britain, and well over 5.0% in France and Germany. The ten-year bonds of Japan yield about 3.0% in real terms while in Switzerland they yield about 3.5%. In late December 1995, by contrast, real and nominal long-term interest rates were about 100 basis points lower in the U.S. and Europe. The one event still capable of producing a positive bond market surprise in the face of stronger output growth during the second quarter would be a successful U.S. budget compromise. The White House is sufficiently concerned about the large rise in U.S. bond yields since January that is has been putting out feelers to Senator Robert Dole about pursuing a new budget agreement. The White House has long viewed him as a more amenable to a compromise than the House Republican leadership and his success in the Republican primaries has greatly increased his potential freedom of action. But despite the opportunity for new negotiations created by the Dole victory, there are still major hurdles to an agreement. The major case for the Republicans to accept a compromise is that they have fallen sharply in the opinion polls and many voters now perceive their attempt at confrontational budget negotiations to have been a failure. The barriers to a budget agreement are congressional and White House perceptions of the tradeoffs between improving the performance of the economy and achieving no deal. The Republicans fear that a budget agreement could help the president more than them by lowering bond yields and boosting the housing market. The White House fears that any compromise which trims Medicare spending will deny them the opportunity to engage in demagogic attacks on the Republicans in states with large populations of retired people, such as Florida. In short, neither side perceives overwhelming advantages to a deal while both sides perceive potential downside. As a result of these constraints, the odds of a deal will probably remain below 50% unless the economy is so strong during the second quarter that bond yields shoot over 7.0% and equity prices fall sharply. In such a scenario, the president would offer major concessions to obtain a deal. While most investors are relieved that Senator Robert Dole has won firm control of the Republican nomination and thwarted the challenge posed by Patrick Buchanan, they are not optimistic about his prospects in November. They perceive him to be an older and less dynamic campaigner than the president. They also perceive that a third party candidacy by Ross Perot or Patrick Buchanan will draw votes largely at the expense of Dole. They believe that Dole has a solid base of about 150 electoral votes in the South and West but they do not think that he will be able to carry California or the Great Lakes states unless the economy deteriorates sharply, there is a foreign policy disaster, or the various investigations of the first family's financial affairs in the 'emerging market' state of Arkansas produce a formal indictment of Mrs. Clinton, not just press stories about sleazy business relationships. The special federal prosecutor, Mr. Ken Starr, has indicted the Governor of Arkansas and may obtain new evidence to use against the first family if he can obtain a conviction which encourages other Arkansas politicians to plea bargain at the expense of the president. But as the president has already survived four years of rumors about his personal life and financial affairs in Arkansas, the markets will remain skeptical about his vulnerability without major new disclosures. While the president is clearly ahead at the present time, there are several factors which could still produce a Dole victory. First, the president received only 43% of the vote in 1992 and thus would have lost if Ross Perot had not taken 19% of the vote largely at the expense of the Republicans. Secondly, as the American president is both head of state and head of government, the issue of character looms large in public perceptions of the office. Senator Dole can campaign as a World War Two veteran who has devoted a lifetime to public service while nearly half of the electorate perceives the president to be a decadent, if not corrupt, member of the most self-indulgent generation in American history (the baby boomers). Thirdly, it is doubtful that Ross Perot will be able to come anywhere close to matching the 19% share of the vote which he received four years ago. In 1992, he was a new face and the opinion polls briefly suggested that he might win the election. In 1996, it is widely accepted that a vote for Ross Perot is ultimately a vote for Bill Clinton. Nor can Perot attract the support of people who voted for Patrick Buchanan because of his clear uncompromising position on abortion. Ross Perot supports the right to abortion, so the pro-life movement has no alternative but to return to the Republican Party. Finally, in contrast to George Bush four years ago, Dole should be able to attract the support of most conservatives because he provides them with an unprecedented opportunity to influence U.S. public policy through Republican control of both the White House and the Congress for the first time since the era of Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. The fact that Dole comes from a tradition of political moderation may offend some conservatives but the fact is the American people would probably not support the election of an ultra-conservative President and Congress at the same time. They like the checks and balances which come from dividing power between executive and legislative branches of different political persuasions. In fact, the president himself has effectively co-opted much of the Republicans' rhetoric so that he can campaign as the candidate who will eliminate the budget deficit in a humane way, not through savage cuts in popular middle class entitlement programs. It will be far easier for Senator Dole to portray himself as the president who can achieve his party's agenda without threatening ordinary people than it would have been for some of his party's other candidates. As a result of these factors, the American presidential race is still wide open. The President's lead should narrow during the next few months but could re-open if the Republicans permit their convention to be dominated by extremist rhetoric or if Patrick Buchanan joins Ross Perot on a third party ticket which captures a large share of the Christian evangelical vote. The Republicans are aware of these risks, so they should be able to avoid the mistakes which plagued them at the 1992 convention but Senator Dole will still have to demonstrate far more skill at coalition building with his party's right wing populists than was possible for George Bush. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013820 WT01-B14-39IA018-000197-B003-2http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/usyieldcurve2.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172839 text/html 11553HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:24:35 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:25:15 GMTContent-length: 11370Content-type: text/html Is The U.S. Yield Curve Discounting Increased Political Risk? (continued page 2) The Weekly Money Report (continued) February 29, 1996 The stagnation of real wages also has coincided with a dramatic expansion of pay among many senior executives as well as a stock market boom which has produced large gains for them on their stock option programs. Popular magazines, such as Newsweek, have played upon class resentments over such differentials in pay by running front page stories about the rise of the "Overclass" (the technocratic elite profiting from the new world economic order) and "Corporate Killers" (a recent cover story on chief executives responsible for large layoffs). In the mid-1980's, there also was considerable media discussion about the social side-effects of corporate restructuring through takeover activity but the restructuring of that era did not provoke as much resentment because the overall growth rate of the economy and real income was much stronger. As many of the takeover artists of the mid-1980's violated federal security laws, the public also derived some satisfaction from watching some of the most prominent players go to jail. The corporate restructuring of the 1990's is being driven by factors very different from the takeover boom of the mid-1980's. As U.S. equity price/earnings multiples are much higher today than they were ten years ago, the dominant factors driving the restructuring are technology, international competition and the cumulative impact of several years of low inflation on corporate cost control strategies, not Wall Street's search for new transaction fees. As a result of the explosive growth of mutual fund ownership, a far larger share of the American population is benefiting from the impact of company rationalization on profits and share prices than ever before but the linkage between share ownership and employment is much weaker among ordinary corporate employees than among senior executives. According to Labor Department data, only 13% of U.S. employees participated in deferred profit sharing plans during 1993 while just 3% of this group belonged to employee stock ownership programs (ESOPS) and less than 1.0% received stock bonuses. The low level of stock ownership among company employees has helped to enhance the appeal of the Buchanan attack on corporate America despite the tremendous growth occurring in public equity ownership through mutual funds, individual retirement accounts and other tax deferred family savings programs. In a few weeks, a special White House taskforce will issue a report examining the feasibility of investing some portion of the social security trust fund in the equity market. Such a development would create practically universal equity ownership in the U.S. but it is unlikely to occur for at least three years. The OECD recently published a study on income distribution in the major industrial countries. The OECD data suggests that the U.S. has significantly more income inequality than other industrial countries primarily because of the very small share of income accruing to people in the bottom quintile of the population. In the U.S., the bottom 20% of the population received about 5.7% of income in 1986 compared to 7.8% in Canada, 10.6% in Sweden and 7.0% in Britain. The share of income accruing to the wealthiest 10% of the population in the U.S. was about 24% in 1986 compared to 22% in Canada, 23% in Britain, 18% in Sweden, and 22% in Australia. In developing countries, such as Brazil and Mexico by contrast, the top 10% of households receive over 40% of personal income while the bottom 20% received only about 2.0-3.0%. The offset to this inequality is that affluent Americans pay high effective marginal income tax rates by international standards. In 1986, people in the top quintile of U.S. income paid 53% of all taxes compared to 3.8% for people in the bottom quintile. In Canada, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 3.6% for the bottom quintile. In Britain, the top quintile paid 46.5% of all taxes compared to 4.5% for the bottom quintile. The U.S. also enjoys remarkable social mobility between income classes. According to a recent research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, only about 5.1% of the people in the bottom income quintile of the population during 1975 were still in that quintile by 1991. Instead, 29% had moved to the top income quintile, 30% to the second income quintile, 21% to the third highest income quintile, and 14.6% to the fourth. Among people in the fourth income quintile, 37.0% also had moved to the highest income quintile while another 32.6% had moved to the second highest income quintile. The fact is that many of the people in the bottom income quintile are elderly and living on savings income, not wages, or young and thus poised to increase their income sharply as they gain work experience. The marital status of people also has a major impact on their income rankings. Among white people, 25% of households headed by single females have income below $10,000 compared to 4.7% for married couples. Among black people, 44% of households headed by single females have incomes below $10,000 compared to 9.8% for married couples. The factor which appears to explain the magnitude of American income inequality compared to other industrial countries is the low level of transfer payments to the poor. In 1986, transfer payments accounted for only 13.7% of median income in the bottom quintile of the U.S. population compared to 32.4% for Britain, 18.3% for Canada, 27.0% for Sweden and 22.5% for Australia. The recent upsurge of spending on the Earned Income Tax Credit may have altered this ratio but with the exception of the EITC program the U.S. has far less generous transfer payment programs for the non-elderly than most other industrial countries. No presidential candidate is currently advocating an expansion of transfer payment programs because most middle class Americans perceive transfer payments other than social security to be give-aways to low income minority groups. In other industrial countries, by contrast, there is much less racial polarization than in the U.S. and thus much greater willingness to use the government as an engine for income redistribution. As a result of the racial constraints on popular support for using the federal government to promote income redistribution, it is not surprising that right wing populists, such as Patrick Buchanan, have focused so heavily on themes such as foreign competition and corporate greed to explain falling living standards. Such issues permit him to play upon the theme of economic insecurity without offering any detailed program for increasing public expenditure to promote job training or redistribute income. The Buchanan themes played well in New Hampshire because that state has had one of the most volatile economies in the nation during the past decade. In the 1980's, New Hampshire enjoyed an economic boom because of the impact of strong employment growth in New England's computer and defense industries, a flight of tax refugees from Massachusetts, and a real estate development boom financed by the state's newly privatized mutual savings banks. In the early 1990's, the boom turned to a bust as the New England high tech sector suffered from a slump in defense spending and demand for micro computers while vacancy rates for real estate reached such high levels that many of the state's banks failed. As a result of these upheavals, New Hampshire has not been immune to the problem of job insecurity and eroding real wages despite a low unemployment rate. According to one consultant's report, median family income in new Hampshire fell by 14.7% between 1989 and 1994 compared to 4.7% for the nation. In 1996, Buchanan received only 27% of the primary vote in New Hampshire compared to 37% when he challenged George Bush in 1992. But while the 1996 primary vote was more fragmented because of the large number of candidates, the profile of the Buchanan vote clearly reflected the theme of economic insecurity. His voters were more heavily male, poorly educated and young than the voters for other candidates. According to surveys, he received the votes of 31% of male voters compared to 26% for Dole, 21% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes while among women he received only 25% of the vote. He obtained 31% of the votes of people aged 18-29 years compared to 18% for Dole, 29% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes. Among people over the age of 60, he received only 25% of the vote compared to 39% for Dole, 19% for Alexander, and 10% for Forbes. He received 43% of the votes of non-college graduates compared to 21% for Dole, 22% for Alexander, and 13% for Forbes whereas among college graduates he had only 23% of the vote compared to 27% for Dole, 23% for Alexander, and 12% for Forbes. Buchanan's voters also had strong ideological views. He collected the votes of 59% of people who described themselves as very conservative compared to 13% for Dole and 9% for Alexander while among moderates he obtained only 18% of the vote compared to 26% for Dole and 30% for Alexander. Buchanan received one third of the votes of people who said the economy mattered most compared to 25% for Dole and 23% for Alexander but his voting group was very much biased towards people with bad economic experiences. He received the votes of 27% of the people who said their personal financial situation had deteriorated compared to 19% for Dole, 24% for Alexander, and 14% for Forbes. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013070 WT01-B14-40IA018-000197-B003-15http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/feddev3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172849 text/html 10071HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:24:49 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:23:14 GMTContent-length: 9889Content-type: text/html Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued page 3) Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued) As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, itis doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets mightfear this autumn. But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised bythe upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries duringearly 1996. With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such arapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary. Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politicsof the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income. Hesuggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusingon the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which hadhelped to produce the Buchanan primary victories. If the Democrats regaincontrol of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in theirlegislative agenda for 1997. The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints. First, real wageshave been stagnant for several years. Secondly, there is growing incomeinequality on the basis of differentials in education. Thirdly, corporationsprovide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same timethat they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle incomeworkers. There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to thegrowth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's. But it isfar from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are agood proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation. There isconsiderable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation. If we adjustwages with the new measures of the CPI being developing to measure inflationmore accurately or deflators of prices being charged by U.S. companies, therehas been modest growth of real wages during the past decade, not a decline.Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in order toavoid taxes, including pensions and health care. Such benefits are now equalto about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late 1940's. There is growing income inequality based on education because new developmentsin technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workerscompared to people with fewer skills. With the economy now close to fullemployment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity toimprove their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost onehalf of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment hasalways encouraged faster wage growth in the past. Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for theirexecutives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices haverisen sharply. The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13%of U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belongto ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership). As a result, there is a weak linkin the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership. About 51million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but theydo not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives inmost corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has beenmagnified in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980. Duringthe past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced theiremployment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact thattotal U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million. The high visibilityof the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense ofinsecurity among American workers than than can be justified by the economy'soverall employment performance. While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock optionprograms and insensitive public relations in the way it conductsrestructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labormarket for job creation in the industrial world. Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor forceof 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor forceentrants. About 20 million American also change their job every years. Since1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a laborforce of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor forceentrants. As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt digitlevels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people. The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility. Among those in the bottom incomequintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to the top income quintile, 30% to thesecond and 21% have moved to the third. The number of American householdsearning over $100,000 per annum in 1994 dollars has risen from 1.0 million in1967 and 2.7 million in 1980to over 6 million today. Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S. labor market.In April, a German business magazine published a cover story about how Germanyshould regard the U.S. economy as a role model for labor market reform. Thecover showed a picture of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200pounds) trying to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume. Shortly after the articleappeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage job creation,including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to abolish many expensivegovernment regulations on firms which employ ten workers or less. Under theprevious law, such rules applied to firms employing more than 5 people. Inthe U.S., by contrast, firms are not subject to many federal labor laws untiltheir total employment exceeds 50 workers. However envious Europe may be of the U.S. labor market, though one of the riskspoised by this autumn's election is that the voters will believe politicianswho say that it is malfunctioning. In politics, perceptions are reality andmany Americans perceive that the U.S. economy is producing unfair outcomes byredistributing income from the poor to the rich. The Democratic congressional leadership has announced a variety of proposals topromote "stakeholder capitalism" and protect employment through new corporatesubsides and labor market regulations. While such proposals are wellintentioned, the experience of Europe suggests that they would be highlycounter productive over the long-term. They would produce a more rigid labormarket and discourage hiring without necessarily reducing wage inequality. While politicians in Washington have dominated the debate about incomeinequality and social fairness, the politicians who actually have the greatestcapacity to promote a more just society in the U.S. are state and localgovernment politicians. They have a major role to play because they areresponsible for the nation's educational system. The U.S. spends about 6.5% ofits GDP on education and Washington is responsible for only about $40 billionof the expenditures. The only effective way to reduce income inequality in anera rapid of technological change is to ensure that everyone has effectiveaccess to a good education. Yet, real education spending has been stagnant andeven declining in some states despite the growing public concern about incomeinequality. Attempts to promote more effective use of education dollarsthrough vouchers and other forms of school choice also have been stymied byopposition from teachers unions. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1020000 WT01-B14-41IA018-000197-B003-27http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/mutualfundboom3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106172857 text/html 13929HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 17:24:58 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:23:28 GMTContent-length: 13746Content-type: text/html Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued page 3) Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued) The growth of the mutual fund industry has had several effects on the economy. First, it has encouraged the household sector to boost its equity market exposure to the highest level since the 1960's. Household ownership of equities and mutual funds now exceeds 25% of all households financial assets compared to 15.5% in 1995, 13.5% in 1975, and a previous peak of 36.0% in 1968. Mutual funds now also represent about 25% of total household equity portfolios compared to 14% in 1985, 6% in 1968 and less than 4% in the 1960's. Second, the growth of the mutual fund industry is broadening the number of households with exposure to the equity market. According to data from Federal Reserve surveys of household finances, about 17.8% of U.S. households owned equities directly in 1992 compared to 19.l1% in 1983 and 17.2% in 1962. But if we include mutual funds, the share of households owning equities rises to 22.0% from 20.1% in 1983 and 19.0% in 1962. If we include IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans, the share rises to 37.4% from 33.2% in 1983. There is no comparable data for the 1960's because IRA's and defined contribution pension plans were non-existent before the 1970's. While the share of the population owning equities has been expanding steadily during recent years, the great bulk of U.S. equity continues to be owned by high income people. According to the Federal Reserve survey of household finances, people with incomes above $250,000 (1.2% of total households) own 29.11% of all publicly traded stock compared to 20.78% for the income group earning $100,000-250,000 (5.9% of total households), 8.76% for the income group earning $75,000-100,000 (5.51% of total households) and 15.16% for the income group earning $50,000-75,000 (13.38% of total households). If we divide the population on the basis of wealth, the ownership of equity appears to be even more concentrated. According to the Fed surveys, the wealthiest 0.5% of U.S. households own 58.6% of all publicly traded stock compared to 11.74% for the second 0.5%, 24.18% for the next 4% of households, 4.62% for the next 5% and less than 1.0% for the remainder of the population. In the case of housing equity, by contrast, the bottom 80% of the population owns 28% of residential housing stock compared to just under 16.0% for the top 1.0% of the population.Age also plays an important role in equity ownership. In the 1992 Fed survey, households with ages above 65 owned 41.36% of all publicly of traded stock compared to 19.25% for the age group 55-64 years, 18.07% for the age group 45-54 years, and 17.01% for the age group 35-44 years. But while U.S. equity ownership is highly concentrated among older high income people, it is becoming more diffuse. The share of publicly traded equity owned by people with incomes above $250,000 fell from 50.60% in 1983 to 29.11% in 1992. If we broaden the measure of equity ownership to include mutual funds, IRA's, Keoghs and defined contribution plans, the share of the top income group drops from 43.06% in 1983 to 22.72% in 1992. The major gainers are groups with incomes below $100,000. The group with incomes of $75,000-100,00 per annum has expanded its share of all equities including mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh's defined contribution pension, to 12.1% from 7.28% in 1983. The $50,000-75,000 group has boosted its share from 12.63% in 1983 to 16.75% in 1992. The group earning $25,000-50,000 has boosted its share of equity from 8.08% in 1983 to 18.39% in 1992. The group earning under $25,000 has boosted its share from 3.06% in 1983 to 7.07% in 1992. Stock ownership is also becoming less concentrated on the basis of age, not just income. In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.35% of U.S. publicly traded equity compared to 49.24% in 1983. The age group 35-44 years, by contrast, has increased its share of publicly traded equity from 6.83% in 1983 to 17.01% in 1992. Share ownership is also far more diffused when mutual funds, IRA's, Keogh plans, and defined contribution plans are included. On this basis, the share of equity owned by households over 65 years of age falls from 43.14% in 1983 to 30.71% in 1992 while the share of households aged 35-44 years rises from 9.13% to 16.97%. Equity ownership on the basis of wealth continues to be highly concentrated but it is becoming gradually more diffuse. In 1992, the top 1.0% of households owned over 70% of publicly traded U.S. equity compared to 78% in 1983 and 75.07% in 1962. The next 4% of the population owned 24.18% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 17.38% in 1983 and 20.4% in 1962. The next 5% of the population owned 4.62% of publicly traded stock in 1992 compared to 3.58% in 1983 and 3.77% in 1962. The bottom 80% of the population continues to own an insignificant share of publicly traded stock compared to 13.7% of all non-equity financial assets, 28.07% of the national housing stock and 19.2% of total household net worth. What has changed dramatically as a result of the mutual fund boom is the distribution of bond ownership by wealth class. In 1992, the wealthiest 1.0% of the U.S. population owned 41.6% of all bonds compared to 78% in 1989. The next 9% of the population has expanded its share of the bond market from 16.1% to 46.3% while the other 90% of the population has boosted its share from 5.9% to 12.0%. Thirdly, the growth of the mutual fund sector is altering the ownership structure of the U.S. corporate sector. In 1994, mutual funds owned 13.6% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 7.1% in 1990, 5.0% in 1985 and 4.5-5.5% during the 1960's. During the modern era, the dominant trend in equity ownership has been a steady decline in the household share and a steady increase in the pension fund share. In 1951, households owned 90% of U.S. corporate equity compared to 1.1% for pension funds, 3.1% for mutual funds, 3.5% for insurance companies, and 2.2% for foreign investors. The household share remained high through the 1950's but plunged to 55.0-60.0% by the early 1970's while the pension fund share grew to 15.0-16.0% and bank personal trusts expanded to 11.0-12.0%. The household share of corporate equity continued to erode during the 1980's and is now only 47.7%. The bank trust account share also has slid to 2.7% while the pension fund share has been stable in the 24-26% range since the mid-1980's. The growth of defined contribution pension plans, individual retirement accounts, and 401-K plans will probably continue to boost the mutual fund share of U.S. corporate equity during the late 1990's at the expense of direct household ownership. But since households own two thirds of mutual fund assets as well as most trust fund and defined benefit pension plans asssets, analysts estimate that households still control about two thirds of all U.S. corporate equity on a direct and indirect basis. Fourthly, the growth of mutual fund assets has helped to encourage a tremendous boom in securitized finance by companies. The number of initial equity public offerings has risen to record high levels during recent years partly because of the demand for new securities from the mutual fund sector. The number of equity IPO's was 582 in 1995, 646 in 1994, 471 in 1993, 447 in 1992, 330 in 1991 and only 150 in 1990. These IPO's raised about $34 billion of new capital for companies in 1995, $30 billion in 1994, $25 billion in 1993, $19.4 billion in 1992, and $13.8 billion in 1991 compared to only $4.2 billion in 1990. The search for higher yields also revitalized the so-called "junk bond market". In 1993, Wall Street sold about $60 billion of non-investment grade bonds compared to $42 billion in 1992, $16.9 billion in 1991, and $2.9 billion in 1990. The improved access to equity and debt finance for small and medium sized companies is important to job creation because practically all of America's employment growth since 1980 has been concentrated in that sector. Between 1979 and 1994, the Fortune 500 companies reduced their employment from 16.2 million to 11.8 million. In the 1980's, the employment losses at large firms were offset by job creation at small firms, but during the early 1990's the economy stalled in part because the small firms lost access to the credit market. In 1993, by contrast, the mutual fund boom provided small firms with unprecedented access to the debt and equity markets while the recovery in bank profitability encouraged banks to ease their lending conditions as well. The securitization boom has even had a benign effect on the U.S. real estate market. During 1992 and 1993, Wall Street sold retail investors about 100 new Real Estate investment Trusts worth $12 billion. These trusts permit investors to invest in real estate without being subject to double taxation of income. They became popular as interest rates fell because commercial property still offered yields in the 10-12% range. As a result of the IPO boomlet for real estate, the market capitalization of the REIT sector now exceeds $60 billion compared to less than $10 billion during 1990. Fifth, the growth of the mutual fund industry is helping to encourage an unprecedented outflow of capital from the U.S. to foreign security markets. The number of purely international equity funds has expanded from 13 in 1984 to 367 while the number of global equity funds (including U.S.) has grown from 16 to 176. Meanwhile, the population of global bond funds has shot up from 1 in 1985 to 145 today. International and global equity funds have expanded their assets from $37 billion in 1992 to $212 billion recently while global bond funds grew from $27.6 billion to a peak of $40 billion in early 1994 before rising interest rates caused an upsurge of net redemptions which reduced assets to $33 billion in late 1995. The creation of this new infrastructure for retail diversification into foreign securities has made New York a far larger market for international bonds and equities than it has ever been before. But the retail demand for foreign securities is volatile. The share of money flows into international mutual funds peaked at 44% in early 1994 and then slumped to less than 20% during much of 1995 as Wall Street boomed. The assets of international money market funds have slumped from a peak of $21.4 billion during the period of high European interest rates after German unification to only $3.7 billion recently. In January, 1996, money flows into international and global equity funds shot up to over $6 billion from only $1-2 billion in mid-1995 but their share of total equity sales was still only 25%. Finally, the mutual fund boom is forcing banks to introduce new fund products in order to retain their share of household savings flows. In 1994, 2072 banks sold mutual funds and 46% of them were proprietary funds compared to 31.5% in 1991. In the early 1990's, banks primarily offered money market funds but they are also now actively promoting equity and bond funds. Such products accounted for over 70% of their money flows in 1994 compared to only about one half in 1991. Government officials are concerned that households may confuse mutual fund products with government insured deposits, so they are encouraging banks to carefully explain to customers that their mutual fund products do not enjoy FDIC protection but surveys indicate that bank customers do not always fully understand the distinction. The growth of bank sponsored mutual funds is also complicating the task of the Federal Reserve in monitoring the growth of the nation's monetary aggregates.

For the growth stockpicker, the game plan is simple: Earnings drive stock prices, so invest in those companies that are outearning the market. "We focus on the fastest growing sectors of the market or economy and invest in leading companies that have historically delivered consistent earnings growth. Most importantly, we look for growth stocks selling at a reasonable price," says Patrick Adams, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion Kemper Growth Fund (as of 9/30/96). Growth stock followers scan the investment horizon, hoping to catch a glimpse of that rarest of breeds -- successful companies with the potential to sustain growth over the long term. Industry heavyweights like Microsoft, Disney, and Home Depot come to mind. In searching for these stocks, analysts look for the indicators that point to a sunny earnings forecast. They pursue firms with healthy profits, rising sales, and rock-solid balance sheets. They dig beyond the numbers to unearth market leaders with strong management teams, superior products, and minimal competition. They scour the corporate landscape in search of innovative technologies. High-flying earnings potential, however, is only part of the Kemper growth equation. To avoid being saddled with unnecessary risks, you also have to factor in the price of your growth. "The key is to reap the potential rewards of growth stock investing without overpaying for that growth," says Tom Regner, equity strategist for Zurich Kemper Investments. "It's a philosophy we at Kemper Funds call 'growth at the right price,' or 'GARP.'" It's also a philosophy that calls for even deeper levels of research, a strong suit of the Zurich Kemper Investment organization. A company's earnings must not only be accurately projected, they must also be measured against its stock price to determine whether the anticipated growth is underpriced, overvalued, or priced fairly. "Look for opportunities where all the good news is not yet reflected in the stock's price," explains Mr. Regner. "If you can find a company that's 20% more expensive than the market but growing 40% faster, buy it." But when to sell? Like any good investment style, the growth philosophy is ruled by clear-cut buy and sell disciplines. The time to end the ride is when the stock reaches its fair market value or a decline in earnings is anticipated. Average annual total returns for one-, five-, and 10-year periods ended 9/30/96 are 12.75%, 9.84%, and 14.15%, respectively. Source: Towers Data Systems. The hypothetical $10,000 investment is from 10/1/86 to 9/30/96. This investment and the average annual returns above reflect reinvestment of all dividends and adjustment for the maximum sales charge of 5.75%. Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns and net asset value fluctuate. Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less than original cost. All performance is for class A shares. The Fund offers different classes of shares. Performance of other classes will vary from that shown because of differences in sales charges and fees paid by shareholders investing in different share classes. Kemper's growth philosophy focuses on stocks that don't depend on the economy for their success. "We follow a bottom-up approach where company fundamentals, not the economy, steer us toward great companies at attractive prices," says Mr. Adams. As an example of this "growth at the right price" philosophy, he points to the stocks in the Kemper Growth Fund, which have enjoyed an 18% long-term growth rate (as of 9/30/96). While the fortunes of some growth stocks may not be tied to the economy, certain industries fare better in different cycles. When the economy cools, for instance, growth managers tend to look toward health care and financial stocks. Their attention may shift, however, to technology and consumer products as the economy heats up. Much of the results of a growth portfolio will typically come in the form of capital appreciation. As a general rule, growth companies pay low dividend yields, choosing instead to reinvest their earnings for continuing expansion. While growth stocks share several key characteristics, they come in many shapes and sizes. In the Kemper Blue Chip Fund, you'll find household names, such as Eli Lilly and B.F. Goodrich. The Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund features emerging companies like Tellabs. And the long-standing Kemper Technology Fund holds today's leading innovators, including 3Com and U.S. Robotics. (Keep in mind that portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change, and investments in smaller companies present greater risk than investments in larger, more established companies.) When compared to the value school, growth provides a more conventional, mainstream approach. And so, it appeals to droves of investors who are naturally lured by the sparkle of the brightest corporate lights, the promise of the market's latest trendsetters, and the prestige of some of Wall Street's best-known names -- companies that often change the way we live, work, and play.

Most importantly, we look for growth stocks selling at a reasonable price." Patrick Adams Portfolio Manager Zurich Kemper Investments GROWTH INVESTING Growth. Growth. Growth.

Value represents a contrarian style, finding beautiful swans where the rest of the market sees ugly ducklings. It pursues the downtrodden and overlooked -- stocks of viable companies that are currently out-of-favor and on sale at bargain prices. "We look for stocks that are unloved for the wrong reason," says David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Advisors and a leading champion of value investing. "We believe there will be enough positive earnings surprises or opinion changes, so that these companies will outperform the market over time." Regarded as a pioneer among contrarians, Mr. Dreman currently manages the Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund, ranked by Lipper as the number one mutual fund in the equity-income category over the one-year, five-year, and life-of-fund time periods as of 9/30/96.* (One yr. - 1/147; five yr. - 1/57; life - 1/37) * Based upon changes in class A shares net asset value with dividends reinvested and without sales charges which, if included, may have resulted in less favorable results. Inception date of 3/18/88. Past performance does not represent future performance. In the topsy-turvy arena of investing, value disciples count on one predictable outcome: investor over-reaction to bad news, which inevitably sends short-term stock prices tumbling to levels much lower than their earnings would suggest. Bad news can come in many forms -- a disappointing earnings quarter, concerns over the economy in general, disturbing news out of the White House. Investors were seeing red, for example, during the 1993 debate over health care reform. Health care stocks nosedived, and value investors picked up some quality companies usually found only in the growth sector. Since then, talk of revamping the medical system has quieted, while many of those health care stocks have rebounded nicely. What does a Kemper-Dreman value stock look like? Its most distinguishing characteristic is a low price-to-earnings ratio, the holy grail pursued by most value investors. In addition to a small price tag, however, value stocks must show signs of financial strength, along with above-average dividend yields and historical growth of earnings and dividends -- qualities found today in companies such as Fannie Mae, Banc One, and Philip Morris. Value investing appeals to the bargain hunter in all of us. It's the same force that compels us to buy our swimwear and lawn furniture in the dead of winter. But value also attracts the patient and disciplined investor. It takes time for out-of-favor companies to achieve the turnaround that value investors bank on. And it takes discipline to follow the strict principles of the Kemper-Dreman strategy, which means selling stocks when P/E ratios approach the market average, regardless of how favorable their prospects appear. While some critics maintain that value is a riskier proposition, supporters maintain just the opposite. The stock's prices and expectations are already low, they argue, so additional downturns can't do much damage. "Put it this way. You will probably get hurt worse falling from a high ladder than from a small step stool," observes Mr. Dreman. Many recent academic studies suggest that contrarians may be onto something with their strategy of pursuing stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios. Source: Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. The chart is a historical comparison of average annual returns of stocks of the 1,500 largest companies on the Compustat database. The returns do not reflect future performance of these market segments or of any specific investment. Mr. Dreman has devoted his life's work to studying the performance of low-priced stocks. His much-published analysis of 1,500 large companies has shown that low P/E stocks outperformed high P/Es over a 20-year period (see chart at right). In fact, the cheapest stocks in the study topped the market average for annual returns by a margin of 17.2% to 14.7%. The most expensive stocks, on the other hand, posted average annual returns of just 11.2%. Mr. Dreman's research looks at total return, including both appreciation and dividends. Because value stocks pay higher-than-average dividends, they tend to weather down markets better than growth stocks. When times are tough, it's often those dividend returns that help to prop up stock prices and provide a measure of capital protection. Other research shows that low-priced stocks performed better than big-ticket stocks among companies of all sizes. As a result, the Kemper-Dreman team has applied their contrarian school of thought to their entire line of value portfolios. The Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund, for example, pursues large cap companies such as General Electric and Mobil. At the other end of the spectrum, the Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund consists of smaller companies, like Bally Entertainment. And the Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund focuses mostly on larger companies, which currently include Amoco and Humana. As noted earlier, portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change. Average annual total returns for one-year, five-year, and life-of-fund periods ended 9/30/96 are 23.08%, 17.27%, and 16.92%, respectively. Source: Towers Data Systems.

Growth pursues fashionable companies in the penthouse, while value roots around for buried treasures in the bargain basement. Value likes underpriced stocks; growth likes oversized earnings. So the question may still linger: Growth or value? Which style is best suited to you as a long-term investor looking to help reduce risks? Both. Like cowboy boots and the matador's slippers, investment styles work best in pairs. For the savvy investor, the issue is not one of growth or value, but rather growth and value. Why? In a word, diversification. Every investment professional preaches the value of diversification. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, they advise. Spread your investments across several instruments as a way of helping lower risk. Good advice, but many investors fail to realize that real diversification occurs when investments are also spread across the two styles of growth and value. Yes, the two disciplines are radically different approaches to stock investing, but investors must come to view them as complementary, not competing. There's plenty of room for both in a well-rounded investment portfolio. "Using only one investment style is like rowing a boat with only one oar," says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities for Zurich Kemper Investments. "You may eventually reach your destination, but it's going to be a tougher trip." Source: Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. for the period from 3/31/88 to 9/30/96. Risk is measured by the volatility of returns (standard deviation). Of course, this information is historical and does not represent future performance. Also, there is no guarantee that any particular portfolio strategy will reduce risk or result in a profit. Despite their many differences, growth and value actually share some significant common threads. Both techniques pursue financially strong, quality companies with steady track records of growth. And, in the case of Kemper's "growth at the right price" philosophy, both also seek mispriced stocks that are selling below their real, or intrinsic, value. For the ambidextrous investor who's equally adept at growth and value, a blended portfolio of both styles may produce better results than a "one-handed" approach. And then there's risk to think about. If the diversification preachers are right, a portfolio of growth and value should carry lower risks than an all-growth or all-value strategy. And that's exactly what happens. An analysis (see chart at right) reveals that a portfolio containing equal investments in the two styles would have had lower volatility than either style alone. Growth and value are both governed by sets of strict, uncompromising principles about the buying and selling of stocks. That's why both disciplines work so well over time. But in the short term, depending on the temperature of the economy, one style usually outshines the other. Annualized returns based on year-end data from S&P 500 stock groupings.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Growth and value tend to be counter-cyclical, with one style usually outperforming the other (seetable at left). This year, both styles are up, with growth surpassing value by a fairly healthy margin. Through the first nine months of 1996, the S&P/Barra Growth Index was up 15.6%, compared to 13.5% for the S&P 500 and 11.4% for the S&P/Barra Value Index. The tendency of growth and value to flip-flop positions as top performer can be both a blessing and a curse. For the wise investor who steadfastly commits to both schools, it means better diversification. For the impetuous investor, however, the temptation may be to switch back and forth between growth and value, pledging allegiance to whichever style happens to be in vogue at the time. Unfortunately, most of these chameleons tend to jump ship just when their abandoned style is about to set sail. "Style switching is one of the main reasons investors and fund managers underperform the market," says Mr. Reynolds. "Style switchers almost never win. That's why it's so important to know that your fund managers are dedicated to their investment style." A portfolio of growth and value also provides an additional benefit -- less duplication of stocks. A mutual fund investor, for instance, may choose three different growth funds that each invest in the same industries, maybe even the same companies. While there may be occasional overlaps between growth and value, the two styles generally cast their lines in entirely different waters. In the end, the smart investor will resist the urge to time the market and remain faithful to the proven styles of growth and value. "Without a strong commitment to your investment styles, the market usually takes advantage of you instead of you taking advantage of the market," notes Mr. Reynolds. So commit to an investment style. Better yet, commit to two. Armed with the cowboy's lasso in one hand and the matador's cape in the other, you'll be fully equipped to take the bull by the horns when you take on your investment challenges. Please note that there is no guarantee that a particular management style will be successful and that the past performance of a particular style is not representative of future results. "At Zurich Kemper Investments, our unique growth and value styles are different enough to offer broad diversification, yet similar enough to ensure consistency. Our growth managers look first for high growth companies and second for reasonable stock prices. Our value managers begin with low-priced stocks and then seek out attractive growth opportunities. Both styles pursue stocks selling at the right price."

The challenge is often not in the diversifying, but in finding one company that can provide such a variety of investment options. Zurich Kemper Investments is the nation's only mutual fund complex where growth and value are managed independently by separate organizations with their own headquarters, management teams, portfolio managers, analysts, and even two chief investment officers. Zurich Kemper Investments, located in Chicago, manages the firm's growth portfolios, while New York-based Dreman Value Advisors, Inc., founded by contrarian pioneer David Dreman, directs the value side. Today, Zurich Kemper Investments continues to add new members to its worldwide organization, bringing in experienced experts who are well-versed and fully committed to the Kemper Funds' styles of growth and value investing, as well as their renowned fixed-income and international portfolios. Zurich Kemper Investments' trademark since 1948 has been research. Both disciplines rely heavily on accurate primary research to identify quality stocks at affordable prices. Says Steve Reynolds, chief investment officer of equities: "The cornerstone of the Kemper Funds investment process is solid research, both quantitative and qualitative. It's research that enables our portfolio managers to recognize stocks that are selling at bargain prices in the growth and value sectors and are likely to experience significant price appreciation."

Which of the following events would you considerthe leastencouraging? A change in total return, considered to be thebest measure of fundperformance, could occur as a result of a changein a dividend paid, achange in net asset value or a combination ofboth. Income fund shareholders may be more sensitive tochanges in dividendsbecause of their relative higher reliance ondividend income. Inaddition, income funds often pay as frequently asonce a month. Dividends paid by an equity fund includedistributions of the dividendspaid by stocks owned by the portfolio and anyprofits earned whenindividual stocks are sold. Any gains aredistributed at least annually,and it is reasonable to expect some variation inthe dividend paymentfrom period to period. Information on the fund's performance compared tofunds with similarinvestment objectives can provide an insight thatabsolute returnnumbers cannot. No investor is pleased withnegative returns, forexample, but there will always be economicperiods that are hostile toinvestors.

The Spanish stock market continued to performwell, backed by the strength of the telecommunications sector,the banking sector and the electric utilities sector which allcontinue to benefit from deregulation and a lower interest-rateenvironment. The food sector suffered the biggest losses withthe recent tax hike on cigarettes starting to affect the profitmargins of tobacco producer Tabacalera.

(continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) October 21, 1996 Mr. Greenspan also called attention to the relationship betweeninflation and profit margins during the current business cycle.He reported that profit margins have risen to high levels in theface of small price increases because of both modest wage growthand the success which firms have enjoyed in boosting productivity.If margins now erode because of accelerating wage growth or decliningproductivity, firms will come under greater pressure to boostprices in order to restore profitability. Most American forecasters believe that the U.S. corporate sectorwill experience a profit squeeze during 1997. On the basisof the Blue Chip survey of the consensus, forecasters are projectinga profit gain of only 3.3% during 1997 compared to 9.0% this year.In 1996, forecasters expect profits to grow at a rate twice theeconomy's projected nominal GDP growth rate of 4.6%. In 1997,by contrast, they are expecting profit growth to lag behind theirestimate of nominal GDP growth of 4.7%. The pessimism of economistsabout the profit outlook is not universally shared on Wall Street.Surveys of corporate profits on the basis of forecasts by companysecurity analysts suggest that profit growth will be 10-15% nextyear. Economists are pessimistic about profits because they believethat rising wages and slower productivity growth will depressmargins. Analysts implicitly appear to believe that output growthwill either be stronger or that firms will obtain larger priceincreases to offset rising wage costs. The performance of corporate profits next year will have amajor influence on both the longevity of the current businesscycle and the relative returns provided by debt and equity.If the corporate sector enjoys 10-15% profit growth during 1997,the odds are high that output growth will remain close to 3.0%and set the stage for at least two or three new rounds of Fedtightening. If earnings growth is only about 3.0%, by contrast,the odds are high that output growth will slow to only about 2.0%and that firms will have absorbed rising labor cost pressuresin their profit margins. After declining corporate profits havedepressed investment and employment, the Fed would probably beable to ease monetary policy during the second half of 1997. Thereare sectors of the equity market which could perform well In theface of a general contraction in profit margins. The winners wouldinclude growth stocks operating independently of the businesscycle, multinational companies able to benefit from a recoveryin Europe and Japan, and financial stocks. But declining profitabilityat large labor intensive and cyclical companies would inhibitthe performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the early stages of the business cycle, it is possible forfirms to enjoy large increases in output with falling costs becausethey enjoy the disinflation effects of depressed utilization rates,high unemployment and large productivity gains. But as thebusiness cycle matures and utilization rates rise, it is difficultto sustain an environment which is positive for both profits andinflation. Unless wages continue to be insensitive to theunemployment rate, the economy appears to be entering a zone inwhich there will be negative trade-offs between profits and prices. It is possible to rationalize the current equity market rallyas a pure liquidity phenomena resulting from easy monetary policyall over the world. But it is difficult to imagine the U.S. equitymarket sustaining its recent robust performance into 1997 if profitmargins are poised to contract as the price of restraining inflation.In 1995, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan defended the stock market'shigh valuation ratios as a reflection of corporate America's successat boosting profits and developing new technology for enhancingproductivity. His reluctance to speak positively about the U.S.stock market this autumn may reflect a concern that equity pricesare now exaggerating the corporate sector's ability to sustainhigh profit growth without more upward pressure on inflation. The financial markets have accepted the verdict of the opinionpolls that President Clinton that will win re-election by a healthymargin, but they have not yet discounted the risk of a Democratictakeover of the Congress. Many investors perceive that the Americanpeople like divided government and thus will offset their votefor the president by voting Republican in the congressional races.There is no clear historical pattern to the coat-tail effectsof landslide presidential election victories. Ronald Reagan enjoyedgreat coat-tails power in 1980 while Lyndon Johnson helped toelect many Democrats to Congress in 1964, but Richard Nixon hadlittle drawing power in the congressional races during 1972 whilethe Reagan re-election landslide of 1984 had only a modest impacton the congressional races. The fact is almost two thirds ofU.S. presidential elections since 1920 have been characterizedby landslide victories (margins over 10%). Incumbent presidentswho enjoy successful first terms which do not generate primaryopposition also tend to expand their victory margins when seekingre-election (Roosevelt in 1936, Eisenhower in 1956, Nixon in 1972and Reagan in 1984). As a result, there would be nothing uniqueabout Clinton winning re-election with a victory margin of 10-15%or what the opinion polls have been predicting recently. Politicalanalysts will long ponder the president's seeming immunity topersonal and financial scandals as well as his ability to shifthis extraordinary ideological profile so effectively, but thevoters appear to be reacting to perceptions of the economy andthe general international environment, not the issue of characteror partisan disagreements about tax policy. According to the Universityof Michigan survey of consumer confidence during September, thepublic has a more positive view of government economic policytoday than at any time since mid-1988. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1024320 WT01-B14-84IA019-000202-B031-187http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/howlong3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181133 text/html 11442HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:07:34 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 11-Oct-96 15:24:56 GMTContent-length: 11259Content-type: text/html How Long Can the Federal Reserve Delay Tightening? (continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 26, 1996 The U.S. election campaign has not yet emerged as a major factorin the financial markets despite the rebound in the president'slead over Robert Dole in the opinion polls. But if Octoberpolls point to a Democratic sweep which could alter control ofthe Congress, business confidence in the 1997 economic outlookcould start to deteriorate. The leadership of the DemocraticParty in the Congress is so far to the left of the president thatsome Washington analysts describe a potential victory for it as"a return of the Dinosaurs". The committee chairmanshipsof a Democratic controlled Congress would be dominated by elderlymembers from old urban centers in the northeast and middle westwho launched their political careers during the 1960's. The newHouse speaker would also be a member of Congress who has spentthe past decade advocating protectionist trade policies and populistdomestic policies. As the election of a Democratic Congress would raise many questionsabout economic policy, it would cause the financial markets tobecome even more sensitive than usual to the cabinet appointmentswhich the president announced during December and the signalsthey provided about the future conduct of policy. The currentTreasury team enjoys a high level of confidence in the financialmarkets, and it is widely expected that Secretary Robert Rubinwill remain but investors expect to see new appointments for otherkey positions, such as Trade Representatives, Secretary of Commerce,and chairman of the National Economic Council. They also willbe anxious to see who replaces Dick Morris as the president'smajor advisor on political strategy. While Morris had littleinfluence on economic policy, he did steer the president towardsthe right on many social issues (family values) and gave the administrationa very conservative tone compared to 1993. As Fed Chairman AlanGreenspan is a long experienced Washington operator, the largeDemocratic lead in the opinion polls probably also had some influenceon the outcome of the September FOMC meeting. Both Mr. Greenspanand some Fed district presidents are aware that a Democratic Congresswould be far more intrusive into the affairs of the Federal Reservethan the current Congress. The dollar remained relatively firm despite the Fed's failureto tighten policy because other G-7 countries are still anxiousto promote dollar appreciation and the U.S. bond market reactedpositively to the Fed's policy. The U.S. government's current account and capital account datafor the second quarter suggest that the dollar is being underpinnedby greater support from private investors, not just central banks.The new data indicates that central bank intervention to supportthe dollar fell to $13.2 billion during the second quarter from$52 billion during the first quarter. In place of official intervention,foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities shot up to $31.7 billionfrom $11.8 billion during the first quarter while purchases of other securities fell only modestly to $28.6 billion from $36billion during the first quarter. Meanwhile, American demandfor foreign securities slumped to $20 billion during the secondquarter from $34.4 billion during the first quarter. Foreigndirect investment was also nearly in balance, with outward investmentof $46 billion during the first half compared to $40 billion ofinward investment. During 1995, by contrast, official interventionto support the dollar was $110 billion compared to foreign purchasesof Treasury securities equal to $99 billion, foreign demand forother securities of $95.2 billion and direct investment of $60billion. In addition to a $148 billion current account deficitduring 1995, American demand for foreign securities was $98 billionwhile outward direct investment was $96 billion. The magnitudeof the U.S. current account deficit and American demand for foreignsecurities suggests the dollar will be vulnerable to renewed weaknessat some point but the willingness of future central banks to supportthe dollar is unlikely to change in the near future. Infact, the IMF has just published its latest estimates of the distributionof the world's foreign exchange reserves by currency. Accordingto the IMF, the dollar's share of global foreign exchange reservesrose modestly to 56.4% last year form 55.9% during 1994 and atrough of 50.3% during 1990. The D-mark's share fell to 13.7%from 14.3% while the yen's share declined to 7.1% from 8.2%. It is the industrial countries which are spending most aggressivelyto protect the dollar's international role. The dollar's shareof their reserves rose to 52.8% from 51.2% while its share ofdeveloping country reserves eased to 60.5% from 61.8%. Whileit is not surprising that Japan and Europe are trying to resistdollar depreciation, it is remarkable that Asian and Latin Americancentral banks have not been more aggressive in diversifying theirforeign exchange reserves out of dollars. Europe and Japan want to encourage a strong dollar because theirown economies are still weak and they need to promote exports. Many European countries are also trying to adhere to exchangerate target bands against the D-Mark and thus don't want the D-markto appreciate against the dollar. The Bundesbank itself alsofavors a weak D-mark because it is trying to discourage the supportof German industry for introducing a new European currency. The currency which has been most vulnerable to a speculativeattack during recent weeks has been the French franc. TheFrench economy is weak and the economic slowdown is underminingthe efforts of the French government to achieve a budget deficitof less than 3.0% of GDP in order to satisfy the Maastricht economicpreconditions for European monetary union in 1999. In mid-September,the French government announced a new budget which introducedsome interesting accounting changes in order to achieve its deficittarget. The French government, for example, will realize an accountinggain of 40 billion francs in the current fiscal year by assumingresponsibility for the national telephone company's pension fundbefore it is privatized. Several journalists chastised the Frenchgovernment for using such unconventional revenue enhancement techniquesin order to achieve its deficit target but investors did not sellthe franc because they consider the French effort to achieve asmaller deficit to be preferable to the alternative EMU strategywhich had appeared to be evolving a few months ago. In mid-summer,it was widely perceived that Chancellor Kohl and President Chiracwould attempt to impose EMU while accepting budget deficits closerto 4.0% of GDP. Investors bought the French franc in mid-Septemberbecause they considered the French government's effort to achievea smaller deficit through a spending freeze and unconventionalrevenue enhancement to be superior to an economic strategy whichsimply sacrificed deficit reduction targets to the greater goalof European monetary union. The French budget has not eliminated all risks to implementationof EMU in 1999. If the French economy stalls this winter,the government will not be able to achieve its revenue targetsand it will have to consider imposing even greater fiscal austerityon an economy which already has high unemployment. As Francewill have parliamentary elections in March 1998, it will be difficultfor President Chirac to introduce another restrictive budget during1997. In the absence of a French economic upturn, the oddsare high that the Chirac government would be forced to introducea new economic strategy including large interest rate reductions,a devaluation of the franc, and an indefinite deferral of monetaryunion. As the Germans are terrified of a large franc devaluation,they would probably reduce interest rate further this winter inorder to help revive the French economy and maintain France'scurrent exchange rate policy. The good news for the French governmentis that the German and British economies are showing such clearsigns of revival that there should be positive spillover effectson France. But as France is suffering from deep structural problemsin its labor market and banking system, it is unclear if exportgrowth alone will be able to revive business and household confidenceby enough to stimulate domestic spending. As the French government is prepared to consider unconventionalrevenue sources in order to achieve its Maastricht deficit targets,it will be interesting to see if the French government investigatesthe feasibility of obtaining more revenue from the Bank of France. The French central bank is now independent of the governmentin the conduct of monetary policy but the French government continuesto be its only shareholder. As a result, it would be appropriatefor the French government to examine whether its central bankis observing the same fiscal austerity as other departments ofthe French government in promoting deficit reduction. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1023160 WT01-B14-85IA019-000202-B031-204http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/risingbondyields3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181149 text/html 7312HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:07:49 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 13-Sep-96 20:34:03 GMTContent-length: 7130Content-type: text/html Will Rising Bond Yields Force The Fed To Tighten? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 2, 1996 The primary focus of the foreign exchange market during the next few weeks will be the relationship between the German mark and French franc. The franc is under pressure because of growing investor concern about the prospects for European monetary union occurring on schedule in 1999. The German economy is showing signs of recovery while the French economy remains lackluster. As a result, it will be difficult for the French government to achieve its target of a fiscal deficit equal to 3.0% of GDP in 1997 unless it can enact further large cuts in public spending or tax hikes. Such fiscal restraint will be unpopular because the tax share of GDP in France is already 55% while French unions have threatened to go on strike if the government pursues further large reductions in government payrolls and entitlement programs. The Bundesbank has attempted to boost the franc and reduce upward pressure on the D-mark by lowering German interest rates 30 basis points but the market shrugged off the move because of perceptions that it will be Germany's last interest rate cut and awareness that France confronts such serious fiscal problems that monetary fine tuning, alone, will be insufficient to resolve them. The market is also apprehensive about the possible impact of a parliamentary investigation into the Credit Lyons scandal on the status of Jean Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France. The office of President Chirac denies that Mr. Trichet is vulnerable to the inquiry, but investors are apprehensive because Mr. Trichet has been the architect of French economic policy for several years. Investors fear that if he were to leave, France might abandon its commitment to monetary union. There are four possible solutions to the franc's problems. First, the French economy could enjoy a stronger than expected recovery during 1997 in response to this year's monetary easing and produce an upsurge of tax receipts which would lower the budget deficit to 3.0-3.5% of GDP from 4.5% this year. Secondly, the French government could be successful in enacting large cuts in public spending and achieve its fiscal target despite sluggish growth of the economy. Thirdly, Chancellor Kohl could attempt to persuade other European governments and the German people to relax the budget deficit targets specified in the Maastricht Treaty on the grounds that France is moving in the right direction and that any delay of monetary union would create the risk of the whole project being deferred indefinitely. Finally, France and Germany could agree to delay monetary union for one year on technical grounds but make it clear that the whole project will go ahead in the year 2000. The most likely scenario at present is a combination of scenarios two and three. The French government will succeed in enacting some spending cuts and Chancellor Kohl will try to persuade other governments to go ahead with European monetary union if the French deficit is less than 4.0% of GDP. The positive surprise for the markets would be that the European monetary easing of the past two years produces a stronger than expected upturn which permits France and other countries to come closer to the Maastricht fiscal targets than now seems possible. As a result of the monetary union issue, the bond markets of many European countries will behave quite differently than the U.S. bond market during the next twelve months. In the U.S., the bond market now slumps whenever economic data shows signs of strength. American bond investors dislike strong growth because the economy is close to full employment and it increases the risk of Federal Reserve tightening. In Europe, by contrast, stronger economic growth helps to reduce government fiscal deficits and thus enhances the prospects of monetary union. The currencies and bond markets which are most vulnerable to a collapse if monetary union is deferred are those which have used the goal of monetary union as a lever for pursuing deficit reduction, including France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. While Italy, Spain, and other southern European countries will not be in the first wave of monetary union, they will be pursuing a fiscal and monetary stabilization pact with the countries of the union in order to lay the groundwork for admission later. Any setback to the monetary union project would therefore provoke investor concern about the ability of the governments in Rome, Madrid, and elsewhere to adhere to the macroeconomic targets which will be pursued in conjunction with the stabilization pact. The pressures on European exchange rates resulting from the uncertainties about monetary union caused investors to buy the D-mark and the Swiss franc at the expense of other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, during August. The dollar also suffered from the failure of the Fed to tighten monetary policy during late August, but the resilience of the U.S.equity market limited the damage resulting from the Fed's passivity. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1021740 WT01-B14-86IA019-000202-B031-212http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/greensp3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181157 text/html 8907HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:07:58 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:21:46 GMTContent-length: 8725Content-type: text/html Is Wall Street Experiencing a Greenspan or Gephardt Correction? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) July 29, 1996 Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker wouldbe Rep. Richard Gephardt. After flirting with many "New Democrat" politicalthemes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decadeto espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,and other forms of government intervention in the economy. As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in thecongressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victoryin this November's congressional races would probably have three immediateeffects on the economy. It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar. It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico aswell as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable tocongressional demands for more restrictive trade polices. It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about newinvestment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election wouldaffect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor marketregulation. Ironically, such caution might cause bond yields to fall duringearly 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 theweakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economicslowdown. As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, itis doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets mightfear this autumn. But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised bythe upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries duringearly 1996. With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such arapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary. Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politicsof the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income. Hesuggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusingon the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which hadhelped to produce the Buchanan primary victories. If the Democrats regaincontrol of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in theirlegislative agenda for 1997. The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints. First, real wageshave been stagnant for several years. Secondly, there is growing incomeinequality on the basis of differentials in education. Thirdly, corporationsprovide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same timethat they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle incomeworkers. There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to thegrowth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's. But it isfar from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are agood proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation. There isconsiderable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation. If we adjustwages with the GDP deflator or the non-farm business deflator, there hasactually been moderate growth in real wages during recent years (see charts21-25). Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation inorder to avoid taxes, including pensions and health care. Such benefits arenow equal to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late1940's. There is growing income inequality based on education because new developmentsin technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workerscompared to people with fewer skills. With the economy now close to fullemployment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity toimprove their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost onehalf of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment hasalways encouraged faster wage growth in the past. Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for theirexecutives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices haverisen sharply. The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13% ofU.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong toESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership). As a result, there is a weak link inthe U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership. About 51million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but theydo not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives inmost corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has beenmagnified in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980. Duringthe past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced theiremployment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact thattotal U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million. The high visibilityof the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense ofinsecurity among American workers than can be justified by the economy'soverall employment performance. While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock optionprograms and insensitive public relations in the way it conductsrestructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labormarket for job creation in the industrial world. Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a laborforce of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor forceentrants. About 20 million American also change their job every years.Since 1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for alabor force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new laborforce entrants. As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubtdigit levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people. The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility compared to the other countries.Among those in the bottom income quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone tothe top income quintile, 30% to the second and 21% have moved to the third.The number of American households earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994dollars has risen from 1.0 million in 1967 and 2.7 million in 1980 to over 6million today. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1019990 WT01-B14-87IA019-000202-B031-224http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/delayed3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181205 text/html 11905HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:08:07 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:22:00 GMTContent-length: 11722Content-type: text/html Will Delayed Fed Tightening Set the Stage For An October Stock MarketCrash? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) June 21, 1996 Goldman Sachs has compiled its own estimate of Tobin Q's solelyfor companies in the S&P 400 Industrial index. Goldman prefersthis formula because it focuses solely on manufacturing firmswith stock market listings, not the whole U.S. corporate sector.Whereas the Fed measure of corporate net worth has declined duringthe 1990's because of falling real estate prices, the Goldmanmeasure has grown at a rate of 3.8% per annum. As a resultof the manufacturing sector's increasing net worth, the S&P400 measure of Tobin Q has risen only to 1.4 from 0.4 in the mid-1980'sand is still below its peak of 1.9 during the mid-1960's. All measures of Tobin Q make it clear that the U.S. stock marketis expensive by the valuation standards of the 1970's and 1980's,but industrial companies do not appear to be as overvalued asthe Federal Reserve estimate of current cost net worth might imply.Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others also have warnedthat book value does not provide useful information about thetrue net worth of the large U.S. investment in technology andhuman capital. The stock market is a discounting machine attemptingto determine the value of a future stream of earnings adjustedfor the return on low risk instruments such as Treasury bills.The replacement cost of assets provides little information aboutfuture earnings growth. As the deflation of commercial real estateprices since 1990 will testify, replacement cost plays minor rolein determining transactions prices for property compared to estimatesof rental income. There are numerous signs of excessive optimism in the U.S. equitymarket today. The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDPhas risen to 91% from previous peaks of 81% in 1929 and 79% in1972 while the ratio of stock and bond market capitalization isnow at 180% of GDP compared to 80% in 1982. The dividend yieldhas dropped to only about 2.1%. The flow of money into mutualfunds is unprecedented both in absolute terms and relative tonational income. Equity funds are also absorbing over 90% ofnew money flows into the mutual fund sector compared to 30-40%during the period 1985-1992. The manager of Fidelity's largestequity mutual fund felt compelled to resign because he had mistakenlyoverweighted his fund in bonds. The volume of money raised fromequity I.P.O's is now running at 0.4% of GDP compared to a peakof 0.52% in 1993 and 0.3-0.4% during the mid-1980's. At the Universityof Chicago, a professor of finance recently announced that itwas possible for investors to outperform the market through carefulselection of value stocks whereas the school has traditionallyadvocated a theory of market efficiency which suggested that stockselection was a futile exercise. When so many yardsticks of popularpsychology suggest euphoria about the equity market, it is difficultfor an experienced professional investor not to feel pessimistic.But the market continues to be supported by a positive outlookfor corporate profits, a modest level of inflation and interestrate risk, and increasing signs of resurgence in the global economy.There will probably have to be more evidence of imbalances inthe real economy or potential inflation risk to puncture the self-reinforcingoptimism which is now driving the demand for U.S. equities. The Dollar Consolidates The dollar has entered a period of consolidation in response toboth economic and political news. There are more signs of economicrecovery in the other G-7 economies while the markets are increasinglyuncertain about the political outlook in the U.S. They do notknow if Mrs. Clinton will be indicted for obstruction of justicenor are they certain how such a development would influence thisautumn's election. They perceive that the Dole candidacy is enjoyinga revival but some polls suggest that the outlook for both theWhite House and the Congress is still wide open. American investorshave discounted a Clinton victory in the presidential race butthey have not adjusted bond prices and exchange rates for a Democratictakeover of the Congress. The yen has rallied because Japan recorded a GDP growth rate of13% at annual rates during the first quarter. Some of the uptickresulted from seasonal adjustment problems with the effect ofthe Leap Year on the number of working days but the year on yeargrowth rate was still 3.3%. While seasonal factors could causeGDP to shrink modestly during the second quarter, there is littledoubt that Japan is shifting from an upturn driven primarilyby public investment to a more broadly based recovery in consumptionand business investment. The first quarter upturn appearsto vindicate those forecasters who contended that Japanese monetarypolicy was highly stimulative because of the tremendous foreignexchange intervention which occurred to support the dollar during1995. The yen rallied in response to the Japanese GDP report becauseinventors now expect the BOJ to hike short-term interest ratesduring the autumn, but further yen rallies will be inhibited byshrinkage of the Japanese trade surplus. It is likely to fallto $60-70 billion this year from $129 billion during 1994 becauseof stronger growth of domestic spending. The Bank of Japan willalso proceed very cautiously before raising interest rates becauseof the large size of Japan's output gap, the lingering creditquality problems of the banks and the Ministry of Finance commitmentto a tighter fiscal policy next year, including a hike in thevalue added tax to 5% from 3%. The D-mark has rallied because of signs that German output willstart to improve this summer and the strong showing of Mr. Yeltsinin the first round of the Russian presidential election. The Germanoutput gap is so large that the Bundesbank will retain a biastowards ease for many months to come. Chancellor Kohl also intendsto go ahead with plans to reduce various entitlement programsdespite the fact that German trade unions have launched the largestprotest demonstrations in the post-war era. Most European economistsare projecting that German real GDP will expand by about 2.3-2.5%next year compared to 0.4% this year, 2.1% during 1995, and 3.0%during 1994. The German upturn should also be accompanied by 2.5-3.0%output growth in the other major European economies. The Russian election was never a dominant factor in the foreignexchange market this spring but if Mr. Zyganov had come in firstplace during the first round or appeared capable of launchinga broad based coalition with all anti-Yeltsin forces there islittle doubt that investors would have sold the D-mark. Insteadof holding the wide lead which he enjoyed during early 1996, Mr.Zyuganov fell 3% behind Mr. Yeltsin while third place went toa former general who has agreed to be Mr. Yeltsin's new nationalsecurity advisor. The supporters of other non-communist candidates,such as Mr. Yavlinsky, will probably also rally around the president. While Moscow equity prices have rallied sharply since the firstround of the Russian presidential elections, there are still risksin the outlook. The Yeltsin supporters could become complacentand fail to turn out in large number on July third. GeneralLebed is unpopular with many army officers and some of them couldshift their support to Mr. Zyuganov. Mr. Yeltsin himself has hadtwo heart attacks during the past year and could easily experienceanother one at any time. In fact, most Moscow journalists believethat Russia will have another presidential election far beforehis term officially ends in four years because of either his deathor renewed health problems. As Russia has never before had an open and free election forthe office of head of state, the recent electoral content representsan important historical watershed. On the basis of reportsby journalists and independent observers, Mr. Yeltsin appearsto have achieved first place on the basis of a fair and free electionlast week. As recently as one month ago, by contrast, many Moscowcommentators had suggested that he would probably have to manufactureat least 5-10 million votes in order to insure a victory overMr. Zyuganov. The resolution of the political uncertainty which resultedfrom having an open presidential election will itself give a boostto the Russian economy. At present, the Russian governmentis being forced to pay nominal interest rates of 150% on T-billinstruments despite the fact that the Ruble has been stable fora year, inflation has fallen to only 30%, and the ratio of centralgovernment debt to GDP is less than 10%. Investors have demanded large risk premiums because they couldnot be certain that Mr. Zyuganov would either honor the government'sdebt or maintain the exchange rate policy which has permittedRussia to sharply reduce her inflation rate. The dominant short-termchallenges confronting Mr. Yeltsin this summer will be to improvethe efficiency of the tax system in order to reduce the government'sdeficit (many firms suspended paying taxes before the election)and to appoint a new team of ministers capable of pursuing theother structural reforms needed to establish a viable market economy.Russia has privatized many state enterprises, including the telecommunicationsand utility sectors which are still under government control inwestern Europe, but the structure of land ownership and the discretionarynature of many government regulations (taxes, import duties, etc.)have encouraged widespread corruption and thus inhibit investmentdecision making. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1018480 WT01-B14-88IA019-000202-B031-234http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/usoutputgrowth3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181215 text/html 7123HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:08:15 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:22:34 GMTContent-length: 6941Content-type: text/html Will U.S. Output Growth Exceed 3.0% During the Second Quarter? (continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) March 25, 1996 Despite the economic weakness in the major G-7 countries, bond yields rose all over the world during the first quarter. Yet, the odds are high that there will be further monetary easing in much of continental Europe while Japanese monetary policy will probably remain on hold until at least the autumn. Many pundits have suggested that the Bundesbank has delayed easing because of strong M3 growth but the real reason is concern about Germany's wage negotiations. Wage bargaining is now underway in the chemical, metal and construction industries while negotiations will begin next month in the banking and insurance sectors. Some of the unions are asking for 6% wage hikes and the Bundesbank wants employers to resist such demands because of the large employment losses now occurring in many German industries. (Manufacturing accounts for over a third of German GDP compared to 20% in the U.S.) If the negotiations produce moderate outcomes, the Bundesbank will probably ease further in late April or May. Monetary easing will be positive for the German financial markets but bond yields could continue to carry a large risk premium to compensate for uncertainty about the future of European monetary union. Many investors fear that Chancellor Kohl will attempt to pursue monetary union even if the key countries fail to achieve their Mastricht targets for deficit reductions. Alternative scenarios are also potentially dangerous for the markets. Kohl, for example, could face so much resistance from his party and coalition partners that he would be forced to call a general election on the issue of monetary union and lose. In such a scenario, a Socialist-Green coalition government could emerge at a time when Germany needs profound restructuring of its rigid labor market and costly welfare state. The financial market in Tokyo were positively surprised by government reports of strong fourth quarter GDP growth. The resilience of final demand suggests that the economy has turned despite a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. The Ministry of Finance intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market during February and also used moral suasion over major players, such as multinational corporations, to discourage repatriation of capital during the final weeks of the fiscal year. As the Japanese current account surplus has fallen sharply from the levels of one year ago, the yen should be able to stay in its current trading range if the Japanese institutions resume exporting capital during April. In the second half of 1995, Japanese investors were net sellers of U.S. bonds but were large purchasers of Eurobonds as well as Australian bonds. In January, they made modest purchases of U.S. bonds but sold Australian bonds. The great uncontrollable factor for the MOF is large swings in demand for yen by hedge funds and other highly leveraged investors. Such investors borrowed yen to buy dollar bonds during late 1995 but they were startled by the weakness of the U.S. bond market and the threat of a yen rally in February. The MOF has tried to work with such investors by providing more information about its intentions but such relationship building will count for little if there is a sudden change in market perceptions of the economic outlook. The coming upturn in the U.S. economy should help to bolster confidence in the dollar and encourage more Japanese demand for U.S. securities, but sentiment towards the dollar could turn negative if the upturn produces a sharp widening of the trade deficit or a correction in the bond market so severe that U.S. equities also fall sharply. The dollar also could suffer if the opinion polls suggest the Democrats might regain control of the U.S. House. To summarize, the U.S. economy appears poised for a moderate growth rebound during the next few quarters. While severe winter weather and the government shutdown have delayed completion of the inventory adjustment in many sectors, there is sufficient resilience in final sales to suggest that inventory demand will emerge as a positive growth factor during the second quarter and boost output growth to 3.0-3.5%. Such a rebound will prevent further monetary easing in the U.S. but the Fed will not tighten policy unless it perceives that growth will remain at levels high enough to push capacity utilization back towards 85.0% and revive inflationary pressures. If, by contrast, output growth returns to the 2.0-2.5% range during the autumn, monetary policy could remain on hold through year-end. The U.S. dollar should benefit from improved perceptions of the American economy but it will be vulnerable to renewed capital outflows by U.S. mutual funds as well as an inventory driven rebound in the trade deficit during the second half of the year.

(continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) February 29, 1996 The other important dimension of the Buchanan victory was his ability to attract strong support from religious fundamentalists. He received 54% of the votes of people who consider themselves to be part of the religious right compared to 11% for Dole and Alexander. The religious right is a political phenomena unique to the United States among the major industrial nations. About 45% of Americans go to church every Sunday compared to only 5-10% in Europe. As the U.S. was founded by religious dissenters, it has a free market in religion whereas in Europe religion is often a nationalized industry. Britain has a state church under the nominal rule of the monarch while the Catholic church is the official church in many other countries. The number of Americans who classify themselves as evangelical Protestants is about 25% today or the same as thirty years ago. But during the interim, many evangelical Protestants have moved from a relatively modest and rural socio economic status firmly into the suburban middle class and thus greatly enhanced their ability to influence the political system. The population of mainstream Protestants, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% of the U.S. total in the 1960's to about 20% today. Catholics have been steady at about 25% of the population while the population of secularist (no religious affiliation) has expanded from 1-2% thirty years ago to about 15% currently. The rise of the religious right has played a very important role in the revival of the Republican Party during recent years. According to surveys of the 1994 congressional elections, the Republicans attracted the support of 78% of Mormons and 75% of evangelical Protestants, compared to 56% of the votes of mainline Protestants and 53% of Catholics. Without strong support from the religious right, Buchanan would probably have received less than 20% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and thus come in third. He also benefited from the fact that New Hampshire permits Democrats and independents to vote in the Republican primary. As the Democrats had no presidential primary, some of their voters probably cast votes for Buchanan on the grounds that he would be the most divisive of Republican candidates. While Buchanan cannot win the Republican nomination, the question still hovering over the markets is how his electoral success will influence other candidates and public policy after 1996. Will his victories encourage other candidates to support more protectionist trade policies? Will the issue of job insecurity cause other candidates to promise more federal money for job training, unemployment relief, or other safety net programs? Will resentment at growing income inequality encourage political support for a return to much higher marginal income tax rates on high income Americans, especially the corporate executives who collect large bonuses and stock option awards while reducing employment in their companies? In 1992, Bill Clinton had campaigned on a platform called "Putting People First" which had pledged to spend $200 billion of federal money on various human capital programs to bolster productivity and real wages. He abandoned most of these promises in order to pursue deficit reduction during 1993 and focus on health care in 1994. When the Republicans captured the Congress in 1994, he further retreated from the campaign themes of 1992 and stressed in his recent State of the Union message that the era of big government is over. Yet, the Buchanan electoral success suggests that there is a political market among less skilled people for campaign promises to bolster job security through some form of government intervention. As a result of the racial profile of his constituency, Mr. Buchanan focused far more heavily on trade protection than government sponsored income redistribution or worker training but it is not difficult to imagine other candidates putting forward federal programs linking the two issues. The Buchanan victory in New Hampshire probably creates three major risks for public policy after the election. First, it will be more difficult for the next president to promote new free trade legislation, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile. Secondly, despite the electoral success of Steve Forbes in Delaware and Arizona, it will be more challenging to develop broad bi-partisan support for a tax reform program to reduce marginal income tax rates or provide new tax allowances for savings. Thirdly, there will be greater willingness to tinker with new tax incentives for promoting certain forms of corporate behavior such as protecting jobs or increasing spending on human capital. In fact, two Democratic Senators will soon be introducing legislation to redesign the corporate tax code to provide new tax incentives for job protection and training programs. Mr. Robert Kuttner described the legislation in a recent issue of Business Week: "Bingaman and Daschle have therefore turned to the one avenue that might produce some traction: inducing corporations to embrace a 'stakeholder' model. The draft legislation, to be released in late February, proposes a new class of corporations, the R Corp.-'R' for Responsible. The idea is to reward corporations that invest in employees and communities instead of pursuing relentless downsizing that boosts short-term profits." "An R Corp. would receive lower taxes and streamlined regulatory treatment. Specifically, the plan replaces the corporate income tax with a 'business activity tax' of the sort proposed in 1994 by Senators John C. Danforth (R-MO) and David L. Boren (D-Okla.). This tax applies a fixed rate to all receipts, subtracting payments for most inputs. Employee training and R&D expenses would be tax-deductible, while wages dividends, and interest would not. Under this plan, an R Corp. would be taxed at 11%, compared with 18% for conventional corporations. It would also pay reduced payroll taxes and be able to self-certify in several areas of regulation." "Compensation Ratio. To qualify, a corporation would be required to contribute 3% of payroll to a portable, multi-employer pension plan, devote 2% to employee training, pay half the costs of a qualifying health plan, and have a profit-sharing plan or employee stock ownership plan with employee trustees." "Another requirement would be to hold the compensation ratio of the highest to lowest paid employee to no more than 50 to 1, compared with the 130-to-1 ratio in some corporations . An R Corp. would have a 'community responsibility agreement' tempering relocations and layoffs. It would be unionized or have an employee-involvement plan. An R Corp. could not use child or prison labor anywhere in the world and half of its new investment and employment would have to be in the U.S." "The Bingaman plan includes a tax of the sort long proposed by Yale University economist James Tobin on the profits of short-term securities trades. The proceeds would finance a social capital fund for worker training, school-to-work transition programs, industrial extension, export promotion, and technology research and development." If there has to be a federal programatic response to public concern about job insecurity, the new Democratic proposals are far superior to the Buchanan program of high tariffs. But attempts to use tax allowances to promote various forms of corporate behavior also raise troublesome questions about the efficiency of resource allcoation, including whether the government will simply end up subsidizing investments which corporations would have made anyway. In Britain, the new Labor Party leader, Mr. Tony Blair, has been making numerous speeches about the theme of promoting "stakeholder capitalism" over the traditional form which merely protects the interests of shareholders. The theme of stakeholder capitalism has caught on with only a few Democratic Party intellectuals, such as Labor Secretary Robert Reich, but the Buchanan primary victories will encourage more discussion about American corporate behavior as the campaign progresses. Although promoting discussion about "stakeholder capitalism" is an intelligent way for Washington policy wonks to channel populist outrage over foreign competition and corporate labor shedding into a coherent examination of public policy choices, it is difficult to imagine the next Congress enacting any substantive legislation to promote stakeholder capitalism. First, the traditional models of stakeholder capitalism, such as Germany and Japan, have been suffering from prolonged recessions in part because their corporate sectors are carrying very high embedded social costs. In Germany, unemployment is rising sharply as German firms attempt to escape from the country's high social benefit costs by shifting jobs to the U.S., eastern Europe and other low wage countries. Secondly, corporations which need well trained workers are already spending heavily on education while small firms would regard legislation requiring investment in new federally mandated programs as a reason to curtail employment. Thirdly, the next Congress will still have to address the issue of federal deficit reduction, so expensive new tax allowances will be challenged by House and Senate committee chairmen. As with Bill Clinton's Putting People First program in 1993, the promises of presidential election campaigns will fade quickly if the American legislative branch remains as conservative about fiscal policy as it has been during recent years. Since the Buchanan and Forbes campaign are personality driven phenomena without any large scale organizations to influence congressional races, it is doubtful that the 1996 presidential race will produce major changes in congressional attitudes towards issues such as deficit reduction and federal spending. But as the presidential contest will dominate political news coverage during the next few months, concern about right wing populism undermining support for deficit reduction and free trade in the Republican Party will probably continue to produce a higher political risk premium in U.S. bond yields. This risk premium will be a de facto tax on the economy to compensate investors for the risk of extreme outcomes in the November elections for the White House and Congress. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013070 WT01-B14-90IA019-000202-B031-252http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/feddev4.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181240 text/html 8519HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:08:40 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:20:26 GMTContent-length: 8337Content-type: text/html Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued page 4) Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued) The need for state and local governments to play a greater role combating thecauses of America's new income inequality at a time when the federal governmentis promoting devolution of other programs suggests that governors andlegislatures are going to face more formidable challenges during the decadeahead than at any other time in the modern era. Their policies in sectors suchas education will not simply affect the economy of their state. They will alsohave a major impact on the wage and employment trends which are driving thenational debate about trade policy, tax policy and federal regulation of thelabor market. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the struggleover America's place in the new global economic order will depend as much onthe policies of state governments as the national government. The strength of the national economy and the growth of tax receipts shouldpermit state governments to manage these challenges during 1996 and 1997. Butwhen the U.S. economy experiences another recession, state governments willhave to confront the triple challenge of faltering tax receipts, increasedspending on the unemployed and the impact of new federal block grant system onthe capacity of Washington to help them fund social programs. In such ascenario, the deficits of state governments could rise sharply and force themto curtail spending on capital investment and other services, includingeducation. How will state governments cope with the fiscal hazards posed by devolution andrecession during the late 1990's? There will be no simple answers because theU.S. no longer enjoys a broad social consensus about the role of government ateither the federal or state level. But one obvious solution which could appealto both the political left and right would be for state governments to raisemoney by privatizing various assets which could be operated more effectively bythe private sector. During the past decade, privatization has been a dominant theme for economicreformers in both the old industrial countries and the developing countries.The British government privatized its utilities, water systems and airportsduring the 1980's. China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines areencouraging the private sector to develop an extensive network of toll roads.Many Asian countries are also privatizing ports, electric systems, and phonecompanies. Argentina privatized its utility companies during the early 1980'sand is about to privatize its water companies. In the U.S. private companiessupply about 85% of electricity but the public sector still owns practicallyall of the airports and waterworks. Toll roads played an important role inAmerica's early infrastructure development but today they account for onlyabout ten percent of the national highway system. In 1994, toll roadscollected about $4.6 billion of revenue compared to $71.4 billion of governmentreceipts from highway user taxes. While it is difficult to put a precise valueon state and local government enterprises, the Reason Foundation has produced areport suggesting they have a potential market value of about $227 billion. A few cities, such as Indianapolis, have promoted the privatization of publicservices on the grounds of efficiency but the overall rate of change in theU.S. has been very modest compared to other industrial countries because stateand local governments have not been confronting fiscal problems on a scalelarge enough to require dramatic action. The U.S. federal tax system alsosubsidizes public ownership of enterprises, such as airports and water systems,by permitting state and local governments to sell tax exempt securities. Despite the great policy changes occurring in Washington today, state and localgovernments enjoy a healthy financial position as a result of both theeconomy's benign performance and the large increase in federal assistance whichoccurred during the Bush administration. But they should not permit theircurrent surpluses to lull them into complacency about the challenges which lieahead. If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be continuingpressure to lower the federal deficit through reduced financial assistance tothe states. If they win the White House, the odds would also increase of adramatic overhaul of the federal tax system which could jeopardize existing taxallowances, such as the exemption on state and local government securities, asa quid pro quo for reducing marginal income tax rates. If the Democrats win,they will move more slowly to curtail federal spending but they will also beunable to resist the demographic pressure for cuts in discretionary spendingprograms over the long-term. Devolution and the movement towards block grantswill be manageable for the states during periods of economic growth but whenthe economy finally experiences a recession, they will have to finance largeincreases in social spending without the support which has traditionally comefrom the federal government. If the federal tax allowance for state and localsecurities are eliminated, they will also have to pay higher interest rates ontheir bonds. There is no way to predict exactly when these pressures will converge in a newcrisis. The timing of any future economic shock will depend upon political andbusiness cycle factors which are still unfolding. But the basic thrust ofpublic policy is very clear. The federal government will attempt to cope withthe coming upsurge in its entitlement spending for the elderly by shifting moreresponsibilities onto the states. The states will be able to cope withdevolution when the economy is prosperous but the caps on federal block grantswill cause future recessions to increase the pressure on their fiscal positionsby more than other economic downturns in the modern era. As a result, the oddsare high that devolution will someday be looked back upon as the first stage ofa more comprehensive restructuring of the American public sector whichculminated in the widespread privatization of state and local governmententerprises during the early years of the 21st century.

The study will examine three possible options for investing social security assets in the equity market. According to a preliminary version of the report, "The Council expressed interest in three different approaches for insuring social adequacy while improving individual equity. One approach involves a slight increase in taxes on benefits, and then letting the Social Security system invest these and other funds directly in common stock, or equities. Historically, returns on equities have exceeded those on government bonds (where all Social Security funds are now invested) and if this equity premium persists, it would be possible to increase benefits for future retirees without worsening social adequacy protections against low wages and retirement benefits, disability and the financial risk of a very long life." "Another very different approach is to create individual accounts within or alongside the Social Security system. One option here would involve a slight reduction in the future growth of Social Security benefits alongside a mandatory contribution of 1.6 percent of covered payroll to individual accounts. These individual accounts would be held by the OASDI Trust Funds but with constrained investment choices available to individuals. If individuals were to devote the same share of the funds to equities as they do in private funds, they already own and manage, it would be possible to raise benefits for future retirees, again without harming social adequacy protections." "A third approach would go even further down this road of creating individual accounts by devoting a much larger share, 5 percent of covered payroll, to these individual accounts. Were this approach to be followed, for younger workers the present Social Security system would move gradually in the direction of just providing a flat benefit to full career workers, along with disability and survivor's protection. The individual accounts might be held by the central system or they might be held privately. Again, individuals would have constrained choices on how the funds were managed. There would need to be a tax of the equivalent of 1.56 percent of payroll necessary to finance the transition to this new regime, though the tax would not actually have to be a payroll tax." Ten years ago, it would have been unthinkable for the White House or the Congress to produce a report with such radical proposals for reforming social security but the aging of the baby boom generation is altering the parameters for political discussion about the nation's retirement system. The senior citizens lobby can no longer supress debate about the subject because many studies are projecting a serious funding crisis when the baby boom generation retires and the first batch of baby boom children are now only fifteen years away from the official retirement age. But even if the principle of equity investment in the social security fund is accepted, there could still be great controversy over the process by which such investment occurs. Should the government create a fund management company to supervise a social security equity fund or should the government farm out the business to independent mangers? If the government decides to encourage retirement saving through private security accounts, should it impose stringent regulatory standards on the firms which will be permitted to mange such accounts? In Chile, the government permits only a small number of firms to compete for private pension fund accounts. In the U.S. by contrast, there is little direct supervision of fund managers by the government. The major goal of public policy is to provide adequate disclosure of information about the fund performance so that individuals can chose a manager on their own. If the federal government selects a small group of fund management firms to supervise social equity accounts, it could encourage more rapid consolidation of the mutual fund industry than is already occurring. The introduction of corporate equity and bonds into the social security trust fund will also have important implications for the government's own funding needs. At present, the social security trust fund has assets of $360 billion which are invested in a special issue of Treasury debt. If the cash flow of the social security system is diversified by 40-50% into corporate bonds and equities, the government could lose direct funding currently worth $300 billion per annum or a sum in excess of the present federal deficit. Conversely, the mutual fund industry is now so large that the addition of $300 billion per annum of social security savings would broadly match the capital inflows already occurring. While potential changes in the social security system to expand equity ownership will have only a modest impact on the mutual fund industry, the growth of defined contribution pension plans through mutual funds could have a major impact on the U.S. savings rate. At present, many Americans are de facto target savers because they belong to defined benefit pension plans. Under the traditional system of defined benefit pension plans, firms often responded to a rising stock market by reducing contributions to their pension plan. The gain in asset prices made it possible for them to achieve their actuarial target with smaller savings contributions. In the 1980's overfunded pension plans also attracted corporate raiders who then financed their takeover bids by extracting surpluses from the pension plan. Under defined benefit plans, by contrast, employees can contribute as much as they want and have no clear incentive to reduce contributions in the face of rising asset prices. At a result of this change in savings incentives, the expansion of the defined contribution form of asset accumulation for retirement could have a more positive impact on the U.S. savings rate than past changes in the tax system. According to IRS data, defined contribution plans (401-K's) accounted for 29% of pension assets in 1993 or a level three times as high as prevailed in 1984. At present defined benefit pension plans have an average of 43% of their assets in equities but some firms go as high as 76%. Some commentators are concerned that in a future stock market correction, the mutual fund sector could experience large scale redemptions which would intensify any bear market. The industry already had a trial run of such a risk during 1994, when U.S. bonds experienced their greatest bear market since 1927 and several bond funds had large trading losses on derivatives. As a result of the bear market in bonds, sales of bond funds slumped and the industry experienced four consecutive months of net redemptions in late 1994. The redemptions peaked at $5.3 billion in November of 1994 compared to sales of $10-15 billion per month one year before. But the industry stabilized in early 1995 and enjoyed renewed sales as bond markets rallied during the next nine months. Equity funds have had no net redemptions since the current bull market began but sales have fluctuated in a range as low as $4.7 billion per month during late 1994 and as high as $24 billion during January, 1996. In past bear markets, the mutual fund sector was also more resilient than many of today's pessimists probably realize. After the 1987 stock market crash, the industry suffered net redemptions equal to 4.5% of assets in its equity funds but the outflows persisted for only a brief period because the market itself quickly stabilized. The 1962 stock market crash did not have a major impact on mutual fund redemptions while there were only modest redemptions after the market corrections of 1970 and 1990. The severe bear market of 1974 produced a sharp decline in financial asset prices and mutual fund sales but there was no large scale withdrawal of funds from the industry. Instead, the industry suffered several years of modest net redemptions which ceased after interest rates fell sharply in 1983. What remains unclear is whether the mutual fund industry was resilient during past bear markets because the ownership of assets was far more narrowly concentrated among upper income people. Before the 1980's, the assets of equity mutual funds also were very modest compared to the household sector's direct ownership of equities. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013370 WT01-B14-92IA019-000202-B031-272http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/areworld3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181259 text/html 8264HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:09:00 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 30-Oct-96 15:15:41 GMTContent-length: 8079Content-type: text/html Are World Financial Markets Underpricing Political Risk? (continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) October 21,1996 Mr. Greenspan also called attention to the relationship betweeninflation and profit margins during the current business cycle.He reported that profit margins have risen to high levels in theface of small price increases because of both modest wage growthand the success which firms have enjoyed in boosting productivity.If margins now erode because of accelerating wage growth or decliningproductivity, firms will come under greater pressure to boostprices in order to restore profitability. Most American forecasters believe that the U.S. corporate sectorwill experience a profit squeeze during 1997. On the basisof the Blue Chip survey of the consensus, forecasters are projectinga profit gain of only 3.3% during 1997 compared to 9.0% this year.In 1996, forecasters expect profits to grow at a rate twice theeconomy's projected nominal GDP growth rate of 4.6%. In 1997,by contrast, they are expecting profit growth to lag behind theirestimate of nominal GDP growth of 4.7%. The pessimism of economistsabout the profit outlook is not universally shared on Wall Street.Surveys of corporate profits on the basis of forecasts by companysecurity analysts suggest that profit growth will be 10-15% nextyear. Economists are pessimistic about profits because they believethat rising wages and slower productivity growth will depressmargins. Analysts implicitly appear to believe that output growthwill either be stronger or that firms will obtain larger priceincreases to offset rising wage costs. The performance of corporate profits next year will have amajor influence on both the longevity of the current businesscycle and the relative returns provided by debt and equity.If the corporate sector enjoys 10-15% profit growth during 1997,the odds are high that output growth will remain close to 3.0%and set the stage for at least two or three new rounds of Fedtightening. If earnings growth is only about 3.0%, by contrast,the odds are high that output growth will slow to only about 2.0%and that firms will have absorbed rising labor cost pressuresin their profit margins. After declining corporate profits havedepressed investment and employment, the Fed would probably beable to ease monetary policy during the second half of 1997. Thereare sectors of the equity market which could perform well In theface of a general contraction in profit margins. The winners wouldinclude growth stocks operating independently of the businesscycle, multinational companies able to benefit from a recoveryin Europe and Japan, and financial stocks. But declining profitabilityat large labor intensive and cyclical companies would inhibitthe performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the early stages of the business cycle, it is possible forfirms to enjoy large increases in output with falling costs becausethey enjoy the disinflation effects of depressed utilization rates,high unemployment and large productivity gains. But as thebusiness cycle matures and utilization rates rise, it is difficultto sustain an environment which is positive for both profits andinflation. Unless wages continue to be insensitive to theunemployment rate, the economy appears to be entering a zone inwhich there will be negative trade-offs between profits and prices. It is possible to rationalize the current equity market rallyas a pure liquidity phenomena resulting from easy monetary policyall over the world. But it is difficult to imagine the U.S. equitymarket sustaining its recent robust performance into 1997 if profitmargins are poised to contract as the price of restraining inflation.In 1995, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan defended the stock market'shigh valuation ratios as a reflection of corporate America's successat boosting profits and developing new technology for enhancingproductivity. His reluctance to speak positively about the U.S.stock market this autumn may reflect a concern that equity pricesare now exaggerating the corporate sector's ability to sustainhigh profit growth without more upward pressure on inflation. The financial markets have accepted the verdict of the opinionpolls that President Clinton that will win re-election by a healthymargin, but they have not yet discounted the risk of a Democratictakeover of the Congress. Many investors perceive that the Americanpeople like divided government and thus will offset their votefor the president by voting Republican in the congressional races.There is no clear historical pattern to the coat-tail effectsof landslide presidential election victories. Ronald Reagan enjoyedgreat coat-tails power in 1980 while Lyndon Johnson helped toelect many Democrats to Congress in 1964, but Richard Nixon hadlittle drawing power in the congressional races during 1972 whilethe Reagan re-election landslide of 1984 had only a modest impacton the congressional races. The fact is almost two thirds ofU.S. presidential elections since 1920 have been characterizedby landslide victories (margins over 10%). Incumbent presidentswho enjoy successful first terms which do not generate primaryopposition also tend to expand their victory margins when seekingre-election (Roosevelt in 1936, Eisenhower in 1956, Nixon in 1972and Reagan in 1984). As a result, there would be nothing uniqueabout Clinton winning re-election with a victory margin of 10-15%or what the opinion polls have been predicting recently. Politicalanalysts will long ponder the president's seeming immunity topersonal and financial scandals as well as his ability to shifthis extraordinary ideological profile so effectively, but thevoters appear to be reacting to perceptions of the economy andthe general international environment, not the issue of characteror partisan disagreements about tax policy. According to the Universityof Michigan survey of consumer confidence during September, thepublic has a more positive view of government economic policytoday than at any time since mid-1988. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1024320 WT01-B14-93IA019-000202-B031-277http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/howlong3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181306 text/html 11288HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:09:08 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 11-Oct-96 15:24:56 GMTContent-length: 11105Content-type: text/html How Long Can the Federal Reserve Delay Tightening? (continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 26, 1996 The U.S. election campaign has not yet emerged as a major factorin the financial markets despite the rebound in the president'slead over Robert Dole in the opinion polls. But if Octoberpolls point to a Democratic sweep which could alter control ofthe Congress, business confidence in the 1997 economic outlookcould start to deteriorate. The leadership of the DemocraticParty in the Congress is so far to the left of the president thatsome Washington analysts describe a potential victory for it as"a return of the Dinosaurs". The committee chairmanshipsof a Democratic controlled Congress would be dominated by elderlymembers from old urban centers in the northeast and middle westwho launched their political careers during the 1960's. The newHouse speaker would also be a member of Congress who has spentthe past decade advocating protectionist trade policies and populistdomestic policies. As the election of a Democratic Congress would raise many questionsabout economic policy, it would cause the financial markets tobecome even more sensitive than usual to the cabinet appointmentswhich the president announced during December and the signalsthey provided about the future conduct of policy. The currentTreasury team enjoys a high level of confidence in the financialmarkets, and it is widely expected that Secretary Robert Rubinwill remain but investors expect to see new appointments for otherkey positions, such as Trade Representatives, Secretary of Commerce,and chairman of the National Economic Council. They also willbe anxious to see who replaces Dick Morris as the president'smajor advisor on political strategy. While Morris had littleinfluence on economic policy, he did steer the president towardsthe right on many social issues (family values) and gave the administrationa very conservative tone compared to 1993. As Fed Chairman AlanGreenspan is a long experienced Washington operator, the largeDemocratic lead in the opinion polls probably also had some influenceon the outcome of the September FOMC meeting. Both Mr. Greenspanand some Fed district presidents are aware that a Democratic Congresswould be far more intrusive into the affairs of the Federal Reservethan the current Congress. The dollar remained relatively firm despite the Fed's failureto tighten policy because other G-7 countries are still anxiousto promote dollar appreciation and the U.S. bond market reactedpositively to the Fed's policy. The U.S. government's current account and capital account datafor the second quarter suggest that the dollar is being underpinnedby greater support from private investors, not just central banks.The new data indicates that central bank intervention to supportthe dollar fell to $13.2 billion during the second quarter from$52 billion during the first quarter. In place of official intervention,foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities shot up to $31.7 billionfrom $11.8 billion during the first quarter while purchases of other securities fell only modestly to $28.6 billion from $36billion during the first quarter. Meanwhile, American demandfor foreign securities slumped to $20 billion during the secondquarter from $34.4 billion during the first quarter. Foreigndirect investment was also nearly in balance, with outward investmentof $46 billion during the first half compared to $40 billion ofinward investment. During 1995, by contrast, official interventionto support the dollar was $110 billion compared to foreign purchasesof Treasury securities equal to $99 billion, foreign demand forother securities of $95.2 billion and direct investment of $60billion. In addition to a $148 billion current account deficitduring 1995, American demand for foreign securities was $98 billionwhile outward direct investment was $96 billion. The magnitudeof the U.S. current account deficit and American demand for foreignsecurities suggests the dollar will be vulnerable to renewed weaknessat some point but the willingness of future central banks to supportthe dollar is unlikely to change in the near future. Infact, the IMF has just published its latest estimates of the distributionof the world's foreign exchange reserves by currency. Accordingto the IMF, the dollar's share of global foreign exchange reservesrose modestly to 56.4% last year form 55.9% during 1994 and atrough of 50.3% during 1990. The D-mark's share fell to 13.7%from 14.3% while the yen's share declined to 7.1% from 8.2%. It is the industrial countries which are spending most aggressivelyto protect the dollar's international role. The dollar's shareof their reserves rose to 52.8% from 51.2% while its share ofdeveloping country reserves eased to 60.5% from 61.8%. Whileit is not surprising that Japan and Europe are trying to resistdollar depreciation, it is remarkable that Asian and Latin Americancentral banks have not been more aggressive in diversifying theirforeign exchange reserves out of dollars. Europe and Japan want to encourage a strong dollar because theirown economies are still weak and they need to promote exports. Many European countries are also trying to adhere to exchangerate target bands against the D-Mark and thus don't want the D-markto appreciate against the dollar. The Bundesbank itself alsofavors a weak D-mark because it is trying to discourage the supportof German industry for introducing a new European currency. The currency which has been most vulnerable to a speculativeattack during recent weeks has been the French franc. TheFrench economy is weak and the economic slowdown is underminingthe efforts of the French government to achieve a budget deficitof less than 3.0% of GDP in order to satisfy the Maastricht economicpreconditions for European monetary union in 1999. In mid-September,the French government announced a new budget which introducedsome interesting accounting changes in order to achieve its deficittarget. The French government, for example, will realize an accountinggain of 40 billion francs in the current fiscal year by assumingresponsibility for the national telephone company's pension fundbefore it is privatized. Several journalists chastised the Frenchgovernment for using such unconventional revenue enhancement techniquesin order to achieve its deficit target but investors did not sellthe franc because they consider the French effort to achieve asmaller deficit to be preferable to the alternative EMU strategywhich had appeared to be evolving a few months ago. In mid-summer,it was widely perceived that Chancellor Kohl and President Chiracwould attempt to impose EMU while accepting budget deficits closerto 4.0% of GDP. Investors bought the French franc in mid-Septemberbecause they considered the French government's effort to achievea smaller deficit through a spending freeze and unconventionalrevenue enhancement to be superior to an economic strategy whichsimply sacrificed deficit reduction targets to the greater goalof European monetary union. The French budget has not eliminated all risks to implementationof EMU in 1999. If the French economy stalls this winter,the government will not be able to achieve its revenue targetsand it will have to consider imposing even greater fiscal austerityon an economy which already has high unemployment. As Francewill have parliamentary elections in March 1998, it will be difficultfor President Chirac to introduce another restrictive budget during1997. In the absence of a French economic upturn, the oddsare high that the Chirac government would be forced to introducea new economic strategy including large interest rate reductions,a devaluation of the franc, and an indefinite deferral of monetaryunion. As the Germans are terrified of a large franc devaluation,they would probably reduce interest rate further this winter inorder to help revive the French economy and maintain France'scurrent exchange rate policy. The good news for the French governmentis that the German and British economies are showing such clearsigns of revival that there should be positive spillover effectson France. But as France is suffering from deep structural problemsin its labor market and banking system, it is unclear if exportgrowth alone will be able to revive business and household confidenceby enough to stimulate domestic spending. As the French government is prepared to consider unconventionalrevenue sources in order to achieve its Maastricht deficit targets,it will be interesting to see if the French government investigatesthe feasibility of obtaining more revenue from the Bank of France. The French central bank is now independent of the governmentin the conduct of monetary policy but the French government continuesto be its only shareholder. As a result, it would be appropriatefor the French government to examine whether its central bankis observing the same fiscal austerity as other departments ofthe French government in promoting deficit reduction. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1023160 WT01-B14-94IA019-000202-B031-286http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/risingbondyields3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181314 text/html 7165HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:09:15 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 13-Sep-96 20:32:58 GMTContent-length: 6983Content-type: text/html Will Rising Bond Yields Force The Fed To Tighten?

The franc is under pressure because of growing investor concern about the prospects for European monetary union occurring on schedule in 1999. The German economy is showing signs of recovery while the French economy remains lackluster. As a result, it will be difficult for the French government to achieve its target of a fiscal deficit equal to 3.0% of GDP in 1997 unless it can enact further large cuts in public spending or tax hikes. Such fiscal restraint will be unpopular because the tax share of GDP in France is already 55% while French unions have threatened to go on strike if the government pursues further large reductions in government payrolls and entitlement programs. The Bundesbank has attempted to boost the franc and reduce upward pressure on the D-mark by lowering German interest rates 30 basis points but the market shrugged off the move because of perceptions that it will be Germany's last interest rate cut and awareness that France confronts such serious fiscal problems that monetary fine tuning, alone, will be insufficient to resolve them. The market is also apprehensive about the possible impact of a parliamentary investigation into the Credit Lyons scandal on the status of Jean Claude Trichet, president of the Bank of France. The office of President Chirac denies that Mr. Trichet is vulnerable to the inquiry, but investors are apprehensive because Mr. Trichet has been the architect of French economic policy for several years. Investors fear that if he were to leave, France might abandon its commitment to monetary union. There are four possible solutions to the franc's problems. First, the French economy could enjoy a stronger than expected recovery during 1997 in response to this year's monetary easing and produce an upsurge of tax receipts which would lower the budget deficit to 3.0-3.5% of GDP from 4.5% this year. Secondly, the French government could be successful in enacting large cuts in public spending and achieve its fiscal target despite sluggish growth of the economy. Thirdly, Chancellor Kohl could attempt to persuade other European governments and the German people to relax the budget deficit targets specified in the Maastricht Treaty on the grounds that France is moving in the right direction and that any delay of monetary union would create the risk of the whole project being deferred indefinitely. Finally, France and Germany could agree to delay monetary union for one year on technical grounds but make it clear that the whole project will go ahead in the year 2000. The most likely scenario at present is a combination of scenarios two and three. The French government will succeed in enacting some spending cuts and Chancellor Kohl will try to persuade other governments to go ahead with European monetary union if the French deficit is less than 4.0% of GDP. The positive surprise for the markets would be that the European monetary easing of the past two years produces a stronger than expected upturn which permits France and other countries to come closer to the Maastricht fiscal targets than now seems possible. As a result of the monetary union issue, the bond markets of many European countries will behave quite differently than the U.S. bond market during the next twelve months. In the U.S., the bond market now slumps whenever economic data shows signs of strength. American bond investors dislike strong growth because the economy is close to full employment and it increases the risk of Federal Reserve tightening. In Europe, by contrast, stronger economic growth helps to reduce government fiscal deficits and thus enhances the prospects of monetary union. The currencies and bond markets which are most vulnerable to a collapse if monetary union is deferred are those which have used the goal of monetary union as a lever for pursuing deficit reduction, including France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. While Italy, Spain, and other southern European countries will not be in the first wave of monetary union, they will be pursuing a fiscal and monetary stabilization pact with the countries of the union in order to lay the groundwork for admission later. Any setback to the monetary union project would therefore provoke investor concern about the ability of the governments in Rome, Madrid, and elsewhere to adhere to the macroeconomic targets which will be pursued in conjunction with the stabilization pact. The pressures on European exchange rates resulting from the uncertainties about monetary union caused investors to buy the D-mark and the Swiss franc at the expense of other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, during August. The dollar also suffered from the failure of the Fed to tighten monetary policy during late August, but the resilience of the U.S.equity market limited the damage resulting from the Fed's passivity. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1021740 WT01-B14-95IA019-000202-B031-293http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/greensp3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181324 text/html 8753HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:09:26 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:24:50 GMTContent-length: 8571Content-type: text/html Is Wall Street Experiencing a Greenspan or Gephardt Correction? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) July 29, 1996 Thirdly, if the Democrats win a majority in the House, their new speaker wouldbe Rep. Richard Gephardt. After flirting with many "New Democrat" politicalthemes during the mid-1980's, Rep. Gephardt has devoted most of the past decadeto espousing protectionist trade policies, higher marginal income tax rates,and other forms of government intervention in the economy. As a result of the ideological polarization which has occurred in thecongressional membership of both major political parties, a Democratic victoryin this November's congressional races would probably have three immediateeffects on the economy. It would encourage investors to sell both U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar. It would probably cause all investors to reduce their exposure to Mexico aswell as other emerging market countries which might be vulnerable tocongressional demands for more restrictive trade polices. It would probably encourage many U.S. companies to defer decisions about newinvestment and hiring until they had more visibility on how the election wouldaffect public policy in such critical areas as taxation and labor marketregulation. Ironically, such caution might cause bond yields to fall duringearly 1997, when lower investment depressed the economy, but in late 1996 theweakness of bond prices would itself help to set the stage for the economicslowdown. As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, itis doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets mightfear this autumn. But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised bythe upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries duringearly 1996. With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such arapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary. Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politicsof the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income. Hesuggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusingon the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which hadhelped to produce the Buchanan primary victories. If the Democrats regaincontrol of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in theirlegislative agenda for 1997. The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints. First, real wageshave been stagnant for several years. Secondly, there is growing incomeinequality on the basis of differentials in education. Thirdly, corporationsprovide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same timethat they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle incomeworkers. There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to thegrowth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's. But it isfar from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are agood proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation. There isconsiderable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation. If we adjustwages with the GDP deflator or the non-farm business deflator, there hasactually been moderate growth in real wages during recent years (see charts21-25). Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation inorder to avoid taxes, including pensions and health care. Such benefits arenow equal to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late1940's. There is growing income inequality based on education because new developmentsin technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workerscompared to people with fewer skills. With the economy now close to fullemployment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity toimprove their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost onehalf of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment hasalways encouraged faster wage growth in the past. Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for theirexecutives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices haverisen sharply. The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13% ofU.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong toESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership). As a result, there is a weak link inthe U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership. About 51million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but theydo not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives inmost corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has beenmagnified in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980. Duringthe past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced theiremployment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact thattotal U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million. The high visibilityof the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense ofinsecurity among American workers than can be justified by the economy'soverall employment performance. While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock optionprograms and insensitive public relations in the way it conductsrestructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labormarket for job creation in the industrial world. Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a laborforce of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor forceentrants. About 20 million American also change their job every years.Since 1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for alabor force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new laborforce entrants. As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubtdigit levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people. The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility compared to the other countries.Among those in the bottom income quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone tothe top income quintile, 30% to the second and 21% have moved to the third.The number of American households earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994dollars has risen from 1.0 million in 1967 and 2.7 million in 1980 to over 6million today. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1019990 WT01-B14-96IA019-000202-B031-303http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/delayed3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181332 text/html 11749HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:09:34 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:24:37 GMTContent-length: 11566Content-type: text/html Will Delayed Fed Tightening Set the Stage For An October Stock MarketCrash? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) June 21, 1996 Goldman Sachs has compiled its own estimate of Tobin Q's solelyfor companies in the S&P 400 Industrial index. Goldman prefersthis formula because it focuses solely on manufacturing firmswith stock market listings, not the whole U.S. corporate sector.Whereas the Fed measure of corporate net worth has declined duringthe 1990's because of falling real estate prices, the Goldmanmeasure has grown at a rate of 3.8% per annum. As a resultof the manufacturing sector's increasing net worth, the S&P400 measure of Tobin Q has risen only to 1.4 from 0.4 in the mid-1980'sand is still below its peak of 1.9 during the mid-1960's. All measures of Tobin Q make it clear that the U.S. stock marketis expensive by the valuation standards of the 1970's and 1980's,but industrial companies do not appear to be as overvalued asthe Federal Reserve estimate of current cost net worth might imply.Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others also have warnedthat book value does not provide useful information about thetrue net worth of the large U.S. investment in technology andhuman capital. The stock market is a discounting machine attemptingto determine the value of a future stream of earnings adjustedfor the return on low risk instruments such as Treasury bills.The replacement cost of assets provides little information aboutfuture earnings growth. As the deflation of commercial real estateprices since 1990 will testify, replacement cost plays minor rolein determining transactions prices for property compared to estimatesof rental income. There are numerous signs of excessive optimism in the U.S. equitymarket today. The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDPhas risen to 91% from previous peaks of 81% in 1929 and 79% in1972 while the ratio of stock and bond market capitalization isnow at 180% of GDP compared to 80% in 1982. The dividend yieldhas dropped to only about 2.1%. The flow of money into mutualfunds is unprecedented both in absolute terms and relative tonational income. Equity funds are also absorbing over 90% ofnew money flows into the mutual fund sector compared to 30-40%during the period 1985-1992. The manager of Fidelity's largestequity mutual fund felt compelled to resign because he had mistakenlyoverweighted his fund in bonds. The volume of money raised fromequity I.P.O's is now running at 0.4% of GDP compared to a peakof 0.52% in 1993 and 0.3-0.4% during the mid-1980's. At the Universityof Chicago, a professor of finance recently announced that itwas possible for investors to outperform the market through carefulselection of value stocks whereas the school has traditionallyadvocated a theory of market efficiency which suggested that stockselection was a futile exercise. When so many yardsticks of popularpsychology suggest euphoria about the equity market, it is difficultfor an experienced professional investor not to feel pessimistic.But the market continues to be supported by a positive outlookfor corporate profits, a modest level of inflation and interestrate risk, and increasing signs of resurgence in the global economy.There will probably have to be more evidence of imbalances inthe real economy or potential inflation risk to puncture the self-reinforcingoptimism which is now driving the demand for U.S. equities. The Dollar Consolidates The dollar has entered a period of consolidation in response toboth economic and political news. There are more signs of economicrecovery in the other G-7 economies while the markets are increasinglyuncertain about the political outlook in the U.S. They do notknow if Mrs. Clinton will be indicted for obstruction of justicenor are they certain how such a development would influence thisautumn's election. They perceive that the Dole candidacy is enjoyinga revival but some polls suggest that the outlook for both theWhite House and the Congress is still wide open. American investorshave discounted a Clinton victory in the presidential race butthey have not adjusted bond prices and exchange rates for a Democratictakeover of the Congress. The yen has rallied because Japan recorded a GDP growth rate of13% at annual rates during the first quarter. Some of the uptickresulted from seasonal adjustment problems with the effect ofthe Leap Year on the number of working days but the year on yeargrowth rate was still 3.3%. While seasonal factors could causeGDP to shrink modestly during the second quarter, there is littledoubt that Japan is shifting from an upturn driven primarilyby public investment to a more broadly based recovery in consumptionand business investment. The first quarter upturn appearsto vindicate those forecasters who contended that Japanese monetarypolicy was highly stimulative because of the tremendous foreignexchange intervention which occurred to support the dollar during1995. The yen rallied in response to the Japanese GDP report becauseinventors now expect the BOJ to hike short-term interest ratesduring the autumn, but further yen rallies will be inhibited byshrinkage of the Japanese trade surplus. It is likely to fallto $60-70 billion this year from $129 billion during 1994 becauseof stronger growth of domestic spending. The Bank of Japan willalso proceed very cautiously before raising interest rates becauseof the large size of Japan's output gap, the lingering creditquality problems of the banks and the Ministry of Finance commitmentto a tighter fiscal policy next year, including a hike in thevalue added tax to 5% from 3%. The D-mark has rallied because of signs that German output willstart to improve this summer and the strong showing of Mr. Yeltsinin the first round of the Russian presidential election. The Germanoutput gap is so large that the Bundesbank will retain a biastowards ease for many months to come. Chancellor Kohl also intendsto go ahead with plans to reduce various entitlement programsdespite the fact that German trade unions have launched the largestprotest demonstrations in the post-war era. Most European economistsare projecting that German real GDP will expand by about 2.3-2.5%next year compared to 0.4% this year, 2.1% during 1995, and 3.0%during 1994. The German upturn should also be accompanied by 2.5-3.0%output growth in the other major European economies. The Russian election was never a dominant factor in the foreignexchange market this spring but if Mr. Zyganov had come in firstplace during the first round or appeared capable of launchinga broad based coalition with all anti-Yeltsin forces there islittle doubt that investors would have sold the D-mark. Insteadof holding the wide lead which he enjoyed during early 1996, Mr.Zyuganov fell 3% behind Mr. Yeltsin while third place went toa former general who has agreed to be Mr. Yeltsin's new nationalsecurity advisor. The supporters of other non-communist candidates,such as Mr. Yavlinsky, will probably also rally around the president. While Moscow equity prices have rallied sharply since the firstround of the Russian presidential elections, there are still risksin the outlook. The Yeltsin supporters could become complacentand fail to turn out in large number on July third. GeneralLebed is unpopular with many army officers and some of them couldshift their support to Mr. Zyuganov. Mr. Yeltsin himself has hadtwo heart attacks during the past year and could easily experienceanother one at any time. In fact, most Moscow journalists believethat Russia will have another presidential election far beforehis term officially ends in four years because of either his deathor renewed health problems. As Russia has never before had an open and free election forthe office of head of state, the recent electoral content representsan important historical watershed. On the basis of reportsby journalists and independent observers, Mr. Yeltsin appearsto have achieved first place on the basis of a fair and free electionlast week. As recently as one month ago, by contrast, many Moscowcommentators had suggested that he would probably have to manufactureat least 5-10 million votes in order to insure a victory overMr. Zyuganov. The resolution of the political uncertainty which resultedfrom having an open presidential election will itself give a boostto the Russian economy. At present, the Russian governmentis being forced to pay nominal interest rates of 150% on T-billinstruments despite the fact that the Ruble has been stable fora year, inflation has fallen to only 30%, and the ratio of centralgovernment debt to GDP is less than 10%. Investors have demanded large risk premiums because they couldnot be certain that Mr. Zyuganov would either honor the government'sdebt or maintain the exchange rate policy which has permittedRussia to sharply reduce her inflation rate. The dominant short-termchallenges confronting Mr. Yeltsin this summer will be to improvethe efficiency of the tax system in order to reduce the government'sdeficit (many firms suspended paying taxes before the election)and to appoint a new team of ministers capable of pursuing theother structural reforms needed to establish a viable market economy.Russia has privatized many state enterprises, including the telecommunicationsand utility sectors which are still under government control inwestern Europe, but the structure of land ownership and the discretionarynature of many government regulations (taxes, import duties, etc.)have encouraged widespread corruption and thus inhibit investmentdecision making. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1018480 WT01-B14-97IA019-000202-B031-311http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/usoutputgrowth3.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181341 text/html 6980HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:09:42 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:25:10 GMTContent-length: 6798Content-type: text/html Will U.S. Output Growth Exceed 3.0% During the Second Quarter? (continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) March 25, 1996 Despite the economic weakness in the major G-7 countries, bond yields rose all over the world during the first quarter. Yet, the odds are high that there will be further monetary easing in much of continental Europe while Japanese monetary policy will probably remain on hold until at least the autumn. Many pundits have suggested that the Bundesbank has delayed easing because of strong M3 growth but the real reason is concern about Germany's wage negotiations. Wage bargaining is now underway in the chemical, metal and construction industries while negotiations will begin next month in the banking and insurance sectors. Some of the unions are asking for 6% wage hikes and the Bundesbank wants employers to resist such demands because of the large employment losses now occurring in many German industries. (Manufacturing accounts for over a third of German GDP compared to 20% in the U.S.) If the negotiations produce moderate outcomes, the Bundesbank will probably ease further in late April or May. Monetary easing will be positive for the German financial markets but bond yields could continue to carry a large risk premium to compensate for uncertainty about the future of European monetary union. Many investors fear that Chancellor Kohl will attempt to pursue monetary union even if the key countries fail to achieve their Mastricht targets for deficit reductions. Alternative scenarios are also potentially dangerous for the markets. Kohl, for example, could face so much resistance from his party and coalition partners that he would be forced to call a general election on the issue of monetary union and lose. In such a scenario, a Socialist-Green coalition government could emerge at a time when Germany needs profound restructuring of its rigid labor market and costly welfare state. The financial market in Tokyo were positively surprised by government reports of strong fourth quarter GDP growth. The resilience of final demand suggests that the economy has turned despite a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. The Ministry of Finance intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market during February and also used moral suasion over major players, such as multinational corporations, to discourage repatriation of capital during the final weeks of the fiscal year. As the Japanese current account surplus has fallen sharply from the levels of one year ago, the yen should be able to stay in its current trading range if the Japanese institutions resume exporting capital during April. In the second half of 1995, Japanese investors were net sellers of U.S. bonds but were large purchasers of Eurobonds as well as Australian bonds. In January, they made modest purchases of U.S. bonds but sold Australian bonds. The great uncontrollable factor for the MOF is large swings in demand for yen by hedge funds and other highly leveraged investors. Such investors borrowed yen to buy dollar bonds during late 1995 but they were startled by the weakness of the U.S. bond market and the threat of a yen rally in February. The MOF has tried to work with such investors by providing more information about its intentions but such relationship building will count for little if there is a sudden change in market perceptions of the economic outlook. The coming upturn in the U.S. economy should help to bolster confidence in the dollar and encourage more Japanese demand for U.S. securities, but sentiment towards the dollar could turn negative if the upturn produces a sharp widening of the trade deficit or a correction in the bond market so severe that U.S. equities also fall sharply. The dollar also could suffer if the opinion polls suggest the Democrats might regain control of the U.S. House. To summarize, the U.S. economy appears poised for a moderate growth rebound during the next few quarters. While severe winter weather and the government shutdown have delayed completion of the inventory adjustment in many sectors, there is sufficient resilience in final sales to suggest that inventory demand will emerge as a positive growth factor during the second quarter and boost output growth to 3.0-3.5%. Such a rebound will prevent further monetary easing in the U.S. but the Fed will not tighten policy unless it perceives that growth will remain at levels high enough to push capacity utilization back towards 85.0% and revive inflationary pressures. If, by contrast, output growth returns to the 2.0-2.5% range during the autumn, monetary policy could remain on hold through year-end. The U.S. dollar should benefit from improved perceptions of the American economy but it will be vulnerable to renewed capital outflows by U.S. mutual funds as well as an inventory driven rebound in the trade deficit during the second half of the year.

(continued page 3) The Weekly Money Report (continued) February 29, 1996 The other important dimension of the Buchanan victory was his ability to attract strong support from religious fundamentalists. He received 54% of the votes of people who consider themselves to be part of the religious right compared to 11% for Dole and Alexander. The religious right is a political phenomena unique to the United States among the major industrial nations. About 45% of Americans go to church every Sunday compared to only 5-10% in Europe. As the U.S. was founded by religious dissenters, it has a free market in religion whereas in Europe religion is often a nationalized industry. Britain has a state church under the nominal rule of the monarch while the Catholic church is the official church in many other countries. The number of Americans who classify themselves as evangelical Protestants is about 25% today or the same as thirty years ago. But during the interim, many evangelical Protestants have moved from a relatively modest and rural socio economic status firmly into the suburban middle class and thus greatly enhanced their ability to influence the political system. The population of mainstream Protestants, by contrast, has shrunk from 40% of the U.S. total in the 1960's to about 20% today. Catholics have been steady at about 25% of the population while the population of secularist (no religious affiliation) has expanded from 1-2% thirty years ago to about 15% currently. The rise of the religious right has played a very important role in the revival of the Republican Party during recent years. According to surveys of the 1994 congressional elections, the Republicans attracted the support of 78% of Mormons and 75% of evangelical Protestants, compared to 56% of the votes of mainline Protestants and 53% of Catholics. Without strong support from the religious right, Buchanan would probably have received less than 20% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and thus come in third. He also benefited from the fact that New Hampshire permits Democrats and independents to vote in the Republican primary. As the Democrats had no presidential primary, some of their voters probably cast votes for Buchanan on the grounds that he would be the most divisive of Republican candidates. While Buchanan cannot win the Republican nomination, the question still hovering over the markets is how his electoral success will influence other candidates and public policy after 1996. Will his victories encourage other candidates to support more protectionist trade policies? Will the issue of job insecurity cause other candidates to promise more federal money for job training, unemployment relief, or other safety net programs? Will resentment at growing income inequality encourage political support for a return to much higher marginal income tax rates on high income Americans, especially the corporate executives who collect large bonuses and stock option awards while reducing employment in their companies? In 1992, Bill Clinton had campaigned on a platform called "Putting People First" which had pledged to spend $200 billion of federal money on various human capital programs to bolster productivity and real wages. He abandoned most of these promises in order to pursue deficit reduction during 1993 and focus on health care in 1994. When the Republicans captured the Congress in 1994, he further retreated from the campaign themes of 1992 and stressed in his recent State of the Union message that the era of big government is over. Yet, the Buchanan electoral success suggests that there is a political market among less skilled people for campaign promises to bolster job security through some form of government intervention. As a result of the racial profile of his constituency, Mr. Buchanan focused far more heavily on trade protection than government sponsored income redistribution or worker training but it is not difficult to imagine other candidates putting forward federal programs linking the two issues. The Buchanan victory in New Hampshire probably creates three major risks for public policy after the election. First, it will be more difficult for the next president to promote new free trade legislation, such as expanding NAFTA to include Chile. Secondly, despite the electoral success of Steve Forbes in Delaware and Arizona, it will be more challenging to develop broad bi-partisan support for a tax reform program to reduce marginal income tax rates or provide new tax allowances for savings. Thirdly, there will be greater willingness to tinker with new tax incentives for promoting certain forms of corporate behavior such as protecting jobs or increasing spending on human capital. In fact, two Democratic Senators will soon be introducing legislation to redesign the corporate tax code to provide new tax incentives for job protection and training programs. Mr. Robert Kuttner described the legislation in a recent issue of Business Week: "Bingaman and Daschle have therefore turned to the one avenue that might produce some traction: inducing corporations to embrace a 'stakeholder' model. The draft legislation, to be released in late February, proposes a new class of corporations, the R Corp.-'R' for Responsible. The idea is to reward corporations that invest in employees and communities instead of pursuing relentless downsizing that boosts short-term profits." "An R Corp. would receive lower taxes and streamlined regulatory treatment. Specifically, the plan replaces the corporate income tax with a 'business activity tax' of the sort proposed in 1994 by Senators John C. Danforth (R-MO) and David L. Boren (D-Okla.). This tax applies a fixed rate to all receipts, subtracting payments for most inputs. Employee training and R&D expenses would be tax-deductible, while wages dividends, and interest would not. Under this plan, an R Corp. would be taxed at 11%, compared with 18% for conventional corporations. It would also pay reduced payroll taxes and be able to self-certify in several areas of regulation." "Compensation Ratio. To qualify, a corporation would be required to contribute 3% of payroll to a portable, multi-employer pension plan, devote 2% to employee training, pay half the costs of a qualifying health plan, and have a profit-sharing plan or employee stock ownership plan with employee trustees." "Another requirement would be to hold the compensation ratio of the highest to lowest paid employee to no more than 50 to 1, compared with the 130-to-1 ratio in some corporations . An R Corp. would have a 'community responsibility agreement' tempering relocations and layoffs. It would be unionized or have an employee-involvement plan. An R Corp. could not use child or prison labor anywhere in the world and half of its new investment and employment would have to be in the U.S." "The Bingaman plan includes a tax of the sort long proposed by Yale University economist James Tobin on the profits of short-term securities trades. The proceeds would finance a social capital fund for worker training, school-to-work transition programs, industrial extension, export promotion, and technology research and development." If there has to be a federal programatic response to public concern about job insecurity, the new Democratic proposals are far superior to the Buchanan program of high tariffs. But attempts to use tax allowances to promote various forms of corporate behavior also raise troublesome questions about the efficiency of resource allcoation, including whether the government will simply end up subsidizing investments which corporations would have made anyway. In Britain, the new Labor Party leader, Mr. Tony Blair, has been making numerous speeches about the theme of promoting "stakeholder capitalism" over the traditional form which merely protects the interests of shareholders. The theme of stakeholder capitalism has caught on with only a few Democratic Party intellectuals, such as Labor Secretary Robert Reich, but the Buchanan primary victories will encourage more discussion about American corporate behavior as the campaign progresses. Although promoting discussion about "stakeholder capitalism" is an intelligent way for Washington policy wonks to channel populist outrage over foreign competition and corporate labor shedding into a coherent examination of public policy choices, it is difficult to imagine the next Congress enacting any substantive legislation to promote stakeholder capitalism. First, the traditional models of stakeholder capitalism, such as Germany and Japan, have been suffering from prolonged recessions in part because their corporate sectors are carrying very high embedded social costs. In Germany, unemployment is rising sharply as German firms attempt to escape from the country's high social benefit costs by shifting jobs to the U.S., eastern Europe and other low wage countries. Secondly, corporations which need well trained workers are already spending heavily on education while small firms would regard legislation requiring investment in new federally mandated programs as a reason to curtail employment. Thirdly, the next Congress will still have to address the issue of federal deficit reduction, so expensive new tax allowances will be challenged by House and Senate committee chairmen. As with Bill Clinton's Putting People First program in 1993, the promises of presidential election campaigns will fade quickly if the American legislative branch remains as conservative about fiscal policy as it has been during recent years. Since the Buchanan and Forbes campaign are personality driven phenomena without any large scale organizations to influence congressional races, it is doubtful that the 1996 presidential race will produce major changes in congressional attitudes towards issues such as deficit reduction and federal spending. But as the presidential contest will dominate political news coverage during the next few months, concern about right wing populism undermining support for deficit reduction and free trade in the Republican Party will probably continue to produce a higher political risk premium in U.S. bond yields. This risk premium will be a de facto tax on the economy to compensate investors for the risk of extreme outcomes in the November elections for the White House and Congress. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013070 WT01-B14-99IA019-000202-B031-328http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/feddev4.html 198.152.185.42 19970106181357 text/html 8377HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:09:58 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:23:17 GMTContent-length: 8195Content-type: text/html Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued page 4) Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and LocalPrivatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued) The need for state and local governments to play a greater role combating thecauses of America's new income inequality at a time when the federal governmentis promoting devolution of other programs suggests that governors andlegislatures are going to face more formidable challenges during the decadeahead than at any other time in the modern era. Their policies in sectors suchas education will not simply affect the economy of their state. They will alsohave a major impact on the wage and employment trends which are driving thenational debate about trade policy, tax policy and federal regulation of thelabor market. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the struggleover America's place in the new global economic order will depend as much onthe policies of state governments as the national government. The strength of the national economy and the growth of tax receipts shouldpermit state governments to manage these challenges during 1996 and 1997. Butwhen the U.S. economy experiences another recession, state governments willhave to confront the triple challenge of faltering tax receipts, increasedspending on the unemployed and the impact of new federal block grant system onthe capacity of Washington to help them fund social programs. In such ascenario, the deficits of state governments could rise sharply and force themto curtail spending on capital investment and other services, includingeducation. How will state governments cope with the fiscal hazards posed by devolution andrecession during the late 1990's? There will be no simple answers because theU.S. no longer enjoys a broad social consensus about the role of government ateither the federal or state level. But one obvious solution which could appealto both the political left and right would be for state governments to raisemoney by privatizing various assets which could be operated more effectively bythe private sector. During the past decade, privatization has been a dominant theme for economicreformers in both the old industrial countries and the developing countries.The British government privatized its utilities, water systems and airportsduring the 1980's. China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines areencouraging the private sector to develop an extensive network of toll roads.Many Asian countries are also privatizing ports, electric systems, and phonecompanies. Argentina privatized its utility companies during the early 1980'sand is about to privatize its water companies. In the U.S. private companiessupply about 85% of electricity but the public sector still owns practicallyall of the airports and waterworks. Toll roads played an important role inAmerica's early infrastructure development but today they account for onlyabout ten percent of the national highway system. In 1994, toll roadscollected about $4.6 billion of revenue compared to $71.4 billion of governmentreceipts from highway user taxes. While it is difficult to put a precise valueon state and local government enterprises, the Reason Foundation has produced areport suggesting they have a potential market value of about $227 billion. A few cities, such as Indianapolis, have promoted the privatization of publicservices on the grounds of efficiency but the overall rate of change in theU.S. has been very modest compared to other industrial countries because stateand local governments have not been confronting fiscal problems on a scalelarge enough to require dramatic action. The U.S. federal tax system alsosubsidizes public ownership of enterprises, such as airports and water systems,by permitting state and local governments to sell tax exempt securities. Despite the great policy changes occurring in Washington today, state and localgovernments enjoy a healthy financial position as a result of both theeconomy's benign performance and the large increase in federal assistance whichoccurred during the Bush administration. But they should not permit theircurrent surpluses to lull them into complacency about the challenges which lieahead. If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be continuingpressure to lower the federal deficit through reduced financial assistance tothe states. If they win the White House, the odds would also increase of adramatic overhaul of the federal tax system which could jeopardize existing taxallowances, such as the exemption on state and local government securities, asa quid pro quo for reducing marginal income tax rates. If the Democrats win,they will move more slowly to curtail federal spending but they will also beunable to resist the demographic pressure for cuts in discretionary spendingprograms over the long-term. Devolution and the movement towards block grantswill be manageable for the states during periods of economic growth but whenthe economy finally experiences a recession, they will have to finance largeincreases in social spending without the support which has traditionally comefrom the federal government. If the federal tax allowance for state and localsecurities are eliminated, they will also have to pay higher interest rates ontheir bonds. There is no way to predict exactly when these pressures will converge in a newcrisis. The timing of any future economic shock will depend upon political andbusiness cycle factors which are still unfolding. But the basic thrust ofpublic policy is very clear. The federal government will attempt to cope withthe coming upsurge in its entitlement spending for the elderly by shifting moreresponsibilities onto the states. The states will be able to cope withdevolution when the economy is prosperous but the caps on federal block grantswill cause future recessions to increase the pressure on their fiscal positionsby more than other economic downturns in the modern era. As a result, the oddsare high that devolution will someday be looked back upon as the first stage ofa more comprehensive restructuring of the American public sector whichculminated in the widespread privatization of state and local governmententerprises during the early years of the 21st century.

The study will examine three possible options for investing social security assets in the equity market. According to a preliminary version of the report, "The Council expressed interest in three different approaches for insuring social adequacy while improving individual equity. One approach involves a slight increase in taxes on benefits, and then letting the Social Security system invest these and other funds directly in common stock, or equities. Historically, returns on equities have exceeded those on government bonds (where all Social Security funds are now invested) and if this equity premium persists, it would be possible to increase benefits for future retirees without worsening social adequacy protections against low wages and retirement benefits, disability and the financial risk of a very long life." "Another very different approach is to create individual accounts within or alongside the Social Security system. One option here would involve a slight reduction in the future growth of Social Security benefits alongside a mandatory contribution of 1.6 percent of covered payroll to individual accounts. These individual accounts would be held by the OASDI Trust Funds but with constrained investment choices available to individuals. If individuals were to devote the same share of the funds to equities as they do in private funds, they already own and manage, it would be possible to raise benefits for future retirees, again without harming social adequacy protections." "A third approach would go even further down this road of creating individual accounts by devoting a much larger share, 5 percent of covered payroll, to these individual accounts. Were this approach to be followed, for younger workers the present Social Security system would move gradually in the direction of just providing a flat benefit to full career workers, along with disability and survivor's protection. The individual accounts might be held by the central system or they might be held privately. Again, individuals would have constrained choices on how the funds were managed. There would need to be a tax of the equivalent of 1.56 percent of payroll necessary to finance the transition to this new regime, though the tax would not actually have to be a payroll tax." Ten years ago, it would have been unthinkable for the White House or the Congress to produce a report with such radical proposals for reforming social security but the aging of the baby boom generation is altering the parameters for political discussion about the nation's retirement system. The senior citizens lobby can no longer supress debate about the subject because many studies are projecting a serious funding crisis when the baby boom generation retires and the first batch of baby boom children are now only fifteen years away from the official retirement age. But even if the principle of equity investment in the social security fund is accepted, there could still be great controversy over the process by which such investment occurs. Should the government create a fund management company to supervise a social security equity fund or should the government farm out the business to independent mangers? If the government decides to encourage retirement saving through private security accounts, should it impose stringent regulatory standards on the firms which will be permitted to mange such accounts? In Chile, the government permits only a small number of firms to compete for private pension fund accounts. In the U.S. by contrast, there is little direct supervision of fund managers by the government. The major goal of public policy is to provide adequate disclosure of information about the fund performance so that individuals can chose a manager on their own. If the federal government selects a small group of fund management firms to supervise social equity accounts, it could encourage more rapid consolidation of the mutual fund industry than is already occurring. The introduction of corporate equity and bonds into the social security trust fund will also have important implications for the government's own funding needs. At present, the social security trust fund has assets of $360 billion which are invested in a special issue of Treasury debt. If the cash flow of the social security system is diversified by 40-50% into corporate bonds and equities, the government could lose direct funding currently worth $300 billion per annum or a sum in excess of the present federal deficit. Conversely, the mutual fund industry is now so large that the addition of $300 billion per annum of social security savings would broadly match the capital inflows already occurring. While potential changes in the social security system to expand equity ownership will have only a modest impact on the mutual fund industry, the growth of defined contribution pension plans through mutual funds could have a major impact on the U.S. savings rate. At present, many Americans are de facto target savers because they belong to defined benefit pension plans. Under the traditional system of defined benefit pension plans, firms often responded to a rising stock market by reducing contributions to their pension plan. The gain in asset prices made it possible for them to achieve their actuarial target with smaller savings contributions. In the 1980's overfunded pension plans also attracted corporate raiders who then financed their takeover bids by extracting surpluses from the pension plan. Under defined benefit plans, by contrast, employees can contribute as much as they want and have no clear incentive to reduce contributions in the face of rising asset prices. At a result of this change in savings incentives, the expansion of the defined contribution form of asset accumulation for retirement could have a more positive impact on the U.S. savings rate than past changes in the tax system. According to IRS data, defined contribution plans (401-K's) accounted for 29% of pension assets in 1993 or a level three times as high as prevailed in 1984. At present defined benefit pension plans have an average of 43% of their assets in equities but some firms go as high as 76%. Some commentators are concerned that in a future stock market correction, the mutual fund sector could experience large scale redemptions which would intensify any bear market. The industry already had a trial run of such a risk during 1994, when U.S. bonds experienced their greatest bear market since 1927 and several bond funds had large trading losses on derivatives. As a result of the bear market in bonds, sales of bond funds slumped and the industry experienced four consecutive months of net redemptions in late 1994. The redemptions peaked at $5.3 billion in November of 1994 compared to sales of $10-15 billion per month one year before. But the industry stabilized in early 1995 and enjoyed renewed sales as bond markets rallied during the next nine months. Equity funds have had no net redemptions since the current bull market began but sales have fluctuated in a range as low as $4.7 billion per month during late 1994 and as high as $24 billion during January, 1996. In past bear markets, the mutual fund sector was also more resilient than many of today's pessimists probably realize. After the 1987 stock market crash, the industry suffered net redemptions equal to 4.5% of assets in its equity funds but the outflows persisted for only a brief period because the market itself quickly stabilized. The 1962 stock market crash did not have a major impact on mutual fund redemptions while there were only modest redemptions after the market corrections of 1970 and 1990. The severe bear market of 1974 produced a sharp decline in financial asset prices and mutual fund sales but there was no large scale withdrawal of funds from the industry. Instead, the industry suffered several years of modest net redemptions which ceased after interest rates fell sharply in 1983. What remains unclear is whether the mutual fund industry was resilient during past bear markets because the ownership of assets was far more narrowly concentrated among upper income people. Before the 1980's, the assets of equity mutual funds also were very modest compared to the household sector's direct ownership of equities. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013370 WT01-B14-101IA019-000202-B033-120http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/areworld4.html 198.152.185.42 19970106182401 text/html 8990HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:20:02 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 30-Oct-96 15:15:56 GMTContent-length: 8805Content-type: text/html Are World Financial Markets Underpricing Political Risk? (continued page 4) The Weekly Money Report (continued) October 21, 1996 There has been such a broad based global rally in equity and bondprices during recent weeks that the strength of Wall Street hasnot had a major impact on the value of the dollar. Buying and selling of the D-mark in response to changing perceptionsof the outlook for European monetary union has driven fluctuationsin the dollar/D-mark rate, not economic developments in the U.S.itself. The monetary union factor is likely to remain the dominantinfluence on the D-mark for many months to come. If the Russianpolitical situation deteriorates significantly in the aftermathof Mr. Lebed's dismissal, there could be broad based selling ofEuropean currencies but the market may ultimately respond positivelyto the Lebed dismissal if it bolsters the odds of Mr. Chernomyrdinreplacing Mr. Yeltsin in the event that his health deterioratefurther. Mr. Lebed has little support in the military and hispositive showing in the recent presidential election resultedfrom Mr. Yeltsin's financial backers giving him a boost in thefinal weeks of the campaign. Russia has many new wealthy peopleand they will rally around the current prime minister or mayorof Moscow in the next presidential election. The most recent German economic data confirms that the economyexperienced a healthy upturn during the third quarter, but Frenchdata continues to show depressed confidence in both the corporateand household sectors. Strikes will also disrupt the French economyduring the next few weeks. While the focal point of the market'sEMU concerns during recent days has been Spain and Italy, itis important to remember that monetary union could still be derailedif the French economy fails to improve during the next few quarters.France will not be able to achieve its budget targets withoutan economic upturn in 1997. The Juppe government could also suffermajor parliamentary losses in the 1998 parliamentary electionsif the economy fails to improve. Indeed, President Chriac willprobably abandon Mr. Juppe next spring if French unemploymentcontinues to increase. Japan will hold elections for its national parliament (the Diet)on October 20th. On the basis of current opinion polls, the LDPwill probably emerge as the dominant party again and may evenwin an outright majority. As with New Zealand, the coming Japaneseelection will be the first to be held under a system of proportionalrepresentation. As a result, the old post-1955 division betweenan entrenched LDP majority and a permanent socialist minoritywill give way to a new equilibrium with two large centrist parties,one moderate sized centrist party and a few fringe parties. Ifthe LDP fails to win a majority, it will have to form a coalitionwith the small centrist party or persuade members of the otherlarge centrist party to defect. As the other parties have campaignedfor delaying next year's consumption tax hike and pursuing moreaggressive administrative reform than the LDP is advocating, sucha coalition would probably have a more positive impact on forecastsof Japan' intermediate term growth outlook than a clear LDP majority.In fact, with the Japanese current account surplus now showingsigns of recovery, there is a risk that the return of a one partyLDP government could set the stage for renewed friction betweenWashington and Tokyo over whether Japan is pursuing sufficientmacroeocnomic stimulus and microeconomic reform to stabilize thetrade surplus at moderate levels. The major case for a further large correction of the dollar againstthe yen is the need for Japanese financial institutions to boostthe yields on their investment portfolios. The Japanese corporatesector has a funding deficiency in its system of retirement savingsequal to about 25% of corporate equity. Japanese life insurancecompanies have to generate a yield of at least 3.6% in order tosatisfy their policy holders while the yield on Japanese moneymarket assets is only 50 basis points. As a result of the constraintson earning higher yields from Japanese assets, the most obviousway for Japanese investment institutions to enhance their portfolioreturn is to purchase more foreign debt and equities. There wasstrong Japanese demand for U.S .bonds during August but this couldchange quickly if there is any hint that the Clinton administrationwill modify its exchange rate policy after the election. The WhiteHouse has favored a strong dollar since mid-1995 in order to lessenthe risk of a financial meltdown in Japan and encourage strongforeign demand for U.S. securities at a time when the currentaccount deficit is still large. While the current exchange ratepolicy should remain intact through the next few months, thereare many people in Washington who believe that deliberate dollardepreciation/yen appreciation is an effective instrument for forcingJapan to pursue more expansionary macroeconomics policies andstructural reform. They will not remain silent if the Japanesetrade surplus resumes widening during 1997 against a backgroundof static economic policy under a revitalized LDP. To summarize, the resilience of financial marketsin countries as diverse as New Zealand, the Ukraine and Italyduring recent weeks confirms that the world is awash with surplusliquidity and that investors have a robust appetite for increasingrisk in order to earn higher returns. The global financial marketshave not been in such a speculative mood since the second halfof 1993. The major threat to this new financial euphoria wouldbe a resurgence of U.S. output growth during the fourth quarterwhich compelled the Fed to raise interest rates by 25-50 basispoints. There also could be a correction if President Clintonwins re-election on a scale large enough to elect a DemocraticCongress with a house majority of 25 seats or more, but as theNew Zealand election demonstrates, investors might even downplaythe risks poised by a Democratic Congress on the grounds thatpoliticians have lost their ability to pursue policies hostileto investors in the new global order of unrestricted electronictransmission of information and capital. Ironically, though, theelection of a pro-business LDP government in Japan could set thestage for new yen/dollar tensions during 1997 if it encouragesrenewed complacency about microeconomic reform in Japan againstthe backdrop of a resurgent trade surplus.

(continued page 4) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 26, 1996 The Bank of France is a potentially interesting candidate forrevenue enhancement because it currently has one of the lowestrates of profitability of all European central banks. Itsbalance sheet has assets of $143 billion compared to $234 billionfor the Bundesbank, $193 billion for the Bank of Italy, and $114.5billion for the Bank of Spain. Yet, the after-tax profits ofthe Bank of France were only $280 million during 1995 comparedto $7.6 billion for the Bundesbank, $443 million for the Bankof Italy and $1.8 billion for the Bank of Spain. Despite muchsmaller balance sheets, the central banks of Holland, Britainand Austria also produced much larger profits than the Bank ofFrance. It is difficult to compare central banks across national bordersbecause of differences in their functions and responsibilities. The Federal Reserve, for example, employs 23,700 people becauseit manages the U.S. check clearing system while the Bank of Englandhas turned over such functions to the private sector. Some Europeancountries have their central banks engage in bank supervisionwhile others turn it over to independent agencies. Some centralbanks may also subsidize their commercial banks by underchargingfor certain services compared to the central banks of other countries. The Bank of France could be a tempting target for rationalizationbecause it is so labor intensive (17,632 employees) in relationto the size of the French economy and a recent study found thatthe cost of producing bank notes is four times higher in Francethan in Britain. France also has not taken advantage of the newgold leasing market developed by the Bank of England to obtainrental income for its gold nor has it attempted to boost its profitsby realizing some of the large holding gains on its gold stock. Before World War Two, many European central banks were owned byprivate investors and thus had to be sensitive to investor pressurefor dividends. Today, only two central banks still have privateshareholders, the Bank of Japan and the Bank for InternationalSettlements. The Bank of Japan has almost 4,000 shareholderswho own about 49% of the bank's equity. The stock rose sharplyduring the late 1980's when the government was privatizing otherstate enterprises but it then declined by nearly two thirds duringthe 1990's Tokyo bear market. As the Bank of Japan distributesonly 5 million yen of its 700 million yen of profits as dividends,investors have lost interest in the stock and it now sells ata 90% discount to book value. The Bank of International Settlementsis a central bank for other central banks and trades on the Swissstock exchanges. As it has a large portfolio of gold, its shareprice often correlates with the gold price but its current shareprice is still equal to only about one half of its potential assetvalue. After the nationalization of other central banks duringthe late 1940's, issues such as shareholder accountability andprofitability ceased to be discussed. But with many Europeancountries now moving towards monetary union it is difficult tobelieve that governments will remain insensitive to the huge resourceswhich their central banks now have available to them. The five central banks which will be at the core of monetary unionin 1997 (France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria) have collectiveassets of $480 billion and 46,934 employees. The five other Europeancountries which are strong candidates to join the EM by 2002 (Italy,Finland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal) have an aggregate balance sheetof $356 billion and employment of 22,291. Hence if all nine bankswere to merge, they would have collective assets of $837 billionand total employment of 69,225 compared to the Federal Reserve'sassets of $410 billion and employment of 23,727 and the Bank ofJapan's assets of $453 billion and employment of 6,300. Under the Maastricht Treaty, the countries of Europe will continueto have independent central banks with voting rights on the councilof the new European central bank. These central banks will alsocontinue to have control over a large share of their countriesforeign exchange reserves. But in view of the pressure for reducingpublic sector deficits which exists in Europe today, it is difficultto believe that the central banks of Europe can remain immuneto the fiscal austerity engulfing other government institutions. In addition to rationalizing their central bank operations throughstaff cuts, some European countries should consider introducingradical changes in their systems of monetary control during thetransition to EMU in order to enhance investor confidence in theirconvergence prospects. Estonia's monetary regime could providean interesting role model for countries in a long transition toEMU, such as Italy, as well as for countries outside of EMU whichwant to maintain a strong exchange rate link to the new Europeancurrency. In 1992, Estonia established a currency board whichhas evolved into one of the most successful monetary regimes inthe world. At present, Estonia has nominal interest rates ofonly 8-9% despite an inflation rate of 17-18% and a current accountdeficit equal to 6-7% of GDP. The central bank is also highlyprofitable and employs only 300 people. After adjusting for loanloss reserves to offset bad debts purchased during the bankingcrisis which followed independence, the Estonian central bankshould earn a profit of $15-20 million on an asset base of $650-700million this year. Countries such as Italy and Spain, which arestrongly committed to EMU but may not qualify until the earlyyears of the next century should give serious consideration toconverting their central banks into de facto currency boards linkedto the new European currency. If the markets took the currencyboard regime seriously, their interest rates would fall sharplyand thus accelerate the process of deficit reduction. It is possiblethat Spain and Portugal will be able to achieve sufficient deficitreduction to qualify for EMU in 1997, but their odds of successwould improve if they introduced an interim monetary regimes whichenjoyed so much investor credibility that their interest ratesfell sharply during 1997 and 1998. The ratio of public debt toGDP in many European countries is now so high that it will bedifficult to achieve small fiscal deficits without large interestrate declines. To summarize, if the U.S. economy shows signs ofreviving to a growth rate in excess of 3.0% after the third quarterslowdown, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve will raiseinterest rates again. Fed tightening could come as early as theOctober 4th employment report or it could be delayed until themid-November FOMC meeting. The buoyancy of consumer confidenceand the U.S. equity markets suggests that the third quarter slowdownin final sales will be temporary but there is sufficient disagreementabout the outlook that the Federal Reserve will want confirmationof resilient final demand before it tightens. The French governmenthas been successful in selling its budget strategy to the marketsbecause investors had become so pessimistic about the prospectsfor deficit reduction during the summer that they regarded thenew budget as a positive surprise. But investor confidence inthe outlook for European monetary union could fade again if theFrench economy stalls during the fourth quarter or there is widespreadpublic hostility to the government's fiscal austerity. Francewill have parliamentary elections in ealry 1998 and economic policywill not remain static in the face of conitnuing recession. (D. Hale) David D.

(continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 2, 1996 The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey has further lessened the risk of Japanese monetary policy being tightened this autumn. The survey showed a small decline in business confidence compared to widespread expectations that it would continue the uptrend which began late last year. The survey indicates that Japan's manufacturing inventory adjustment is not yet over and that growth during the second half of 1996 will be far more subdued than it was during the first half. The yen/dollar rate has been stable during recent weeks, but the MOF will probably attempt to encourage renewed dollar strength during the run-up to the IMF meetings in early October. The recovery of Robert Dole in the opinion polls after the Republican convention and the selection of Jack Kemp as his vice-presidential running mate has helped to lessen investor concern about a potential Democratic sweep of both the presidential and congressional elections. While the President continues to enjoy nearly a ten point lead over Mr. Dole, the Republicans are now only slightly behind the Democrats in opinion polls for the congress. The decision of Mr. Dole to link his campaign so firmly to the theme of tax cuts suggests that if he scores an upset victory in the November election, the dollar will probably rally in expectation of the U.S. experiencing a replay of the fiscal policy of the early Reagan years. Investors remember that during the early 1980's the dollar rose sharply because the expansion of the federal deficit against the backdrop of a restrictive monetary policy required the U.S. to become a large scale capital importer. It is doubtful, though that the Dole fiscal policy will have nearly as dramatic an impact on the dollar as the Reagan fiscal policy. First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts. This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it. Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to a high deficit fiscal policy. The ratio of federal debt to GDP in the U.S. is now about 55% compared to only 28% when Mr. Reagan took office, so the initial conditions for a major fiscal reflation are much less suitable than they were in 1981. Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part. The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending. If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing. But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates. The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1021740 WT01-B14-104IA019-000202-B033-145http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/greensp4.html 198.152.185.42 19970106182432 text/html 9576HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:20:33 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:21:50 GMTContent-length: 9394Content-type: text/html Is Wall Street Experiencing a Greenspan or Gephardt Correction? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) July 29, 1996 Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S.labor market. In April, a German business magazine publisheda cover story about how Germany should regard the U.S. economyas a role model for labor market reform. The cover showed a pictureof Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200 pounds) tryingto squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume. Shortly after the articleappeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encouragejob creation, including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal toabolish many expensive government regulations on firms which employten workers or less. Under the previous law, such rules appliedto firms employing more than 5 people. In the U.S., by contrast,firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until their totalemployment exceeds 50 workers. The U.S. needs new government policies to improve educationalopportunity while corporations should attempt to broaden employeeparticipation in stock option programs, but attempts to imposenew regulations on the labor market will be counter productiveto job creation without necessarily reducing wage inequality. As education in the U.S. is primarily a responsibility of stateand local governments, it will be difficult for Washington basedpoliticians to have much impact on the quality of education withoutproviding much greater federal funding or structural reforms topromote more competition for the delivery of what is still a monopolypublic good in most communities. Several factors suggest that the Republicans should improvetheir standing in the opinion polls during September. Asidefrom convention publicity, they will be free from the officialrestrictions on campaign spending which were imposed on Mr. Dolebecause of his large outlays during the primary season. Mr. Doleis also starting to develop more effective campaign themes, suchas school vouchers and tax allowances for small business. Whilethese themes will not resolve his problem with highly divisiveissues such as abortion, they should help to energize constituencieswho voted Republican during the 1980's. The Clinton personal and financial scandals in Arkansas also willcontinue to be a wildcard in the political outlook. They havenot been a major factor yet because of Mr. Clinton's unique personalcircumstances compared to other presidents. As Arkansas is perceivedto be a poor corrupt state, many people discount the Clinton financialscandals as a natural outcome of the state's potential culture. As Mrs. Clinton is the most assertive first lady in the historyof the presidency, many male voters believe the president shouldbe entitled to have mistresses. What remains unclear is whetherthis tolerance for scandals will persist when voters actuallyenter the polling booth. The comments of Mr. Ken Starr to themedia could also have an important effect on voter attitudes. If he gives the impression that he might indict Mrs. Clintonor the president next year, voters could turn against the presidentin order to avoid a repetition of the paralysis which crippledthe government during Mr. Nixon's second term. While the opinion polls suggest that the Democrats have an opportunityto recapture the House, four factors suggest the Republicans shouldbe able to hold onto a small majority. First, they have raiseda great deal of money and attracted many strong new candidatesas a result of their victory in 1994. Secondly, many Democraticincumbents will retire in the south and at least 15-20 of thoseseats are potentially good prospects for a Republican takeover. Thirdly, there is a significant risk that the election for tencongressional seats in Texas will be delayed until December inorder to redraw the boundaries to eliminate radical gerry-mandening.Eight of the ten seats are Democratic seats with good Republicanpotential for a take-over. The delay in the congressional electionscould boost Republican victory prospects by depressing the turnout. In special elections, only committed voters turn out comparedto an average of 50-60% for presidential elections. Finally,the odds are high that there will be a conservative third partyin the presidential race offering Mr. Ross Perot as its candidate. As the Reform Party will not have any congressional candidates,its voters will probably support the Republicans in most houseraces. The U.S. dollar fell sharply during July because of the declinein U.S. bond and equity prices. The D-mark also benefited fromthe failure of the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates at itspre-vacation meeting in late July. As the U.S. economy is enjoying buoyant growth while the economiesof Germany and Japan are much less dynamic, the only factorwhich appears capable of producing a sustained dollar correctionis investor concern about the upcoming U.S. elections. The Bundesbankappears to have been deadlocked on a rate cut in late July becauseseveral social democratic members of the council missed the meeting. When they return in late August, the odds will increase of avote to ease further. Recent Japanese economic data point toa moderation in that country's growth rate after the spurt toa 13% growth rate during the first quarter. Government officialsalso have gone out of their way to stress that the Bank of Japanwill not raise interest rates for several months. Despite theupturn in GDP growth during the first quarter, Japan continuesto suffer from severe credit quality problems in its banking systemand there are recurring rumors of new bank failures. As Japaneseofficials would be quite happy to see the yen depreciation tothe 110-115 range, they will not feel any impulsion to raise interestrates even if the Federal Reserve hikes U.S. interest rates by50 basis points during the next few months. As a result of thesefactors, the dollar should stabilize once U.S. securities marketestablish a viable trading range and could rally if U.S. assetmarkets bottom in the near future. To summarize, the U.S. economy appears likely toexpand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the third quarter or alevel about 1.0% above the Fed's perception of the economy's non-inflationarygrowth rate. As the unemployment rate is only 5.3% and thereare increasing signs of wage acceleration in the economy, theodds are high that the Fed will decide to raise interest ratesduring August in order to insure that output growth slows to the2.0-2.5% rate by the fourth quarter. The Fed tightening, coupledwith investor concern about this autumn's elections for the presidencyand the Congress, could produce a stock market correction duringthe third quarter but such an adjustment is preferable to a largerand more dramatic adjustment during the autumn if the Fed deferstightening and then has to change its mind. The poor showingof Robert Dole in the opinion polls is increasing investor concernabout the Republicans losing control of the Congress but severalfactors suggest the Republicans should be able to retain the Houseand Senate even if Dole runs several percentage points behindClinton. The dollar is vulnerable to continuing weakness in U.S.bond and equity prices but it could improve during the late summerwhen the Bundesbank finally lowers interest rates. (D. Hale) David D.

(continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) June 21, 1996 While many western commentators believe that Russia has a culturalhistory which will discourage entrepreneurship and establishmentof a successful private sector, it is important to rememberthat Russia was a high growth economy during the decade beforethe First World War. With her large natural resource endowmentand well educated population, Russia should be able to duplicatethe 6-7% growth rates now apparent in Poland, Estonia, and otherformer communist countries in eastern Europe. But such take-offwill not happen without further action to address core structuralproblems, such as the integrity of the tax system and governmentagencies in general. There will probably also be a debate aboutwhether the strength of the ruble is discouraging exports andboosting imports excessively. After the devaluation of 1992, theruble stood at barely 10% of its purchasing power parity withthe dollar. At the end of 1995, it was 65% of its PPP value againstthe dollar and it will probably soon reach a level equal to 75-80%of its PPP value against the dollar. As Russian industry is stillin the midst of a major restructuring and trying to develop exportmarkets to compensate for the collapse of domestic spending, therewill probably be a powerful lobby arguing for a larger devaluationof the ruble than Mr. Yeltsin's policy team and the IMF have sofar advocated. As a result of the economic upturn now occurring in both the G-7countries and the developing countries adversely affected by Mexico's1995 financial crisis, the world economy should enjoy a growthrate in excess of 4.0% this year for the first time since 1988.As the recovery in Europe and Japan is much less mature than thesix year old recovery in the U.S., there is no reason why globaloutput growth should not remain above 4.0% next year as well. The global scope of the current upturn is reviving concernslast heard during 1994 about the adequacy of global savings tofinance a resurgence of investment in the old-industrial countriesas well as the emerging market economies which now encompass about45% of the world' output, 70% of its land area, and 85% of itspopulation. The world economy's major source of surplus savingsduring recent years has been the current account surplus of eastAsia while its largest consumer of savings has been the westernhemisphere. In 1995, Japan had a current account surplus of $110billion, China had a current account surplus of $16 billion, Singaporehad a surplus of $11 billion and Taiwan had a surplus of $5 billioncompared to an aggregate current account deficit of $40 billionin Korea and the other countries of Asean. In the western hemisphere,by contrast, the U.S. and Canada had a current account deficitof $160 billion while Latin America ran a deficit of $28 billion.Latin America's deficit fell sharply from $45 billion during 1994because of the Mexican crisis but Brazil, Columbia and Peru expandedtheir borrowing modestly. Europe is far closer to financial equilibriumthan either Asia or the western hemisphere. Germany and Britainhad a current account deficit of $27 billion last year but thiswas more than offset by current account surpluses of $27 billionin the Benelux countries, $17 billion in France and $20 billionin Italy. In 1996, there will be large declines in the current account surplusesof Japan and China while the deficit of the western hemispherewill probably remain unchanged. The deficit of the U.S. will shrinkmodestly but Latin America will expand its borrowing. The onlyoffset to the reduced surplus of east Asia will be a larger surplusin Western Europe as the deficit of Germany shrinks while thesurpluses of other countries linger at high levels. But with easternEurope and Russia now poised for faster growth, the Visegard countrieswill probably run a current account deficit of $8-10 while Russiacould shift from a large external surplus in 1995 to a small deficitnext by 1997. The heavy emphasis on reduction of government borrowing in themajor industrial countries today suggests the coming shift inthe composition of the world's balance of payments should posefewer interest rate risks than the world economic upturn whichoccurred during 1994 . But the revival of capital flows toLatin America, the large external deficits of the traditionalhigh savings societies of southeast Asia and the re-appearanceof eastern Europe as a major borrower indicates that some of theupward pressure on real interest rates this year is a responseto changes in the global savings and investment balance, not justconcerns about rising inflation. As a result of the Mexicancrisis many developing countries in Latin America and elsewhereare putting much greater emphasis on boosting their domestic savingsrates and thus reducing their need for external capital. But itis still unclear if savings rates will rise rapidly enough duringthe next few years to satisfy all of the capital demands whichwill develop as the global business cycle matures. To summarize, the strength of U.S. data for employment,retail sales and industrial production have increased the oddsthat the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest rates by25 basis points this summer. The hike could also come in betweenthe next two FOMC meetings in order to avoid a conflict with theDemocratic National Convention in late August. The U.S. economywill probably grow at a 3.5-4.5% annual rate during the thirdquarter and hold in a growth range close to 3.0% during the secondhalf of the year. Inflation will not accelerate dramatically butanother three quarters of above trend growth would reduce unemploymentto 4.0% and encourage a revival of industrial commodity prices. (D. Hale) David D.

(continued page 4) The Weekly Money Report (continued) February 29, 1996 The growth rate of the U.S. economy slowed to only about 0.9% during the fourth quarter from 3.6% during the third quarter and 0.6% during the first half of the year. The most distressing feature of the fourth quarter report was the weakness of domestic final sales. They expanded at only a 0.6% annual rate compared to 2.6% during the third quarter. But the fourth quarter data was depressed by special factors which should reverse during the first half of 1996. The Boeing strike produced a 10% decline in aircraft spending. Real federal government spending fell at a 12% annual rate because of the government shutdown late in the year. The government shut-down probably also contributed to weakness in private spending which requires government authorization, such as construction projects in environmentally sensitive areas of the west and exports of high technology goods with military potential. On the basis of preliminary data, one of the weakest sectors of the economy during the fourth quarter was consumer spending. It grew at an annual rate of only 0.8% compared to 2.8% during the third quarter and 3.4% during the second quarter. But newly revised retail sales suggests that the growth rate of consumer spending was probably about 1.3% while the weakness of spending was heavily concentrated in October. January retail sales fell sharply because of severe weather and the shutdown of several federal agencies during the previous month (furloughed workers lost their paychecks for several weeks) but survey data for February suggests that consumer spending is now improving. If consumer spending is recovering, the economy should be able to complete its inventory adjustment during the current quarter and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter. Surveys of business confidence suggest that the corporate sector remains confident despite the weakness of the economy during the fourth quarter. According to the latest Dun and Bradstreet survey, corporate executives expect sales to improve during April after three months of weakness recently. The D&B survey of new orders rose to 48 in January from 45 in December and 33 in November. Surveys of small business confidence are also generally positive. The January survey of National Federation of Independent Business noted, "The index of Small Business Optimism dropped 2.5 points in December from its highest reading in the expansion. The December reading of 101.5 is just 0.4 points below the average for the year of 101.9. The November 'sales bubble' burst in December and sales slipped to a mediocre level. The strong fourth quarter of 1994, which saw a good Christmas shopping season, culminated a year in which 3.3 million net new jobs were formed. Although the economy stayed close to this high employment level, it was not able to follow with yet another strong year of job creation in spite of record-high hiring plans in January. Without the buying power generated by the same volume of new paychecks, it was unlikely that the 1995 holiday season could significantly better the 1994 season in nominal dollar terms. But in real terms, the 1995 season might actually be better than 1994 because year-over-year, there was probably zero retail price inflation." The resilience of the small business sector is important because it accounts for most of the employment creation in the U.S. economy. The Manpower Employment Survey is cautious about hiring during the second quarter but in the NFIB survey, small business continues to report labor scarcity in many regions. Twenty-two percent of small firms have jobs which are hard to fill. The buoyancy of U.S. financial markets should help to bolster consumer and business spending. The household sector has become a major beneficiary of rising equity prices because of its large holdings of mutual funds. In January, it owned $1.3 trillion of equity mutual funds compared to $418 billion in early 1992 and $811 billion of bond funds compared to $449 billion in early 1992. The total value of savings accounts, small time deposits, and retail money market funds, by contrast, is $2.597 trillion. The mutual fund industry has grown so dramatically during recent years that its assets excluding money market funds will soon exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the country's national banks. If we include retail money market funds, the mutual fund industry is now larger than the national banking system. The growth of the mutual fund industry has resulted from both changes in household savings flows and stock market appreciation. In January, the market capitalization of America's 7551 listed companies (including preferred stock) was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion (6925 companies) in January, 1994 and $3.957 trillion (5608 companies) in January 1992. The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968. The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post war era it was 30% in 1974 and 1982. The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%. At first glance, the U.S. market appears to be as frothy as the Tokyo market in the late 1980's, when Japan's ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP rose to 130% from an average of 20-30% during the 1970's and early 1980's (this about 65% today). But since the U.S. corporate sector now has about one fifth of its output in other countries, the ratio of stock market capitalization of GDP should probably be adjusted to include the $1.6 trillion of sales which U.S. firms have in other countries. If we adjust the U.S. market capitalization/GDP ratio for foreign sales, it drops to about 74% from 87.5%. This ratio is still high but the fact remains that U.S. firms now have global sales opportunities on a scale unprecedented in economic history. At the peak of the Tokyo bull market, by contrast, Japanese firms had only about 7% of their output in foreign countries. American investment spending will also benefit from rising equity prices by lowering the cost of business capital. At present, the ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs for U.S. firms is about 1.7 or the highest level ever recorded in the modern era. The high value of equity in the U.S. stock market makes it possible for firms to finance new capital spending on attractive terms while enhancing the appeal of greenfield investment compared to corporate takeover activity. Inventory spending will probably be a drag on the economy during the first quarter but it should turn into a positive growth stimulant during the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, firms reduced the rate of real non-farm inventory accumulation to $23.6 billion from $38.3 billion during the third quarter and $33.8 billion during the second quarter. The weakness of the purchasing agent survey during January suggests that real non-farm inventory accumulation could decline further during the first quarter of 1996. The total index fell to 44.2 from 46.0 during January while the new order component slid to 41.8 from 45.4. The inventory index increased to 47.7 from 44.2 but it is difficult to imagine that such gains were voluntary at a time when final demand was depressed by the weather and the federal government shut-down. Manufacturing inventories rose during the fourth quarter while retail and wholesale inventories fell. The weakness of final sales during January suggests that manufacturing inventories should decline further during the first quarter. The major new risk facing the economy is rising bond yields. They have increased sharply because of investor concern about the fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries, the apparent collapse of deficit reduction talks in Washington, and the disappointment of some aggressive investors about the economy avoiding a full scale recession this spring. If bond yields continue to increase, mortgage rates will rise, depressing the upturn which should occur in housing and consumer spending on furniture and appliances this spring. The February Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus continues to show a remarkable unanimity of views among private sector forecasters. The average forecast for output growth in 1996 is 2.0% with the ten most optimistic analysts projecting a gain of 2.5% and the ten most pessimistic expecting a gain of 1.4%. In January, by contrast, the average forecast for 1996 projected 2.2% output growth. Analysts have lowered their 1996 forecasts because of downward revisions in growth estimates of the fourth quarter of 1995 as well as the first quarter of this year. In 1997, the consensus projects that output growth will accelerate to 2.1%. The ten most optimistic analysts are projecting 2.6% output growth compared to 1.6% for the ten most pessimistic. The primary factor holding most private sector growth forecasts close to 2.0% is the perception of analysts that the economy has achieved full employment and thus can sustain output growth only slightly above 2.0% if inflation is going to remain below 3.0%. If analyst perceived that the economy had more supply potential, they would probably boost their growth forecasts but since the latest GDP revisions lowered estimates of the U.S. economy's recent growth performance most forecasters are even more cautious about the economy's growth potential today than they were six months ago. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013070 WT01-B14-107IA019-000202-B033-177http://www.kemper.com:80/curious/global_economy/mutualfundboom5.html 198.152.185.42 19970106182511 text/html 8562HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:21:12 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:20:43 GMTContent-length: 8380Content-type: text/html Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued page 5) Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued) The next major test of the mutual fund industry will probably come when the world economy enjoys such a prolonged boom that inflation revives to a level which compels the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy by more than it did during 1994. The Fed doubled the level of U.S. short-term interest rates two years ago but real interest rates did not exceed 3.0% and the economy slowed so abruptly in the months after the Mexican financial crisis that the Fed was able to ease interest rates during the summer of 1995. If, by contrast, the economy had remained strong through 1995, short-term interest rates might have risen to 7.0-8.0% and provoked far larger redemptions in bond funds as well as a correction in the equity market large enough to encourage net redemptions of equity funds. In the modern era, the primary channel through which monetary policy influenced the economy was the housing market. In the era of Regulation Q ceilings on interest rates, monetary tightening would divert savings flows from thrift institutions and choke off the supply of mortgage funds for housing. After deregulation of the thrift industry, the Fed slowed the economy by pushing up interest rates to levels which depressed the demand for money in all sectors. Such monetary tightening also sometimes encouraged dollar appreciation which increased the trade deficit. As a result of the household sector's growing exposure to the stock and bond markets through mutual funds, changes in the value of household equity portfolios could emerge as a more important channel for monetary policy to influence the economy than in the past. Most econometric research has shown a weak link between consumer spending and stock market fluctuations because of the heavy concentration of equity ownership in the top 10% of the population as measured by wealth, but the parameters of this relationship could gradually change if equities continue to expand as a share of household assets and ownership becomes more diffused throughout the population. At present, the group which is probably most sensitive to the stock market driven changes in wealth is the households over the age of 65. They own far more equity than any other group and have little wage and salary income. In the past, they were referred to as fixed income people but as a result of the buoyant performance of financial markets compared to real wages during recent years, it is now people in their 20's and 30's, not senior citizens, who could be more accurately described as having fixed incomes. Younger households can share in the wealth gains of the older generation through bequests but on the basis of current demographic tables only about 5.7% of corporate equity is bequeathed over a five year period compared to 24.4% over a fifteen year period. During the past two year, households over the age of 65 have enjoyed an equity capital gain of about $250 billion compared to $125 billion for people in the age group 35-44 years and $196 billion for people in the age group 45-54 years.Two months after Alan Greenspan became Federal Reserve chairman in 1987, the New York stock exchange experienced its largest one day correction since 1929 and the Dow fell by over 23%. Since 1990, the New York market has enjoyed a seven year bull run without experiencing even the modest 5-10% corrections typical of past bull markets. Mr. Greenspan's attempt to pursue a policy of monetary fine tuning rather than large and abrupt changes in the level of interest rates certainly has contributed to the market's good performance since 1990 but he has also enjoyed the benefits of a sustained period of global disinflation. In the 1970's, by contrast, inflation shot up to double digit levels on two occasions because of oil price shocks, global crop failures, and the cost pass through pricing policies which characterized the U.S. corporate sector before the 1980's. Not coincidentally, the global economic forces which have restrained inflation and boosted equity prices during recent years also have played a role in encouraging the economic anxieties about stagnant real wages and corporate restructuring which helped to produce victories for Patrick Buchanan in the early Republican primaries. Many of the voters who have suffered from wage stagnation or job losses have not enjoyed compensating gains from rising equity prices despite the boom in mutual fund ownership. At present, only 13% of U.S. workers belong to profit sharing plans and just 3% are enrolled in Employee Stock Ownership Plans. There are even striking class divisions in the membership of 401-K plans. About 46% of white collar workers belong to 401-K plans while only 26% of blue collar workers are enrolled in such plans. The unequal sharing in the benefits of corporate rationalization and disinflation creates the risk of a political backlash against business and demands for more interventionist government policies to protect the interests of company stakeholders (employees, etc.), not just stockholders. If the corporate sector wants to contain such political pressures, it should attempt to promote share ownership among the people who have not yet found their way into the equity market through mutual funds by promoting more widespread use of ESOP's. In the past, trade unions opposed ESOP's and profit sharing but during the past decade some unions have turned to ESOP's in order to promote employee takeovers of troubled companies. The major barriers to expanding ESOP membership in the 1990's have been the reluctance of workers to accept the double jeopardy of committing capital to the same firm where they work (they naturally prefer more diversification of risk), reduced tax benefits, and disagreements about how large a role workers should have in a company's management as their share of its equity expands. More universal ownership of equity would not resolve all of the concerns about eroding real wages and job insecurity now plaguing America's labor force but it would at least help to contain the politics of envy now stirring in the U.S. presidential election campaign. If envy emerges as a dominant theme in this year's election, the financial press will soon be carrying stories about the risks posed to the U.S. economy from household wealth losses in the stock market, not just stagnant real wages.

(continued page 4) The Weekly Money Report (continued) October 21, 1996 There has been such a broad based global rally in equity and bondprices during recent weeks that the strength of Wall Street hasnot had a major impact on the value of the dollar. Buying and selling of the D-mark in response to changing perceptionsof the outlook for European monetary union has driven fluctuationsin the dollar/D-mark rate, not economic developments in the U.S.itself. The monetary union factor is likely to remain the dominantinfluence on the D-mark for many months to come. If the Russianpolitical situation deteriorates significantly in the aftermathof Mr. Lebed's dismissal, there could be broad based selling ofEuropean currencies but the market may ultimately respond positivelyto the Lebed dismissal if it bolsters the odds of Mr. Chernomyrdinreplacing Mr. Yeltsin in the event that his health deterioratefurther. Mr. Lebed has little support in the military and hispositive showing in the recent presidential election resultedfrom Mr. Yeltsin's financial backers giving him a boost in thefinal weeks of the campaign. Russia has many new wealthy peopleand they will rally around the current prime minister or mayorof Moscow in the next presidential election. The most recent German economic data confirms that the economyexperienced a healthy upturn during the third quarter, but Frenchdata continues to show depressed confidence in both the corporateand household sectors. Strikes will also disrupt the French economyduring the next few weeks. While the focal point of the market'sEMU concerns during recent days has been Spain and Italy, itis important to remember that monetary union could still be derailedif the French economy fails to improve during the next few quarters.France will not be able to achieve its budget targets withoutan economic upturn in 1997. The Juppe government could also suffermajor parliamentary losses in the 1998 parliamentary electionsif the economy fails to improve. Indeed, President Chriac willprobably abandon Mr. Juppe next spring if French unemploymentcontinues to increase. Japan will hold elections for its national parliament (the Diet)on October 20th. On the basis of current opinion polls, the LDPwill probably emerge as the dominant party again and may evenwin an outright majority. As with New Zealand, the coming Japaneseelection will be the first to be held under a system of proportionalrepresentation. As a result, the old post-1955 division betweenan entrenched LDP majority and a permanent socialist minoritywill give way to a new equilibrium with two large centrist parties,one moderate sized centrist party and a few fringe parties. Ifthe LDP fails to win a majority, it will have to form a coalitionwith the small centrist party or persuade members of the otherlarge centrist party to defect. As the other parties have campaignedfor delaying next year's consumption tax hike and pursuing moreaggressive administrative reform than the LDP is advocating, sucha coalition would probably have a more positive impact on forecastsof Japan' intermediate term growth outlook than a clear LDP majority.In fact, with the Japanese current account surplus now showingsigns of recovery, there is a risk that the return of a one partyLDP government could set the stage for renewed friction betweenWashington and Tokyo over whether Japan is pursuing sufficientmacroeocnomic stimulus and microeconomic reform to stabilize thetrade surplus at moderate levels. The major case for a further large correction of the dollar againstthe yen is the need for Japanese financial institutions to boostthe yields on their investment portfolios. The Japanese corporatesector has a funding deficiency in its system of retirement savingsequal to about 25% of corporate equity. Japanese life insurancecompanies have to generate a yield of at least 3.6% in order tosatisfy their policy holders while the yield on Japanese moneymarket assets is only 50 basis points. As a result of the constraintson earning higher yields from Japanese assets, the most obviousway for Japanese investment institutions to enhance their portfolioreturn is to purchase more foreign debt and equities. There wasstrong Japanese demand for U.S .bonds during August but this couldchange quickly if there is any hint that the Clinton administrationwill modify its exchange rate policy after the election. The WhiteHouse has favored a strong dollar since mid-1995 in order to lessenthe risk of a financial meltdown in Japan and encourage strongforeign demand for U.S. securities at a time when the currentaccount deficit is still large. While the current exchange ratepolicy should remain intact through the next few months, thereare many people in Washington who believe that deliberate dollardepreciation/yen appreciation is an effective instrument for forcingJapan to pursue more expansionary macroeconomics policies andstructural reform. They will not remain silent if the Japanesetrade surplus resumes widening during 1997 against a backgroundof static economic policy under a revitalized LDP. To summarize, the resilience of financial marketsin countries as diverse as New Zealand, the Ukraine and Italyduring recent weeks confirms that the world is awash with surplusliquidity and that investors have a robust appetite for increasingrisk in order to earn higher returns. The global financial marketshave not been in such a speculative mood since the second halfof 1993. The major threat to this new financial euphoria wouldbe a resurgence of U.S. output growth during the fourth quarterwhich compelled the Fed to raise interest rates by 25-50 basispoints. There also could be a correction if President Clintonwins re-election on a scale large enough to elect a DemocraticCongress with a house majority of 25 seats or more, but as theNew Zealand election demonstrates, investors might even downplaythe risks poised by a Democratic Congress on the grounds thatpoliticians have lost their ability to pursue policies hostileto investors in the new global order of unrestricted electronictransmission of information and capital. Ironically, though, theelection of a pro-business LDP government in Japan could set thestage for new yen/dollar tensions during 1997 if it encouragesrenewed complacency about microeconomic reform in Japan againstthe backdrop of a resurgent trade surplus.

(continued page 4) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 26, 1996 The Bank of France is a potentially interesting candidate forrevenue enhancement because it currently has one of the lowestrates of profitability of all European central banks. Itsbalance sheet has assets of $143 billion compared to $234 billionfor the Bundesbank, $193 billion for the Bank of Italy, and $114.5billion for the Bank of Spain. Yet, the after-tax profits ofthe Bank of France were only $280 million during 1995 comparedto $7.6 billion for the Bundesbank, $443 million for the Bankof Italy and $1.8 billion for the Bank of Spain. Despite muchsmaller balance sheets, the central banks of Holland, Britainand Austria also produced much larger profits than the Bank ofFrance. It is difficult to compare central banks across national bordersbecause of differences in their functions and responsibilities. The Federal Reserve, for example, employs 23,700 people becauseit manages the U.S. check clearing system while the Bank of Englandhas turned over such functions to the private sector. Some Europeancountries have their central banks engage in bank supervisionwhile others turn it over to independent agencies. Some centralbanks may also subsidize their commercial banks by underchargingfor certain services compared to the central banks of other countries. The Bank of France could be a tempting target for rationalizationbecause it is so labor intensive (17,632 employees) in relationto the size of the French economy and a recent study found thatthe cost of producing bank notes is four times higher in Francethan in Britain. France also has not taken advantage of the newgold leasing market developed by the Bank of England to obtainrental income for its gold nor has it attempted to boost its profitsby realizing some of the large holding gains on its gold stock. Before World War Two, many European central banks were owned byprivate investors and thus had to be sensitive to investor pressurefor dividends. Today, only two central banks still have privateshareholders, the Bank of Japan and the Bank for InternationalSettlements. The Bank of Japan has almost 4,000 shareholderswho own about 49% of the bank's equity. The stock rose sharplyduring the late 1980's when the government was privatizing otherstate enterprises but it then declined by nearly two thirds duringthe 1990's Tokyo bear market. As the Bank of Japan distributesonly 5 million yen of its 700 million yen of profits as dividends,investors have lost interest in the stock and it now sells ata 90% discount to book value. The Bank of International Settlementsis a central bank for other central banks and trades on the Swissstock exchanges. As it has a large portfolio of gold, its shareprice often correlates with the gold price but its current shareprice is still equal to only about one half of its potential assetvalue. After the nationalization of other central banks duringthe late 1940's, issues such as shareholder accountability andprofitability ceased to be discussed. But with many Europeancountries now moving towards monetary union it is difficult tobelieve that governments will remain insensitive to the huge resourceswhich their central banks now have available to them. The five central banks which will be at the core of monetary unionin 1997 (France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Austria) have collectiveassets of $480 billion and 46,934 employees. The five other Europeancountries which are strong candidates to join the EM by 2002 (Italy,Finland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal) have an aggregate balance sheetof $356 billion and employment of 22,291. Hence if all nine bankswere to merge, they would have collective assets of $837 billionand total employment of 69,225 compared to the Federal Reserve'sassets of $410 billion and employment of 23,727 and the Bank ofJapan's assets of $453 billion and employment of 6,300. Under the Maastricht Treaty, the countries of Europe will continueto have independent central banks with voting rights on the councilof the new European central bank. These central banks will alsocontinue to have control over a large share of their countriesforeign exchange reserves. But in view of the pressure for reducingpublic sector deficits which exists in Europe today, it is difficultto believe that the central banks of Europe can remain immuneto the fiscal austerity engulfing other government institutions. In addition to rationalizing their central bank operations throughstaff cuts, some European countries should consider introducingradical changes in their systems of monetary control during thetransition to EMU in order to enhance investor confidence in theirconvergence prospects. Estonia's monetary regime could providean interesting role model for countries in a long transition toEMU, such as Italy, as well as for countries outside of EMU whichwant to maintain a strong exchange rate link to the new Europeancurrency. In 1992, Estonia established a currency board whichhas evolved into one of the most successful monetary regimes inthe world. At present, Estonia has nominal interest rates ofonly 8-9% despite an inflation rate of 17-18% and a current accountdeficit equal to 6-7% of GDP. The central bank is also highlyprofitable and employs only 300 people. After adjusting for loanloss reserves to offset bad debts purchased during the bankingcrisis which followed independence, the Estonian central bankshould earn a profit of $15-20 million on an asset base of $650-700million this year. Countries such as Italy and Spain, which arestrongly committed to EMU but may not qualify until the earlyyears of the next century should give serious consideration toconverting their central banks into de facto currency boards linkedto the new European currency. If the markets took the currencyboard regime seriously, their interest rates would fall sharplyand thus accelerate the process of deficit reduction. It is possiblethat Spain and Portugal will be able to achieve sufficient deficitreduction to qualify for EMU in 1997, but their odds of successwould improve if they introduced an interim monetary regimes whichenjoyed so much investor credibility that their interest ratesfell sharply during 1997 and 1998. The ratio of public debt toGDP in many European countries is now so high that it will bedifficult to achieve small fiscal deficits without large interestrate declines. To summarize, if the U.S. economy shows signs ofreviving to a growth rate in excess of 3.0% after the third quarterslowdown, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve will raiseinterest rates again. Fed tightening could come as early as theOctober 4th employment report or it could be delayed until themid-November FOMC meeting. The buoyancy of consumer confidenceand the U.S. equity markets suggests that the third quarter slowdownin final sales will be temporary but there is sufficient disagreementabout the outlook that the Federal Reserve will want confirmationof resilient final demand before it tightens. The French governmenthas been successful in selling its budget strategy to the marketsbecause investors had become so pessimistic about the prospectsfor deficit reduction during the summer that they regarded thenew budget as a positive surprise. But investor confidence inthe outlook for European monetary union could fade again if theFrench economy stalls during the fourth quarter or there is widespreadpublic hostility to the government's fiscal austerity. Francewill have parliamentary elections in ealry 1998 and economic policywill not remain static in the face of conitnuing recession. (D. Hale) David D.

(continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 2, 1996 The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey has further lessened the risk of Japanese monetary policy being tightened this autumn. The survey showed a small decline in business confidence compared to widespread expectations that it would continue the uptrend which began late last year. The survey indicates that Japan's manufacturing inventory adjustment is not yet over and that growth during the second half of 1996 will be far more subdued than it was during the first half. The yen/dollar rate has been stable during recent weeks, but the MOF will probably attempt to encourage renewed dollar strength during the run-up to the IMF meetings in early October. The recovery of Robert Dole in the opinion polls after the Republican convention and the selection of Jack Kemp as his vice-presidential running mate has helped to lessen investor concern about a potential Democratic sweep of both the presidential and congressional elections. While the President continues to enjoy nearly a ten point lead over Mr. Dole, the Republicans are now only slightly behind the Democrats in opinion polls for the congress. The decision of Mr. Dole to link his campaign so firmly to the theme of tax cuts suggests that if he scores an upset victory in the November election, the dollar will probably rally in expectation of the U.S. experiencing a replay of the fiscal policy of the early Reagan years. Investors remember that during the early 1980's the dollar rose sharply because the expansion of the federal deficit against the backdrop of a restrictive monetary policy required the U.S. to become a large scale capital importer. It is doubtful, though that the Dole fiscal policy will have nearly as dramatic an impact on the dollar as the Reagan fiscal policy. First, under current law, no administration can enact a tax cut unless there are offsetting spending cuts. This law was enacted in order to force the Congress to adhere to long-term targets for deficit reduction and it is doubtful that a president as cautious about fiscal policy as Mr. Dole would repeal it. Indeed, the threat of a bond market collapse would probably constrain Congress from repealing the law even if the Dole-Kemp administration decided to revert to a high deficit fiscal policy. The ratio of federal debt to GDP in the U.S. is now about 55% compared to only 28% when Mr. Reagan took office, so the initial conditions for a major fiscal reflation are much less suitable than they were in 1981. Secondly, the Dole administration has a broad based economic growth agenda of which personal tax cuts are only one part. The Dole program is also committed to reducing the cost of government regulation and the legal system on U.S. business, slashing capital gains taxes and slowing the growth of Federal spending. If the Dole program encourages corporations to invest more aggressively, interest rates could rise because of strong demand for capital in the private sector, not increased government borrowing. But, as the Dole program has far more modest tax incentives for investment than the Reagan program of 1981, it will probably only have a modest impact on private capital demands and interest rates. The Reagan program directly subsidized investment through large increases in depreciation allowances whereas the Dole program is focused on capital gains relief and regulatory reform. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1021740 WT01-B14-111IA019-000202-B033-219http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/weekly_report/greensp4.html 198.152.185.42 19970106182601 text/html 9434HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:22:02 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:24:52 GMTContent-length: 9252Content-type: text/html Will Delayed Fed Tightening Set the Stage For An October StockMarket Crash? (continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) July 29, 1996 Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S.labor market. In April, a German business magazine publisheda cover story about how Germany should regard the U.S. economyas a role model for labor market reform. The cover showed a pictureof Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200 pounds) tryingto squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume. Shortly after the articleappeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encouragejob creation, including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal toabolish many expensive government regulations on firms which employten workers or less. Under the previous law, such rules appliedto firms employing more than 5 people. In the U.S., by contrast,firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until their totalemployment exceeds 50 workers. The U.S. needs new government policies to improve educationalopportunity while corporations should attempt to broaden employeeparticipation in stock option programs, but attempts to imposenew regulations on the labor market will be counter productiveto job creation without necessarily reducing wage inequality. As education in the U.S. is primarily a responsibility of stateand local governments, it will be difficult for Washington basedpoliticians to have much impact on the quality of education withoutproviding much greater federal funding or structural reforms topromote more competition for the delivery of what is still a monopolypublic good in most communities. Several factors suggest that the Republicans should improvetheir standing in the opinion polls during September. Asidefrom convention publicity, they will be free from the officialrestrictions on campaign spending which were imposed on Mr. Dolebecause of his large outlays during the primary season. Mr. Doleis also starting to develop more effective campaign themes, suchas school vouchers and tax allowances for small business. Whilethese themes will not resolve his problem with highly divisiveissues such as abortion, they should help to energize constituencieswho voted Republican during the 1980's. The Clinton personal and financial scandals in Arkansas also willcontinue to be a wildcard in the political outlook. They havenot been a major factor yet because of Mr. Clinton's unique personalcircumstances compared to other presidents. As Arkansas is perceivedto be a poor corrupt state, many people discount the Clinton financialscandals as a natural outcome of the state's potential culture. As Mrs. Clinton is the most assertive first lady in the historyof the presidency, many male voters believe the president shouldbe entitled to have mistresses. What remains unclear is whetherthis tolerance for scandals will persist when voters actuallyenter the polling booth. The comments of Mr. Ken Starr to themedia could also have an important effect on voter attitudes. If he gives the impression that he might indict Mrs. Clintonor the president next year, voters could turn against the presidentin order to avoid a repetition of the paralysis which crippledthe government during Mr. Nixon's second term. While the opinion polls suggest that the Democrats have an opportunityto recapture the House, four factors suggest the Republicans shouldbe able to hold onto a small majority. First, they have raiseda great deal of money and attracted many strong new candidatesas a result of their victory in 1994. Secondly, many Democraticincumbents will retire in the south and at least 15-20 of thoseseats are potentially good prospects for a Republican takeover. Thirdly, there is a significant risk that the election for tencongressional seats in Texas will be delayed until December inorder to redraw the boundaries to eliminate radical gerry-mandening.Eight of the ten seats are Democratic seats with good Republicanpotential for a take-over. The delay in the congressional electionscould boost Republican victory prospects by depressing the turnout. In special elections, only committed voters turn out comparedto an average of 50-60% for presidential elections. Finally,the odds are high that there will be a conservative third partyin the presidential race offering Mr. Ross Perot as its candidate. As the Reform Party will not have any congressional candidates,its voters will probably support the Republicans in most houseraces. The U.S. dollar fell sharply during July because of the declinein U.S. bond and equity prices. The D-mark also benefited fromthe failure of the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates at itspre-vacation meeting in late July. As the U.S. economy is enjoying buoyant growth while the economiesof Germany and Japan are much less dynamic, the only factorwhich appears capable of producing a sustained dollar correctionis investor concern about the upcoming U.S. elections. The Bundesbankappears to have been deadlocked on a rate cut in late July becauseseveral social democratic members of the council missed the meeting. When they return in late August, the odds will increase of avote to ease further. Recent Japanese economic data point toa moderation in that country's growth rate after the spurt toa 13% growth rate during the first quarter. Government officialsalso have gone out of their way to stress that the Bank of Japanwill not raise interest rates for several months. Despite theupturn in GDP growth during the first quarter, Japan continuesto suffer from severe credit quality problems in its banking systemand there are recurring rumors of new bank failures. As Japaneseofficials would be quite happy to see the yen depreciation tothe 110-115 range, they will not feel any impulsion to raise interestrates even if the Federal Reserve hikes U.S. interest rates by50 basis points during the next few months. As a result of thesefactors, the dollar should stabilize once U.S. securities marketestablish a viable trading range and could rally if U.S. assetmarkets bottom in the near future. To summarize, the U.S. economy appears likely toexpand at a 3.0-3.5% annual rate during the third quarter or alevel about 1.0% above the Fed's perception of the economy's non-inflationarygrowth rate. As the unemployment rate is only 5.3% and thereare increasing signs of wage acceleration in the economy, theodds are high that the Fed will decide to raise interest ratesduring August in order to insure that output growth slows to the2.0-2.5% rate by the fourth quarter. The Fed tightening, coupledwith investor concern about this autumn's elections for the presidencyand the Congress, could produce a stock market correction duringthe third quarter but such an adjustment is preferable to a largerand more dramatic adjustment during the autumn if the Fed deferstightening and then has to change its mind. The poor showingof Robert Dole in the opinion polls is increasing investor concernabout the Republicans losing control of the Congress but severalfactors suggest the Republicans should be able to retain the Houseand Senate even if Dole runs several percentage points behindClinton. The dollar is vulnerable to continuing weakness in U.S.bond and equity prices but it could improve during the late summerwhen the Bundesbank finally lowers interest rates. (D. Hale) David D.

(continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) June 21, 1996 While many western commentators believe that Russia has a culturalhistory which will discourage entrepreneurship and establishmentof a successful private sector, it is important to rememberthat Russia was a high growth economy during the decade beforethe First World War. With her large natural resource endowmentand well educated population, Russia should be able to duplicatethe 6-7% growth rates now apparent in Poland, Estonia, and otherformer communist countries in eastern Europe. But such take-offwill not happen without further action to address core structuralproblems, such as the integrity of the tax system and governmentagencies in general. There will probably also be a debate aboutwhether the strength of the ruble is discouraging exports andboosting imports excessively. After the devaluation of 1992, theruble stood at barely 10% of its purchasing power parity withthe dollar. At the end of 1995, it was 65% of its PPP value againstthe dollar and it will probably soon reach a level equal to 75-80%of its PPP value against the dollar. As Russian industry is stillin the midst of a major restructuring and trying to develop exportmarkets to compensate for the collapse of domestic spending, therewill probably be a powerful lobby arguing for a larger devaluationof the ruble than Mr. Yeltsin's policy team and the IMF have sofar advocated. As a result of the economic upturn now occurring in both the G-7countries and the developing countries adversely affected by Mexico's1995 financial crisis, the world economy should enjoy a growthrate in excess of 4.0% this year for the first time since 1988.As the recovery in Europe and Japan is much less mature than thesix year old recovery in the U.S., there is no reason why globaloutput growth should not remain above 4.0% next year as well. The global scope of the current upturn is reviving concernslast heard during 1994 about the adequacy of global savings tofinance a resurgence of investment in the old-industrial countriesas well as the emerging market economies which now encompass about45% of the world' output, 70% of its land area, and 85% of itspopulation. The world economy's major source of surplus savingsduring recent years has been the current account surplus of eastAsia while its largest consumer of savings has been the westernhemisphere. In 1995, Japan had a current account surplus of $110billion, China had a current account surplus of $16 billion, Singaporehad a surplus of $11 billion and Taiwan had a surplus of $5 billioncompared to an aggregate current account deficit of $40 billionin Korea and the other countries of Asean. In the western hemisphere,by contrast, the U.S. and Canada had a current account deficitof $160 billion while Latin America ran a deficit of $28 billion.Latin America's deficit fell sharply from $45 billion during 1994because of the Mexican crisis but Brazil, Columbia and Peru expandedtheir borrowing modestly. Europe is far closer to financial equilibriumthan either Asia or the western hemisphere. Germany and Britainhad a current account deficit of $27 billion last year but thiswas more than offset by current account surpluses of $27 billionin the Benelux countries, $17 billion in France and $20 billionin Italy. In 1996, there will be large declines in the current account surplusesof Japan and China while the deficit of the western hemispherewill probably remain unchanged. The deficit of the U.S. will shrinkmodestly but Latin America will expand its borrowing. The onlyoffset to the reduced surplus of east Asia will be a larger surplusin Western Europe as the deficit of Germany shrinks while thesurpluses of other countries linger at high levels. But with easternEurope and Russia now poised for faster growth, the Visegard countrieswill probably run a current account deficit of $8-10 while Russiacould shift from a large external surplus in 1995 to a small deficitnext by 1997. The heavy emphasis on reduction of government borrowing in themajor industrial countries today suggests the coming shift inthe composition of the world's balance of payments should posefewer interest rate risks than the world economic upturn whichoccurred during 1994 . But the revival of capital flows toLatin America, the large external deficits of the traditionalhigh savings societies of southeast Asia and the re-appearanceof eastern Europe as a major borrower indicates that some of theupward pressure on real interest rates this year is a responseto changes in the global savings and investment balance, not justconcerns about rising inflation. As a result of the Mexicancrisis many developing countries in Latin America and elsewhereare putting much greater emphasis on boosting their domestic savingsrates and thus reducing their need for external capital. But itis still unclear if savings rates will rise rapidly enough duringthe next few years to satisfy all of the capital demands whichwill develop as the global business cycle matures. To summarize, the strength of U.S. data for employment,retail sales and industrial production have increased the oddsthat the Federal Reserve will hike short-term interest rates by25 basis points this summer. The hike could also come in betweenthe next two FOMC meetings in order to avoid a conflict with theDemocratic National Convention in late August. The U.S. economywill probably grow at a 3.5-4.5% annual rate during the thirdquarter and hold in a growth range close to 3.0% during the secondhalf of the year. Inflation will not accelerate dramatically butanother three quarters of above trend growth would reduce unemploymentto 4.0% and encourage a revival of industrial commodity prices. (D. Hale) David D.

(continued page 4) The Weekly Money Report (continued) February 29, 1996 The growth rate of the U.S. economy slowed to only about 0.9% during the fourth quarter from 3.6% during the third quarter and 0.6% during the first half of the year. The most distressing feature of the fourth quarter report was the weakness of domestic final sales. They expanded at only a 0.6% annual rate compared to 2.6% during the third quarter. But the fourth quarter data was depressed by special factors which should reverse during the first half of 1996. The Boeing strike produced a 10% decline in aircraft spending. Real federal government spending fell at a 12% annual rate because of the government shutdown late in the year. The government shut-down probably also contributed to weakness in private spending which requires government authorization, such as construction projects in environmentally sensitive areas of the west and exports of high technology goods with military potential. On the basis of preliminary data, one of the weakest sectors of the economy during the fourth quarter was consumer spending. It grew at an annual rate of only 0.8% compared to 2.8% during the third quarter and 3.4% during the second quarter. But newly revised retail sales suggests that the growth rate of consumer spending was probably about 1.3% while the weakness of spending was heavily concentrated in October. January retail sales fell sharply because of severe weather and the shutdown of several federal agencies during the previous month (furloughed workers lost their paychecks for several weeks) but survey data for February suggests that consumer spending is now improving. If consumer spending is recovering, the economy should be able to complete its inventory adjustment during the current quarter and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter. Surveys of business confidence suggest that the corporate sector remains confident despite the weakness of the economy during the fourth quarter. According to the latest Dun and Bradstreet survey, corporate executives expect sales to improve during April after three months of weakness recently. The D&B survey of new orders rose to 48 in January from 45 in December and 33 in November. Surveys of small business confidence are also generally positive. The January survey of National Federation of Independent Business noted, "The index of Small Business Optimism dropped 2.5 points in December from its highest reading in the expansion. The December reading of 101.5 is just 0.4 points below the average for the year of 101.9. The November 'sales bubble' burst in December and sales slipped to a mediocre level. The strong fourth quarter of 1994, which saw a good Christmas shopping season, culminated a year in which 3.3 million net new jobs were formed. Although the economy stayed close to this high employment level, it was not able to follow with yet another strong year of job creation in spite of record-high hiring plans in January. Without the buying power generated by the same volume of new paychecks, it was unlikely that the 1995 holiday season could significantly better the 1994 season in nominal dollar terms. But in real terms, the 1995 season might actually be better than 1994 because year-over-year, there was probably zero retail price inflation." The resilience of the small business sector is important because it accounts for most of the employment creation in the U.S. economy. The Manpower Employment Survey is cautious about hiring during the second quarter but in the NFIB survey, small business continues to report labor scarcity in many regions. Twenty-two percent of small firms have jobs which are hard to fill. The buoyancy of U.S. financial markets should help to bolster consumer and business spending. The household sector has become a major beneficiary of rising equity prices because of its large holdings of mutual funds. In January, it owned $1.3 trillion of equity mutual funds compared to $418 billion in early 1992 and $811 billion of bond funds compared to $449 billion in early 1992. The total value of savings accounts, small time deposits, and retail money market funds, by contrast, is $2.597 trillion. The mutual fund industry has grown so dramatically during recent years that its assets excluding money market funds will soon exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the country's national banks. If we include retail money market funds, the mutual fund industry is now larger than the national banking system. The growth of the mutual fund industry has resulted from both changes in household savings flows and stock market appreciation. In January, the market capitalization of America's 7551 listed companies (including preferred stock) was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion (6925 companies) in January, 1994 and $3.957 trillion (5608 companies) in January 1992. The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968. The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post war era it was 30% in 1974 and 1982. The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%. At first glance, the U.S. market appears to be as frothy as the Tokyo market in the late 1980's, when Japan's ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP rose to 130% from an average of 20-30% during the 1970's and early 1980's (this about 65% today). But since the U.S. corporate sector now has about one fifth of its output in other countries, the ratio of stock market capitalization of GDP should probably be adjusted to include the $1.6 trillion of sales which U.S. firms have in other countries. If we adjust the U.S. market capitalization/GDP ratio for foreign sales, it drops to about 74% from 87.5%. This ratio is still high but the fact remains that U.S. firms now have global sales opportunities on a scale unprecedented in economic history. At the peak of the Tokyo bull market, by contrast, Japanese firms had only about 7% of their output in foreign countries. American investment spending will also benefit from rising equity prices by lowering the cost of business capital. At present, the ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs for U.S. firms is about 1.7 or the highest level ever recorded in the modern era. The high value of equity in the U.S. stock market makes it possible for firms to finance new capital spending on attractive terms while enhancing the appeal of greenfield investment compared to corporate takeover activity. Inventory spending will probably be a drag on the economy during the first quarter but it should turn into a positive growth stimulant during the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, firms reduced the rate of real non-farm inventory accumulation to $23.6 billion from $38.3 billion during the third quarter and $33.8 billion during the second quarter. The weakness of the purchasing agent survey during January suggests that real non-farm inventory accumulation could decline further during the first quarter of 1996. The total index fell to 44.2 from 46.0 during January while the new order component slid to 41.8 from 45.4. The inventory index increased to 47.7 from 44.2 but it is difficult to imagine that such gains were voluntary at a time when final demand was depressed by the weather and the federal government shut-down. Manufacturing inventories rose during the fourth quarter while retail and wholesale inventories fell. The weakness of final sales during January suggests that manufacturing inventories should decline further during the first quarter. The major new risk facing the economy is rising bond yields. They have increased sharply because of investor concern about the fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries, the apparent collapse of deficit reduction talks in Washington, and the disappointment of some aggressive investors about the economy avoiding a full scale recession this spring. If bond yields continue to increase, mortgage rates will rise, depressing the upturn which should occur in housing and consumer spending on furniture and appliances this spring. The February Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus continues to show a remarkable unanimity of views among private sector forecasters. The average forecast for output growth in 1996 is 2.0% with the ten most optimistic analysts projecting a gain of 2.5% and the ten most pessimistic expecting a gain of 1.4%. In January, by contrast, the average forecast for 1996 projected 2.2% output growth. Analysts have lowered their 1996 forecasts because of downward revisions in growth estimates of the fourth quarter of 1995 as well as the first quarter of this year. In 1997, the consensus projects that output growth will accelerate to 2.1%. The ten most optimistic analysts are projecting 2.6% output growth compared to 1.6% for the ten most pessimistic. The primary factor holding most private sector growth forecasts close to 2.0% is the perception of analysts that the economy has achieved full employment and thus can sustain output growth only slightly above 2.0% if inflation is going to remain below 3.0%. If analyst perceived that the economy had more supply potential, they would probably boost their growth forecasts but since the latest GDP revisions lowered estimates of the U.S. economy's recent growth performance most forecasters are even more cautious about the economy's growth potential today than they were six months ago. © Copyright Kemper Distributors, Inc. 1996 - All rights reserved. 1013070 WT01-B14-114IA019-000202-B033-247http://www.kemper.com:80/lite/curious/global_economy/mutualfundboom5.html 198.152.185.42 19970106182628 text/html 8420HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.1Date: Monday, 06-Jan-97 18:22:30 GMTLast-modified: Friday, 06-Sep-96 04:23:33 GMTContent-length: 8238Content-type: text/html Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued page 5) Economic Implications of the Mutual Fund Boom (continued) The next major test of the mutual fund industry will probably come when the world economy enjoys such a prolonged boom that inflation revives to a level which compels the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy by more than it did during 1994. The Fed doubled the level of U.S. short-term interest rates two years ago but real interest rates did not exceed 3.0% and the economy slowed so abruptly in the months after the Mexican financial crisis that the Fed was able to ease interest rates during the summer of 1995. If, by contrast, the economy had remained strong through 1995, short-term interest rates might have risen to 7.0-8.0% and provoked far larger redemptions in bond funds as well as a correction in the equity market large enough to encourage net redemptions of equity funds. In the modern era, the primary channel through which monetary policy influenced the economy was the housing market. In the era of Regulation Q ceilings on interest rates, monetary tightening would divert savings flows from thrift institutions and choke off the supply of mortgage funds for housing. After deregulation of the thrift industry, the Fed slowed the economy by pushing up interest rates to levels which depressed the demand for money in all sectors. Such monetary tightening also sometimes encouraged dollar appreciation which increased the trade deficit. As a result of the household sector's growing exposure to the stock and bond markets through mutual funds, changes in the value of household equity portfolios could emerge as a more important channel for monetary policy to influence the economy than in the past. Most econometric research has shown a weak link between consumer spending and stock market fluctuations because of the heavy concentration of equity ownership in the top 10% of the population as measured by wealth, but the parameters of this relationship could gradually change if equities continue to expand as a share of household assets and ownership becomes more diffused throughout the population. At present, the group which is probably most sensitive to the stock market driven changes in wealth is the households over the age of 65. They own far more equity than any other group and have little wage and salary income. In the past, they were referred to as fixed income people but as a result of the buoyant performance of financial markets compared to real wages during recent years, it is now people in their 20's and 30's, not senior citizens, who could be more accurately described as having fixed incomes. Younger households can share in the wealth gains of the older generation through bequests but on the basis of current demographic tables only about 5.7% of corporate equity is bequeathed over a five year period compared to 24.4% over a fifteen year period. During the past two year, households over the age of 65 have enjoyed an equity capital gain of about $250 billion compared to $125 billion for people in the age group 35-44 years and $196 billion for people in the age group 45-54 years.Two months after Alan Greenspan became Federal Reserve chairman in 1987, the New York stock exchange experienced its largest one day correction since 1929 and the Dow fell by over 23%. Since 1990, the New York market has enjoyed a seven year bull run without experiencing even the modest 5-10% corrections typical of past bull markets. Mr. Greenspan's attempt to pursue a policy of monetary fine tuning rather than large and abrupt changes in the level of interest rates certainly has contributed to the market's good performance since 1990 but he has also enjoyed the benefits of a sustained period of global disinflation. In the 1970's, by contrast, inflation shot up to double digit levels on two occasions because of oil price shocks, global crop failures, and the cost pass through pricing policies which characterized the U.S. corporate sector before the 1980's. Not coincidentally, the global economic forces which have restrained inflation and boosted equity prices during recent years also have played a role in encouraging the economic anxieties about stagnant real wages and corporate restructuring which helped to produce victories for Patrick Buchanan in the early Republican primaries. Many of the voters who have suffered from wage stagnation or job losses have not enjoyed compensating gains from rising equity prices despite the boom in mutual fund ownership. At present, only 13% of U.S. workers belong to profit sharing plans and just 3% are enrolled in Employee Stock Ownership Plans. There are even striking class divisions in the membership of 401-K plans. About 46% of white collar workers belong to 401-K plans while only 26% of blue collar workers are enrolled in such plans. The unequal sharing in the benefits of corporate rationalization and disinflation creates the risk of a political backlash against business and demands for more interventionist government policies to protect the interests of company stakeholders (employees, etc.), not just stockholders. If the corporate sector wants to contain such political pressures, it should attempt to promote share ownership among the people who have not yet found their way into the equity market through mutual funds by promoting more widespread use of ESOP's. In the past, trade unions opposed ESOP's and profit sharing but during the past decade some unions have turned to ESOP's in order to promote employee takeovers of troubled companies. The major barriers to expanding ESOP membership in the 1990's have been the reluctance of workers to accept the double jeopardy of committing capital to the same firm where they work (they naturally prefer more diversification of risk), reduced tax benefits, and disagreements about how large a role workers should have in a company's management as their share of its equity expands. More universal ownership of equity would not resolve all of the concerns about eroding real wages and job insecurity now plaguing America's labor force but it would at least help to contain the politics of envy now stirring in the U.S. presidential election campaign. If envy emerges as a dominant theme in this year's election, the financial press will soon be carrying stories about the risks posed to the U.S. economy from household wealth losses in the stock market, not just stagnant real wages.

(continued) The Weekly Money Report (continued) September 2, 1996 The overall scope of the Dole fiscal program is also very modest compared to the tax changes which occurred during the Reagan years. The Dole program would reduce the top marginal tax rate to 34% whereas during the Reagan years it declined to 28%. If Congress enacted every tax change proposed by the Dole-Kemp platform without cutting spending, the net fiscal stimulus to the economy would be only $58 billion during 1998 compared to a nominal GDP of $8 trillion. It is also quite likely that the capital gains tax cut would produce such a huge revenue windfall that the federal deficit would shrink during the twelve to twenty four months after the enactment of the Dole tax program. As a result of the equity bull market since 1991, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP in the U.S. is now 95% compared to a previous all time peak of 82% in 1929 and a sixty year moving average of 48%. If the household sector could realize capital gains with a tax rate of only 14%, there would be a realignment of portfolios on a scale so large that the Treasury would experience a massive revenue windfall. Thirdly, if the Dole-Kemp team takes over the White House and the Republicans retain control of the White House, there would be a far greater likelihood of radical reform in the nation's hitherto uncontrolled entitlement programs than if the nation continues with its current mix of divided government or a return to full Democratic control over the executive and legislative branches. The Republicans would be more willing to impose limitations on the growth ofMedicare spending. There is also strong support in the Republican congressional caucus for privatization of the social security system. The experience of other countries suggests that privatization of the social security system could have a very benign impact on U.S. interest rates by encouraging a rise in the household savings rate. The growth of defined contribution pension plans has already helped to sustain the private savings rate in the face of a stock market boom which will depress corporate contributions to defined benefit plans. The privatization of the social security would only accelerate this trend. There were further signs during August that the world economy's developing countries will enjoy more buoyant growth during late 1996 and 1997 than during 1995. Mexico reported a 7% year on year increase in total output during the second quarter while the peso has been so resilient that the Bank of Mexico has eased interest rates to the lowest level since the late 1994 peso crises. China announced a cut in both its lending and deposit interest rates for the second time this year. The Bank of China stresses that it will continue to restrain credit growth through non-price mechanisms such as lending quotas, but the interest rate cuts will still help to reduce the losses of the country's heavily indebted state enterprises and encourage more consumption and investment. As China accounts for about 9% of total world output, any upturn in her economy will have important implications for commodity demand as well as trade flows in the Asia-Pacific region. In June, the U.S. had a larger trade deficit with China than Japan but if China pursues a policy of reflation her import demand will rise and lower her trade surplus. The economies of southeast Asia and Korea, by contrast, are now reporting a growth slowdown because of their heavy dependence upon the electronics industry. Korea accounts for 20% of world semi-conductor production and the price of chips has fallen almost 80% this year. The electronics sector accounts for almost two thirds of Singapore's industrial production, with much of the output being produced by the branch plants of U.S. multinational companies. The slowdown in the sector should last for only a few quarters but it is a reminder of the trade vulnerability which still exists in many of Asia's high growth economies. To summarize, the government's data reports in the month of September are likely to have a major impact on both investor and Federal Reserve perceptions of the intermediate term economic outlook. If final demand continues to expand at a steady rate, there will be a sustained upturn in corporate inventory demand and production strong enough to justify at least one Federal Reserve interest rate hike before the November presidential election. If domestic final demand slows sharply from the 4.6% growth rate which occurred during the first half of 1996, the Fed will probably be able to remain passive through year end. The preliminary data for August suggests that the economy will display sufficient strength to justify a tightening move but the Fed is unlikely to arrive at a consensus on the question until he sees the employment and retail sales reports. The dollar has weakened because of investors purchasing the D-mark to hedge against the risk of European monetary union being deferred. The D-Mark could remain firm until there is more evidence of stronger European economic growth or successful fiscal policy tightening in France. The August Tanken survey confirms the Japanese economy is recovering at a very gradual pace. The Japanese economy's weakness will encourage the MOF to promote renewed yen depreciation during the run-up to October's IMF meeting. (D. Hale) David D.

(continued page 5) The Weekly Money Report (continued) February 29, 1996 When President Clinton attacked the Republican Congress for rejecting his plans to nominate Felix Rohatyn as vice chairman of the Fed, he said that he wanted to encourage a debate about whether the U.S. economy can sustain a higher growth rate. The persistence of low inflation will undoubtedly encourage such a debate at some point but as of today the American forecasting community continues to perceive that the economy's potential growth rate is only about 2.0-2.5%. If the economy's growth rate dips below that range, they believe that the Fed will ease further in order to hold unemployment close to its current level of 5.7%. If, by contrast, the economy suddenly rebounds to a 3.0-4.0% growth rate and the unemployment rate drops below 5.5%, they expect that the Fed will tighten. In his recent Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan addressed the issue of the economy's potential growth rate. He admitted that recent breakthroughs in technology should increase the economy's optimal growth rate but he was reluctant to offer any higher estimates of the economy's optimal growth rate. He said, "In light of the quickened pace of technological change, the question arises whether the U.S. economy can expand more rapidly on an ongoing basis than the 2 to 2 1/4 percent range for measured GDP forecaster for 1996 by government agencies and most private forecasters without adding to inflationary pressures, which in turn would undermine growth. The Federal Reserve would certainly welcome faster growth-provided that it is sustainable." "The particular rate of maximum sustainable growth in an economy as complex and ever-changing as ours is difficult to pin down. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve does not need to have a firm judgment on such an estimate, for persistent deviations of actual growth from that of capacity potential will soon send signals that a policy adjustment is needed. Should the nation's true growth potential exceed actual growth, for example, the disparity and lessened strain would be signaled in shorter lead times on the delivery of materials, declining overtime, and ebbing inflationary pressures. Conversely, actual growth in excess of the economy's true potential would soon result in tightened markets and other distortions which ,as history amply demonstrates, would propel the economy into recession. Consequently, we must be cautious in reaching conclusions that growth in productivity and hence of potential output has as yet risen to match the evident step-up in technological advance." "The hypothesis that advancing technology has enhanced productivity growth would be more persuasive if national data on productivity increases showed a district improvement. To a degree, the lack of any marked pick-up may be a shortcoming of the statistics rather than a refutation of the hypothesis. Faulty data could be arising in part because business purchases are increasingly concentrated in items that are expensed but which market prices suggest should be capitalized. Growing disparities between book capital and its valuation in equity markets may in part reflect widening effects of this misclassification. If this problem is indeed growing, we may be underestimating the growth of our GDP and productivity." "While the Federal Reserve does not need to establish targets - and definitely not limits - for long-term growth, it is helpful in coming to shorter-run policy insights to have some judgments about the growth in potential GDP in the past and what it is likely to be in the future. Judgments of potential, quite naturally, are based on experience. Through the four quarters of 1994, for example, real GDP, pressed by strong demand, rose 3 1/2 percent. If that were the true rate of increase in the economy's long-run potential, then we would have expected no change in rates of resource utilization. Instead, industrial capacity utilization rose nearly 3 percentage points and the unemployment rate dropped a percentage point. Moreover, we began to see signs of strains on facilities; deliveries of materials slowed appreciably and factory overtime rose sharply. These signs of developing pressures on capacity suggest that the growth rate in economic potential in 1994 was below 3 1/2 percent. In general, as we get close to presumed potential, we are required to step up our surveillance for inflation pressures." While Greenspan was unwilling to offer any bold new estimate of optimal GDP growth, there should be little doubt that he will reduce interest rates further if the U.S. economy's growth rate appears likely to remain in a range of 1.0-2.0% or less. The sharp drop in the price component of the purchasing agent survey indicates that there is little cost pressure in the industrial sector. It is true that average hourly earnings have recently began to move higher but this development reflects changes in the composition of new job creation, not wage cost-push. Employment in the highest paid managerial and professional workers group has increased by 4% during the past year while employment has fallen elsewhere. As the managerial group has a wage level about 60% above other groups, its growing share of the workforce is boosting the overall level of compensation. In the fourth quarter, there also was an uptick in the employment cost index to a 0.9% rate of change compared to 0.6% previously, but most of this gain occurred in the benefit component while wage growth remained steady. As the unemployment rate is below 6.0%, any further Fed easing will continue to be cautious but the excellent performance of cyclical inflation measures such as the purchasing agent index will cause policy makers to retain a bias towards promoting growth. The geographic composition of the economy's current weakness also will give the Fed a bias towards ease because of how the votes of Federal Reserve district presidents are allocated on a regional bias. The current boundaries of the Federal Reserve district banks were established in 1914 and designed to permit commercial bankers to reach their Federal Reserve regional bank for ready cash after a train ride of less than twenty four hours. As a result the boundaries of the Fed's regional banks no longer correlate well with the current distribution of economic activity and population in the U.S. Because geographic boundaries of the Federal Reserve's twelve districts were created in 1914, the east coast is over represented on the FOMC compared to the west (see Table 25). The San Francisco district accounts for 18% of national employment but is still allowed to cast a lone vote only once every three years. The Cleveland district accounts for 6.3% of total employment and is allowed to rotate with Chicago (15.1% of national employment) in voting every two years. There are also independent Federal Reserve districts with only 4.0-5.0% of national employment in Philadelphia and Boston while the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has the same voting power as San Francisco despite the fact that its district accounts for only 3.3% of national employment. At present, the west coast is experiencing a steady but belated upturn in business activity while Cleveland and Philadelphia have slowed after buoyant growth two years ago. Regional district presidents do not vote solely on the basis of their local economies but their perceptions of the business outlook are influenced in part by what is happening in their district. The over-representation of the eastern and central states at the expense of the western states during recent years probably encouraged monetary policy to be too restrictive during the early 1990's (when California was in a severe recession) but may now have the reverse effect because the eastern and central states are suddenly experiencing more weakness than the west.

Faulty data could be arising in part because business purchases are increasingly concentrated in items that are expensed but which market prices suggest should be capitalized. Growing disparities between book capital and its valuation in equity markets may in part reflect widening effects of this misclassification. If this problem is indeed growing, we may be underestimating the growth of our GDP and productivity." "While the Federal Reserve does not need to establish targets - and definitely not limits - for long-term growth, it is helpful in coming to shorter-run policy insights to have some judgments about the growth in potential GDP in the past and what it is likely to be in the future. Judgments of potential, quite naturally, are based on experience. Through the four quarters of 1994, for example, real GDP, pressed by strong demand, rose 3 1/2 percent. If that were the true rate of increase in the economy's long-run potential, then we would have expected no change in rates of resource utilization. Instead, industrial capacity utilization rose nearly 3 percentage points and the unemployment rate dropped a percentage point. Moreover, we began to see signs of strains on facilities; deliveries of materials slowed appreciably and factory overtime rose sharply. These signs of developing pressures on capacity suggest that the growth rate in economic potential in 1994 was below 3 1/2 percent. In general, as we get close to presumed potential, we are required to step up our surveillance for inflation pressures." While Greenspan was unwilling to offer any bold new estimate of optimal GDP growth, there should be little doubt that he will reduce interest rates further if the U.S. economy's growth rate appears likely to remain in a range of 1.0-2.0% or less. The sharp drop in the price component of the purchasing agent survey indicates that there is little cost pressure in the industrial sector. It is true that average hourly earnings have recently began to move higher but this development reflects changes in the composition of new job creation, not wage cost-push. Employment in the highest paid managerial and professional workers group has increased by 4% during the past year while employment has fallen elsewhere. As the managerial group has a wage level about 60% above other groups, its growing share of the workforce is boosting the overall level of compensation. In the fourth quarter, there also was an uptick in the employment cost index to a 0.9% rate of change compared to 0.6% previously, but most of this gain occurred in the benefit component while wage growth remained steady. As the unemployment rate is below 6.0%, any further Fed easing will continue to be cautious but the excellent performance of cyclical inflation measures such as the purchasing agent index will cause policy makers to retain a bias towards promoting growth. The geographic composition of the economy's current weakness also will give the Fed a bias towards ease because of how the votes of Federal Reserve district presidents are allocated on a regional bias. The current boundaries of the Federal Reserve district banks were established in 1914 and designed to permit commercial bankers to reach their Federal Reserve regional bank for ready cash after a train ride of less than twenty four hours. As a result the boundaries of the Fed's regional banks no longer correlate well with the current distribution of economic activity and population in the U.S. Because geographic boundaries of the Federal Reserve's twelve districts were created in 1914, the east coast is over represented on the FOMC compared to the west (see Table 25). The San Francisco district accounts for 18% of national employment but is still allowed to cast a lone vote only once every three years. The Cleveland district accounts for 6.3% of total employment and is allowed to rotate with Chicago (15.1% of national employment) in voting every two years. There are also independent Federal Reserve districts with only 4.0-5.0% of national employment in Philadelphia and Boston while the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank has the same voting power as San Francisco despite the fact that its district accounts for only 3.3% of national employment. At present, the west coast is experiencing a steady but belated upturn in business activity while Cleveland and Philadelphia have slowed after buoyant growth two years ago. Regional district presidents do not vote solely on the basis of their local economies but their perceptions of the business outlook are influenced in part by what is happening in their district. The over-representation of the eastern and central states at the expense of the western states during recent years probably encouraged monetary policy to be too restrictive during the early 1990's (when California was in a severe recession) but may now have the reverse effect because the eastern and central states are suddenly experiencing more weakness than the west.

Timothy Liu Team Members: Naoto Ebuchi , Hua Hu , Yuezhen Liu, Bill Patzert, Laure Siefridt, Wenqing Tang, Xiaosu Xie, Xiaoli Zhu Previous Members: Rebecca Tagett, Kelly Case, Anzhen Zhang, and Carol Hsu What We do We take a synergistic and interdisciplinary approach to apply space-basedobservations, ground-based measurements, and numerical model to study thecoupled ocean-atmosphere system. We improve the monitoring, from space, of ocean-atmosphere exchanges inmomentum, heat and water. We study how these exchanges force ocean circulation and distribute theheat, water, greenhouse gases, and nutrients stored in the ocean. We examine the effect of these exchanges on the enery and hydrologicbalances in the atmosphere. We focus on seasonal-to-interannual variability and predictability, butalso examine how such variability is affected by shorter time scales(intra-seasonal) changes and longer time scales (decadal) trend. We areplanning to study the manifest of long-term and global variability in localand near-term hazards, such as hurricane and monsoon.

Project Manager: James E. Graf, JPL Project Scientist: W. Timothy Liu, JPL The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Scatterometer (NSCAT), a microwave radar, will measure near-surface wind velocity (both speedand direction) over the global oceans. The information derived is critical in determining regional weather patterns and global climate. Mission Japan's Advanced Earth Observing Satellite, scheduled for launch in early 1996.The Jet Propulsion Laboratory built the NASA Scatterometer under contract to NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth. Science Objectives Acquire all-weather high-resolution measurements of near-surface winds over the global oceans. Determine atmospheric forcing, ocean response and air-sea interaction mechanisms on various spatial and temporal scales. Develop improved methods of assimilating wind data into numerical weather- and wave-prediction models. Combine wind data with measurements from various scientific disciplines to understand mechanisms of global climatic change and weather. Measurements The instrument will operate continuously at 14 GHz. Six dual-polarized antennas will collect backscatter data with a resolution of 25 km. Backscatter data will be combined and processed to yield 190,000 globally distributed wind vectors per day. Instrument Description Mass: 300 kg. Power: 275 W. Data rate: 2.9 kbps. The NSCATwill measure wind speeds and directions over at least 90% of the ice-freeglobal oceans every 2 days - under all weather and cloud conditions. Winds area critical factor in determining regional weather patterns and global climate. At present, weather data can be acquited over land, but our only knowledge of surface winds over oceans comes from infrequent and sometimesinaccurate reports from ships. Since oceans cover approximately 70% ofEarth's surface, NSCAT data will play a key role in scientist's efforts tounderstand and predict complex global weather patterns and climate systems. NSCAT has two major systems - the spaceborne instrument system and theground data processing system. The flight instrument is a specialized microwaveradar designed to measure winds over the oceans. It will be launched into a near-polar Sun-synchronous orbit on the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), scheduled for flight inearly 1996. Like its predecessor on the Seasat satellite, NSCAT will usean array of antennas that radiate microwave pulses at a frequency of 14 GHzacross broad regions on Earth's surface. This array of six, 3-m-long antennaswill scan two 600-km bands of ocean - one band on each side of the instrument'sorbital path, separated by a gap of approximately 330 km. Obtaining backscatterand wind vector information nearly continuously, NSCAT will be able to make190,000 wind measurements per day - more than 100 times the amount of oceanwind information presently available from ships. Ground computers will produce wind measurements within 2 weeks of receivingraw NSCAT data from the ADEOS spacecraft, with no backlog, throughoutthe 3-year mission. Arrangements may be made to allow near-real-time accessto these wind data by agencies such as the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration. NSCAT data products will include global backscatter data;50-km resolution ocean wind vectors in the measurement swaths, and spatiallyand temporally averaged, gridded, wind field maps. As part of the NSCAT project, NASA is also sponsoring a team of 15 scientificinvestigators who serve as project advisors during the development of theinstrument and ground data processing system and who will conduct researchbased on NSCAT data. Their studies are expected to lead to improved methods ofglobal weather forecasting and modeling - and possibly to a better understanding of environmental phenomena (such as El Nino) that greatly affect world economies. Satellite scatterometers are microwave radar instruments designed specificallyto measure near-surface wind velocity (both speed and direction) over the global oceans under all weather conditions. Wind stress is the single largest source of momentum to the upper ocean, driving oceanic motions on scales ranging from surface waves to basin-wide current systems. Winds over the ocean modulate air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture, gases and particulates, regulating the crucial coupling between atmosphere and ocean that establishes and maintains global and regional climate. Measurements of surface wind velocity can be assimilated into regional and global numerical weather models, improving our ability to predicate future weather. As the only remote sensing systems able to provide accurate, frequent, high-resolution measurements of ocean surface wind speed and direction under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions, scatterometers will play an increasingly important role in oceanographic, meteorological and climatic studies during the 1990s and beyond. Scatterometers use a highly indirectly technique to measure wind velocityover the ocean, since the atmospheric motions themselves do not substantially affect the radiation emitted and received by the radar. These instruments transmit microwave pulses and receive backscattered power from the ocean surface. Changes in wind velocity cause changes in ocean surface roughness, modifying the radar cross section of the ocean and the magnitude of the backscattered power. Scatterometers measure this backscattered power, allowing estimation of the normalized radar cross section of the sea surface. Backscatter crosssection varies with both wind speed and direction when measured at moderateincidence angles. Multiple, collocated, nearly simultaneousnormalized radar cross section measurement acquired from several detections canthus be used to solve simultaneously for wind speed and direction. The first spaceborne scatterometer flew as part of the Skylab mission in1973 and 1974, demonstrating that spaceborne scatterometers were indeed feasible. The Sea-sat-A Satellite Scatterometer (SASS) operated from June to October 19878 and proved that accurate wind velocity measurements could be made formspace. The SASS cross section measurements have been used to significantlyrefine the empirical model relating backscatter to wind velocity, and theSASS data have been applied to a variety of oceanographic and meteorologicalstudies. A single-swath scatterometer operating at C-band is presentlyflying on the European Space Agency's Remote Sensing Satellite-1 mission.When it is launched as part of the ADEOS mission in 1996, NSCAT will bethe first dual-swath, Ku-band scatterometer to fly since Seasat. Additional spaceborne scatterometers will be flown in the later 1990s on European andU.S. spacecraft. Return to the team's main page Link to the JPL home page Created by Hua Hu.

Timothy Liu Perspective The ocean is forced at the surface largely through the exchanges of water,momentum, and heat. Without surface forcing, the ocean would just be adead pool of water. The exchanges drive the transport and change thestorage of heat, water, and greenhouse gases and thus moderate the world'sclimate. The ocean feedback to climate changes must be manifested throughthese exchanges, without which the Earth would be a more hostile habitat.We need to study ocean circulation and air-sea exchanges to understandnatural global changes and to discern the anthropogenic effects. The ocean is an under-sampled turbulent fluid with non-linear interactions;processes at one scale affect processes at other scales. Adequateobservations at significant temporal and spatial scales can only beachieved from the vantage point of space. A suite of complementaryspaceborne sensors is needed to unravel the complex processes ofocean-atmosphere interaction. Our study will demonstrate that the value offlying the suite of sensors together continuously far outweighs the sum ofthe benefits of flying individual sensor one at a time, the essence of theEOS. Spaceborne sensors, however, cannot probe deep ocean and, therefore,in situ measurements are also needed. Ocean general circulation modelshave the potential of providing the dynamic interpolation and integrationof these data. Our study will take advantage of the historic opportunitycreated by the advance of computer technology and the maturity of oceangeneral circulation models in the era of EOS sensors and data systems. Goal To improve diagnosis and prognosis of global changes through theunderstanding of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Objectives To improve existing and to develop new methodologies for estimatingglobal ocean-atmosphere fluxes in momentum, energy, water, and carbondioxide. To study the changes in the transport and storage of heat, water, andgreenhouse gases by the ocean in response to surface forcing. To understand the energy and hydrologic balances of the atmosphere andtheir relation with ocean surface fluxes. Strategy The strategy of our investigation evolves over time, but it is be basedlargely on the synergistic and interdisciplinary approaches of applyingsatellite data, ground-based measurements, and numerical models. Satellite Observations Our team has strong experience in estimating ocean surface forcing usingsatellite data. We are currently using SSMI and AVHRR to estimateevaporation and latent heat; ISCCP to compute solar irradiance; GPCP(Global Precipitation Climatology Project) to provide rain; andscatterometer (ERS1) to derive wind stress. We are also using altimetersea level (from Geosat and Topex), sea surface temperature (from AVHRR) tostudy the ocean's dynamic and thermal responses. In the near future, wewill continue to use operational data from AVHRR, TOVS, SSMI, SSMT2(humidity sounding), ISCCP, and GPCP; from scatterometers and altimeters onERS1 and 2; from SeaWifs (ocean productivity); from NSCAT and OCTS onADEOS-1; from TRMM; from GLI and AMSR on ADEOS-2. We are activelypreparing for the increase in accuracy and resolution of expected EOSsensors, such as, SeaWinds, ocean altimeter, MIMR, AIRS (MHS), MODIS, CERESat the turn of the century. In Situ Monitoring and Field Campaign Our team members have participated in the design of in situ monitoringprograms and the execution of field campaigns for the Tropical Ocean ofGlobal Atmosphere (TOGA) Program and World Ocean Circulation Experiment(WOCE). We shall continue in the analysis of data from experiments, suchas, TOGA-COARE (Couple Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment) and areactively planning and will participate in new programs, such as, the GlobalDrifter Program and the Atlantic Climate Change Experiment. Global Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) Eddy-resolving OGCM with realistic thermodynamics are being studied.Realistic surface forcing derived from satellite data is being used toforce the OGCM, and the model responses are being compared withobservations both from spaceborne and ground based sensors. We will learnto interpret the difference in terms of specific physical processes andmodel weakness. Data assimilation techniques are being vigorously pursued,both for improving model performance and for interpolation and integrationof data. Surface flux derived inversely by constraining the model withdata will also be examined. We plan to extend our study to coupledocean-atmosphere models in the future.

Recent Warming Event in the Pacific May or May Not Be an El Niño [From Liu et al., 1995: Eos, Trans. of Amer. Geophys. Union, 76, No. 43,P. 429 and 437.] A recent anomalous warming event in the tropical Pacific consists of aseries of intraseanal episodes, observations from four spaceborne sensorsand simulation by an ocean general circulation model show. The figureincludes time-longitude variations, along the equator, of the 1994-1993difference in (a) zonal wind component, (b) sea level, (c) sea surfacetemperature, and (d) atmospheric water-vapor, as derived from spacebasedobservations and corresponding simulation of sea level (e) and sea surfacetemperature (f) by the Modular Ocean Model developed at the Geophysical=46luid Dynamics Laboratory when forced by realistic wind. The vertical axisrepresents time in months; the horizontal axis represents longitude, running from Indonesia, across the Pacific, to theGalapagos Islands. The zonal wind component is derived from observationsby the microwave scatterometer on the European spacecraft ERS-1. Thesea-surface height is derived from the observations by the microwavealtimeter on the joint U.S.-French Topex/Poseidon Mission. The sea-surfacetemperature is produced through optimal interpolation of data from theAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer blended with in situ data. Theatmospheric integrated water vapor is derived from observations by theSpecial Sensor Microwave Imager. Along the equator, the Trade Wind usually blows from east to west andshould be negative, following our convention. Four distinct groups ofequatorial westerly (positive) wind anomalies near the date line wereobserved by the scatterometer from July through December 1994. The windanomalies initiated eastward-propagating, downwelling Kelvin waves. Thesewaves, in turn, caused a rise in sea-level that was registered by thealtimeter. Surface-warming episodes related to the Kelvin waves wereobserved by a visible-infrared radiometer. Anomalous integrated watervapor observed by the microwave radiometer indicate that the westerly windand warming episodes are also associated with enhanced atmosphericconvection. The observed variations in sea level and sea surfacetemperature anomalies agree with simulation by an ocean general circulationmodel when forced by realistic winds, both in time and location but withslightly different magnitudes. Unlike the El Niño events of the 1980s, equatorial warming events in the1990s are more frequent, last for shorter periods, and are less intense.Whether the 1994 warming can be classified as an El Niño is being debated.The realistic simulation provides a theoretic link between the observedforcing and responses and will help to further our understanding in theinteraction between the episodic changes associated with Kelvin waves andthe low-frequency changes of El Niño. The NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) Project which is scheduled to be launched in August 1996 will provide improved wind field. Return to the team's main page Link to JPL home page Created by Hua Hu.

Thelow correlation along the equatorial waveguide in the upper figure delineatethe region where ocean dynamic is more important than surface heating. The solar irradiance is derived from cloud information provided by theInternational Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and thelatent heat flux is derived using wind and humidity from the SpecialSensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) and sea surface temperature from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).

Liu (ed.), ElsevierPress, Amsterdam.] Typhoon Violet is revealed by the wind vectors (dark arrows) and theprecipitable water (color image) on 21 September 1996, just before it hitsthe Honshu Island of Japan, causing damage and death. The wind and watervapor are derived from the observations by the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration Scatterometer [NSCAT] on the Japanese Advanced EarthObserving Satellite [ADEOS] and the Special Sensor Microwave / Imager[SSM/I] on the operational spacecraft, F-13, of the Defense MeteorologicalSpace Program, along their respective ascending orbits which are roughlyfive hours apart. Since the start of ocean observing mode on 15 September,NSCAT has observed the evolution of Violet from a tropical cyclone into anextratropical storm with developing frontal structure (in the northeast),increasing asymetry, and intrusion of drier air into the core. The overlay of wind on precipitable water dramatically visualizes not onlythe structure of this evolving system, but also the relation between thedynamics and the hydrologic balance in the mesoscale.

Liu (ed.), ElsevierPress, Amsterdam.] This image shows ocean surface wind speeds and directions over the PacificOcean on 21 September 1996, 12 UTC, derived from observations by the NASAScatterometer (NSCAT) onboard Japan's Advanced Earth Observing Satellite(ADEOS). The background color indicates wind speed and the white arrowsshow the direction of the wind. The basin-wide wind field is typical ofnear-Equinox atmospheric circulation. The strong (red color)Trade Windsblow steadily from the cooler subtropical ocean to the warm water of theIntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) located just north the Equator.Instead of blowing in the north-south direction, the winds are deflectedwestward by the Corriolis Force due to the Earth's rotation. The air risesover the warm water of ITCZ and sinks in the subtropics at the HorseLatitudes, forming the Hadley Circulation. Both the convergence area atthe ITCZ and the divergence area at the Horse Latitudes are indicated bylow wind speed of blue color. In the mid-latitudes, the high vorticity dueto strong Corriolis Force generates cyclones (yellow spirals) moving in theeastward direction. Two typhoons are observed in the western Pacific.Typhoon Violet is just south of Japan. After these data were taken,Typhoon Violet struck the East Coast of Japan causing damage and deaths.Typhoon Tom is located further east and did not land. The image is based on preliminary processing of the first set of NSCATobservations, using prelaunch model function and calibration. The NSCATdata is objectively interpolated into 12 hourly and 1 degree longitude by1 degree latitude grids, using the methodology described by Tang and Liu [JPLPublication 96-19, 1996], but with no other data used for initialization.This preliminary analysis clearly demonstrates that the high spatialresolution of NSCAT and its observing capability under cloudy conditionsimprove the monitoring of sever storms, such as typhoon, whose location andintensity are usually not well-defined by conventional methods. It alsoshows that the repeated global coverage provides a better description ofatmospheric circulation over ocean, which has not been adequately sampledin the past.

Tang, and R. Atlas, 1996: Responses of the tropicalPacific to wind forcing as observed by spaceborne sensors and simulated byan ocean general circulation model [J. Geophys. Res., 101, 16,345-16,359,1996] Satellite observations, in situ measurements, and model simulations arecombined to assess the oceanic response to surface wind forcing in theequatorial Pacific. The surface wind fields derived from observations bythe spaceborne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) and from theoperational products of the European Centre for Medium Range WeatherForecasts (ECMWF) are compared. The top figure shows significant meandifference between the two wind-stress fields. When SSMI winds are used toforce a primitive-equation ocean general circulation model (OGCM), theyproduce 3C more surface cooling than ECMWF winds for the easternequatorial Pacific during the cool phase of an El Niño Southern Oscillation(ENSO) event, as shown in the middle figure. The stronger cooling by SSMIwinds is in good agreement with measurements at the moored buoys andobservations by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).While the most significant wind differences are found off the equator(centered at 15N and 5S), the largest differences in ocean temperatureresponses are found on the equator and below the surface (as shown in thebottom figure). The bottom figure, together with the heat budget analysisusing OGCM simulated data under different winds, infers that vertical heatadvection and uplifting of the thermocline are the dominant factors in theanomalous cooling of the ocean mixed layer. The results of this studyindicate that the spacebased winds are superior to winds from weatherprediction model in forcing realistic oceanic response, particularly thesea surface anomalies during an ENSO event. The study demonstrates certainmaturity and also deficiency in OGCM, and identifies the dominant mechanismfor anomalous upper ocean cooling in the 1980s (which may be different fromthe events in 1990s as discussed by Liu et al., 1996, Eos, 76, 429 and437). It is an example of combining spacebased ocean observing sensors andOGCM for significant contribution to our understanding ofseasonal-to-interannual variability and predictability. Figure Caption The top figures shows the distribution of the absolute value of Student's twhich is the mean difference between SSMI and ECMWF zonal wind stressesdivided by the standard error. The areas where the mean difference hasmore than 1% probability to come by pure chance from wind stresses of equalmeans are colored. The middle figure shows a comparison of first-level(5-m) temperatures produced by the OGCM, when forced by SSMI and ECMWFwinds, with AVHRR and buoy SST at a location along the equator. Theclimatological annual cycle derived from the AVHRR SST is also shown.

It is based in London, UK, and is administered by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) in Washington, D.C. Privacy International publishes a quarterly newsletter (the International Privacy Bulletin) and organizes conferences each year on privacy and technology. Latest News Pakistan Info Bill, ID Cards. Radio Pakistan reported on January 22 that the federal cabinet has approved a draft Freedom of Information Act that allows citizens to request documents of any public record. An ombudsman will hear appeals. The station also reported that the cabinet approved a contract with IBM to "computerize the national citizens database and introduce computerized national identity cards." British House of Lords Rejects Police Bill. The House of Lords voted 209-145 on January 22 to modify the controversial police bill that would allow bugging of homes with only the permission of a Chief Constable.

Last modified: February 3, 1997 LATEST NEWS Senator Conrad Burns announced at the 1997 RSA Data Security Conference that he plans to reintroduce his PRO-CODE legislation. Rep. Goodlatte also announced that he plans to introduce his companion legislation in the House. RealAudio of day one of the conference. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has remanded the Karn v. State Dept. case back to the U.S. District Court in light of the new regulations. The White House released new regulations on December 30 on the export of cryptography. Jurisdiction for controls has been moved from State to commerce but the sma econtrols apply. Key escrow products will receive "favorable consideration". Products containing DES may be exported for 2 years but only if the company produces a "satisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail the steps the applicant will take during the two years transitiion period to develop, produce, and/or market encryption items and services with recoverable features." The new regulations go into effect December 30. Comments can be sent until Feb. 13, 1997. Business groups led by the Business Software Alliance earlier described the regulations as "moving in the wrong direction."C|net story on the opposition. The White House released the executive order on encryption exports on November 18. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris announced that they had completed their Guidelines for Cryptography Policy. The Guidelines emphasize "voluntary, market-driven development" of cryptography and include a strong principle in support of privacy protection. Key escrow has been downplayed. US District Court Judge Patel ruled in the Bernstein v. US case on December 18 that current restrictions on exports of cryptography violate the First Amendment. Many of the world's leading human and cyber rights organizations signed a resolution supporting unresticted use of cryptography. The groups also sponsored a conference to educate the OECD on the public and technical views on cryptography policy. UPCOMING EVENTS THE GOLDEN KEY CAMPAIGN -- PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS ONLINE A KEY, AN ENVELOPE -- Both are historic means for communicating privately and protecting personal information. Today, encryption tools provide this privacy in the electronic world. The Golden Key Campaign is being launched to raise awareness and supportfor the preservation of the right to communicate privately and theavailability of new techniques which make it possible. Privacy, a fundamental human right, has been affirmed by the US Supreme Court, the constitutions and laws of many countries, and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Privacy must be preserved as we move from paper to electronic communications. JOIN THE GOLDEN KEY CAMPAIGN -- Display the logo, link to a Golden Key site, and show your support for private communication online. The Internet Privacy Coalition is urging members of the net community to display a Golden Key & Envelope symbol on their Web pages to show support for the right of privacy and the freedom to use good tools of privacy without government restraints. We have chosen a key and envelope because we are all familiar withthese privacy tools in the physical world. Throughout history we haverecognized that individuals and organizations need the ability and the have the right to build bonds of trust, to protect new ideas and confidential information, and to promote the growth of smaller communities within the larger society. Today, we look to new tools to protect the privacy and security ofinformation in the on-line world. As electronic communicationstechnology develops, tools that enable privacy, including anonymityand authentication, are also being developed, offering historic privacy benefits in the new medium to individuals, organizations, and businessesaround the world. Presently, many governments are trying to understand how to apply andinterpret privacy laws and rights in the new electronic world. Duringthis time, individuals and corporations should join in the discussion and debate to ensure that sensible policies result. We do not object to the right of government to conduct lawful investigation. We recognize that the enforcement of law is a central concern in every democratic society. But no government has the right to restrict the ability of its citizens to make use of tools to protect their own privacy. Nor should any government put crime investigation before crime prevention. The explosive growth of the Internet and online communications requires that governments re-examine and remove policies that evolved in era that has now passed. Cryptography and the tools of privacy are now the tools of commerce, and are the electronic keys and envelopes of the information age. We must promote privacy and security on the Internet, and other online services and networks, through public availability of strong encryption and the deregulation of cryptography. If you share our goals, please display a Golden Key & Envelope logo onyour Web pages or other online offerings, and express your support for the Golden Key Campaign.

A BILLTo promote electronic commerce by facilitating the use of        strong encryption, and for other purposes.       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.    This Act may be cited as the "Promotion of CommerceOn-Linein the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996"SEC.2.FINDING;PURPOSE   (a) FINDINGS.___ The Congress finds the following:                     (1) The ability to digitize information makes        carrying out tremendous amounts of commerce and         personal communication electronically possible.           (2) Miniaturization, disturbed computing, and        reduced transmission costs make communication via        electronic networks a reality.           (3) The explosive growth in the Internet and         other computer networks reflects the potential        growth of electronic commerce and personal        communication.           (4) The Internet and the global information        infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize        the way individuals and businesses conduct business.           (5) The full potential of the Internet for the        conduct of business cannot be realized as long as it         is an insecure medium in which confidential business        information and sensitive personal information               remains at risk of unauthorized viewing, alteration,        and use.           (6) Encryption of information enables busi-        nesses and individuals to protect themselves against        the unauthorized viewing, alteration, and use of         information by employing widely understood and          readily available science and technology to ensure        the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of        information.           (7) In order to promote economic growth and        meet the needs of businesses and individuals in the        United States, a variety of encryption products and        programs should be available to promote good, flexi-        ble, and commercially acceptable encryption capab-        ilities.           (8) United States computer, computer software and        hardware, communications and electronics business are                leading the world technology revolution as those        businesses have developed and are prepared to offer         immediately to computer users worldwide a variety of         communications and computers hardware and computer        software  that provide good, robust, and easy-to-use        encryption.           (9) United States businesses seek to market the        products described in paragraph(8) in competition        with scores of foreign businesses in many countries        that offer similar, and frequently stronger, encryp-        tion products and programs.            (10) UNITED STATES businesses have beendiscouraged        from further developing and marketing products with         encryption capabilities because of regulatory efforts        by the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the         National Institute Os Standards and Technology, to        promulgate standards and guidelines in support of         government-designed solutions to encryption problems         that              (A) were not developed in the private sector;                  and              (B) have not received widespread commercial                  support.          (11) Because of outdated Federal controls, United        States businesses have been prohibited from exporting        goods encryption products and programs.          (12) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the        National Institute of Standards and Technology on the             part of the President has attempted to leverage the             desire of United States businesses to sell commercial        products to the United States Government, and sell a        single product worldwide, to force the businesses to        include features in products sold by the businesses in         the United States and in foreign countries that will            allow the Federal Government easy access to the plain         text of all electronic information and communications.                  (13) Specifically, the Secretary of Commerce, acting        through the National Institute of Standards and          Technology, has proposed that United states businesses          be allowed to sell products and programs offering good          encryption to the United States Government, and in          foreign countries only if the products and programs         inside a feature guaranteeing the Federal         Government access to a key that decrypts information        (hereafter in this section referred to as "key escrow          encryption")          (14) The key escrow encryption approach to regulating         encryption is reflected in the approval in 1994 by the         National Institute of Standards and Technology of a         Federal information processing standard for the         "clipper chip", that was flawed and controversial.          (15) The Federal Government-               (A) has designed key escrow encryption to solve                    a perceived problem: and               (B) has ignored the fact that-                   (i) there is no demonstrated commercial                       demand for features which give                       governments easy access to information;                       and                     (ii) numerous nonkey escrow encryption                      alternatives are available commercially                       from foreign suppliers and free of charge                      from the Internet.          (16) In order to promote electronic commerce in the               twenty-first century to realize the full                potential of the Internet and other computer               networks-                           (A) United States businesses should be                          encouraged to develop and market products                   and programs offering encryption                    capabilities; and                (B) the Federal Government should be prohibited                   from promulgating regulations and adopting                   policies that discourage the use and sale of                   encryption.   (b) PURPOSE- The purpose of this Act is to promoteelectroniccommerce through the use of strong encryption by-          (1) recognizing that businesses in the United States         that offer computer hardware and computer software made         in the United States that incorporate encryption        technology are ready and immediately able, with respect         to electronic information that will be essential to        conducting business in the twenty-first century to-               (A) protect the confidentiality of that                   information: and               (B) ensure the authenticity and integrity                   of that information;          (2) restricting the Department of Commerce with        respect to the promulgation or enforcement of regulations,        or the application of policies, that impose government-        designed encryption standards; and               (3) promoting the ability of United States businesses        to sell to computer users worldwide computer softwareand        computer hardware that provide the strong encryption        demanded by such users by-               (A) restricting Federal or State regulation of the                   sale of such products and programs in                   interstate commerce;               (B) prohibiting mandatory key escrow encryption                   systems; and               (C) establishing conditions for the sale of                   encryption products and programs in foreign                   commerce.SEC.3 DEFINITIONS.

One of the most egregious of these hasbeen the governmentally set limits on so-called "encryption" technologies. Today I am introducing a bill to address this major problem forbusinesses and users of the Internet. If the telecommunications law enacted this year is a vehicle to achievereal changes in the ways we interact with each other electronically, mybill is the engine that will allow this vehicle to move forward. The billwould promote the growth of electronic commerce, encourage the widespreadavailability to strong privacy and security technologies for the Internet,and repeal the out-dated regulations prohibiting the export of encryptiontechnologies. This legislation is desperately needed because the Clinton administrationcontinues to insist on restricting encryption exports, without regard tothe harm this policy has on American businesses' ability to compete in theglobal marketplace or the ability of American citizens to protect theirprivacy online. Until we get the federal government out of the way andencourage the development of strong cryptography for the global market,electronic commerce and the potential of the Internet will not berealized. The last thing the Net needs are repressive and outdated regulationsprohibiting the exports of strong privacy and security tools and makingsure that the government has copies of the keys to our privatecommunications. Yet this is exactly the situation we have today. My new bill, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996, would: - Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy andpopular World Wide Web browsers. - Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export ofother encryption technologies if products of similar strength aregenerally available outside the United States. - Prohibit the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrowencryption policies on the domestic market and limit the authority of theSecretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products. Removing export controls will dramatically increase the domesticavailability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security products andencourage the use of the Internet as a forum of secure electroniccommerce. It will also undermine the Clinton Administration's "Clipper"proposals which have used export restrictions as leverage to imposepolicies that guarantee government access to our encryption keys. The Pro-CODE bill is similar to a bill I co-authored with Senator PatrickLeahy of Vermont, except that it highlights the importance of encryptionto electronic commerce and the need to dramatically change current policyto encourage its growth. My bill does not add any new criminal provisionsand does not establish legal requirements for key-escrow agents. Over the coming months, I plan to hold hearings on this bill and encouragea public debate on the need to change the Clinton Administration'srestrictive export control policies. I will need your support as we moveforward towards building a global Internet that is good for electroniccommerce and privacy. I look forward to working with the Internetcommunity, online activists, and the computer and communications industryas this proposal moves through Congress. I'd like to hear from you, so please join me on two upcoming online eventsto talk about the new bill. The first is on America Online in the NewsRoom auditorium at 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 6. The second willbe on Hotwired's Chat at 9 p.m. EDT on May 13. In the meantime, I need your help in supporting the effort to repealcryptography export controls. You can find out more by visiting my webpage http://www.senate.gov/~burns/. There you will find a collection ofencryption education resources that my Webmaster has assembled. I trustthat the entire Internet community, from the old-timers to those juststarting to learn about encryption, will find this information useful. This bill is vital to all Americans, from everyday computer users andbusinesses to manufacturers of computer software and hardware. I verymuch look forward to working with you on this issue.

Our various offices have been raided by various police forces looking for evidence of spying or subversive activities.  Our mail has been regularly tampered with and our office in Romania has a constant wiretap.Last year in Zagreb, the security police raided our office and confiscated our computers in the hope of retrieving information about the identity of people who had complained about their activites.In every instance PGP has allowed us to communicate and protect our files from any attempt to gain access to our material as we PKZIP all our files and then use PGP's conventional encryption facility to protect all sensitive files.Without PGP we would not be able to function and protect our client group.  Thanks to PGP I can sleep at night knowing that no amount of prying will compromise our clients.I have even had 13 days in prison for not revealing our PGP pass phrases,but it was a very small price to pay for protecting our clients.I have always meant to write and thank you, and now I am finally doing it.  PGP has a value beyond all words and my personal gratitude to you is immense.  Your work protects the innocent and the weak, and as such promotes peace and justice, quite frankly you deserve the biggest medal that can be found. Please be encouraged that PGP is a considerable benefit people in need, and your work is appreciated.Could you please tell us where in Europe we can find someone who can tell us more about using PGP and upgrades etc.  If you can't tell us these details because of the export restriction thing, can you point us at someone who could tell us something without compromising you.Many thanks.---  [ I sent him a response and asked him if I could disclose his inspiring    letter to the press, and also possibly use it in our ongoing    legislative debates regarding cryptography if the opportunity arises    to make arguments in front of a Congressional committee.  I also    asked him to supply some real examples of how PGP is used to protect    human rights.  He wrote back that I can use his letters if I delete    his organization's name "to protect the innocent".  Then he sent me    the following letter.  --PRZ ]Date: Mon, 18 Mar 1996 15:32:00 +0000 (GMT)>From: [name and email address deleted] Subject: More News from [Central Europe]To: Philip Zimmermann Dear Phil,I have been thinking of specific events that might be of use to your Congressional presentation.  I am concerned that our brushes with Governments might be double-edged in that Congress might not like the idea of Human Rights groups avoiding Police investigation, even if such investigations violated Human Rights.However we have one case where you could highlight the value of PGP to "Good" citizens, we were working with a young woman who was being pursued by Islamic extremists.  She was an ethnic Muslim from Albania who had converted to Christianity and as a result had been attacked, raped and threatened persistently with further attack.We were helping to protect her from further attack by hiding her in Hungary, and eventually we helped her travel to Holland, while in Holland she sought asylum, which was granted after the Dutch Government acknowledged that she was directly threatened with rape, harrassment and even death should her whereabouts be known to her persecutors.Two weeks before she was granted asylum, two armed men raided our office in Hungary looking for her, they tried to bring up files on our computers but were prevented from accessing her files by PGP.  They took copies of the files that they believed related to her, so any simple password or ordinary encryption would eventually have been overcome. They were prepared to take the whole computer if necessary so the only real line of defence was PGP.Thanks to PGP her whereabouts and her life were protected.  This incident and the young woman's circumstances are well documented.We have also had other incidents where PGP protected files and so protected innocent people.  If the US confirms the dubious precedent of denying privacy in a cavalier fashion by trying to deny people PGP , it will be used as a standard by which others will then engineer the outlawing of any privacy.  Partial privacy is no privacy.  Our privacy should not be by the grace and favour of any Government.  Mediums that ensured privacy in the past have been compromised by advances in technology, so it is only fair that they should be replaced by other secure methods of protecting our thoughts and ideas, as well as information.I wish you well with your hearing.Yours most sincerely[name deleted]---[end of quoted material]------------------------------------------------------------------ WT01-B14-152IA075-000494-B044-135http://www.privacy.org:80/pi/reports/state_dept.html 199.34.33.146 19970209033649 text/html 158129HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sun, 09 Feb 1997 03:36:43 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 157955Last-modified: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 05:24:55 GMT State Dept HR 1994 Privacy U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE ANNUAL HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT (Privacy Report) FEBRUARY 1, 1995 Exerpted by Privacy International Full State Department Report AFGHANISTAN Widespread forced entry into homes and looting occurred in the northern citiesof Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz early in the year during intense fighting there.There were fewer reports of looting in Kabul compared with 1993, probablybecause much of the city was in ruins and many items of value had already beencarried off. A U.N. facility in Mazar-i-Sharif and the Pakistani Embassy inKabul were ransacked in early 1994. The Afghanistan National Archives werelooted in May. ALBANIA The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that Albania guarantees "thehuman rights and fundamental freedoms as accepted in international documents."The Law on Fundamental Freedoms and Human Rights addresses protectionsassociated with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. Although Article 16 provides for protection of the home from arbitrary entry orsearch, the Penal Code permits warrantless searches for weapons. Article 17calls for privacy of correspondence except "for a judgment in the interest ofcriminal proceedings or by the approval of a competent government body,assigned by law, in cases where it (encroachment) is considered indispensablefor reasons of national security." The Government is considering plans to open and examine the files of theSigurimi (the former secret police of the Communist regime), but no legislationhas been passed, and the files remain under the control of the SHIK. Seniorgovernment officials have indicated that not all files are intact and some mayhave been tampered with in the final days of the Communist regime. The AHC isconcerned that information from the files may have been used for politicalpurposes and protested the lack of legislation on their disposition. ALGERIA Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, the stateof emergency authorizes regional governors to issue exceptional search warrantsat any time. Security forces often enter residences illegally. The Governmentfails to ensure that the police adhere to lawful procedures for entering housesor monitoring correspondence. In addition, there were increasingly frequentincidents of entry into private homes by armed opposition elements, either tokidnap residents or to steal weapons or valuables. ANDORRA The Constitution provides safeguards against arbitrary interference with"privacy, honor, and reputation," and the authorities honor these. No searchesof any private premises may be conducted without a juridically issued warrant.The law also protects private communications. ANGOLA The Government routinely maintains surveillance of certain groups, such asUNITA and other opposition National Assembly deputies, opposition partyleaders, known or suspected Angolan or foreign UNITA sympathizers, and foreigndiplomats. The law requires judicial search warrants, and in practice the lawis respected. However, as far as known there were no search warrants issuedbefore the roundup of Lebanese and other foreign businessmen in 1993. ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA The Constitution provides for these rights, and there were no reports ofarbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. Thepolice must obtain a warrant from an officer of the court before searchingprivate premises. ARGENTINA The Constitution prohibits the Government from interfering in the private livesof its citizens, and the Government rarely does so. ARMENIA Apart from the provisions of the International Covenant, there is no legalprotection for the privacy of citizens, their communications, and theircorrespondence. Procedurally, the Directorate of National Security mustpetition the General Prosecutor's office for permission to tap a phone orintercept correspondence. The General Prosecutor's office purportedly mustfind a compelling need for a wiretap before it will grant the agency permissionto proceed. One of the leading opposition parties claimed to have discoveredunauthorized wiretaps on its office telephones, but there was no officialinvestigation of these allegations. There were many instances of interference with privacy during waves of armyconscription in 1994. Military recruiters appeared at houses where draft-agemen were reported to live and often threatened or detained the occupants orinflicted material damage. They seized draft-age men in public places, such asmarkets, theaters, and the subway. There are credible reports that Armenianand Nagorno-Karabakh officials forcibly conscripted refugees fromNagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. AUSTRALIA By law, the authorities may not conduct searches without a judicially issuedwarrant, and in practice they do not do so. The Government respects theprivacy of family, home, and correspondence. AUSTRIA The law provides for the protection of personal data collected, processed, ortransmitted by government agencies, public institutions, or private entities.The Constitution protects the secrecy of mail and telephone communications. A1991 law introduced permanent parliamentary control over the state police andthe military secret service. Parliamentary subcommittees to oversee theseorgans were established in September 1993. AZERBAIJAN The Soviet surveillance apparatus, reorganized as the Ministry of NationalSecurity, became more active than under the previous Elcibey government. It iswidely and credibly believed that the Ministry taps telephones, especiallythose of foreigners and prominent political and business figures. The policehave periodically raided the offices of opposition press and political partieson the grounds of a search for illicit weapons. The post-October emergencylegislation, extended in December by the legislature until early February 1995,made explicit the right to conduct such searches. The police also makeperiodic sweeps in search of young men evading the draft. THE BAHAMAS The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure. The lawusually requires a court order for entry into or search of a private residence,but a police inspector or more senior police official may authorize a searchwithout a court order where probable cause of a weapons violation exists. Suchan official may also authorize the search of a person (which extends to thevehicle in which the person is traveling) without a court order should probablecause exist for drug possession. The Government neither censors mail norrestricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publications. BAHRAIN The law empowers the Ministry of Interior to authorize entry into privatepremises without specific judicial authorization. The authorities monitor somedomestic and international telephone calls and correspondence. Police informernetworks are extensive and sophisticated. BANGLADESH The law requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering ahome. However, human rights monitors assert that the police rarely obtainwarrants and officers violating the procedure are not punished. In addition, the SPA permits searches without a warrant. Some oppositionmembers and CHT tribal leaders maintain that the intelligence servicesillegally monitor their telephones and mail. Sheikh Hasina, leader of theopposition Awami League, charged that the Government taps her telephones andhas her under surveillance. The Government denied tapping her telephone, butadmitted that the "surveillance" was provided for her protection. BARBADOS The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the lawrequires warrants to be issued before privately owned property may be enteredand searched. The Government does not routinely interfere in the private livesof its citizens. Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, inresponse to increased drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches ofhomes in certain neighborhoods, sometimes without warrants. The Governmentneither censors mail nor restricts the receipt of foreign correspondence orpublications. BELARUS Electronic monitoring of residences and telephones reportedly continued. TheKDB, the MVS, and certain border guard detachments have the right to requestpermission to install wiretaps but must legally obtain a prosecutor'spermission before installing it. Except in cases of pursuit, a prosecutorialsearch warrant is needed in order to enter a private home. BELGIUM Freedom from arbitrary state interference with privacy is guaranteed by law andrespected in practice. Search warrants issued by a judge are required unlessthe inhabitants of a domicile agree to a search. In 1994 Parliament passed legislation under which law enforcement officials mayapply to a magistrate for permission to use wiretaps. Permission is generallygranted only for limited periods of time and only for the investigation ofmajor crimes. BELIZE The Constitution provides for the protection of personal property, privacy ofhome and person, and recognition of human dignity, and the Government generallyhonors these provisions. The law requires police to obtain judicial warrantsbefore searching private property, except when they have a reasonable suspicionthat a crime is being committed and do not have time to obtain a warrant. Thepolice observe this requirement in practice. Customs officers do not need awarrant to search private property. BENIN The Constitution provides for, and the Government respected in practice, theinviolability of private property and the home, as well as the privacy ofpersonal correspondence and communications. Police are required to obtain ajudicial warrant before entering a private home, a requirement observed inpractice. BHUTAN There are no laws providing for these rights, but cultural traditions arehighly respectful of personal privacy. However, the Government has underminedthese traditions by its emphasis on promoting national integration. Forexample, a royal decree issued in 1989 made Drukpa national dress compulsoryfor all citizens. Anyone found violating the decree may be fined or sentencedto jail for a week. Although observance of the decree is lax, there areoccasional drives to stiffen enforcement, which exposes ethnic Nepalese tointimidation. According to human rights groups, police regularly conducthouse-to-house searches for suspected dissidents without explanation or legaljustification. BOLIVIA The Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy ofcitizens' lives, and the Government usually respected these provisions. Therewere credible allegations of UMOPAR abuses, including thefts of property fromhomes and illegal searches. Opponents charged that security services conductedillegal phone taps and other surveillance; these charges could not beconfirmed. The Government respects the rights of individuals to determinefamily size, religion, and political affiliations. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA The Republic's Constitution provides for the right to privacy, protection ofthe family and of children, and property. Governmental respect for theserights was the rule rather than the exception in 1994. Bosnian authoritiesattempted to monitor communications that impinged on military or other nationalsecurity concerns. Local Serbian authorities in Serb-occupied territories in Sarajevo, such asGrbavica, instituted a policy of summarily confiscating the property ofmixed-marriage couples with sons who had either fled abroad or to Federationterritory. According to a credible observer, Serbian authorities in Grbavicathreatened to confiscate the property of a mixed Serb-Muslim family whose sonfled from Grbavica to Bosnian-controlled Sarajevo and who was dating a loyalistSerb, if the son did not return to fight for a "Greater Serbia." There arefive other mixed families living in the same building with sons who have fled,who also were threatened with having their property confiscated unless theirsons acceded to the draft. The persistence of the Serbian policy of ethnic cleansing constituted sustainedarbitrary interference with family and home. Serbs continued to enter Bosnianand Croatian homes in Serb-held territory without search warrants. In thetowns of Banja Luka, Bijeljina, and Rogatica, the pattern of ethnic cleansingusually began with unauthorized entry into non-Serb homes by the BSA, Serbianpolice, or other paramilitary forces who demanded weapons and threatenedresidents with violence if they did not leave. In the village of Janja, in theBijeljina township, Serbs regularly placed Serbian refugee families in Muslimhomes, forcing the owners to live in one room. In general, in Serb-occupiedBosnia, police powers were intrusive and only minimally restricted by law orcustom. Letters carried through Serbian lines were regularly opened. In addition to forcible eviction, extortion, and robbery, Bosnian Serbauthorities routinely harassed and terrorized non-Serbs in Serb-heldterritories by breaking into homes with dynamite and threatening to blow up theoccupants; by destroying graveyards so that deceased family members had to beburied in family gardens; and by destroying farm animals and crops to starveout the population. BOTSWANA The Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of theperson, and the Government respects these rights. While judicial searchwarrants are normally required, police officers above the rank of sergeant mayenter, search, and seize property if they have reasonable grounds to suspectthat evidence might be destroyed or that a crime is in progress. Evidencegathered without a search warrant is admissible in court, but judges may and dodisqualify such evidence if it can be shown that the police had time to obtaina warrant. BRAZIL The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home.There were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entryinto homes without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. Awomen's rights group in the city of Porto Alegre reported suspected policeinvolvement in five break-ins at its offices--each time its files on spousalabuse and finances were ransacked. Wiretaps are unconstitutional except whenauthorized by a judicial authority for purposes of criminal investigation andprosecution. The inviolability of private correspondence is respected. BRUNEI Although the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individualpersons, families, or homes, this rarely happens. There are sporadic reportsof mail having been opened prior to delivery. BULGARIA The Constitution provides for inviolability of the home, protects the freedomand confidentiality of correspondence, and provides for the right to chooseone's place of work and residence. Parliament passed a bill in June regulatingthe activities of the NSS, which is responsible for civiliancounterintelligence. The law allows the Interior Minister to authorizeelectronic surveillance for up to 24 hours without informing other governmentagencies, if he determines there is imminent danger to national security. Somehuman rights groups asserted that the Government has carried out unjustifiedsurveillance of religious groups and of the outlawed Macedonian groupUMO-Ilinden (see Section 2.b.). Labor leader Krustyo Petkov charged thatsecurity services monitored union activities during the period before athreatened general strike in May. BURKINA FASO The Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authoritiesgenerally do not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. Innational security cases, however, a special law permits surveillance, searchesand monitoring of telephones and private correspondence without a warrant. Bylaw and under normal circumstances, homes may be searched only with theauthority of a warrant issued by the Minister of Justice. Except in certaincases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling dens, such warrants must beexecuted during "legal hours," defined as between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. BURMA The military rules unchecked by any outside authority and the State continuedto interfere extensively and arbitrarily into the lives of private citizens.Through its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely monitoredthe travel, whereabouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly thoseknown to be politically active. Security personnel selectively screenedprivate correspondence and telephone calls and conducted warrantless searchesof private premises. Government employees were required to obtain advancepermission before meeting with foreigners. The SLORC continued to move people out of cities to peripheral new townsettlements throughout the country, albeit on a smaller scale than in pastyears. While facilities in some of these areas have improved over time,residents targeted for displacement continued to be given no option but tomove, usually on short notice. The military also continued to forciblyrelocate villages in rural areas, especially those with large ethnic minoritypopulations. Also, those able to remain in established cities and towns were subject toarbitrary seizure of their property. Many residents of Mandalay were compelledearly in the year to cede large parcels of prime downtown real estate to theauthorities for road-widening projects decided upon without any publicconsultation or endorsement. Widespread reports indicate the Mandalay citygovernment threatened to charge demolition costs to those in affected areas whowavered in tearing down their own homes. Beyond these seizures for publicpurposes there were consistent reports of pressure being applied to forceindividuals to cede parts of their property to government or militaryofficials, in some cases for these officials' personal use. Automobiles andother movable property also remained vulnerable to arbitrary seizure. In ruralareas, military personnel confiscated livestock and food supplies duringperiodic sweeps to procure porters. BURUNDI The Constitution provides for the right to privacy and the authoritiesgenerally respect the law requiring search warrants. Security forces canmonitor telephones and are commonly assumed to do so. CAMBODIA According to human rights observers, the police routinely make arrests andconduct searches without warrants. However, the number of forced entries intohomes and offices decreased, after a high incidence during the 1993 politicalcampaign. Reports of surveillance continued, but decreased as the securityapparatus of the SOC continued to be dismantled. According to newspaperreports, the Government often monitored private citizens' telephone calls andasked telephone companies for records of conversations. There were no reportedincidences of forced political party membership. Persons in Khmer Rouge zonesare subject to rigid social controls and accorded no right to privacy. CAMEROON Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are illegal, butthere were numerous credible reports that police and gendarmes harassedcitizens and conducted searches without warrants. Security forces, includingpolice, frequently set up roadblocks to extract bribes from travelers. Thislongstanding practice appears to have increased as the economy declined. InJune a high-ranking CPDM official involved in a commercial dispute with aforeign citizen, rather than resolve his dispute through legal means, employedthe police to seize the citizen's property unlawfully. The foreign citizenthen sought redress through the courts. At year's end, the dispute remainedbefore the courts without resolution. On August 23, the national police breached accepted diplomatic immunity inforcibly entering U.S. Government diplomatic property (USAID and AdministrativeCompound) in Yaounde, removing three vehicles and miscellaneous items. Thebailiff claimed he had authority to seize the property pursuant to a courtdecision. The bailiff also claimed to have an order of execution (warrant)signed by the Attorney General. Police and bailiffs again forcibly entered thegrounds on August 26 and again attempted to seize U.S. Government property.The Embassy in both instances protested vigorously this violation of diplomaticimmunity and twice received high-level apologies. Government officialsrepeatedly promised that the vehicles would be returned to the Embassy, but atyear's end their return was still pending. There were numerous credible reports that the Government kept some oppositionactivists and dissidents under surveillance. CANADA The Constitution affords Canadians strong legal protection from arbitraryinterference, and federal and provincial governments generally do not interferewith an individual's basic rights without due process. Intrusive searches maybe carried out only when there is a demonstrable, reasonable basis forpresuming the affected person is involved in criminal activity. Policeofficials face judicial penalties for abuse of a person's privacy if they donot obtain a judicial search warrant in advance. CAPE VERDE The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, correspondence,and other means of communication, and the Government respects these rights inpractice. The law requires a judicial warrant before homes may be searched. CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC The Government rarely abused legal prohibitions on invasion of the home withouta warrant in civil and criminal cases. Title IV of the Penal Code, whichcovers certain political and security cases, allows police to search privateproperty without written authorization. Early in the year, police conductedsuch searches as part of investigations into illegal weapons caches. In atleast one other attempt, when the police did not invoke national securityprovisions, irate neighbors thwarted a politically inspired search. TheGovernment used telephone monitoring to maintain a close watch on oppositionfigures. CHAD The Transitional Charter provides for citizens' rights to privacy of home andcorrespondence, freedom from arbitrary arrest and search, and liberties ofassociation. The Penal Code further stipulates that police may search homesonly during daylight hours and only with a legal warrant. In practice,security forces conducted searches without legal warrant, day and night. Insome cases, they mistreated and extorted money from their victims. The Government also engaged in telephone surveillance of its citizens withoutjudicial supervision. CHILE The Constitution prohibits searches of the home and interception of privatecommunications, unless either a civilian or military court issues a searchwarrant for specific locations. The 1984 antiterrorist law allows courtsupervised surveillance of those suspected of terrorist crimes, and for theinterception, opening, or recording of private communications and documents insuch cases. Privacy laws do not permit the release of telephone records northe use of caller identification services. Since the return to civilian rule, there have been a number of incidentsinvolving supposed espionage. In a 1992 political eavesdropping scandal, itwas clear that an army unit was recording cellular telephone conversations ofpolitical leaders of all persuasions, including members of Congress. While itis against stated government policy to engage in this kind of politicalespionage, it is not clear whether or not it continues. CHINA Changes in the economic structure, including the growing diversity ofemployment opportunities and the increasing market orientation of many workunits, are undermining the ability of the authorities to monitor and regulatepersonal and family life as closely as in the past, particularly in ruralareas. In urban areas, however, most people still depend on theirgovernment-linked work unit for housing, permission to have a child, approvalto apply for a passport, and other aspects of ordinary life. The work unit,along with the neighborhood committee, is charged with monitoring activitiesand attitudes. Although the law requires search warrants before security forces can searchpremises, this provision is often ignored. In addition, both the PublicSecurity Bureau and procuracy apparently can issue search warrants on their ownauthority. The 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy ofcorrespondence of citizens ... are protected by law," but in practice,authorities record some telephone conversations and some mail is opened andcensored. Government security organs monitor and sometimes restrict contactbetween foreigners and Chinese citizens, particularly dissidents. Rules issuedin July implementing the State Security Law define "activities of individualsoutside the country (including non-Chinese citizens resident in China) whodisregard dissuasion and meet with personnel in the country who have endangeredstate security or who are seriously suspected of endangering state security" asa violation of the State Security Law. The Government has continued its effort to control citizens' access to outsidesources of information, selectively jamming Chinese language broadcasts of theVoice of America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation. The effectivenessof the jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals of VOA andother broadcasters reaching most parts of China. China's population has roughly doubled in the past 40 years to 1.18 billionpeople. In the 1970's and 1980's, China adopted a comprehensive and highlyintrusive one-child family planning policy. This policy most heavily affectsHan Chinese in urban areas. Urban couples seldom obtain permission to have asecond child. However, exceptions are allowed for the 70 percent of Han wholive in rural areas, and ethnic minorities are subject to less stringentpopulation controls. Enforcement of the family planning policy isinconsistent, varying widely from place to place and year to year. The population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economicincentives, as well as more coercive measures, including psychological pressureand economic penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy includemonthly stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits.Disciplinary measures against those who violate the policy include fines,withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative punishments,such as loss of employment. Unpaid fines have sometimes resulted inconfiscation or destruction of personal property. Because penalties for excessbirths can be levied against local officials and the mothers' work units, manyindividuals are affected, providing multiple sources of pressure. Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is not authorized,but Chinese officials acknowledge privately that there are instances of forcedabortions and sterilizations. Officials maintain that, when discovered,responsible officials are disciplined and undergo retraining. They admit,however, that stronger punishment is rare. Individuals can also sue officialswho have exceeded their authority in implementing family planning policy, butgovernment officials have not provided data on the number of successful suitson these grounds. Regulations forbid sex-selective abortion, but because of the traditionalpreference for male children, particularly in rural areas, some families haveused ultrasound to identify and abort female fetuses. Use of ultrasound forthis purpose was specifically prohibited by the Maternal and Child Health Lawpassed in October, which prescribes penalties for medical practitioners whoviolate this provision. The Chinese press has reported that the ratio of maleto female births is 114 to 100, based on a nationwide average, while thestatistical norm is 106 male births to 100 female. The ratio excludes manyfemale births, especially the second or third in a family, which are unreportedto permit the parents to keep trying to conceive a boy, but may also reflectthe abuse of sonography. Female infanticide may also be a factor in some areasof China. At least five provincial governments have implemented regulations seeking toprevent people with severe mental handicaps from having children. In OctoberChina passed a national Maternal and Child Care Law calling for premarital andprenatal examinations to determine whether couples have acute infectiousdiseases, certain mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or areat risk for passing on debilitating genetic diseases. The law goes into effecton June 1, 1995, and implementing regulations defining which diseases orconditions will be covered have not yet been completed. The law will beimplemented by the Ministry of Health, not the State Family PlanningCommission, and while it includes provisions for abortion or sterilization insome cases based on medical advice, it provides for obtaining a second opinionand mandates that patients or their guardians give written consent to suchprocedures. (See also Section 5 on People with Disabilities.) There were no reported cases of prosecution of parents for teaching theirchildren religion in the privacy of their home. COLOMBIA The law generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a privatehome, except in cases of hot pursuit. In remote regions of the country, themilitary forces have civilian prosecutorial units delegated to them. Humanrights groups charged that these delegate units were unconstitutional, andCongress refused to grant them permanent status. Nonetheless, there werecredible reports that they continued to function, often facilitating armysearches with little regard for judicious issuance of search warrants. In oneexample, the Nueva Granada battalion carried out over 60 searches anddetentions in the rural areas surrounding Barrancabermeja between January andMarch. Many of the detainees reported that soldiers mistreated and unjustlyinterrogated them. A judge must authorize telephone wiretaps and the interception of mail. Thisprotection extends to prisoners incarcerated in the penal system. COMOROS The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and property. Therewere no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence. CONGO The Constitution protects the privacy of homes as well as correspondence andtelecommunications. Official searches of private properties and communicationsrequire a warrant, but in practice warrants are not uniformly served. There iswidespread belief that the Government continues to tap telephones. COSTA RICA There were no reports of extralegal invasions of privacy conducted by, or withthe knowledge of, the Government. The law requires judicial warrants to searchprivate homes, and police seldom fail to comply. In August the LegislativeAssembly approved legislation permitting government-authorized wiretaps incertain restricted circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking. COTE D'IVOIRE The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigativemagistrate may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there isreason to believe that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime.The official must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seizedin the search and is required to have witnesses to the search, which may nottake place between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. In practice, police sometimes use ageneral search warrant without a name or address. On occasion, police haveentered homes of non-Ivorian Africans (or rounded them up on the streets),taken them to local police stations, and extorted small amounts of money foralleged minor offenses. Security forces have reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations,but the extent of the practice is unknown. There is no evidence that privatewritten correspondence is monitored. In Cote d'Ivoire's multiparty political system, citizens are free to join, ornot join, any political party. However, the State has reportedly transferredgovernment employees (e.g., teachers) active in the opposition because of theirpolitical activities. CROATIA The Constitution declares the home inviolable. Only a court may issue a searchwarrant, stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises.Police may enter a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only ifnecessary to enforce an arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent seriousdanger to life or important property. In practice, the authorities oftenfailed to adhere to these constitutional requirements. Military or civil police carried out evictions by force, involving severalhundred families, ethnic Serbs and Croats as well as Muslims. In Split, 230families were reported to be seeking through the courts to remove soldiers whohad seized their apartments. Almost all of these cases involved apartmentspreviously owned by the JNA, over which the Ministry of Defense assertedownership. Referring to property laws which remove tenancy rights as a resultof any 6-month absence or if the tenant is ruled to have acted against theinterests of Croatia, the Ministry of Defense granted soldiers tenancy ofoccupied flats. The soldiers then frequently took residences by force of arms,either evicting the current tenants or forcing them to cohabitate. During the year, human rights organizations became increasingly effective atcalling public attention to forced evictions, and their members turned up inlarge numbers at the announced time of the eviction. But in at least twocases, police beat and injured human rights monitors seeking to obstruct aneviction. In May the Defense Ministry issued public orders to remove anysoldiers who had illegally forced their way into an apartment, using force ifnecessary. But military police never carried out these orders, reportingprivately to observers that their commanders had told them to refrain fromarresting the soldiers. The tenants of these apartments were typically Serbianfamilies or the spouses and children of Serbs in the JNA who had left Croatia.At a July 12 press conference, President Tudjman justified the forced evictionsby linking them to the Serbian aggression against Croatia and eviction ofone-quarter million Croats. The Constitution guarantees the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it wasunclear if such guarantees were adhered to in practice. Serbian authorities in the UNPA's showed no compunction about interfering withthe privacy rights of the inhabitants of those areas, particularly non-Serbs.UNPROFOR continued to provide 24-hour patrols of several minority villages toprotect the inhabitants from armed bands. The practice of forcibly movingSerbian refugees or soldiers into the homes of non-Serb residents continued aswell, which was clearly designed to pressure the non-Serbs to leave. Onecouple in Sector West was forced to live in their pantry after Serbian soldierstook over the remainder of the house and Serbian refugees moved into theiroutbuildings. Inhabitants were even denied the right to talk on the telephone,with the authorities putting severe restrictions on international observers whoprovided mobile telephones to villagers during visits to permit them to callrelatives on the other side of the line. CUBA Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home andcorrespondence, official surveillance of private and family affairs bygovernment-controlled mass organizations, such as the CDR's, remains one of themost pervasive and repressive features of Cuban life. The State has assumedthe right to interfere in the lives of citizens, even those who do not activelyoppose the Government and its practices. The Communist Party controls the massorganizations which permeate society, although to a lesser extent than in thepast because of the collapsing economy. Their ostensible purpose is to"improve" the citizenry, but in fact their goal is to discover and discouragenonconformity. The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls. The educationalsystem teaches that the State's interests have precedence over all othercommitments. In September Minister of Higher Education Fernando Vecino Alegretaffirmed that commitment to the revolution, including a willingness to defendthe revolution in the streets, was a condition for admission to the university.The Ministry of Education requires teachers to evaluate students' ideologicalcharacter and note it in records the students carry throughout their schooling,which affect their future educational and career prospects. The Interior Ministry employs an intricate system of informants and blockcommittees (the CDR's) to monitor and control public opinion. Guardians ofsocial conformity, CDR's are neighborhood security committees tasked withclosely monitoring the daily lives of residents. CDR's often report onsuspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings--including those with foreigners--and defiant attitudes toward the Governmentand the revolution. State security often reads international correspondence and monitors overseastelephone calls and conversations with foreigners. Citizens do not have theright to receive publications from abroad. Security agents subject dissidents,foreign diplomats, and journalists to surveillance. In March the Governmentlodged a formal complaint against two U.S. diplomats for distributing enemypropaganda; the diplomats had given a few copies of a Miami newspaper to fellowpassengers on a train to Santa Clara. The authorities regularly search people and their homes without probable causeto intimidate and harass them. In August police searched the home of PastorHerrera, a leader of the human rights group "Alternative Criteria," andconfiscated written human rights allegations, membership information, copies ofa Miami newspaper, and Herrera's appointment pass to visit the U.S. InterestsSection. The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visitedthe U.S. Interests Section, confiscated their written reports of human rightsabuses, and seized copies of U.S. newspapers and other informational materials.Police stopped two women, Isabel del Pino and Maria Valdes Rosado of thedissident religious group "Christ the King" on March 9, took them to a nearbypolice station, and subjected them to a strip search. Police carefullysearched their belongings and confiscated reports of human rights violationsthey had written. Two state security officials then threatened them witharrest if they did not stop their activities. In November the authoritiesdetained several activists following their meetings with a visiting Spanishofficial. CYPRUS Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriotcommunity include provisions protecting the individual against arbitraryinterference by the authorities. A judicial warrant is required for a policeofficial to enter a private residence. CZECH REPUBLIC Electronic surveillance, telephone tapping, and interception of mail require acourt order, and the Government complies with this requirement. There were noknown cases of electronic surveillance reported in 1994. There were no reportsof arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy. DENMARK The Constitution stipulates that without a court order there can be nosearching of any home, surveillance of any individual, seizure of any paper, orbreaching of the confidentiality of any communication. The Government respectsthese prohibitions. DJIBOUTI The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home,correspondence, and communications. However, the Government monitors thecommunications of regime opponents, including opposition party and Afarleaders. Warrants are required for the authorities to conduct searches onprivate property. DOMINICA The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and seizure. The lawrequires search warrants. While there were no official reports of arbitrarygovernment intrusions into the private lives of individuals, human rightsmonitors allege that the authorities often searched young men with little or noprobable cause in drug-related inspections. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC The Government does not arbitrarily interfere with the private lives of personsor families and generally observes constitutional provisions against invasionof the home. The authorities may not search a residence except in the presenceof a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, in instances of "hot pursuit," orwhen there is probable cause to believe that a crime is in progress. Duringthe 1994 electoral campaign and the post-electoral crisis, there were numerouscredible allegations of widescale interception of telephone conversations andsurveillance of individuals which may have involved the Government as well aspolitical parties. In addition, opposition politicians charged that governmentraids on their homes, ostensibly to search for firearms, were politicallymotivated. They also charged that the security service officials who roundedup many of the detainees mentioned in Section 1.d. employed illegal raids ontheir homes to capture them. ECUADOR The law requires police to have a warrant to enter a private home or business,except in the case of hot pursuit. The police generally respect the sanctityof private homes and correspondence. Police surveillance is permitted, but theConstitution prohibits wiretapping, and the results of a wiretap are notadmissible as evidence in court. EGYPT In 1994 there continued to be substantial abridgment, under the Emergency Law,of constitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy. Under theConstitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other means ofcommunication "shall have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall beguaranteed." Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches andwiretaps. Courts have dismissed cases in which warrants were issued withoutsufficient cause. Police officials who conduct searches without properwarrants are subject to criminal penalties, although these are seldomimposed. The Emergency Law empowers the State to search persons or places withoutwarrants. Security agencies frequently place political activists, suspectedsubversives, journalists, and writers under surveillance, screen theircorrespondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes,and confiscate personal property. EL SALVADOR According to the Constitution, the police must have the resident's consent, awarrant, or a reasonable belief that a crime is being or is about to becommitted, before entering a private dwelling. In practice, however, theauthorities used forced entry to carry out arrests and investigations.Wiretapping of telephone communications by the Government, private persons, andpolitical parties is illegal but occurs. EQUATORIAL GUINEA The Government does not enforce the law requiring judicial warrants andsecurity forces conduct arbitrary searches of homes. The Government does not overtly force officials to join the DPEG, but lawyers,government staff, and others understand that party membership is necessary foremployment and promotion. There is reportedly some surveillance of members of the opposition parties.There does not appear to be systematic interference with correspondence, andthere is no coercive population control or forced resettlement. ERITREA Under the Criminal Code, warrants are required to monitor mail, telephones, orother means of communication. Warrants are required in routine searches andseizures, except in cases where authorities believe individuals may attempt toescape or destroy evidence. In the past this restriction has often not beenobserved, but there were no reports of illegal surveillance or searches in1994. ESTONIA Estonian law requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property.Prosecutors, rather than judges, issue such warrants during the investigativestage upon a showing of probable cause. Once a case has gone to trial,however, judges then issue search and seizure warrants. The Constitution guarantees secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, andother means of communication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept aperson's communications. Illegally obtained evidence is not admissible incourt. ETHIOPIA The law requires judicial search warrants, but government critics allege theyare seldom used in practice. The TGE implemented a nationwide campaign touncover and confiscate unregistered firearms. Government security officialsconducted searches of private and commercial vehicles, as well as privatehomes. Leaders of political opposition groups claim their members have beensingled out for illegal searches and often unfairly detained during thiscampaign. These charges were given additional credibility when 44 of 46 ENDPmembers, detained following accusations of illegal weapons possession in theSouthern Ethiopian People's Region, were subsequently released without charge(see Section 1.d.). Many people allege they are under surveillance forexpressing antigovernment views. FIJI In general, privacy of the home is respected. However, the IntelligenceService has powers to search people and property, open mail, and tap telephoneswhen a warrant is issued by the National Security Council, within specificoperational guidelines outlined in the government decree which created it. TheIntelligence Service does conduct surveillance of persons it believes representa security threat. Some political dissidents believe their telephones and mailare monitored, but they have not provided substantiating evidence. FINLAND The law provides for the right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, and itspecifically prohibits eavesdropping and mail tampering. The authorities fullyrespect these provisions. The law authorizes police to conduct wiretappingunder certain conditions of suspected criminal activity. Senior policeofficials, rather than judges, have the authority to issue search warrants;there is no indication this power is abused. By law, the police are subject tojudicial scrutiny. FRANCE French law provides for freedom from invasion of privacy, and the authoritiesrespect this. Police must obtain a judicial warrant in order to search aprivate residence, except when responding to a crime in progress. They canconduct such a search only between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m., except in specialcircumstances such as a crime in progress or a drug case. Telephoneconversations may be monitored only under a court order in conjunction withcriminal proceedings, except in national security cases. GABON The Constitution provides protection from surveillance, from searches withoutwarrant, and from interference with private telecommunications orcorrespondence. As part of criminal investigations, police may issue searchwarrants, which are easily obtainable and often granted after the fact. TheGovernment has used them to gain access to the homes of opposition figures andtheir families. Government authorities also routinely monitor privatetelephone conversations, personal mail, and the movements of citizens. Humanrights monitors, opposition figures, union leaders, foreign diplomats, and evenmembers of the Government have all reported being followed, watched, orotherwise monitored by authorities at various times. The state of alert in effect from the beginning of the year until April 10imposed a curfew and granted the Government numerous extralegal powers to limitan individual's constitutional rights. Security forces routinely entered andsearched private homes, offices, and vehicles without a warrant during thisperiod. In February government troops attacked and ransacked an oppositionradio station and the homes of two leading opposition politicians (see Section2.a.), confiscating or destroying a considerable amount of property. After August, when most of the reshuffling of personnel within ministries wascomplete, there were no further confirmed reports of dismissal of government ormilitary personnel due to political affiliation. One of the opposition'snegotiating demands in pursuit of a government of national unity wasreinstatement of persons so dismissed. THE GAMBIA Although constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search remain in place,AFPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investigations overridethese safeguards. Police seized private documents and property without dueprocess and placed armed guards at homes and other properties suspected ofhaving been acquired with embezzled or misappropriated funds. The AFPRC frozeaccounts of persons under suspicion and prohibited by decree the transfer oftheir property. It denied persons under house arrest access to internationaltelephone service. Police must generally have court orders to conduct searchesrelated to crimes unless the individual concerned agrees or it is deemed toinvolve an urgent matter of national interest. The Government has notgenerally intruded in family matters, and this has remained true under theAFPRC. Security officials are believed to monitor telephone communications. GEORGIA Intelligence agencies, including both Georgian and Russian services, arecredibly reported to monitor private telephone conversations. Prior to hisassassination, Gia Chanturia, the head of the National Democratic Party,complained publicly that his office was electronically monitored. Both paramilitary and law enforcement representatives enter homes without legalsanction. However, most Soviet-era forms of interference diminished. Telephone communications with Abkhazia and South Ossetia are almost impossiblebecause local authorities exercise control over them. GERMANY The Basic Law provides for inviolability of the home, and the authoritiesrespect these provisions. Prior to forcibly entering a home, police mustobtain a warrant from a judge or, in an emergency, a public prosecutor. Forelectronic surveillance of telephone lines or monitoring of mail, police mustobtain a court order. GHANA Observers assume the Government continues to engage in surveillance of citizensengaged in activity which it deems objectionable. In the past, this includedmonitoring of telephones and mail. Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do not always obtainthem. The Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interferencewithin the privacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication.This article has yet to be tested. GREECE Although the Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches withoutwarrants, and the law permits monitoring personal communications only understrict judicial controls, the variety of persons and groups subjected togovernment surveillance in recent years raises questions about safeguards.Targets included human rights monitors, non- Orthodox religious groups, andactivist members of minority groups. In June a parliamentary investigation committee recommended indictment offormer Prime Minister Mitsotakis and 30 persons from the former Mitsotakisadministration on charges of wiretapping political opponents from 1989 to 1991.In January 1995, the Parliament voted to drop all charges against Mitsotakis.The others will be tried in criminal courts in 1995. The security services continued to monitor human rights and minority grouprepresentatives and foreign diplomats who met with such individuals. Humanrights monitors also reported the continuation of suspicious openings anddiversions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequentlypublished in newspapers with apparent links to Greek security services. So faras is known, the Government took no steps to stop such practices or toprosecute those involved. GRENADA The Constitution provides for protection from these abuses, and there were noreports of such actions. The law generally requires judicially issued warrantsfor searching homes, except in cases of hot pursuit. The Firearms Act of 1968and the Drug Abuse Prevention Act No. 7 of 1992 contain other exceptions whichgive the police and security units legal authority to search persons andproperty without warrants in certain circumstances. In practice, police obtainwarrants in the majority of cases before conducting any search. GUATEMALA The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, andprivate documents, but the authorities do not always respect these provisions.Elements of the security forces continue to monitor private communications.Many human rights monitors reported receiving threats in the form ofsurveillance, telephone calls, and anonymous letters. On March 11, a year after an arrest warrant had been issued, Juan Jose GarciaOrellana, a postal control officer charged with operating a mail espionage ringin the post office for the presidential security staff under the Serranoadministration, turned himself in to judicial authorities. The authorities arestill gathering evidence in this case. Through July, officials enforcing the military draft continued to stop vehiclesand enter homes and places of business without legally required court orders.Prior to August, under recruitment practices adopted in some departments,potential draftees receive three induction notices, after which they arearrested if they do not report for enlistment. Under the law, such arrestsmust be effected pursuant to a court order. On June 14, Amilcar Mendez, the founder of CERJ, filed a lawsuit againstDefense Minister Enriquez charging that the armed forces' forced recruitmentpractices violated constitutional provisions regarding obligatory militaryservice. However, a court ruled the judicial branch did not have jurisdictionover this matter because the Minister of Defense had immunity from prosecution,which only Congress could remove. It referred the immunity question to theCongress, which ruled that the case lacked legal merit, thus effectivelydismissing the entire lawsuit. Through July 30, the Archbishop's human rights office handled 89 individualcases of forced recruitment. In the same period, the Human Rights Ombudsman'soffice reported receiving 663 complaints of forced recruitment. The officeobtained the release of 268 persons from military service, of whom 79 wereminors. On June 29, Defense Minister General Enriquez announced a 6-monthmoratorium on forced recruitment, which was confirmed by President De Leonduring the June 30 Army Day celebrations. However, the Ombudsman reportedthree separate instances of forced conscription in July. On August 28, theDefense Ministry once again ordered a suspension of forced recruitment; sincethen, there were no further reports of forced recruitment. The army hascontinued the practice of setting up draft boards consisting of the zonemilitary commander, the local representative of the Human Rights Ombudsman'soffice, and other civilian leaders. The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary. However, armyofficers, military commissioners, and PAC leaders often pressure men in areasof conflict to become members. Nevertheless, PAC's do appear to enjoy somepopular support; a majority of respondents in a recent academic surveyconducted for the Human Rights Ombudsman in seven departments claimed to bepleased with the PAC membership and with the PAC presence in their communities.However, some human rights monitors have charged that PAC members may have feltintimidated by fellow PAC members and did not give completely candid answers. In June and July, CERJ filed a legal complaint on behalf of former PAC memberJuan Antonio Chumel with local judicial authorities and the IACHR stating thatsince 1988, when Chumel left the PAC's, PAC members threatened and intimidatedChumel to the extent that he was forced to leave his community for fear of hislife. There are other credible reports that others who refused to serve in thePAC's suffered threats and other abuses. GUINEA The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and judicial searchwarrants are required by law. Police frequently ignore these procedures,however, or do not strictly follow them, and interference in citizens' livescontinued, primarily through police harassment. Police and paramilitary policeoften ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals and frequently detainprivate citizens at night roadblocks in order to extort money to supplementtheir incomes. It is widely believed that security officials monitor mail andtelephone calls. Local businesses, especially expatriate companies, often complain ofintimidation and harassment by public officials and authorities. GUINEA-BISSAU The Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, andcorrespondence, but the Government does not always respect these rights. Theauthorities examine international and domestic mail, the security forces seldomuse judicial warrants, and the police sometimes force entry into privatehomes. GUYANA The Government generally respects the right to privacy, although someopposition politicians have claimed instances of government surveillance ofpolitical meetings and rallies. (Uniformed police officers are routinelypresent at such rallies.) Police generally respected the laws requiringjudicially issued search warrants. HAITI The Constitution provides that no house search or seizure of papers may takeplace except in accordance with the law. Correspondence is also defined asinviolable. Prior to September 19, soldiers and other armed persons frequently enteredprivate homes for illegal purposes in Port-au-Prince and the provinces. InAugust there was a rash of attacks on the homes of politicians, includingparliamentarians and the mayor of Petionville, the capital's main suburb.Attaches and FRAPH members were involved in raids on homes, but victims alsoreported seeing soldiers personally known to them and dressed in civilianclothing among their attackers. In addition, gangsters violently raided entireneighborhoods of Port-au-Prince, taking advantage of their ties to police andthe general climate of impunity to steal and rape. When the armed personsentered looking for a particular individual, they frequently beat or otherwiseharmed family members during the search. The police, along with armed civilians acting at their behest, frequently usedroadblocks to conduct illegal searches, especially during periods of real orperceived political tension. The discovery of pro-Aristide posters orliterature during a police search of a house or vehicle frequently resulted inphysical abuse and illegal arrest. There were credible reports that police andmilitary also seized private correspondence during such searches. After the arrival of the MNF and the restoration of the legitimate Government,such abuses were dramatically reduced. HONDURAS The Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that personsauthorized by the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with theauthorization of a competent authority. Entry may take place only between 6a.m. and 6 p.m. or at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent thecommission of a crime. However, as in previous years, there were crediblecharges that police and armed forces personnel failed at times to obtain theneeded authorization before entering a private home. Despite a new system of"duty judges" and "duty prosecutors" to issue search orders, they appeared tolack the discipline to make themselves available 24 hours per day, 7 days aweek. Coordination among the police, the court, and the Public Ministry isimproving. However, interagency liaison problems still undermine theeffectiveness of the system. Judges may authorize government monitoring of mail or telephones for specificpurposes, such as criminal investigation or national security. However, thearmed forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the nationaltelephone company to monitor illegally telephone lines of influential people inthe Government, the military, and the private sector without authorization fromthe appropriate civilian judicial authority. HONG KONG The law provides for the right of privacy, and the Government generallyrespects this right. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) isvested with powers which are normally exercised only by a judicial officer.Amendments to ordinances governing the ICAC deprived it of this independentauthority to issue arrest or search warrants (it must now go to the courts),but it still operates on the assumption that any excessive, unexplainableassets held by civil servants are considered ill-gotten until provenotherwise. HUNGARY The law provides that the prosecutor's office may issue search warrantsindependently. Police must carry out house searches in the presence of twowitnesses and must prepare a written inventory of items removed from thepremises. Wiretapping, which may be done for national security reasons and forlegitimate criminal investigations, requires a court's permission. Theseprovisions are observed in practice. A search warrant is not necessary, however, in cases in which the police aremaking checks on the validity of the identity papers of foreigners. In aseries of raids in September, police conducted arbitrary identity checks inrestaurants and residences frequented by foreigners. In Budapest, a dozenpolicemen went to the residence of an American business executive at 2:45 a.m.to demand identification. The businessman was not home. The policemen leftafter the businessman's wife produced the appropriate documents for herself andher small children. ICELAND Under the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect for the autonomyand rights of individuals. A warrant from a court is required to enter aprivate house, except in cases of hot pursuit. There have been no knownarbitrary intrusions by official entities, political organizations, or anyother organized group into the private beliefs or personal liberties ofindividuals. INDIA The police must obtain warrants for searches and seizures. In a criminalinvestigation, the police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid unduedelay, but they must justify the searches in writing to the nearest magistratewith jurisdiction over the offense. The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir,Punjab, and Assam have special powers to search and arrest without a warrant. The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications,including monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail--incases of public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety ortranquility." These powers have been used by every state government. On May 25, the Punjab state government ordered the authorities to intercept anymail addressed to or mailed by various Sikh political, student, and lawyergroups, persons residing in Pakistan, or any group or person considered adanger to the state. On July 25, the state High Court ordered the stategovernment to suspend implementing the order. INDONESIA Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases involvingsuspected subversion, economic crimes, and corruption. However, securityagencies regularly make forced or surreptitious entries. They also intimidateby surveillance of persons and residences and selective monitoring of local andinternational telephone calls without legal restraint. Government securityofficials monitor the movements and activities of former members of the PKI andits front organizations, especially persons the Government believes wereinvolved in the abortive 1965 Communist-backed coup. The Government stated inlate 1990 that this latter group then totaled 1,410,333 people. These personsand their relatives sometimes are subject to surveillance, required check-ins,periodic indoctrination, and restrictions on travel outside their city ofresidence. Their legally required identification cards carry the initials"E.T." which stand for "Ex-Tapol," or former political prisoner, which readilyidentifies them to prospective employers or government officials. The Government's transmigration program which moved large numbers of peoplefrom overpopulated islands to more isolated and backward ones has beencriticized by nongovernmental human rights monitors. They say that it not onlyviolates the rights of indigenous people but also those of the transmigrants,claiming that they are frequently duped into leaving their home villageswithout any means of return (see Section 5.). IRAN The Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)"are protected from trespass except as "provided by law." However, securityforces enter homes and offices, monitor telephone conversations, and open mailwithout court authorization. The wife of writer Saidi-Sirjani reported that,after her husband's arrest in March, the Anti-Vice Department of theRevolutionary Prosecutor's office raided her home, seized her husband's papers,and sealed the library (see Section 1.a.). Paramilitary volunteer forces known as the Basiji and other security forcesmonitor the social activities of citizens. Such organizations may harass orarrest women whose clothing does not cover the hair and all of the body excepthands and face, or those who wear makeup. Enforcement of such standards ofpublic morality varies with the political climate and the jurisdiction. IRAQ The Government frequently disregards the constitutional right to privacy,particularly in cases in which national security is alleged to be involved.The law defines security offenses so broadly that authorities are virtuallyexempt from the legal requirement to obtain search warrants. In 1994 theauthorities subjected the Shi'a religious clergy, Shi'a Muslim inhabitants ofthe southern marshes, and various ethnic minorities to searches withoutwarrants (see Section 1.g.). The regime routinely ignores the constitutionalprovisions safeguarding the confidentiality of mail and telegraphiccorrespondence and telephone conversations. The security services and the Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks ofinformers to deter dissident activity and instill fear in the public. As theSpecial Rapporteur noted in his February report, "the fear of informers andsubsequent severe reprisals have prevented virtually the entire population fromexpressing genuinely held opinions which are not consistent with those of theGovernment." IRELAND The Supreme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for inthe Constitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home mustbe respected in law and practice; and the Government honors this. However, the Constitution provides that the State shall enact no law permittingdivorce. A 1986 nationwide referendum overwhelmingly defeated a proposal toamend the Constitution to permit divorce in limited circumstances. In the sameyear, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the prohibition of divorceis not a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Ireland isa party. The Government has pledged to hold another referendum on divorce,which now seems likely to occur in 1995. ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES Although privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law,authorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations.In criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping by court order; in securitycases, the order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Under emergencyregulations, authorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds. ITALY The law safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect thisprovision. Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only underjudicial warrant and in carefully defined circumstances. There have been noreports of any other kinds of violations of privacy. JAMAICA The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the privatelife of the individual. The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act, however,continues to give security personnel the sort of broad powers of search andseizure which were consistently abused under the Suppression of Crimes Act.Although the use of telephone taps without a court order is officially limitedto cases involving the drug trade, terrorism, and subversion of the Government,politicians, trade union officials, and local journalists have charged that theauthorities were tapping their telephones in recent years. The accusedauthorities did not respond to these charges. JAPAN Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separatewarrant issued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guardagainst arbitrary searches. There were no reports that the Government or anyother organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, orcorrespondence. JORDAN The police must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor General or a judge beforeconducting searches in most cases. However, in security cases, authoritiessometimes, and in violation of the law, obtain warrants retroactively or obtainpreapproved warrants. Security officers reportedly monitor telephones, readcorrespondence, and engage in surveillance of persons that allegedly pose athreat to the regime. While these practices are not believed to be widespread,the law permits them if the Government obtains a court order. KAZAKHSTAN The KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of theProcuracy, may arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, andcorrespondence, a legacy of Soviet rule. The law requires criminal police, whoremain part of the internal security structure, to obtain a search warrant froma prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes search without awarrant. There were credible reports in 1994 that police occasionally plantedevidence. The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mail, but under the law itmust inform the Procuracy within 3 days of such activity. KENYA The Constitution permits searches without warrants in certain instances "topromote the public benefit," such as in security cases. Although securityofficials generally obtain judicially issued search warrants, at times theyconduct searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seizeproperty believed to be stolen. The courts have admitted evidence obtainedwithout search warrants to support convictions. Security forces employ various means of surveillance, including electronicsurveillance and a network of informers. Police routinely monitored theactivities of political opponents and their associates. In a June letter tothe Director of State Intelligence, FORD-K M.P. Paul Muite complained thatseveral specific vehicles with civilian license plates constantly shadowed hismovements and that of his family. Muite, who is also the lead defense attorneyin the Wamwere case, reported that the cars even followed him from Nairobi tothe Nakuru courtroom and back again--a 4-hour trip. The Government monitored and intercepted correspondence as well. In August theU.S.-based Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights mailed twopackages to the Kenya Human Rights Commission. The local Nairobi post officerefused to release the packages, claiming that the reports were "political" and"hitting at the Government." In April police detained and interrogated an18-year-old student for several hours after police intercepted a letter she hadsent to opposition M.P. Paul Muite. City council security officers, or "Askaris," continued to destroy the kiosksof licensed and unlicensed vendors in several Kenyan cities. On February 9 and15, Nairobi Askaris demolished and burned a stretch of vendors' booths at theMachakos country bus terminal, destroying several thousand dollars' worth ofproperty. On February 16, Askaris beat and arrested the chairman of theVendors' Association when he visited the Machakos bus terminal. Askaris alsoarrested and confiscated goods from vendors at the Kisumu town center inFebruary. Although Kenyans are theoretically free to choose their political affiliation,government employees continued to be warned to support the ruling party or befired. In May the Government dismissed a permanent secretary in the Ministryof Labor after he reportedly made contact with an opposition party member. KIRIBATI The privacy of the home is protected in law and respected by the Government.There is no arbitrary intrusion by the State or political organizations intothe private life of the individual. REPUBLIC OF KOREA In general, the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In thepast, the security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance,including wiretaps, of political dissidents. The Antiwiretap Law and the lawto reform the NSP were designed to curb government surveillance of civilians,and appear largely to have succeeded. The Antiwiretap Law lays out broadconditions under which the monitoring of telephone calls, mail, and other formsof communication are legal It requires government officials to secure ajudge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in the event of an emergency,soon after placing them, and it provides for jail terms for those who violatethis law. Some human rights groups argue that a considerable amount of illegalwiretapping is still taking place and say the lack of an independent body toinvestigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps hinders theeffectiveness of the antiwiretapping law. South Koreans are not allowed to listen to North Korean radio in their homes orread books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they aredoing so for the purpose of helping North Korea. Student groups make plausibleclaims that government informants are posted around university campuses.Persons with backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficultto obtain some forms of employment or advance in such fields as government,broadcast media, and education. KUWAIT The Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home. Thepolice must obtain a warrant to search both public and private property, unlessthey are in hot pursuit or suspect the presence of alcohol or narcotics. Thewarrant can be obtained from the state prosecutor or, in the case of privateproperty, from a judge. The security forces occasionally monitor theactivities of individuals and their communications. By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women.However, the Government does not vigorously enforce the restriction, andKuwaitis routinely obtain exemptions from the Ministry of Justice. TheGovernment also advises women against marrying foreign nationals. KYRGYZ REPUBLIC The 1993 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishesof the occupant and states that a person's private life, privacy ofcorrespondence, and telephonic and telegraphic communications are protected bylaw. Current law and procedures require the General Procurators's approval forwiretaps, searches of homes, interception of mail, and similar procedures. Personnel and organizations responsible for violations during the Soviet periodhave remained largely in place; however, no widespread and systematicviolations of the privacy of citizens were reported in 1994, but the localpress often cited harassment of individuals by police on the street as aproblem. Some citizens active in politics or interested in human rightsbelieve that the privacy of their communications was violated in 1994.Credible evidence is not available. LAOS Concomitant with economic liberalization, the Government relaxed some elementsof state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal andbusiness activities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, whilethe Constitution prohibits arrests or searches in homes without possessing awarrant or authorization, the security bureaus authorize search and seizure bythemselves rather than by judicial authority. The Government and the partycontinue to monitor the citizenry sporadically through a system of neighborhoodand workplace committees. The neighborhood committees also have responsibilityfor maintaining public order and reporting "bad elements" to the police. Thesecommittees usually concern themselves more with street crime and instances ofmoral turpitude than with political activism. The degree of surveillance andcontrol varies from province to province. The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, butthe security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves.Monitoring of international mail and telephone calls continued, although theincreasing number of such calls limited its extent. The 1991 Constitution stipulates that the "national community" owns all land.Private "ownership" is in the form of land use certificates, which can bebought, sold, and transferred to heirs. Many Lao who fled the country after1975 regained confiscated property after demonstrating their intent torepatriate. LATVIA By law, law enforcement authorities require a judicial warrant to interceptmail, telephone calls, or other forms of communication. LEBANON While the authorities generally show little interest in controlling thepersonal lives of citizens, they are not reluctant to interfere with theprivacy of persons regarded as foes of the Government. Laws require thatprosecutors must obtain warrants before entering houses, except when the armyis in hot pursuit of an armed attacker. Militias and non-Lebanese forcesoperating outside areas of central government authority have frequentlyviolated rights of privacy. Various factions and the Government use informernetworks and monitor telephones to gather information on their foes. LESOTHO Although search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, theISA provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehiclesand to enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant.After the May LMP mutiny, police officers entered without warrant dozens ofresidences in the Maseru neighborhoods of Sea Point and Matimposo, allegedlyseeking looted property. The security services are believed to monitorroutinely telephone conversations of Basotho and foreigners on nationalsecurity grounds. LIBERIA While the Constitution provides for these rights, there were many seriousabuses of privacy and home--including confiscation of property and failure toobtain required warrants--by the police and fighters of all the warringfactions. According to the Constitution, the police must have a warrant or areasonable belief that a crime is in progress, or is about to be committed,before entering a private dwelling. In practice, the police engaged in forcedentry without a warrant to carry out arrests and investigations. Combatants of all the warring factions looted villages during the year, withULIMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo factions in Bomi and Cape Mount counties and LPCand NPFL fighters in southeastern counties and elsewhere drawing considerablepublic outrage. These forces pilfered virtually any item of value andregularly demanded scarce food and personal valuables from already impoverishedresidents or displaced persons, often robbing them of their clothes andphysically abusing them, particularly at checkpoints. Confiscation of privatehomes and vehicles was common practice. These factions also used forced entry for purposes of intimidation. Forexample, AFL soldiers made two raids on the Monrovia residence of a legislativerepresentative to harass the representative for his support of the new policedirector. In one instance, an AFL soldier shot the representative's guard inthe leg. The representative sent a formal letter to the TransitionalLegislative Assembly accusing four members of the AFL high command of attemptedmurder. LIBYA The Government does not respect the right to privacy. Security agencies oftendisregard the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a privatehome. They also routinely monitor telephone calls. The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensiveinformant network. Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspectedregime opponents may result in government harassment and detention. TheGovernment may seize and destroy property belonging to the "enemies of thepeople" or those who "cooperate" with foreign powers. In early 1994, citizensreported that Mr. Qadhafi warned that members of the extended family of anyregime opponent risk the death penalty. In August Mr. Qadhafi proposed a program to seize private wealth, deeming allprivate assets above a nominal amount to be the fruits of exploitation orcorruption. He encouraged local cadres to investigate and report any citizenretaining "excessive" private assets after the expiration of a grace period,during which citizens could turn over such assets to the Government. LIECHTENSTEIN The Constitution provides for personal liberty, and for inviolability of thehome, of postal correspondence, and of telephone conversations. No violationshave been reported. Police need a judicial warrant to search privateproperty. LITHUANIA The authorities do not engage in indiscriminate or widespread monitoring of thecorrespondence or communications of citizens. With the written authorizationof a procurator or judge, however, police and the security service may engagein surveillance and monitoring activities on grounds of national security.Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of disappearance of evidence,police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor before they mayenter premises. It is widely assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased theuse of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organizedcrime. There is some question as to the legal basis of this policesurveillance, but there are no known legal cases challenging the legality ofthe surveillance. The former president of the Lithuanian National Bank, whocharged that eavesdropping devices were found in his office in 1993, publiclycalled on the Procurator General to investigate the incident. The pressreported that, although the devices were in fact found and are in thepossession of the new bank management, the authorities failed to pursueinvestigation of the incident. LUXEMBOURG The law provides for the right to privacy, and the authorities respect this.Police must obtain a judicial warrant in order to enter a private residence, tomonitor private correspondence, or to conduct electronic surveillance. MACAU Laws provide for the inviolability of the home and of communication, the rightof ownership of private property and enterprises, and the freedom to marry andraise a family. There is no indication of abuses of these rights by theGovernment. FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA The Constitution provides for the right to privacy of person, home, andcorrespondence. Although no instances of abuses were substantiated, officialsof the rightwing opposition Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization(VMRO) charged that the state security service tapped their telephones MADAGASCAR The home is inviolable by tradition and law, and the State does not intervenein the private aspects of the lives of the people. The law requires judiciallyissued warrants to search houses, but there were reportedly some instances inwhich private citizens used police acquaintances to intimidate others withoutproper warrants. Telephones and correspondence are not monitored. MALAWI Under the law, search warrants are required, and there were no reportedincidents of illegal search of homes or businesses. However, postalauthorities occasionally opened and inspected private correspondence, seeminglyat random. MALAYSIA These rights are normally respected and protected by law. Provisions in thesecurity legislation (see Section 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter andsearch without a warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening nationalsecurity. Police may also confiscate evidence under these acts. In some caseseach year, police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices,seize books and papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custodywithout a warrant. MALDIVES The Constitution prohibits security officials from opening or reading letters,telegrams, and wireless messages or monitoring telephone conversations, "exceptin accordance with the specific provisions of the law." The NSS may open themail of private citizens and monitor telephone conversations if authorized inthe course of a criminal investigation. Although the Constitution requires the authorities to respect private premisesand dwellings, there is no legal requirement for search or arrest warrants.The Attorney General or a commanding officer of the police must approve thesearch of private residences. MALI The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Governmentrespects this right in practice. Police searches are infrequent, and requirejudicial warrants. Security forces do, however, maintain physical surveillanceof individuals and groups believed to be threats to internal security; withcourt approval, police may maintain technical surveillance as well. There wereno instances of forced resettlement. MALTA The Constitution protects privacy of the home and prohibits electronicsurveillance. The Government respects these provisions. Search warrants areissued by police officers of the rank of inspector or above based on perceivedreasonable grounds for suspicion of wrongdoing. MARSHALL ISLANDS The law provides for privacy of the home. This is respected by the Government.There was no known instance of arbitrary intrusion by the State into theprivate life of the individual. MAURITANIA The law requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but theauthorities often ignore this requirement. During the roundup of some 60Islamists in September and October, as well during the detention of humanrights monitor Cheik Saad Bouh Kamara, police searched detainees' homes andseized papers without a search warrant. There were fewer reports of government surveillance of suspected dissidentsthan in previous years, although the extent to which the Government usedinformants is unknown. MAURITIUS The sanctity of the home is provided for in law and generally respected inpractice. The search of personal property or premises is allowed only underclearly specified conditions by court order or by police action in stopping acrime in progress. There were reliable reports that the Government'sintelligence apparatus continued to carry out illegal surveillance of localopposition leaders and other major figures. MEXICO The Constitution protects the rights to privacy, family, home, andcorrespondence. The law requires search warrants, but there were credibleclaims that unlawful searches without warrants are common. There were no knownclaims of forced political membership and no substantiated claims ofsurveillance or interference with correspondence. FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA The law prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none. MOLDOVA According to the 1990 police law, prosecutors, rather than judges, issue searchwarrants. There have been numerous instances in which searches were conductedwithout warrants, and courts do not exclude evidence that was illegallyobtained. There is no judicial review of search warrants. The new Constitution specifies that searches must be carried out "in accordancewith law" but does not specify the consequences if the law is not respected.It also forbids searches at night, except in the case of flagrant crime. Opponents of the Government continue to claim that security forces monitoredand harassed them, especially during the election campaign. It is widelybelieved that the security forces continued to use electronic monitoring ofresidences and telephones in some cases, although confirmation of suchactivities is lacking. By law, the prosecutor's office must authorize wiretapsand may do so only if a criminal investigation is under way. In practice, theprosecutor's office lacks the ability to control the security organs and policeand prevent them from using wiretaps illegally. MONACO The individual's right of privacy in personal and family life, at home, and incorrespondence is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected in practice. MONGOLIA The Constitution provides that the State shall not interfere with the privatebeliefs and actions of citizens, and this is generally respected. The head ofthe MCIA may, with the knowledge and consent of the Prime Minister, direct themonitoring and recording of telephone conversations. The extent of suchmonitoring is unknown. MOROCCO The Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that the police may notconduct a search without a warrant. The law stipulates that search warrantsmay be issued by a prosecutor for good cause. However, there continue to bereports of illegal searches of the homes and offices of suspected politicalactivists. Government security services monitor the activities of certain persons andorganizations, including their telephones and mail. Government informers alsomonitor activities on university campuses. MOZAMBIQUE The 1990 Constitution provides for the right to privacy and expressly prohibitsthe use of surveillance techniques. By law, police need a warrant to enterhomes and businesses, but in practice most policemen routinely operate withoutthem. During the war, police and security forces entered homes at will, used avariety of surveillance techniques, and often forced civilians to move intogovernment-protected villages. However, since the signing of the Rome Accords,the number of reported incidents of intrusive government actions declinedmarkedly. Although there are fewer reports of such activity, incidents of illegaltelephone wiretapping by Government intelligence agencies allegedly stilloccur. In November the independent weekly Savana reported what it consideredconvincing evidence that a telephone conversation between two of itsjournalists was tapped. The SISE denied the charge. NAMIBIA The Constitution grants all citizens the right to privacy and requiresarresting officers to secure a judicial warrant for certain listed offensesbefore conducting a search. These rights were respected in practice. NAURU The Constitution generally provides protection from these abuses. Searches notsanctioned by court order are prohibited, and there is no surveillance ofindividuals or of private communications. Nauruan citizenship and inheritancerights are traced through the female line. Until very recently, lawsrestricted intermarriage of Nauru men and women with non-Nauruans. Althoughthe laws have changed and such intermarriage is practiced and permitted,intermarriage between Nauru women and foreign males still draws substantialsocial censure. The spouses--male or female--of Nauru citizens have noautomatic right of abode in Nauru. They are, however, normally grantedshort-term "visits" sponsored by the Nauru spouse or they may apply forlonger-term work permits. Foreign spouses are not eligible for Naurucitizenship. NEPAL The Government generally respects the privacy of the home and family. Searchwarrants are required before search and seizure, except in cases involvingsuspected security and narcotics violations. Under the Police Act of 1955, asamended, the police are authorized to issue warrants for search and seizure.Such warrants must be approved within 24 hours by the Chief District Officer inmisdemeanor cases and court judges in felony cases. THE NETHERLANDS In most criminal cases, a judicial warrant is required to enter a person's homeor to monitor private correspondence or telephone conversations. The Staterespects individual freedom of choice in family matters. NEW ZEALAND The law protects the right to privacy. The Government does not violatepersonal privacy, the sanctity of the home, or the integrity of correspondence.The Office of the Privacy Commissioner hears complaints involving violation ofpersonal privacy by individuals or the Government. The Privacy Commissioner isa statutory member of the Human Rights Commission. NICARAGUA The Constitution establishes that all persons have the right to privacy oftheir family and to the inviolability of their home, correspondence, andcommunications. It also requires warrants for searches of private homes andexcludes from legal proceedings illegally seized letters, documents, andprivate papers. However, in April the police burst into the home of the Bishopof Leon looking for the driver of an illegally parked truck. The driver andtwo workmen were delivering material to a nearby chapel and had sought refugein the Bishop's residence after being chased by the police. The police enteredthe residence without a warrant, caught the workmen, and beat them in front ofthe Bishop. The police later released the three uncharged persons, and ViceMinister of Government Frank Cesar personally visited and apologized to theBishop (the police also apologized). The Bishop made no formal complaint. Article 26 of the new Military Code prohibits the Defense IntelligenceDirectorate from undertaking "political intelligence activities" and places itunder the authority of the President as head of all armed forces. Despite thenew law, several political parties have complained that infiltration by the DIDinto their groups has not ceased. NIGER The law requires that police have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge.Police may search without warrants when they have strong suspicion that a houseshelters criminals or stolen property. However, human rights organizationsreport that police often conduct routine searches without warrants. NIGERIA Provisions of the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide for the rights to privacyin the home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications.However, the military Government regularly interfered in the lives of itscitizens, and if the authorities desired to use a warrant in a particularsearch case, they often secured it from a military tribunal rather than aregular court. Human rights leaders reported that security agents regularlyfollowed them and cut or tapped their organizations' telephones. DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA The constitutional stipulation that "citizens are guaranteed the inviolabilityof person and residence and the privacy of correspondence" does not reflectreality. The Government relies upon an extensive system of informers toidentify critics and potential troublemakers. In some cases, entire familiesare detained for alleged political offenses committed by one member of thefamily. The authorities subject citizens in all age groups and occupations to politicaland ideological indoctrination. Even after Kim Il Sung's death, his cult ofpersonality and glorification of his family and the official "juche"(self-reliance) ideology continued to be omnipresent. The cult approaches thelevel of a state religion. The goal of indoctrination remains to ensureloyalty to the Kim Il Sung system and his son and heir Kim Jong Il, as well asconformity to the State's ideology and authority. Indoctrination is carriedout systematically not only through the mass media, but also in schools andthrough worker and neighborhood associations. Citizens with relatives who fledto South Korea at the time of the Korean War appear to be still classified aspart of the "hostile class" in the DPRK's elaborate loyalty system. Becauseapproximately 10 million families were separated by the war, this categoryencompasses a significant percentage of the North Korean population. The defector Cho Kap Chae estimated that the class of those consideredpolitically "impure" may comprise 25 to 30 percent of the population. Membersof this class may still be subject to some discrimination, although Cho claimedthat their treatment has improved greatly in recent years. NORWAY The privacy of the family and the person is free from arbitrary interference bythe Government. Police may conduct searches of the home only with courtapproval and in instances of hot pursuit or when they fear evidence is beingdestroyed. There were no allegations of forced entry into homes in 1994. Inmost cases, wiretaps are prohibited by law, but they may be used in casesinvolving state security or narcotics offenses when officially approved by thecourt within carefully drawn legal guidelines. Correspondence may be openedonly by court order in cases involving state security. THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (INCLUDING AREAS SUBJECT TO JURISDICTION OF THEPALESTINIAN AUTHORITY) Israeli military authorities in the West Bank may enter private Palestinianhomes and institutions without a warrant on security grounds when authorized byan officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel. In conducting searches, the IDFhas used forced entries, and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyedproperty. Undercover units have also engaged in destructive and violentbehavior during searches, as well as harassment of families of wantedPalestinians. Israeli authorities claim that forced entry may lawfully occuronly when incident to an arrest and when entry is resisted. They maintain thatbeatings and arbitrary destruction of property during searches are punishableviolations of military regulations, and that compensation is due to victims insuch cases. The Government does not provide information regarding suchcompensation. Authorities sealed 5 houses in 1994 for security reasons, a sharp decline from27 houses sealed in 1993. Security forces may demolish or seal the home of asuspect, whether he is the owner or tenant, without any trial. The decision toseal or demolish a house is made by several high-level Israeli officials,including the coordinator of the Civil Administration and the Defense Minister.Owners of houses ordered demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the areacommander; a final appeal may be made to the High Court. A successful appealgenerally results in the conversion of a demolition order to sealing. After ahouse is demolished, military authorities confiscate the land and prohibit theowner from rebuilding or removing the rubble. In November part of a house was demolished by military order for securityreasons after an appeal to the Israeli High Court was rejected. This was thefirst house demolition, albeit partial, since 1992. The home was the residenceof the Palestinian responsible for the October bus bombing in Tel Aviv andbelonged to his parents. Many human rights groups maintain that the sealing ordemolishing of homes is a form of collective punishment because such actstarget families and children. Owners may apply to regional military commanders for permits to rebuild orunseal their homes. In 1994 the Government processed 94 requests to opensealed rooms and houses; 61 applications were approved. In June thePalestinian Center for the Study of Nonviolence began a campaign to reopen manyhomes sealed during the occupation. At the Center's urging, activists andfamily members opened 130 of more than 350 sealed houses before they werearrested. Authorities resealed several of the homes. In December the IsraeliGovernment decided to allow the opening or rebuilding of homes sealed ordemolished as a result of security offenses committed by a family member whohad been released from prison. Each former prisoner must apply for arebuilding or unsealing permit after which the Government will approve orreject the application. Israeli security services sometimes monitor mail and telephone conversations.The authorities sometimes interrupt telephone service and electricity tospecific areas. In Gaza and Jericho, the existing law requires that a chief prosecutor issuewarrants for entry and searches of private property. These requirements wereignored in October, when the Palestinian police conducted a sweep of severaldistricts in the Gaza Strip to search for a kidnaped Israeli soldier. Homeswere searched without the consent of their owners; in some cases, the policeforcibly entered premises, destroying doors and windows. Palestinian humanrights groups and political leaders protested the police's conduct, but the PAdid not officially respond. OMAN The police are not required by law to obtain search warrants. There is awidespread belief that the Government eavesdrops on both oral and writtencommunications, and Omanis are guarded in both areas. Citizens must obtainpermission from the Ministry of Interior to marry foreigners. PAKISTAN By law the police must obtain a warrant to search a house but do not need awarrant to search a person. However, the police often enter homes without awarrant. In the absence of a warrant, a policeman is subject to charges ofcriminal trespass. However, policemen are seldom punished for illegal entry. The Government maintains several domestic intelligence services which monitorpoliticians, political activists, suspected terrorists, and suspected foreignintelligence agents. Credible reports indicate that the authorities commonlyresort to wiretapping and occasionally intercept and open mail. PANAMA The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and communications.The authorities may not examine personal documents, monitor communications, orenter and search private residences except by written order. However, therewere credible complaints that PTJ agents failed to follow legal requirementsfor arrest and search warrants and instead conducted indiscriminate searches ofentire apartment buildings or housing complexes. Such complaints continuedduring the first months of the Perez Balladares Government. Despite the view of some that the Constitution prohibits all wiretapping, theGovernment maintains that wiretapping with judicial branch approval is legal.Under the guidelines established by new antinarcotics legislation passed inJuly, the Public Ministry may engage in undercover operations, including theuse of "videotaping and recording of conversations." The Supreme Court willultimately have to decide whether wiretapping is constitutional and, if so,under what circumstances. PAPUA NEW GUINEA While the authorities generally respect privacy rights, police in the highlandsand the PNGDF in Bougainville have burned homes to quell intertribal conflictand punish communities suspected of harboring suspected criminals. Also,police often force entry into homes during searches for criminals or stolengoods. PARAGUAY While the Government and its security forces generally did not interfere in theprivate lives of citizens, there were exceptions. The Constitution providesthat police may not enter private homes except to prevent a crime in progressor when the police possess a judicial warrant. There were credible reportsthat at times the authorities ignored this legal guarantee, particularly in thecountry's interior. There were also allegations that the Governmentoccasionally spied on individuals and monitored communications for politicaland security reasons. PERU The Constitution requires security forces to have a judicial warrant to enter aprivate dwelling, but this requirement is suspended in the emergency zones, andsecurity forces in those areas routinely conduct searches of private homeswithout warrants. The law requires that a Public Ministry prosecutor bepresent during searches. There were plausible reports that, on occasion,police planted subversive pamphlets in the homes of persons they suspected ofterrorism but could not otherwise arrest for lack of evidence. There werefrequent credible reports of illegal telephone wiretaps. In August andSeptember, several prominent journalists, opposition politicians, and retiredmilitary officers made credible claims that the Government's intelligenceservices followed them, videotaped them, and recorded their privateconversations. In Lima and other urban areas, the army conducted "sweep" operations in whichsoldiers surrounded and sealed off targeted neighborhoods to conducthouse-to-house searches. They detained persons wanted for a crime and held forquestioning those found with unregistered weapons, subversive material, orwithout identity documents. Public prosecutors routinely accompany theseoperations, and citizens made few complaints of serious abuses stemming fromthem. A number of rural communities--with arms, training, and encouragement from thearmy--have organized self-defense forces, or rondas, to protect themselvesagainst terrorist and bandit incursions. These have had a noticeable impact oncurbing Sendero's presence in certain areas of the country. In some parts ofPeru, rondas have existed for centuries as a form of social organization and toprotect communities from invaders and rustlers. However, military authoritiesorganized many of the newer rondas and sometimes coerced peasants intoparticipating. As a regular practice and to a far greater degree, Sendero alsoforced peasants to join its military ranks, often for extended periods,coercing their participation in terrorist attacks and executions. THE PHILIPPINES The Constitution provides that search warrants may be issued by a judge on afinding of probable cause. Restrictions on search and seizure are generallyobserved, although raids without search warrants on private homes areoccasionally reported. In the past, judges have thrown out evidence obtainedillegally. The Government does not interfere with the free personal use of the mails orother public communications except upon issuance of a court order in the courseof an investigation. Some human rights NGO's are increasingly concerned about the Government'sforced resettlement of tenant farmers to make way for development projects.These resettlement schemes are designed to clear the land for industrial,agroindustrial, and tourism projects. In urban settings, squatters are movedto make way for infrastructure, commercial, and housing projects. TheGovernment has made efforts to resettle squatters, as required by law, butNGO's contend that in both rural and urban settings, those being relocated aresometimes given little or no notice and are violently ejected. Land rightsissues are made more difficult by the slow process of the Government's exerciseof eminent domain and complex zoning regulations. POLAND The Government does not arbitrarily monitor private mail or telephones. Thereis no Polish legislation that guarantees the right to privacy, although Polandhas signed the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides for thatright. Poles do have the legal right to privacy of correspondence, and therewas no evidence of violations. The Government introduced draft legislation in Parliament in September whichwould give the police the power--with the personal approval of the chiefprosecutor and the Interior Minister--to monitor private mail and telephoneconversations in cases involving serious crimes, drugs, money laundering, orillegal arms sales. The parliamentary opposition sought assurances that theseexpanded police powers would be subject to appropriate human rights safeguardsbut generally supported the need to expand the police force's ability to combatcrime. Polish law forbids arbitrary forced entry into homes. Search warrants issuedby a prosecutor are required in order to enter private residences. Inemergency cases when a prosecutor is not immediately available, police mayenter a residence with the approval of the local police commander. In the mosturgent cases, in which there is not time to consult with the police commander,police may enter a private residence after showing their officialidentification. There were no reports that Polish police abused search warrantprocedures in 1994. PORTUGAL The Constitution forbids forced entry into homes and searches without ajudicial warrant. In addition, entry into a person's home at night requiresthe consent of the occupant. The Government may intercept privatecorrespondence, or make wiretaps, only on the basis of a court order. QATAR Traditional attitudes of respect for the sanctity of the home provide a greatdeal of protection against arbitrary intrusions for most citizens and residentsof Qatar. A warrant must normally be obtained before police may search aresidence or business, except in cases involving national security oremergencies. However, warrants are issued by police officials themselvesrather than by judicial authorities. There were no reports of unauthorizedsearches of homes in 1994. The police and security forces are believed tomonitor the communications of suspected criminals, those considered to besecurity risks, and selected foreigners. With prior permission, which is usually granted, Qataris may marry foreignersof any nationality and apply for residence permits for their spouses. ROMANIA The Constitution provides for legal protection against the search of aresidence without a warrant, but this protection is subordinate to "nationalsecurity or public order." The 1992 National Security Law defines nationalsecurity very broadly and lists as threats to national security not only crimessuch as terrorism, treason, espionage, assassination, and armed insurrectionbut also totalitarian, racist, and anti-Semitic actions or attempts to changethe existing national borders. Security officials may enter residences withoutproper authorization from a prosecutor if they deem a threat to nationalsecurity "imminent." The Constitution further states that the privacy of legal means ofcommunication is inviolable; thus, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) islegally prohibited from engaging in political acts (e.g., monitoring thecommunications of a political party). However, the laws on national securityallow it to engage in such monitoring on national security grounds. Similarly,although the law requires the SRI to obtain a warrant from a prosecutor tocarry out intelligence activities involving "threats to national security," itmay engage in a wide variety of operations, including "technical operations,"in order to determine if a situation meets the legal definition of a "threat tonational security." In 1994 arbitrary interference with individual citizens' rights to privacy wasinfrequent; however, some nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and Protestantchurch groups alleged that current or former government intelligence servicesopened their mail and tapped their telephones. The tenor of official responsesto such complaints was always that the SRI itself was not involved, but thatunreconstructed agents of the Securitate, the Communist-era internalintelligence service, or independent individuals were involved. In addition,both Romanian citizens and foreign diplomats credibly reported opened mail,personal surveillance, and harassment. The Government took some measures to investigate reports of such continuingabuses. In September the prosecutor's office brought to trial the former headof the SRI in Maramures county, accused of illegally tapping wires for the PUNRin the 1992 local elections. The SRI had dismissed the accused immediatelyfollowing the alleged incident, but his trial attracted increased publicattention after the appointment of the new Minister of Telecommunications, whois a member of the PUNR and was head of the telecommunications service inMaramures at the time of the alleged infraction. However, the court dismissedthe case in October on procedural grounds before trying it. RUSSIA Article 25 of the Constitution states that the right to privacy in the home maybe violated only on the basis of a court decision or in accordance with federallaws. In practice, law enforcement organs and internal security forces fail todo this and continue to observe the Soviet-era requirement of informing theprosecutor's office of intent to enter private premises. Article 23 of the Constitution provides for privacy of correspondence andelectronic communications, except in cases in which a judge issues a warrant.Many Russians believe electronic monitoring of residences and telephoneconversations continues, even if at reduced levels in comparison to the Sovietera. Refugee organizations claim that law enforcement officials routinely useinformer networks to track the whereabouts of persons from the Caucasus,whether resident in Russia legally or illegally. General societaldiscrimination against people from the Caucasus area and reports of harassmentagainst these people by law enforcement officials lend credence to suchassertions. RWANDA The Constitution provides for the respect of privacy of individuals,correspondence, and communications and declares that the home is inviolable.Police generally respected these provisions before the events of April. In the3-month period that followed, political and military officials of the interimgovernment abandoned any pretense of respecting privacy laws and committedwholesale abuses. There are no reports that the new Government interfered with these rights, nordoes it reportedly engage in surveillance of political parties, associations,or individuals. However, Hutu civilians and displaced persons in the northwestand southwest complained of abuses by RPA troops searching for weapons andsuspected war criminals. After capturing Kigali, both RPA soldiers andcivilians committed widespread looting and vandalism. SAN MARINO The authorities respect the concept of privacy of the home. The law requiresjudicial warrants for searches, and provides also for protection of the privacyof correspondence, including telephonic communications. SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE The Constitution provides for the integrity of the person and the right toprivacy of home, correspondence, and private communication. The Governmentdoes not engage in intrusive practices, such as surveillance of individuals orcommunications. The Judicial Police are responsible for criminalinvestigations and must obtain authorization from the Ministry of Justice toconduct searches. SENEGAL The Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, and there was littlegovernment interference in the private lives of citizens, particularly in therural areas. Normally, search warrants are required and only judges may issuethem. In practice, however, searches without warrants occasionally takeplace. SERBIA-MONTENEGRO Federal law gives republic ministries of the interior sole control over thedecision to monitor potential criminal activities, a power routinely abused.Authorities regularly monitored opposition and dissident activity, eavesdroppedon conversations, read mail, and tapped telephones. In December human rightsadvocates objected to an announcement by the Federal post office that it hadbeen registering all mail from abroad, ostensibly to protect mail carriers fromcharges of theft. Although the law includes restrictions on searches, officials often ignoredsuch restrictions. In Kosovo and Sandzak, police systematically subjectedethnic Albanians to random searches of their homes, vehicles, and offices,asserting they were searching for weapons. The CDHRF reported that in thefirst 3 months of 1994 police searched over 1,000 Kosovar Albanian homes, oftenphysically abusing the inhabitants. As an example of such methods, on a typical day in Kosovo (July 22), policeraided Hetmen and Nezir Makolli's Pristina home and seized a licensed huntingrifle, searched the home of Hysen Hasani and his sons in Lipljan, and raidedthe home of Hasan Fetaj in Suva Reka, threatening to draft him into theYugoslav army. Similar scenes were repeated thousands of times in Kosovo andSandzak. In January and February, police conducted a series of massive house-to-housesearches in Prijepolje (Sandzak). Police also routinely stopped privatevehicles in Kosovo and Sandzak and searched them and the passengers withoutprobable cause. Authorities often confiscated foreign currency from driversand passengers, although it is not illegal to possess foreign currency. SEYCHELLES The Constitution provides for the right to privacy and freedom from arbitrarysearches. The law requires a warrant for police searches, and the authoritiesgenerally respected this requirement in practice. SIERRA LEONE Although the Constitution prohibits arbitrary invasion of the home, theauthorities still have broad authority under NPRC decrees to monitor actions orconversations within homes, to prevent a person from acting in a mannerprejudicial to public safety, to impose restrictions on employment or business,to control association or communication with other persons, and to interferewith correspondence. In practice, there were numerous occasions of abusive treatment of ordinarycitizens by ill-disciplined soldiers and police, both within and outside of thewar zone. These abuses included forced entry into homes, robberies, andassaults, some of them fatal. Superior officers frequently punished offendingsoldiers when caught. In November the government executed 12 soldiers who hadbeen found guilty by a court-martial for crimes ranging from armed robbery tomurder (see Section l.e.). SINGAPORE The Government can use its wide discretionary powers if it determines thatnational security is threatened. In most cases, the law requires searchwarrants, normally issued by the magistrate court, for intrusion into the home.Law enforcement officers may, however, search a person, home, or propertywithout a warrant if they decide searches are necessary to preserve evidence. The Misuse of Drugs Act and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act alsopermit warrantless searches in dealing with drug- and secret society-relatedoffenses. The courts may undertake judicial review of such searches at therequest of the defendant. Divisions of the Government's law enforcementagencies, including the ISD and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board(CPIB), have wide networks for gathering information. The authorities have thecapability to monitor telephone and other private conversations and conductsurveillance, but there were no proven allegations that they did so in 1994. SLOVAK REPUBLIC The Criminal Code requires police to obtain a judicial search warrant in orderto enter a home. The court may issue such a warrant only if there is awell-founded suspicion that important evidence or persons accused of criminalactivity are present inside or if there is some other important reason. Policemust present the warrant before conducting the house search or within 24 hoursafter the search. The 1993 police law regulates wiretapping and mail surveillance for thepurposes of criminal investigation, which may be conducted, on the order of ajudge or prosecutor, only in cases of extraordinarily serious premeditatedcrimes or crimes involving international treaty obligations. There were noreports of illegal surveillance of persons or communications or of mailtampering. SLOVENIA The Constitution provides protection for privacy and the inviolability of thehome, mail, and other means of communication. These rights and protections areusually respected in practice. However, in March parts of a universityprofessor's private correspondence, critical of a minister in the Government,were read out in a broadcast on a government-controlled television station.The issue is now in the courts. SOLOMON ISLANDS In addition to legal provisions, the traditional culture provides strongprotection against these types of abuses. SOMALIA These rights were regularly violated by the warring factions. During fightingin Mogadishu, heavily armed bandits systematically looted the property of rivalgroups. Similar incidents occurred after the fighting in Kismayo in February.During military operations, the major factions have conducted home searches andevictions, and homes and property belonging to the former government andinternational bodies have been looted and destroyed. Although there has beensome discussion about property claims, the continued fighting has rendered theissue moot. SOUTH AFRICA Police and security forces retained the legal authority to engage in domesticsurveillance activities, including the use of informers. However, informedobservers believe that under the country's dramatically changed politicalenvironment the use of this authority has been limited to the pursuit oflegitimate law enforcement and national security objectives. Before the Interim Constitution came into force, police had sweeping powers ofsearch and seizure in magisterial districts that had been declared "unrestareas," under the provisions of the Public Safety Act. The provisions of theAct that allowed for the declaration of "unrest areas" are no longer operative,and police searches in all of South Africa must now be conducted in accordancewith the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977. This Act requires that a warrant beissued by a magistrate before a search can be conducted, unless there arereasonable grounds to suspect that evidence would be destroyed in the time thatit would take to obtain one. Despite the widespread anticipation that someprovisions of the Criminal Procedures Act will be challenged as beingunreasonable infringements of the right to privacy, all South Africans nowgenerally enjoy protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. The legacy of apartheid has left vast numbers of South Africans landless; morethan 8 million people now live in squatter camps which often surround settledcommunities. The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act gives landowners andlocal governments the authority to remove informal settlements withoutreference to the courts. Despite widespread preparedness on the part of thecentral Government and many local authorities to seek accommodation withsquatters, some municipalities, landowners, and, in one case, rightwingvigilantes, have demolished shacks as a means of forcing squatters to move. Although the problem of forced relocation of residents of informal settlementswas most pronounced prior to the April election, forced relocations continuedthroughout the year. The most notable of these incidents occurred in earlyJune when the Johannesburg City Council, without securing a court order orlegal judgment, demolished two squatter settlements on city land. Unauthorizedland invasions by squatters also continued sporadically throughout the year, apractice severely decried by the Government as inimical to the housing strategyit devised as part of its Reconstruction and Development Program. SPAIN The Constitution protects the privacy of the home and correspondence. Underthe Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval beforesearching private property, wiretapping, or interfering with privatecorrespondence. The antiterrorist law authorizes the Minister of the Interiorto act prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency." There havebeen no complaints of abuse of this authority. The Congress of Deputies passed legislation in 1992 broadening police authorityto makes searches and detentions without a court order, mostly in antinarcoticsoperations, but in 1993 this law was ruled unconstitutional. During the 20months it was in force, this law led to 340 raids and 940 arrests. Many damageclaims have been filed against the Government. SRI LANKA The Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individualprivacy and the sanctity of the family and home. The police obtain properwarrants for arrests and searches conducted under ordinary law. However, the security forces are not required to obtain warrants for searchesconducted under the PTA (see Section 1.e.). The Secretary of Defense isresponsible for providing oversight for such searches. There is no judicialreview or other means of redress for alleged illegal searches under the PTA. The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations andcorrespondence on a selective basis. The security forces routinely open maildestined for the LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband. The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens. In 1990 the LTTE evictedthousands of Muslim residents from their homes in the north. They currentlylive in refugee camps. ST. KITTS AND NEVIS There were no reports of arbitrary government or police interference in theprivate lives of individuals. The law requires judicially issued warrants tosearch private homes. SAINT LUCIA There were no reports of arbitrary intrusion by the Government into the privatelives of individual citizens. Authorities consistently observed constitutionalprohibitions against arbitrary search, seizure, and entry. ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES The Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other governmentintrusions into the private life of individual citizens, and there were noreports of such abuses. SUDAN The Government routinely interferes with its citizens' privacy. Throughout1994 security forces frequently conducted night searches without warrants.They targeted persons suspected of political crimes or also, in northern Sudan,of distilling or consuming illegal alcoholic beverages. For example, in Marchsecurity forces broke up a family ceremony in a private home in memory of 28officers executed in 1991 for coup plotting. They arrested and beat 30participants at the memorial service. A wide network of government informants conducted pervasive surveillance inschools, universities, markets, workplaces, and neighborhoods. The authoritieskept key opposition figures under frequent surveillance. The Government alsocontinued its practice of summarily dismissing military personnel and othergovernment employees whose loyalty it suspected. Dozens lost their jobsthroughout the year. Security personnel routinely opened and read mail andtapped telephones. Government-instituted neighborhood "popular committees," ostensibly a mechanismfor political mobilization, served as a means for monitoring households. Thesecommittees caused many Sudanese to be wary of neighbors who could report themfor "suspicious" activities, including "excessive" contact with foreigners.The committees also furnished or withheld documents essential for obtaining anexit visa from Sudan. In high schools, students were sometimes pressured tojoin proregime youth groups. SURINAME The Constitution provides for the right to privacy. The law requires warrantsfor searches, which are issued not by judges but by quasi-judicial officers whosupervise criminal investigations. The police obtain them in the greatmajority of investigations. The new military command curbed invasions ofprivacy by the military such as the illegal monitoring of telephone calls,monitoring the movements of human rights advocates, and threatening governmentofficials, policemen, politicians, human rights workers, and journalists.Although some persons continued these activities on occasion, the militaryauthorities reportedly did not authorize them to do so. SWAZILAND The law requires a warrant from a magistrate before police may search homes orother premises, and police generally respect this requirement in practice.However, police officers with the rank of subinspector or higher have the rightto search without a warrant if they believe evidence might be lost throughdelay in obtaining a warrant. While searches without warrants occuroccasionally, the issue of legality of evidence rarely arises in court.Opponents of the Government complained of unlawful police searches and seizuresbut did not seek judicial relief in 1994. There is no evidence that the Government systematically monitors privatecorrespondence or conversations. SWEDEN The law limits home searches to investigations of crimes punishable by at least2 years' imprisonment, such as murder, robbery, rape, arson, sabotage,counterfeiting, or treason. The authorities respect this provision. Normally,police must obtain court approval for a search or wiretap; however, a seniorpolice officer may approve a search if time is a critical factor or thereappears to be a threat to life. A parliamentary committee each year reviewsall monitoring of telephones, faxes, or computers. SWITZERLAND Cantonal laws regulate police entry into private premises. These laws differwidely from canton to canton, but all prohibit arbitrary intrusion. There wereno reports of violations of these rights. SYRIA Although laws provide for the freedom from arbitrary interference, theEmergency Law authorizes the police to enter homes or conduct searches withoutwarrants in national security cases. The authorities arbitrarily set up security checkpoints on streets and roads.At these sites, security officials search persons and vehicles withoutwarrants, looking for weapons, drugs, subversive literature, and smuggledgoods. The security services selectively monitor telephone conversations and facsimiletransmissions and interfere with the mail. In some cases, censors haveprevented the delivery to private citizens of foreign human rightspublications. TAIWAN The Constitution and sections of the criminal and civil codes containprovisions for privacy. The authorities generally do not make warrantlesssearches, which were common before the lifting of martial law. A warrant,issued by a prosecutor or a judge, must be obtained before a search, exceptwhen incidental to arrest. Critics, however, claim that the "incidental toarrest" provision is not only unconstitutional but often interpreted broadly bypolice to justify searches of locations other than actual sites of arrests.Moreover, police continue to search cars routinely at roadblocks. According to the National Police Administration, warrantless searches areallowed only in specialized circumstances, such as to arrest an escapee or iffacts indicate a person is in the process of committing a crime and thecircumstances are urgent. In any such case, the police must file a report withthe prosecutor or court within 24 hours. Evidence collected without a warrant,according to regulations, is not excluded from introduction during a trial;however, a policeman who carries out an illegal search can be sued for illegalentry and sentenced up to 1 year's imprisonment. Although in the past allegations were made that police and security agenciesinterfere with the right to privacy through such means as surveillance andinterception of correspondence and telephone calls, there were no reports ofsuch interference for political purposes in 1994. According to EY regulations,judicial and security authorities may file a written request to a prosecutor'soffice to monitor telephone calls to collect evidence against a suspectinvolved in a major crime. TAJIKISTAN Articles 22 and 23 of the new Constitution and the Criminal Code provide forthe inviolability of the home and prohibit interference with correspondence,telephone conversations, and postal and communication rights, except "in casesprescribed by law." Police may not enter and search a private home without theapproval of the procurator. In some cases, police may enter and search a homewithout permission, but they must then inform the procurator within 24 hours.Police are permitted to enter and search homes without permission if they havecompelling reason to believe a delay in obtaining a warrant would impairnational security. There is no judicial review of police searches conductedwithout a warrant. In September the penalties for the violation of the privacyof correspondence were increased to several years in prison. Also inSeptember, the Supreme Soviet raised the maximum sentence for invasion ofprivacy of the home from between 2 and 5 years to between 5 and 8 years inprison. Numerous examples of arbitrary illegal search and seizure by government forcesincluded the August raid by Interior Ministry forces against a predominantlyGarmi and Pamiri neighborhood in the Yuzhni district of Dushanbe. Securityforces presented no warrants as they rounded up young men, apparently atrandom, and took them away. TANZANIA The State continued to interfere with these rights, which are generallyprovided for in the Constitution. The CCM has historically penetrated alllevels of society through local cells, varying in size from single-family homesto large apartment buildings and containing from 10 to 200 persons. Unpaidparty officials serve as 10-cell leaders with authority to resolve problems atthe grassroots level and to report to authorities any suspicious behavior,event, or noncompliance with compulsory night patrol service in theneighborhood. In 1993 elections were held for new grassroots leaders toreplace the CCM 10-cell leaders in nonparty business. Because the Governmentreversed its position and subsequently held the elections on a party basis,most of the opposition parties boycotted the elections. In fact, few votersparticipated in these elections, and the former CCM 10-cell leaders retainednearly all of their power and influence. CCM membership is voluntary and is estimated at approximately 2 to 3 millioncardholders. While in the past CCM membership had been necessary foradvancement in political and other areas, the importance of such membership iswaning. The Criminal Procedure Act of 1985 authorizes police officials (including thecivilian anticrime units) to issue search warrants; however, the Act alsoauthorizes searches of person and premises without a warrant if necessary toprevent the loss or destruction of evidence connected with an offense or ifcircumstances are serious and urgent. In practice, warrants are rarelyrequested, and the police and others search private homes and businessestablishments at will. The security services reportedly monitor telephonesand correspondence of some citizens and selected foreign residents. Compulsory participation in local anticrime groups known as "Wasalama" and"Sungusungu" continued in some areas. Historically, these groups have operatedonly in rural areas to combat cattle rustling and other criminal activity;however, government ministers continued to promote them vigorously in urbanareas to combat crime. THAILAND The law requires police to obtain a warrant prior to a search. Warrants areissued by the police with prior Ministry of Interior or provincial governorapproval and are not subject to judicial review. There were some crediblereports that officers sometimes endorse warrants in advance and then allowtheir noncommissioned subordinates to apply them as needed. The Anti-CommunistActivities Act allows officials engaged in "Communist suppression operations"to conduct searches without warrants, but these powers rarely have been invokedin recent years and were not invoked in 1994. Thai society is essentially open; membership in political organizations isvoluntary, and the unmonitored exchange of ideas is generally permitted.However, security services monitor persons espousing leftist or controversialviews, including foreign visitors. TOGO In criminal cases, a judge or senior police official may authorize searches ofprivate residences. In political and national security cases, the securityforces need no prior authorization. Police conducted such warrantless searchesextensively, searching for dissidents' arms caches as well as for criminals.The Government uses telephone taps, monitors correspondence, and maintains thepolice and gendarmerie as domestic intelligence services. TONGA By law and in practice, no one may enter or search the home of another orremove any item of property unless in possession of a warrant issued by amagistrate. Neither the State nor political organizations intrude arbitrarilyinto a person's private life. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO The authorities generally respected in practice the constitutional provisionsfor the rights to security of the person, enjoyment of property, and respectfor private and family life. Police must obtain search warrants to enterprivate property. There were occasional reports of search warrants or drugraids executed on the wrong houses, but persons injured in this manner haveredress through a civil action for damages. TUNISIA The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person and the home andfor the privacy of correspondence, "except in exceptional cases defined bylaw." Police must have a search warrant, but this requirement is sometimesignored in cases in which the authorities consider that state security isinvolved or in which a "flagrant crime" is deemed to have been committed. The authorities continued to monitor the activities of Islamists and leftistsand searched their homes without warrants. They frequently harassed therelatives and associates of such persons by repeatedly interrogating them.During the year, several human rights monitors and oppositionists accused theGovernment of harassment and intimidation. Police presence in urban areas isheavy. Traffic officers routinely stop motorists to examine their identity andvehicular documents. TURKEY The Constitution provides for the inviolability of a person's domicile and theprivacy of correspondence and communication. Government officials may enter aprivate residence or intercept or monitor private correspondence only uponissuance of a judicial warrant. These provisions are generally respected inpractice outside the state of emergency region. A judge must decide whether to issue a search warrant for a residence. Ifdelay may cause harm, prosecutors and municipal officers authorized to carryout prosecutors' instructions may conduct a search. Searches of privatepremises may not be carried out at night, unless the delay will be damaging orthe search will result in the capture of a prisoner at large. Exceptionsinclude persons under special observation by the Security Directorate General,places anyone can enter at night, places where criminals gather, places wherematerials obtained through the Commission of Crimes are kept, gamblingestablishments, and brothels. In the 10 provinces under emergency rule, theRegional Governor can and does empower security authorities to search without awarrant residences or the premises of political parties, businesses,associations, or other organizations. According to the HRF, the practice ofsecurity authorities in these provinces to search, hold, or seize withoutwarrant persons, letters, telegrams, and documents is unconstitutional.Roadblocks are commonplace in the southeast, and security officials regularlysearch vehicles and travelers. Security forces have compelled the evacuation of villages in the southeast toprevent villagers from giving aid and comfort to the PKK (see Section 1.g.).The Government admits to village and hamlet evacuations but claims they occuras the consequence of pressures by and fear of the PKK and because securityoperations against the PKK in the region make continued occupancy unsafe. TURKMENISTAN The Constitution provides that a citizen has the right to protection fromarbitrary interference in his or her personal life. However, there are nolegal means to regulate the conduct of surveillance by the state securityapparatus, which regularly monitors the activities of opponents and critics ofthe Government. Security officials use physical surveillance, telephonetapping, electronic eavesdropping, and recruit informers. Critics of theGovernment and other citizens report credibly that their mail is interceptedbefore delivery. TUVALU The Government adheres in practice to the legal protection of privacy of thehome. It does not arbitrarily intrude into the private life of theindividual. UGANDA The Government does not generally intrude in the privacy, family, or home ofcitizens. The law requires that the police have search warrants beforeentering private homes or offices, and this law is generally observed inpractice. However, the police searched vehicles for weapons at checkpointswithout prior warrants. UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND Warrants are normally required for a police search of private premises.However, under the EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or policemen inNorthern Ireland may enter any premises if they believe they have "reasonablegrounds of suspicion" that the entry is necessary to preserve peace andorder. In Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, where distrust of the Governmenthas deep historical roots, many believe that the conduct of some members of thesecurity forces in carrying out security checks constitutes unwarrantedharassment and intimidation. Such allegations also occur in Protestantneighborhoods, albeit less frequently. The Government intensively trainssecurity personnel in proper procedures, but acknowledges that violations ofthe rules occasionally occur. UKRAINE Search warrants issued by prosecutors, not judges, are required and utilized inmost cases. The SBU may, however, conduct intrusive surveillance and searcheswithout a warrant on national security grounds. Human rights observers reportreceiving no complaints of invasion of privacy by the SBU. According to theSBU charter, persons subject to surveillance must be informed after a month'stime. The Prosecutor General's office has oversight responsibility over theSBU, but the extent to which it utilizes that authority to monitor SBUactivities and to curb excesses by security officials is unknown. The remnants of Soviet control mechanisms survive in many guises. The militiastops vehicles arbitrarily in cities, at the borders of cities and towns, andthroughout the countryside. It needs no probable cause to stop vehicles for anextensive document check and inspection of all parts of the vehicle and itscontents. This has become a great source of and inducement to corruption inthe militia: citizens who often have committed no violation, or only a minorone, prefer to pay a bribe to avoid time-consuming inspections. Westerners andWestern vehicles are popular targets of this treatment. Persons who havecommitted serious violations also escape justice by paying bribes to officials,further undermining the concept of the rule of law. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES The Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission,except in accordance with the law. Although the police may enter homes withouta warrant and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions insearching premises are subject to review, and he is subject to disciplinaryaction if he acts irresponsibly. Officials other than a police officer musthave a court order to enter a private home. Local custom places a high valueon privacy, and entry into private homes without the owner's permission israre. There is no known surveillance of private correspondence. URUGUAY The Constitution provides for the right to privacy. It states that the home isabsolutely inviolable at night and may be entered and searched only with ajudicial warrant and only during the day. It provides equally strongprotection for private papers and correspondence, and requires a warrant forconfiscation. The authorities generally respect these rights and safeguards inpractice. UZBEKISTAN By law, search warrants issued by a procurator are required. There is noprovision for judicial review of search warrants. There does not appear to bea legal mechanism for authorizing telephone tapping or monitoring. Securityagencies nonetheless monitor telephone calls, and there is evidence that theyemploy surveillance and wiretap telephones in the cases of persons involved inopposition political activities. Certain high- profile opposition activistswere the subject of very visible surveillance, including round-the-clock policemonitoring of all movements. VANUATU There were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, orcorrespondence. VENEZUELA Constitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family,home, and correspondence. After the Government suspended the freedom fromsearch without warrant on June 27, however, the press reported a number ofincidents of searches without warrants by security forces. According to themedia, DISIP searched the homes of a prominent Caracas businessman and of anoted intellectual, and the DIM similarly searched 30 homes in the city ofCumana. In recent years, there have been some complaints of telephonesurveillance, and human rights monitors accused the security forces of illegalwiretapping. In September the Interior Minister announced that the telephonesin his office were being wiretapped, apparently by former employees of hisMinistry. VIETNAM The Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance andcontrol through household registration and party-appointed block wardens whouse informants to keep track of individual activities. However, many foreignobservers believe this monitoring was done with less scope and efficiency thanin the past, with authorities concentrating on those suspected of involvementin unauthorized political or religious activities. Anecdotal evidence suggestsGovernment monitoring is stricter in the south, especially in Ho Chi Minh City.Particularly in urban areas, most Vietnamese citizens were free to contact,talk, and work with foreigners, although many remained nervous about extensivesocial contacts. The Government continued to selectively censor mail, confiscate packages, andmonitor telephone and facsimile transmissions. In the past, the Party pressedpeople to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist for villages,city districts, schools, work (trade unions), youth, and women. However, withthe growth of the private sector, these organizations play a less importantrole than in the past. While membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Government orin state companies, and vital to promotion to senior levels of the Government,the Party faced increased difficulty attracting members. In response, theGovernment increased its recruitment efforts and was marginally successful inattracting new members from the private sector. The Government continued to implement a family-planning policy that urges allfamilies to have no more than two children. It sometimes penalized people whohave more than two children by denying promotions or permission to changejobs. WESTERN SAHARA (no information) WESTERN SAMOA Western Samoan law provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizureof property without substantive and procedural safeguards, including searchwarrants, which are issued by the judicial branch. Practically, however, thereis little or no privacy in the village. Village officials by law must havepermission to enter homes, but there can be substantial social pressure togrant such permission. YEMEN Despite constitutional provisions against such interference, security forcesroutinely search homes, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwiseintrude into personal matters for alleged security considerations. Suchactivities are conducted without warrants issued by legal authorities or otherjudicial supervision. Many citizens believe that the security forces monitortelephone conversations. ZAIRE Security forces routinely ignore the Constitution's provision for theinviolability of the home and of private correspondence. They ignore therequirement for a search warrant, entering and searching homes at will. Underthe pretext of searching for arms, troops entered and looted the home of aleader of the radical opposition in Kinshasa; troops also looted the home of anurban commissar in Kolwezi. Human rights monitors and the press reportnumerous other instances in which gangs believed to be security forces enteredand looted private homes, sometimes abusing or threatening the residents. Inmany of these cases, simple robbery, rather than political intimidation,appeared to be the motive. Citizens widely assume that the Government monitorsmail and telephone communications. ZAMBIA The Constitution provides for respect for privacy and the inviolability of thehome, and the authorities generally respected these rights in practice. Exceptduring a state of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may entera home. Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplacecontinued. According to the government Commissioner for Refugees, immigrationofficials are empowered under the law to conduct these roundups without awarrant. ZIMBABWE The Constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search or entry, and sincethe lifting of the State of Emergency (SOE) in June 1990, these protectionshave been generally respected. It is widely known, however, that theGovernment monitors private correspondence and telephones, particularlyinternational communications. Although the need for land reform in Zimbabwe is almost universally accepted,pursuant to the 1992 Land Acquisition Act farmers whose lands have beendesignated for acquisition may only appeal the amount of compensation inadministrative courts, not the decision to acquire their farms. The Act has been implemented largely along racial lines; the Government statedthat black-owned commercial farms would not be subject to designation. In somecases, land has been designated for acquisition to achieve political goals.The designation of former Member of Parliament (M.P.) Henry Ellsworth's homefarm for acquisition, highlighted in the 1993 Human Rights Report as an exampleof the Land Acquisition Act's use as a political tool, has been revoked.However, opposition party leader Ndabaningi Sithole is still fighting theGovernment's acquisition of his Churu farm. After the Government's late 1993attempt to evict more than 2,500 families living on the property, severalthousand Churu farm residents were resettled on a holding farm where severaldied as the result of abysmal sanitary conditions. The situation at Churu farmremained at a standoff until October 1994, when the ZRP evicted the remaining1,600 residents and resettled them at a camp formerly used by Mozambicanrefugees.

Since the late1980s, when computer and telecommunications systems began to converge, this process hasaccelerated. The result is that personal privacy is endangered as never before. During 1990, in response to a growing number of privacy threats, more than a hundred leadingprivacy experts and Human Rights organizations from forty countries linked arms to form aworld organization for the protection of privacy. Members of the new body, including computerprofessionals, academics, lawyers, journalists, jurists and human rights activists, had acommon interest in promoting an international understanding of the importance of privacy anddata protection. Meetings of the group, which took the name Privacy International, were heldthroughout that year in North America, Europe, Asia and the South Pacific, and members agreedto work toward the establishment of effective privacy protection throughout the world. The formation of Privacy International is the first successful attempt to establish astructured world focus on this crucial area of human rights. Privacy International is anindependent, non-government organization with the primary role of advocacy and support. Campaigns and Networking Privacy International has been most prominent in North America, Europe and Asia, where ithas liaised with local human rights organisations to raise awareness about the development ofnational surveillance systems. The network has also been used by law reform and human rightsorganisations in more than twenty countries to assist local privacy issues. In Thailand andthe Philippines, for example, Privacy International worked with local human rights bodies todevelop national campaigns against the establishment of government identity card systems. InCanada, New Zealand, the United States, Hungary, Australia and the United Kingdom we havepromoted privacy issues through national media and through public campaigns.

Conferences Privacy International organises two conferences each year. These are held at the time of theInternational Conference of Privacy and Data Protection Commissioners, and the US basedComputers, Freedom and Privacy conference. These conferences have been held in Sydney,Washington, Manchester, Chicago, San Francisco and the Hague. They bring together anunprecedented diversity of interest groups and expertise. Electronic Archive PI also has an extensive archive of material on international privacy including majorinternational agreements, country reports, and constitutions located on the World Wide Web at http://www.privacy.org/pi/. Structure and Finances Privacy International has received funding and support from a range of Foundations, academicestablishments and non-government organisations. These include The Stern Foundation(Washington DC), The German Marshall Fund (Washington DC), Computer Professionals for SocialResponsibility (CPSR, Washington DC) and the University of New South Wales (Sydney). Theorganisation is also minimally financed through membership fees and newsletter subscriptions.Privacy International is administered through the Electronic Privacy Information Center inWashington DC. Activities for 1996 In 1996, Privacy International will produce a Privacy Activists Handbook for distribution toconsumer, privacy and human rights groups throughout the world. The book will explain howprivacy issues can be identified and fought through campaigns, political action and mediaactivity. The book will be a vital part of other strategies being initiated by PrivacyInternational. Privacy International will also be holding a conference in Ottawa,Canada, on the subject of advanced technologies of surveillance. Amongst these are genetictechnology, satellite surveillance, advanced Geographic Information Systems, IntelligentVehicle Highway Systems, microchip implants and nanotechnology. The conference will be heldSeptember 16. Click here to see the advance program for the Ottawa conference.

In the morning session representatives from the Netherlands, New Zealand, Quebec, Hong Kong and the United States explained how data protection law is administered and enforced in their respective societies. In the afternoon, the participants engaged in a roundtable discussion on the implementation of data protection policy in the Canadian context. The Canadian representatives included officials from federal government departments, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC), the provincial Information and Privacy Commissioner and Ombudsman offices, and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). I was asked by Industry Canada to be the rapporteur for this workshop and to write a report on the day's events. The views expressed in this paper, however, are not a strict report of all that was said at the workshop and no views are attributed to any of the participants. Rather the paper is a set of personal reflections on the various options for extending privacy protection rules to the private sector in the light of the very informative discussion on this occasion. These views are mine and mine alone, even though they have been shaped by numerous conversations with experts and officials both before and after the March 25th workshop. The paper also builds upon my own previous work on the implementation of privacy protection policy in other countries, especially Regulating Privacy: Data Protection and Public Policy in Europe and the United States, and upon the research conducted on the implementation of the Canadian Standards Association's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information (Q830). The paper also draws upon other comparative and Canadian analysis of the implementation of privacy protection policy. In particular, the 1995 report by Ian Lawson set out a complete range of regulatory options for the protection of privacy on the information highway. This paper attempts to narrow the focus, and to concentrate on the most practical regulatory options for Canada. Although there is plenty of scope to draw lessons from Canadian and overseas experience, we are not working with a tabula rasa. There are public sector laws at the federal level, and in most provinces. In Quebec's Bill 68, we have the only legislation in Canada that regulates private sector practices. Each of these statutes grants a different range of powers and responsibilities to the respective offices of Information and Privacy Commissioners (see Appendices). In addition, there are a plethora of other provisions within provincial and federal statutes that relate to the collection, storage, processing and transmission of personal data. Many businesses have also developed voluntary "codes of practice." It is impossible to "wipe the slate clean" and to build a privacy protection regime from the ground up. The policy process will be inescapably incremental. It must build upon the instruments and provisions that are already in place. The paper will also not grapple with the complicated issue of federal/provincial constitutional authority. To a large extent, questions about the appropriate oversight and compliance mechanisms will apply whether or not legislation is crafted with a comprehensive scope, or whether it applies more narrowly to federally regulated entities. This paper addresses the functions that need to be performed in any effective regime for personal data protection. Those functions will require careful analysis whether they are performed at the federal and/or provincial levels, or on a comprehensive or sectoral basis. This paper is about the level of regulation. Jurisdictional conflicts will continue to occur under any legislated or self-regulatory scheme. I am, therefore, indebted to those people who attended the March 25th workshop. This paper cannot purport to offer any consensus on the results of that meeting. Nevertheless, I hope that those present recognize from this paper the most important themes and issues discussed on that occasion. I am also grateful to Ritu Mahil for her research assistance. ___________________ I. The National Standard for Privacy Protection In its 1995 report the Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) advised the federal government to: create a level playing field for the protection of personal information on the Information Highway by developing and implementing a flexible legislative framework for both public and private sectors. Legislation would require sectors or organizations to meet the standard of the CSA model code, while allowing the flexibility to determine how they will refine their own codes. The report goes on to recommend that the federal government "in cooperation with the CSA Working Group on Privacy and other interested parties, study the development of effective oversight and enforcement mechanisms." This paper is a contribution to that effort. On May 23, Industry Minister Manley released the government's response to the IHAC report in which it was concluded that "the right to privacy must be recognized in law, especially in an electronic world of private databases where it is all too easy to collect and exploit information about individual citizens." Hence: As a means of encouraging business and consumer confidence in the Information Highway, the Ministers of Industry and Justice, after consultation with the provinces and other stakeholders, will bring forward proposals for a legislative framework governing the protection of personal data in the private sector. The government's response explicitly mentions the Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information from the Canadian Standards Association as a legislative framework. The following principles have been widely agreed by representatives from government, industry and consumer associations. They represent an important consensus on the basic principles of a privacy protection policy: … Accountability An organization is responsible for personal information under its control and shall designate an individual or individuals who are accountable for the organization's compliance with the following principles. … Identifying Purposes The purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified by the organization at or before the time the information is collected … Consent The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the use, or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate. … Limiting Collection The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by the organization. Information shall be collected by fair and lawful means. … Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law. Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. … Accuracy Personal information shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. … Safeguards Personal Information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. … Openness An organization shall make readily available to individuals specific information about its policies and practices relating to the management of personal information. … Individual Access Upon request, an individual shall be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information and shall be given access to that information. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate. … Challenging Compliance An individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable for the organization's compliance. The goal of any national privacy protection policy should be to implement these principles throughout all organizations that process personal data (in both public and private sectors). This goal requires voluntary action from the "bottom-up" as well as regulatory action from the top-down. There are a range of tools within the repertoire of possible policy instruments. Four are outlined within Industry Canada's 1994 publication Privacy and the Canadian Information Highway: legislation and regulation; voluntary codes and standards; technological solutions; and consumer education. Although this paper concentrates on the relationship between law, regulation, codes and standards, it should never be forgotten that technologies of privacy (such as public-key encryption) have a crucial role to play in any privacy policy. Moreover, no policy can succeed without the actions of an informed and vigilant citizenry. Each of these four approaches contributes to a "mosaic of solutions." Each is a necessary condition for privacy protection on the information highway; none is a sufficient condition. II. The Value of the Privacy Standard The status quo has been described as a "privacy patchwork." A comprehensive data protection law covering all private sector organizations in Quebec contrasts with a hodgepodge of voluntary codes and isolated statutory provisions in the rest of the country. Partly as a response to this incoherence, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has recently developed a Code for the Protection of Personal Information in association with stakeholders from government, consumer groups and key industry sectors (banking, telecommunications, insurance, direct-marketing, credit-reporting). This Code was ratified without any dissent in September 1995 and was released in March 1996. It was designed to add some uniformity to data protection policy and practice within the Canadian private sector. At first glance, the CSA Model Code might seem a Canadian version of the OECD Guidelines -- a rearrangement and translation of the key principles into the Canadian context. At the moment, it is just that -- a model that any organization can use and adapt to their specific circumstances. But it does represent a very important consensus, brokered among the major stakeholders. Moreover, it has doubtless been very valuable for participants in the process to think about the privacy protection problem from scratch and to grapple with these complex issues. Although no decision has yet been made about the mechanisms for implementation and oversight, the CSA Model Code is a "standard" that might be subjected to the same kind of certification and registration procedures that are used for other standards. Privacy, of course, is not the kind of "hard" standard typically used within manufacturing industry. Nevertheless it does have certain parallels with the range of "quality management standards" within the ISO-9000 series that have been rapidly permeating the Canadian and American private sectors, as well as with environmental standards in the ISO 14000 series. Thus, in the same way that a company might be forced to register to ISO-9000 to convince its clients and customers that it has adopted a level of "quality assurance" the same system of accreditation could be developed to the privacy standard, where effective data protection is demanded within the Canadian or international marketplace. The price of maintaining a registration to the standard would be an agreement to have independent and regular privacy audits. Of course, not all businesses would be expected to go to the kind of trouble and expense of registering to ISO-9000. The registration scheme for privacy would also require procedures applicable to the smaller business. The scheme requires an appropriate balance between the encouragement of registration on the one hand, and the prevention of symbolic claims about policies and practices on the other. It also requires an appropriate publicity vehicle, so that any consumer can find out who has registered to the standard and who has not. A "Privacy Good Book" in the form of a Privacy Register would have to accompany the registration scheme. If a credible registration process is established, the CSA Model Code ceases to be a "voluntary" mechanism. Organizations would have to produce a code and a related set of operational guidelines and be subjected to regular and independent auditing of their practices. The system would build a more consistent and credible system of verification than occurs at the moment. It could satisfy international and contractual requirements. It could provide a more common and consistent yardstick by which to observe and evaluate company practices. Such a system would be able to monitor the claims made by organizations about their policies and practices. I have suggested that the privacy standard might filter throughout the marketplace by a number of different inducements to registration: by moral suasion; by the desire to avoid adverse publicity; by the desire to gain a competitive advantage; by the reference to the standard in private contract; by the registration to the privacy standard in conjunction with registration to ISO-9000; by the reference to the standard when government "contracts out" data processing services; by pressure from research-funding agencies; by the regulation of interprovincial data flows in Quebec's Bill 68; and by the use of the "adequacy" provisions by European data protection authorities. Canadian and foreign regulatory bodies can insist that the receipt of personal data within Canada be accompanied by a registration to the CSA Model Code. As outlined, the registration to the CSA Model Code would provide a better yardstick for the evaluation of personal information practices. It could promote higher levels of consumer awareness. It could raise the levels of responsibility and accountability within Canadian business. It can initiate more and better privacy auditing. But the process would still be incremental and piecemeal. It could never achieve the kind of uniform legal standard in Canada, the "seamless protection" that the Federal Privacy Commissioner has called for. III. The Value-Added of Data Protection Law Leaving aside the peculiar constitutional dilemmas within Canada, what would a legal regime add to the standards-approach monitored through a registration regime administered through an accredited standards-registration body? Five arguments are persuasive. First, only law can express the standards of the community, the line beyond which no organization should be allowed to cross. This is what Bruce Phillips has in mind when he argues that "unless some sensible rules of traffic management are a part of these systems, the first roadkill will be our personal privacy and dignity." The metaphor of the "information highway" does lead naturally to the undeniable argument that there needs to be some consistent "rules of the road." For many businesses the rules of the road might be attractive to create a "level-playing field" a clear and consistent set of privacy rules that apply across the entire Canadian marketplace. Law does not necessarily provide that standard. "Far too frequently," Oscar Gandy reminds us, "we tend to talk about the law as the even-handed instrumentality that ensures that the universal values claimed for any society are protected and guaranteed." Any advocate for a legal regime must recognize the vast inequalities within the operation of the law, especially when it is used as a "strategic weapon" rather than as "an expression of a basic moral vision, a set of guiding principles that serve as foundations supporting relations among persons." Second, those "rules of the road" are more likely to be even-handedly applied under the guidance of an impartial "traffic cop." The CSA Model Code states that each organization shall designate an individual who is responsible for compliance, and that organizations shall make it clear how consumers might challenge compliance with the principles (Principles One and Ten). Under current circumstances, the highest mechanism for complaint resolution within most sectors is within the business that is processing the personal data. Only legislation can establish a final arbiter external to the organization. Only legislation can involve the institutions that to date have the best experience with resolving privacy complaints within Canada -- the offices of the federal and provincial Information and Privacy Commissioners. Third, only law can bring the recalcitrants into line. However successfully the CSA Model Code can regulate the practices of the most responsible businesses, there will always be a minority that will see a competitive advantage in processing personal data in contravention of the standard. Undoubtedly, the fear of the CDMA that the image of its responsible members is being tarnished by a minority of non-members motivated its call for national legislation based on the CSA standard. This move is fascinating. It indicates that at a certain point for some sectors, legislation becomes the acceptable alternative to continued bad publicity. Fourth, an economic argument can be advanced. As Ian Lawson has argued: "To the extent that business obtains and uses personal information without a market mechanism to govern the exchange, business is a classic free rider in the economy. It consumes a common property resource without covering the externalities related to its extraction and use." So when organizations benefit from the use of the information, either themselves or by trading that information to third parties, no benefits accrue to the original information provider. That situation has perpetuated because of the reluctance of many businesses to be transparent about their practices and to establish mechanisms to obtain informed consent when they wish to use personal information for "secondary uses." Business remains a "free rider" so long as individuals are kept in the dark about how their information is being used and disclosed. Classic economic theorizing would contend that an imperfect marketplace can be rectified by two mechanisms. First, one can give a value to personal information so that the costs and benefits of transactions are allocated more appropriately. There have been some proposals for market-based solutions to this imbalance; all rest on schemes to give individuals some property rights over their information with appropriate compensation when it is used for purposes other than those for which it was originally supplied. The other solution is regulatory intervention to redress the marketplace imbalance. It is contestable, of course, that economic theorizing has any role to play in the protection of a fundamental human right. Nevertheless, even according to the principles of neoclassical economic reasoning, the arguments for regulatory intervention are hard to resist. Fifth, only the law can harmonize the standards of the public and the private sectors. Where the "public" sector ends and the "private" sector begins is increasingly difficult to determine. Questions raised about the application and meaning of the privacy provisions in the Federal Privacy Act and related provincial statutes will have an evolving impact on the practices of the private sector. It can also be expected that the increased publicity that privacy issues will receive in the media as a result of the efforts of the Privacy Commissioners will continue to have some spill-over effect. The need for "seamless protection" between the private and public sectors was one key factor behind the passage of the New Zealand Privacy Act. The distinction is also being eroded by efforts to privatize or hive-off government functions. Thus "private" organizations are increasingly performing "public" functions, and often require the use of "public" data to fulfill those obligations. Illustrations include: the use of smart cards and ATM machines for the dispensing of government benefits; the matching of data on welfare recipients with bank or financial records to ascertain eligibility; the trading of government personal information to enhance revenue; the use of credit reports for security checks, and so on. The pervasiveness and flexibility of the new technologies will make it increasingly difficult to determine which data are "in" the public sector, and which "in" the private. Finally, and the least important reason, concerns the interpretation of Article 25 of the new European Directive on data protection: The Member States shall provide that the transfer to a third country of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer may take place only if, without prejudice to compliance with the national provisions adopted pursuant to the other provisions of this Directive, the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection. Notwithstanding the stipulation in Article 26 that "professional rules and security measures which are complied with" may be taken into account in determining the "adequacy of protection," Article 25 could mean that European regulators might legitimately interrupt flows of data to every part of Canada except Quebec, unless legal protections are forthcoming. An "adequate level of protection" could be interpreted to mean a legislated regime, overseen by an independent "supervisory authority." At the very least, it should be noted that any professional rules (such as codes of practice) have to be complied with. Any data protection system in Canada has to demonstrate that it is seriously and effectively implemented. IV. Legislating to the Standard Unlike voluntary codes of practice, the CSA standard can be referenced in law. Around one-third of CSA's published standards have been referenced either in federal and/or provincial legislation. Most of these standards relate to the technical standards for products procured by government. Increasingly, however, performance standards, such as those for quality management or environmental protection, are being used in order to implement statute, regulation and court-order. There is nothing to stop federal and/or provincial authorities using Q830 in a similar way. The report of the Information Highway Advisory Council, however, envisages a more comprehensive approach -- a "flexible legislative framework for both public and private sectors. Legislation would require sectors or organizations to meet the standard of the CSA model code, while allowing the flexibility to determine how they will refine their own codes." This seems to contemplate "framework" or "shell" legislation at the federal level; a statement of principles and obligations, leaving the functions of complaints resolution, investigation, auditing, and so on, as a matter for further analysis "in cooperation with the CSA Working Group on Privacy." But there have been a number of different interpretations of what IHAC means and of what it means to "legislate to the standard." The Canadian Direct Marketing Association, for example, called upon Minister Manley: to place before Parliament framework federal legislation that requires each industry sector to develop its own specific privacy code that meets a national standard. We do not think this legislation needs to be complex, nor would it be expensive to administer. We suggest a similar model to that of the Canada Health Act that sets minimum national standards but allows each province to develop and run its own health care system to meet its specific needs. The CDMA goes on to explain that "each code would reflect the needs of the individual sector and meet the standards set by the OECD and/or draft CSA codes." Moreover, the CDMA also has "concerns that regulatory authority could be used to make the principles more onerous. We think the concept of allowing industries to create standards that protect privacy and meet their particular needs will prevent undue regulatory interference." The CDMA would delegate a small complaints-resolution function to the Federal Privacy Commissioner. There is a key distinction between voluntarism and self-regulation. The former implies that public policy should remain indifferent to the policies and practices pursued. It implies that government should simply trust business to pursue privacy-friendly practices but has no interest in setting an overall standard. This has been the position of the Canadian and American federal governments to date. A self-regulatory regime, on the other hand, establishes in law the standard and grants business the authority to regulate its own practices. The key difference is that a legislated standard is set, and that both individual and organization knows that when self-regulation breaks down, the policy instruments established under the law can intervene. The Federal Privacy Commissioner has a slightly different vision, suggesting that the CSA Model Code could form an amendment to the Privacy Act. This option is attractive to the Privacy Commissioner as it would "embody in law a set of rules devised by a committee representing a broad cross-section of Canadian private enterprise." However, the Privacy Commissioner says nothing about "codes." For him the advantage of legislating to the standard is that "observance of the CSA standards would become a legal obligation and would be supported by a system of independent oversight." Ian Lawson also recognizes the "unique consensus that is emerging between government, consumers and industry players" and that is reflected in the CSA Model Code. For him, the "higher purpose of the Model Code is for it to be adopted-by-reference as a legislative standard to which the private sector must comply as a condition of using personal information on the information highway." Lawson outlines three possible options for federal regulation based on standards-enforcement. Under his "Light Version", framework legislation is enacted by the federal government with the operating provision that data users must comply with the CSA Model Code by developing an appropriate code that meets the industry standard. The model would rely entirely on the CSA as the monitoring instrument, and embodies no obvious role (beyond moral suasion) for the Privacy Commissioners. Under his "Medium Version", the Privacy Commissioners would be "mandated to receive complaints from consumers relating to the data user's compliance with its code." The Commissioners apply "existing problem-solving techniques, including education, persuasion, and mediation." This then adds a layer of oversight to the CSA Model Code, in addition to any code verification and registration process established through an accredited registrar. It perhaps adds a more coherent and focussed method of redress for the aggrieved individual, and locates overall oversight responsibility within the institutions that have sole responsibility for, and expertise in, the privacy issue. Under Lawson's "Heavy Version", the Privacy Commissioners would not only resolve complaints but would be "empowered to issue orders requiring data users to comply with their codes; disobedience of such orders is a criminal offence." The legislation would also establish civil liability for failure of a data user to comply with its code." Only under Lawson's "Heavy Version" would registration be underpinned by a set of legally enforceable rights, and be subjected to the general oversight of the Privacy Commissioners. Only under this version would a system of data protection be constructed that brings the full range of compliance mechanisms to bear on the problem. The remainder of this paper builds upon Lawson's analysis and addresses in more detail the oversight functions under a system in which the CSA Model Code is referenced in federal and/or provincial legislation. If the law says that any business operating in Canada must comply with the CSA Model Code as a condition for using personal information on the information highway, what further responsibilities and obligations need to be assigned? V. The Oversight Functions A functional approach to policy analysis begins with a statement of the functions that might be performed within any public policy, and only then considers the public and private agencies that might perform them. The discussion at that workshop on March 25th was organized according to the following functions: the receipt, verification and approval of privacy codes; the receipt, investigation and resolution of complaints; enforcement powers; the auditing of organizations; advice on the privacy implications of new technology practices; education and research; and remedies and sanctions. This analysis is organized according to the same framework. 1) The Receipt, Verification and Approval of Privacy Codes There are probably more instruments that can be called "privacy codes" in Canada than in any other society. I have concluded that "almost by default, Canada has become the only country in the advanced industrial world that has begun seriously the process of promoting privacy protection from the bottom up." Codes of practice are, and will continue to be, a feature of privacy protection policy in Canada. The question is, what role should they play under a legislated regime? Peter Hustinx, the President of the Netherlands Registratiekamer (the Dutch Data Protection Authority), has concluded that codes of practice do offer some clear advantages even within a legislated data protection regime. The procedure of negotiating codes enhances the understanding of the privacy problem within different sectors. It also allows his office to gain a better appreciation of the relevant privacy issues and directly to influence the self-regulatory mechanisms. Codes are quite flexible instruments and once negotiated can be adapted to changing economic and technological developments. Codes also allow organizations to publicize their privacy policies and to remove suspicions about the improper collection, processing and dissemination of personal data. They allow an "enhanced measure of understanding on both sides." Similar advantages have been noted by Canadian analyses of the subject. Codes of practice have been developed for a number of different motivations. Peter Hustinx has noted four: to avoid legislation; to anticipate legislation; to implement legislation; and to supplement legislation. The development of a legislative system in Canada would signal a move from the first two incentives, to the second two. Codes of practice should offer detailed guidance to employees in an organization about how to implement the privacy principles contained within the law. Codes should clarify legal obligations without weakening or obscuring the legislative standard. To the extent that this can be achieved, they should continue to play an important role within a Canadian system of personal data protection. There is, however, a difficult problem concerning the relationship between privacy codes of practice and the privacy law. There are three subtly different models that have evolved in those countries that use or countenance privacy codes. The first, and in many ways most stringent, is represented by the system under the New Zealand Privacy Act. The system for negotiating and promulgating codes of practice is spelled out in greater detail in the New Zealand legislation than in any other law. The provisions have also been supplemented by a detailed guidance note from the Privacy Commissioner. Thus, where the Privacy Act specifies the functions of a code, and to whom (or what) a code may apply. The law allows, among other things, for standards that are less stringent than the information privacy principles, as well as for exemptions. The crucial aspect of the New Zealand approach is that codes of practice negotiated under the Privacy Act have the force of law. The statutory force of codes is expressed as follows: Where a code of practice is in force -- a) The doing of any action that would otherwise be a breach of an information privacy principle shall, for the purposes of Part VII of this Act, be deemed not to be a breach of that principle if the action is done in compliance with the code; b) Failure to comply with the code, even though that failure is not otherwise a breach of any information privacy principle, shall, for the purposes of Part VII of this Act, be deemed to be a breach of an information privacy principle. Codes of practice in New Zealand therefore have "teeth." A breach of a ratified code of practice is as serious as a breach of the information privacy principles expressed in the law, which would then trigger the complaints and enforcement procedures in the legislation. Final remedies for such a breach can be obtained from the Complaints Review Tribunal. The Privacy Commissioner subsequently published a "Guidance Note" to explain his understanding of these provisions. He notes that a "code of practice is a legal document. It is enforceable through the Commissioner and the Complaints Review Tribunal (although not usually through) the ordinary courts." The codes might restate the principles and provide for "specific departures, procedures, standards or exceptions. Or a new set of rules can substitute for the principles. Either way there must be a rule or standard against which a complaint can be measured. The purpose of a code of practice is to increase relevance, certainty, precision and clarity, not to substitute some other language which might create uncertainty." Thus far, only three codes have been issued. The first is a comprehensive code for the processing of health information, a fifty-page document that goes through each of the privacy principles and applies them (with commentary) to the health field. The second (produced relatively quickly at the instigation of the Privacy Commissioner) governs the operations of GCS Limited, the government-owned corporation that supplies computer processing services to major government departments. The third was developed in conjunction with the Association of Superannuation Funds. Each is affixed with the "Seal of the Privacy Commissioner" to signify that the code is consistent with the Privacy Act, and was developed in accordance with its procedures. This is the most formal endorsement process in existence in any country. The fact that only three codes have been issued, however, suggests that many associations have been reluctant to devote the necessary time and resources to code development. However, others are currently under development. The second, slightly more flexible regime, exists in the Netherlands. The Dutch system is similar in most respects to that in New Zealand. There is a lengthy and careful process of code negotiation. At the end of the day, however, the codes are not formally binding on the courts. Certainly if an organization can prove that it has met the requirements of its code, then it will have a strong case. Conversely, if a complainant can demonstrate that the provisions of the code have been breached, then this constitutes prima facie evidence of liability under the law. Codes then have indirect, rather than direct, legal effect. However, the Registratiekamer is still expected to give its approval to the code, a process that often has been difficult and contentious. Several key sectors have still to develop codes of practice under this system. Some codes (such as that in the Dutch banking sector) have been rejected. In Britain, thirdly, the Data Protection Registrar is empowered by the Data Protection Act to "encourage trade associations or other bodies representing data users to prepare, and to disseminate to their members, codes of practice for guidance in complying with the data protection principles." Privacy codes had been a feature of the British data protection landscape since the early 1970s. Codes under the 1984 legislation are not "statutory" in this sense, although they do play a significant role in the interpretation of the data protection principles and in the enforcement of the law. The first Data Protection Registrar, Eric Howe, was initially very enthusiastic about the importance of codes within the British data protection regime. In his very first annual report in 1985, he stated: "I have become increasingly convinced that codes of practice will be a valuable assistance to compliance with the data protection principles. Such codes should be positive and practical. They must support and propagate good practice and not simply consist of well intentioned but vague statements." In his Second Report the following year, he outlined a preliminary statement about how codes of practice ought to be developed: "To command respect Codes of Practice must not simply paraphrase the Act or be exhortative -- they must state clear practical actions which are to be followed." The purpose and operation of codes of practice in Britain is still somewhat unclear, however. The former Registrar was generally careful not to "endorse" codes, in the fear that their provisions might come into possible conflict with the legislation. He therefore tended to "welcome" them as offering helpful guidance to employees, thus reducing the need for regular intervention from the staff of the office. He also rejected the notion that detailed statutory codes should be prepared for each sector and that compliance with the codes would replace compliance with the law: "The great effort required to define sectors and develop precise codes in fine detail would, in my view, divert resources from encouraging compliance with the powerful and flexible principles." The negotiation of codes can be time-consuming, and possible conflicts can occur in interpretation with unforeseen consequences. This issue still requires discussion in Britain as a result of the provisions within Article 27 of the EU Directive. Codes of practice therefore have a role under a variety of regulatory conditions. They have also become increasingly popular; they are used most in those countries which have legislated in the 1980s rather than before. The complexities and diversification of personal data processing have produced observed needs for more specific guidance on how the vague and broad fair information principles can be translated into the day-to-day lives of complex organizations. A measure of the increasing interest in codes is the provision within the EU Data Protection Directive: 1) The Member States and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper implementation of the national provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to this Directive, taking account of the specific features of the various sectors. 2) Member states shall make provision for trade associations and other bodies representing other categories of controllers which have drawn up draft national codes or which have the intention of amending or extending existing national codes to be able to submit them to the opinion of the national authority. Member states shall make provision for this authority to ascertain, among other things, whether the drafts submitted to it are in accordance with the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. If it sees fit, the authority shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives. This provision also needs to be read in conjunction with Recital 60: "Whereas Member States and the Commission, in their respective spheres of competence, must encourage the trade associations and other representative organizations concerned to draw up codes of conduct so as to facilitate the application of this Directive." It appears that codes of practice are no longer an optional instrument within European data protection systems. Codes of practice underpinned by a legislative framework obviously embody a greater compulsion that those currently in force in Canada. The role of the data protection agency is more central to code development and enforcement. Moreover, the process of code development can be more valuable than the result. Consultation over codes can ensure that organizations become more familiar with their own practices and more well-versed in their privacy obligations. On the other hand, there is a central dilemma with the use of codes of practice within systems that have a comprehensive data protection law. If they are not formally endorsed by a data protection authority, then they may contain language that conflicts with the wording of the law, and confusion about applicability and enforcement might ensue (as in Britain). If a more formal ratification process is laid out, then (as in New Zealand and the Netherlands) this can lead to the bureaucratization of a process that, in theory, is supposed to allow the flexibility of self-regulation. The advantages of codes of practice are mitigated by some other problems. Submission of codes in some sectors is often hindered by competition within sectors, and by unclear boundaries and overlaps that weaken the claim that the association submitting the code is sufficiently "representative." This has sometimes led to the submission of "codes" which merely recite the legislative provisions, to avoid the work necessary to adapt the law into a practical and detailed set of guidelines. Moreover, codes do not always help the data subject. The relationship between the code and the law is often unclear to someone seeking access and correction of personal data, for example. The data subject also rarely knows the difference between a code which has received the approval of the data protection agency, and one that has not. Finally, under any legislated regime, it is necessary to make a distinction between the Privacy Code, that is the formal expression of policy within business or industry, the set of operational guidelines that are communicated to employees to remind them of their obligations, and the briefer statements of policy designed to give assurances to consumers. To date there has been little consistency in the codification of privacy codes. If these instruments are to have any wider statutory or evidentiary value under a legislated regime, then it will be necessary to distinguish the Privacy Code (with a large 'C') from the other diverse material that is published by business on privacy. 2) The Receipt, Investigation and Resolution of Complaints The Federal Privacy Commissioner's self-declared mission is first "to be an effective ombudsman's office, providing thorough and timely complaint investigation to ensure Canadians enjoy the rights set out in the Privacy Act." Even Commissioners' offices that are not formally established on the "ombudsman model" are expected to receive and investigate complaints from data subjects. All also act as clearinghouses for more routine inquiries about the respective legislation. Principle 10 (Challenging Compliance) of the CSA Model Code states that "an individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with the above principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable for the organization's compliance." One weakness of the CSA Model Code (as it stands) is that complaint resolution mechanisms are largely located within the organization or industry. There are some exceptions: for example, the CRTC accepts complaints about the personal-information handling practices of the telecommunications industry; the CDMA receives complaints about direct-marketing practices. Moreover, complaints also reportedly go to regulatory bodies that have no jurisdiction over privacy. Complaints also go to the institutions with responsibility for privacy, but which have no jurisdiction over the private sector. The current process for the receipt and resolution of privacy complaints is variable and confusing. The complaints resolution function is central to any effective oversight of personal data protection, but it can also be a time-consuming and a significant drain on resources. It is important not to exaggerate the importance of this function for the overall implementation of the privacy principles within the private sector. More pro-active techniques can be far more effective. The system for complaints-handling needs careful consideration and rationalization. Three questions require consideration: Who should be responsible for the receipt of complaints? Who should then investigate complaints and what further powers are necessary to fulfill that function? And what process of complaints resolution is appropriate at federal/provincial levels? (i) The Receipt of Complaints Complaints under a legislated CSA standard would still continue to be resolved principally at the level of the organization concerned. The first principle of the CSA Model Code stipulates the designation of an individual or individuals who shall be responsible for compliance with the privacy principles. Under certain circumstances, trade associations (such as those within the cable or direct-marketing industries) may also play a mediation role. The more credible and effective the complaints resolution at lower levels, the less the need for a complicated regime at governmental levels. Given the fact that complaints resolution is potentially the most time-consuming and least attractive of all the oversight functions that need to be performed, it is appropriate that the Privacy Commissioners should be the avenue of last resort -- the means of redress when resolution within the business, the trade or professional association, or even within a federal or provincial regulatory authority fails. All Canadian legislation gives a complaints-handling role to their respective oversight offices (See Appendix One). This is emphasised more heavily in the Quebec and federal legislation than in that of BC, Alberta and Ontario. Each office has, therefore, developed expertise in this area and can handle complaints about the private sector more efficiently than any other federal or provincial agencies. The filtering of complaints about the private sector will obviously require careful coordination between existing commissioners. Problems of jurisdictional competence can arise when for example the federal Privacy Commissioner receives a complaint about a provincially regulated enterprise. Under these circumstances any federal legislation might have to delegate powers of complaints resolution to the provincial commissioners. A regime needs to be established whereby provincial and federal agencies can cooperate through administrative arrangements to handle complaints at the most appropriate level. (ii) The Investigation of Complaints The more contentious issue is the investigation of complaints and what powers should be granted to allow this function to be performed. Again each provincial agency has powers of investigation vested in them. Normally these include the power to enter premises, to require records to be produced, and to summon the appearance of responsible persons (see Appendix One). These powers seem to be more extensive at the federal level than anywhere else. Under Bill 68 in Quebec, the Commissioner may authorize an entrusted agent to make inquiries on his behalf. Any authorized person may "enter at any reasonable time, the facilities of an enterprise carried on by a person collecting, holding, using or communicating personal information to third persons." This reflects the belief that, as in the public sector, the Commissioner does need powers of on-site inspection if he suspects non-compliance with the data protection principles. The larger question is whether or not the Commissioner be expressly empowered to conduct investigations in the absence of a complaint. Most offices in Canada also have the power to initiate an investigation on their own initiative. Such investigations may result from a pattern of complaints about a particular practice. Complaints tend to highlight concerns of a more general nature. Subsequent investigations would then take on the form of a more systemic "audits" of the personal information practices of an organization and would go beyond the particular grievance of the original complainant(s) (see below). (iii) The Resolution of Complaints The resolution of complaints about privacy may take a number of different forms and may also culminate in binding enforcement order. Canadian privacy legislation already displays a variety of procedures for the resolution of complaints that range from along the continuum of possible policy instruments. The federal Privacy Act is based squarely on the ombudsman approach; complaints are received, investigated and findings and recommendations issued. Under certain circumstances, the Commissioner may apply for review by a Federal Court, if his recommendations are not acted upon. Most of this process, and indeed most complaints at the federal level, relate to the refusal to grant access to personal information. The Federal Commissioner therefore has to rely on conciliation and mediation with the ultimate hope that the willingness to avoid bad publicity will encourage a satisfactory settlement of the complaint. The emphasis on mediation to settle requests for access and correction of personal information is also apparent in the provincial legislation in BC, Ontario and Alberta. Mediation has become a standard operating procedure in the administration of these laws, before the Commissioner conducts an oral or written inquiry. Quebec's Bill 68 also places great emphasis on access to and rectification of personal information. Any person denied access, or who wishes to have personal information deleted from a file, may seek recourse through the Commission d'acces a l'information. A conciliation process may then follow (Sec. 48), after which the Commission renders a decision. Each of these processes for complaints resolution at federal and provincial levels is inherently reactive. It should be remembered, moreover, that these laws also enforce freedom of information obligations. The mediation and inquiry processes are written to deal principally with the refusal to grant access to information (personal or otherwise). These procedures may not translate neatly into a context of private sector compliance with the broader range of fair information practices represented within the CSA standard. Ultimate redress in Canada is normally vested in the courts. Each Canadian law outlines the circumstances under which disputes might be reviewed at the judicial level. Most circumstances for judicial review in the public sector relate to disputes over access requests. There may be an argument for a different review process within the context of private sector compliance. Some other countries have established small tribunals, ad hoc groups of experts that perform a quasi-judicial function. In Britain, for example, the 1984 Data Protection Act establishes a Data Protection Tribunal to which individuals or data users may appeal a decision of the Registrar. This body is constituted from a panel of experts as is necessary. In New Zealand, an aggrieved individual may appeal a finding of the Privacy Commissioner to the Complaints Review Tribunal established under the Human Rights Commission Act of 1977. Thus Tribunals can serve as an avenue of appeal against enforcement decisions (as in the UK) and against the more advisory findings of an agency like the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner. In the Canadian federal context, appeal to a Privacy Tribunal may have a number of attractive advantages. First, the courts are not the ideal institutions to resolve comparatively specialised and technical issues. Moreover, a tribunal process could provide an important way to span the federal/provincial divide. 3) Audit Powers Privacy Commissioners may have suspicions about the personal-information practices of a particular organization that arise from a number of sources. The conduct of general audits of an organization or a technology can be a very effective way to implement fair information practices. Audits are more systemic. And they may be less confrontational than an investigation into the circumstances of a specific complaint. Only in the BC legislation, however, is the word "audit" mentioned, even though other offices have had audit programmes for some time. Audits may be internal or external to the organization. Under some circumstances, an external review of an internal audit might be an effective tool. Some Commissioners (such as the President of the Dutch Registratiekamer) have required audits to be performed by accredited auditors under certain circumstances. The existence of the standard can potentially provide an additional mechanism to extend the investigative process and relieve the offices of the privacy commissioners of some of this investigative responsibilities. If a credible registration process is established, by which businesses may be certified to Q830, the commissioners can simply require registration to the standard, and therein be assured that a verifiable and independent audit program is conducted (see below). 4) Enforcement Powers At the end of the day, the central question arises as to what powers would be given to a Commissioner to order compliance with the privacy protection principles. This is the key distinction between the "medium" and "heavy" versions of standards-enforcement outlined by Lawson above. Here we see a sharp contrast between the federal and provincial approaches. As mentioned above, the federal Privacy Commissioner's powers are generally limited to those of investigation and recommendation. This approach is defended because it avoids the adversarial relationships that arise when enforcement powers are used or threatened. Besides, it is argued that bad publicity for privacy protection can be a more effective sanction against business than it is against government. In contrast, others contend that the ability to negotiate with data users is facilitated by the existence of an enforcement power at the end of the day, even if those powers are rarely used. Moreover, government and business organizations need certainty and consistency in the application of data protection rules. The provision of a formal order-making process assures a greater level of consistency, transparency and accountability over time in the implementation of the law. Most order-making power is related to the release of information in response to access requests. The debate over the appropriate range of powers is invariably conducted with the access and correction rights in mind. However, some provincial commissioners currently enjoy other power that might be more applicable to private sector oversight. The BC Commissioner, for instance, can (independently of the review process): "require a public body to stop collecting, using or disclosing personal information in contravention of this Act; and require the head of a public body to destroy personal information collected in contravention of this Act." The Ontario Commissioner can also "order an institution to, (i) cease a collection practice, and (ii) destroy personal information that contravene this Act." More generally, the Quebec Commission d'Acces "has all the powers necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction; it may make any order it considers appropriate to protect the rights of the parties on any issue of fact or law." Any federal legislation to the CSA standard would need to be drafted with careful consideration of such powers. "Cease and desist" powers found in many data protection laws that cover the private sector. But they are only used as a last resort and with regard to the most blatant contraventions of law. These powers are likely to be less enforceable in the private sector, although there may be an argument for their inclusion as a means to encourage mediated settlements under less adversarial conditions. 5) Advice on the Privacy Implications of New Technologies The foregoing functions are largely reactive. They are performed only after problems arise, complaints are lodged and investigations conducted. The implementation of data protection law is, however, as much an educational effort as a regulatory one. Much can be achieved in anticipation of policy and system development if privacy protection is built in at the outset, rather than "added on" afterwards. All Canadian legislation recognizes this fact, and grants responsibilities to the Commissioners to comment on the privacy implications of proposed legislation or on new automated personal record systems. The Federal Privacy Commissioner is currently empowered to "make a special report to Parliament referring to and commenting on any matter within the scope of the powers, duties and functions of the Commissioner." This function is performed in addition to the regular submission of the annual report. He, and to a lesser extent his provincial counterparts in Ontario and BC, have occasionally commented on privacy issues that fall outside their formal jurisdiction of the public sector. Privacy issues raised by the contracting-out of government services, for example, demonstrate the vague and shifting boundaries between public and private sectors. Moreover, the federal Privacy Commissioner already consults with private sector trade associations on their efforts at self-regulation. It would make sense to formalise this responsibility, granting the privacy commissioners the power to advise on the privacy implications of new information systems in both public and private sectors. The requirement of a privacy impact statement whenever a new technology (such as the Call Display) is introduced can go a long way to anticipate future problems and encourage a consideration of privacy and security issues at the outset. Linked with this, is the advice that may be given about the use of privacy-enhancing technologies. 6) Public Education and Research There is, of course, a fine line between the advisory responsibilities, that are generally conducted in confidence, and the performance of wider educational and research roles. The analysis of wider privacy and surveillance questions and the ongoing education of the general public can do much to anticipate problems and encourage citizens to protect their own privacy. The provincial Commissioners in B.C., Alberta and Ontario are given an explicit statutory obligation to information the public about their legislation. The federal Commissioner, however, has no mandate for public education and therefore no budget for such activities. Successive Commissioners have consistently pointed this out to successive governments without success. He can, however, carry out "special studies" "relating to the privacy of individuals" and has used this power to commission substantial research reports on issues such as drug testing, genetic testing and AIDS. Provincial commissioners may also "engage in or commission research." The Ontario office tends to produce shorter and more frequent research publications on new technologies such as smart cards, electronic mail systems and intelligent transport systems. In conjunction with the Registratiekamer in the Netherlands, the Ontario office has also published a study on privacy-enhancing technologies. Research reports are extremely useful techniques alerting public, government and business opinion to the privacy risks inherent in new technologies. This activity should continue with regard to private sector issues. To a certain extent, this is already occurring. It is important, however, for the education and research function to be explicitly mandated in legislation. These programs can be expensive and require appropriate funding. 7) Sanctions and Remedies Legal sanctions do not play a significant role in the implementation of public sector privacy law in Canada. Each statute does contain a list of various offences. In Ontario, this list includes the willful disclosure of personal information in contravention of the Act, the willful maintenance of a personal information bank that contravenes the Act, making an access request under false pretences, the willful obstruction of an order of the Commissioner, and willfully misleading the Commissioner. In BC and at the federal level, the list of offences is confined to the willful obstruction of the work or orders of the Commissioner. Under Quebec's Bill 68, penal provisions apply more broadly to the illegal collection, processing and communication of personal information. Those in contravention may be liable for a fine of between $1000 and $10,000 (and up to $20,000 for subsequent offences). Civil remedies are also little used. One perennial problem in this area of the law is that of proving that damages have occurred through the wrongful collection and processing of personal information. The fact that the provincial privacy torts have been rarely used is a testament to this. One of the advantages of a statutory framework may be to relieve business of its liability under the common law. It has been suggested that this trade-off may be used to convince industry to accept a more consistent, coherent and predictable policy environment. Nevertheless, there will always be the need for the inclusion of sanctions as a last resort. The CSA standard may indeed have an important role to play in this regard. If the legislation were to give the Commissioners (or indeed the courts) the power to order a registration to the standard, a potentially more effective means of enforcement can be constructed. The costs of registration are passed on to the data user. Moreover, the sanction becomes, not only a fine, but an obligation to change practices, be audited and meet the registration. This technique has been used to enforce environmental regulation, by obliging registration to ISO-14000. There is no reason why it cannot also profitably be used to enforce privacy standards. A process of registration to the standard adds a compliance instrument that is not present within any other data protection regime. The potential to require (by law or regulation) a registration to the standard can relieve privacy commissioners (and other regulators) of expensive and time-consuming compliance monitoring functions. Registration to the standard is also potentially a more effective sanction than a fine. The loss of the CSA "mark" can have real consequences for business. I quote Jason Meyers, chief economist at the Canadian Manufacturers Association: "The prospect of a $50,000 government fine for breaching the law pales in comparison to losing your entire customer base because the firm fails to meet its ISO-9000 requirements." VI. Summary: The Elements of an Oversight System in Canada It is now necessary to summarise the analysis to reach some tentative conclusions about the possible elements of an oversight system for the protection of personal information within Canada's private sector: … Provincial and federal governments need to apply the full range of available policy instruments to the privacy problem: Self-regulatory codes, legislation, privacy-protecting technologies, and better programs for consumer education. These are the policy instruments. They are not mutually exclusive. They all need to be utilized. … The three years of bargaining over the CSA standard represents a crucial stage in the policy-making process. The brokering of a consensus has been completed. Any legislated scheme needs to be based on this established accommodation. … A private sector privacy protection law does not need to be burdensome or overly complicated. Canada should avoid the costly and bureaucratic licensing and registration systems that have been established in some European societies. … On the other hand, law without an effective mechanism for compliance monitoring can be worse than no law at all, and would not be considered "adequate" to meet European standards. … The central oversight agencies should be federal and provincial information and privacy commissioners (where they exist). These offices have established an independence, credibility and expertise. They are uniquely located within the regulatory landscape to oversee private sector legislation, and resolve issues that span the public/private divide. … Any legislated scheme needs to establish a balance of responsibilities for the following functions: complaints resolution and mediation; complaints investigation; audits; advice on the privacy implications of new technologies; the promotion of codes of practice; public education; and research. The most effective remedies may be those that are general in nature and pro-active rather than reactive. … Dispute resolution should be as non-litigious as possible, and should only be provided after all other avenues have been exhausted. Business will want quick and predictable resolution of privacy problems . There may be a persuasive case for a specialized federal/provincial Privacy Tribunal to resolve disputes over private sector issues. … Registration to the CSA Model Code contributes a crucial mechanism for enforcement within any potential regulatory system . Registration to the privacy standard can complement almost any current or future, contractual or regulatory, provincial or federal, sectoral or comprehensive, provisions for personal data protection. It can be used to reward good practice, and to bring the recalcitrants into line. … Privacy codes will obviously continue to play an important role within any legislated regime. The standards-registration process can relieve regulatory bodies of checking and verifying privacy code content. A system that mandates all organizations to develop privacy codes would be unnecessarily burdensome and expensive. Consequently, codes should continue to be developed as a result of market demand and consumer pressure but, only in special circumstances, in response to regulatory fiat. … Overseas experience suggests that codes of practice that enjoy any form of legal status (beyond the evidentiary value) are difficult and time-consuming to negotiate. Privacy codes should be encouraged and they should use the CSA standard as a template. But under a legislated regime, they should not be given an official "seal of approval", nor the power to qualify the provisions of the law. However, compliance with a code approved by CSA may be taken into account by Commissioners and courts in determining whether there has been a breach of the privacy principles. … Experience suggests that sanctions in the form of fines are not a significant inducement toward compliance. Civil remedies are also ineffective because of the difficulty of proving actual damages from the willful mistreatment of personal data. … In the context of private sector oversight, the threat of bad publicity can go a long way to securing compliance with the data protection principles. This incentive is probably a lot higher in the private, than in the public, sectors. The public reporting process is, therefore, crucial within any oversight model. … It may be that the most effective sanction is a regulatory power to order registration to the standard. Thus if a pattern of complaints arose about a particular business, privacy commissioners or the courts could require registration to the standard, triggering the code development and audit process and passing the costs to the data user. Conclusion: Questions for Further Analysis These conclusions are not inconsistent with other recent policy analysis about data protection. They are, however, tentative and incomplete. I conclude with an inventory of some of the complex regulatory questions that still require careful analysis and debate. The consistency of the CSA Model Code with existing Canadian and international privacy provisions? If the principles within the CSA Model Code are to be given the force of law, there clearly needs to be careful analysis of the relationship between the wording of these principles and that within existing privacy legislation, including: the federal Privacy Act, the provincial Information and Privacy Acts, Quebec's Bill 68. In addition, we need analysis of its consistency with other private sector privacy provisions including those within the 1993 Telecommunications Act, the 1991 Bank Act, and the provincial consumer credit legislation. We also require careful comparison of the CSA Model Code with the EU Data Protection Directive. What is the future relationship between the Privacy Commissioners and other federal and provincial regulators? What should be the continuing role of federal regulators such as the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC ) and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI)? The former in particular has been active in regulating uses of new technologies within the telecommunications sector. There is an argument that this regulatory power should not be diluted. At the provincial level, what would be the future role of regulators for insurance and consumer credit? Should the privacy commissioners be empowered to restrict flows of personal data to societies that do not have adequate data protection? One concern of the European data protection authorities is that personal data can flow through societies with "adequate" protection, to those without. Ideally each national data protection law would contain a transborder data flow restriction similar to that within Articles 25 and 26 of the EU Directive. If so, how should this power be exercised in Canada, and by whom? At what point do the fleeting and rapid electronic impulses that characterize international data flows become a matter for Canadian regulation? Will compliance monitoring under the CSA standard be consistent with existing auditing schemes under the public sector legislation? The Quality Management Institute of CSA is currently deciding on the most appropriate registration scheme to Q830. If registration to the standard is to be employed as a compliance monitoring process, we need a consistent audit guide, an accreditation scheme for privacy auditors, an appropriate publicity mechanism, a method to monitor claims made about business policies and practices, and possibly an appropriate symbol or cachet for the "privacy-friendly" business. Privacy commissioners need to have confidence in the registration process if the Model Code is to be employed in the same way as other quality management standards. Can regulatory power be given in statute to require a registration to a standard? This is an interesting innovation and a potentially very effective means of compliance monitoring. But what are the precedents for this power in other fields, such as government procurement, equity policy, environmental policy and so on? If subsequent violations occur within a business that is registered to the standard, who shares the liability for any damages to the data subject? What are the costs of an oversight regime, and by whom should they be borne? Are there opportunities for cost-recovery? Oversight that is coordinated among the existing commissioners, systemic rather than specific, anticipatory rather than reactive, and educational rather than regulatory, is also likely to be more cost-effective. The use of the standards-registration process can also relieve Commissioners and other regulators of much compliance work, and pass the costs onto the data user. What process should be used for federal/provincial coordination? The federal/provincial constitutional question underpins this entire analysis. Little is possible without a cooperative arrangement between the federal and provincial governments on the appropriate legislative process. Lawson outlined six models, in addition to the "paramount national standards model": mirror legislation; jurisdictional abstention; contract; conditional legislation; concurrent legislation; collaborative/complementary model. To the extent that that process can be agreed, the resolution of these oversight and enforcement issues will be facilitated. ____________________ In conclusion, it can be noted that not everything needs to be firmly concluded and nailed down. Legislation is a framework; it needs to be adaptable to changing circumstances. It also needs to be accessible and user-friendly. The more complicated the legislative provisions, the less likely will the law be used as an instrument by ordinary citizens. From this discussion, however, may be emerging a distinctively Canadian approach to personal data protection. This approach emphasizes the use of all instruments within the "toolkit" of privacy protection. It recognizes that voluntary action from the "bottom-up", is just as necessary as regulatory action from the "top-down." And it comprises an innovative combination of the traditional ombudsman approach with the use of the relatively new instruments from the world of standards-setting and certification. APPENDIX 1 Powers granted to Information and Privacy Commissioners in Complaints Investigation and Resolution Federal The Privacy Commissioner has the power: € to summon and enforce the appearance of persons before the Privacy Commissioner and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce such documents and things as the Commissioner deems requisite to the full investigation and consideration of the complaint, in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record; € to administer oaths; € to receive and accept such evidence and other information...whether or not such evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law; € to enter any premises occupied by any government institution on satisfying any security requirements of the institution relating to the premises; € to converse in private with any person in any premises entered..and carry out inquiries within the authority of he Privacy Commissioner; € to examine or obtain copies or extracts from books or other records found in any premises entered...containing any matter relevant to the investigation.

In order to simplify comparisons between them, the responses have been broken down into eight categories. These categories and the relevant number of responses in each are as follows: Medical and Social Research (21); Telecommunications and Technology (12); Individuals (11); Consumer and Privacy Advocates (11); Financial Services, Credit and Marketing Groups (5); Privacy Commissioners (4); Government (4); Miscellaneous (8). Each of the submissions is summarized in regard to general comments on privacy, privacy concerns and various methods of ensuring privacy. Specific proposals and recommendations, stemming from the four main potential approaches set out in the Discussion Paper, are included in each summary, where applicable. These various elements are brought together and summarized in the review itself, which includes conclusions resulting therefrom. WHAT IS PRIVACY? The definition of privacy set out in the Discussion Paper is generally accepted by the great majority of respondents. One of the questions that frequently comes up is "Who owns personal information?". The majority of consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners believe that personal information is owned by the individual. However, most private sector organizations tend to see it as a commodity over which the consumer has varying degrees of control. A number of respondents contend that the right to privacy should be incorporated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, recognizing the difficulty of amending the Charter, they are of the opinion that any amendment to the Privacy Act or any new federal privacy legislation should include a preamble that recognizes the principle of privacy. WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS? The great majority of respondents, including those from the private sector, acknowledge that there is strong and growing public concern about privacy protection on the information highway. This view is corroborated by a number of privacy surveys that have been conducted over the past few years. The most quoted of these surveys are the Ekos survey of 1992, the Equifax survey of 1992 and the poll done by Gallup Canada in 1994. There is considerable concern about freedom from intrusion. Monitoring and surveillance are seen to be the most potentially damaging forms of intrusion. Typical examples include, tracking the whereabouts of an individual by wireless or satellite-based personal communications systems, tracing the market profile of an individual from the "data shadow" cast by a series of transactions, and employee surveillance. Surveillance of E-mail, including the related question of who owns the E-mail message, also is seen as a problem. Monitoring of cellular phone messages by the use of scanners, as well as electronic surveillance in the home, also rate highly. Nevertheless surveillance and monitoring are seen to have some benefits, particularly in the fields of search and rescue, home security and fleet management. It all depends on the uses to which they are put. Lesser forms of intrusion are seen as being more of an annoyance, such as telemarketing which the individual can terminate at will. The protection of personal information is the major concern of the public This is expressed by the lack of control that an individual has over his/her personal information. The use of personal information to create personal profiles of individuals, as well as a perceived lack of security and protection for personal information holdings, also are significant issues. The unauthorized use of the Social Insurance Number (SIN), protection of medical and health information, and cross-border transfers of information are also of great concern to some respondents. Equally, business is concerned that the social and economic benefits of the collection and use of personal information must be recognized. Some journalists and writers fear that the freedom of expression provisions of the Charter could be subverted by unwarranted privacy rules. Mention is also made of the strange ambivalence that occurs within the general public. Very often members of the public believe that it is their right to know all the sordid details of the personal lives of celebrities but would be horrified if the same information was divulged about themselves. The continuing and rapid evolution of technology raises a concern that privacy could become the victim of creeping erosion. Security of stored data is also a significant concern. Nonetheless, there is a growing acceptance of the use of technology, coupled with the benefits it can bring. On the other hand, business is concerned that privacy requirements not be allowed to inhibit the introduction of new technologies. A fair balance is required between the demands of technology development and privacy protection. Some of the foregoing concerns can be attributed to a feeling of lack of knowledge and power on the part of individuals. In particular, they often do not know just who holds information about themselves and they feel vulnerable in the light of well-publicized privacy infractions. Medical and social research, as it relates to the protection of personal information, is a significant issue. By far the greatest number of responses come from medical and social researchers. They are concerned that strict privacy rules could prohibit the long term storage of personal medical and health data and could mandate prior consent for the use of such data, in spite of the very high levels of security provided. If this occurs, much valuable medical and social research, which is directed toward the public good, could be stifled. Examples include, tracking the incidence of fatal diseases such as cancer and heart disease and undertaking studies as the basis for important government decisions in the social policy field. In overall terms, there is a strong belief, expressed by many respondents from all sectors, that if the various concerns of the general public are not alleviated, the information highway will not be used to its full potential. HOW TO ENSURE PRIVACY As a background to potential changes in privacy protection, some respondents provided details of the historical evolution of the development of privacy practices and legislation both in Canada and abroad. It is noted that in Canada, only the federal government and five provinces have legislation to protect personal information held by governments. Only Quebec has legislation governing the protection of personal information in the private sector. At the federal level, some sector specific legislation, governing such areas as telecommunications and financial institutions, makes provisions for the implementation of regulations in regard to the management of personal information. To date, however, regulations have only been implemented in the telecommunications sector. The development of voluntary privacy codes in the private sector also is traced. In the overall scheme of things, these scattered developments are seen as an unsatisfactory patchwork approach. They are confusing and difficult to understand by the average individual and will not address emerging international standards, the dangers of rapidly evolving technologies, or the expectations of the public. International developments are also reviewed. Europe is seen to lead the world, particularly over the last 10 to 15 years. Commencing in 1982, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a set of privacy guidelines. The guidelines contained comprehensive personal data protection principles, coupled with provisions for the restriction of transborder flows of personal data to countries which did not have equivalent protection standards. Relatively all privacy legislation in Canada is based on the principles found in the OECD guidelines. At the present time, the guidelines are being updated into directives by the European Communities (EC) and compliance will be mandatory for all members, once they have been passed by the European Parliament. The most important factor about the proposed directives, from Canada's viewpoint, is that they have the potential to inhibit trade by preventing the flow of personal information, whether in automated or manual form, to countries that do not have adequate data standards. At the present time, it is doubtful that Canada would qualify because it does not have national standards governing the private sector. Privacy developments in the USA also are summarized. The USA does not have national standards applicable to the whole of the private sector, nor does it have legislation covering the public sector which meets all of the provisions of the federal Privacy Act. The Discussion Paper's call for input on principles that should form the basis of effective privacy protection met with a wide range of responses. Most of this input was based on the OECD guidelines. Basic to the arguments of some consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners is the premise that the right to privacy is a basic human right. Stemming from this, is the view that the right to control one's personal information is the most important factor, coupled with the principle of consent. However, some variations of viewpoint exist in regard to the question of consent. Many consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see consent as meaning "informed consent". However, in the private sector consent tends to be seen as "consent", no matter how obtained. Moreover, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners tended to see consent as "opting-in", whereas the private sector sees it as "opting-out". One of the additional principles raised, beyond those contained in the OECD guidelines, is the principle that individuals should not have to pay to maintain basic and existing levels of privacy. Again, there are differences of viewpoint on this issue. Some respondents believe that levels of privacy above the basic level should be paid for, while others maintain that privacy should not be prejudiced by inability to pay. Another principle entails freedom of individuals to choose whether or not to connect to the information infrastructure, to accept or reject services that may affect their level of privacy, and to be free to sub scribe to, and be charged for, only those services they wish to receive. However, they should not suffer reduced levels of service because of their choice. Nevertheless, in overall terms, there is little difference in views. Most respondents support the principles contained in the Canadian Standards Association's (CSA) draft "Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information". Other submissions propose principles that should govern the information highway itself. An emerging problem is seen in the blurring of distinction between information which is resident in the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector. In Europe, this distinction between the public and private sectors, in terms of privacy protection, has been rendered irrelevant by the proposed EC directives. Within the private sector, a further blurring is evident. With the increasing integration of various media on the information highway, the original distinction between the various players, e.g., telephone and cable companies, the press, broadcasters, and marketers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to establish clear boundaries between sectors. Accordingly, the effective establishment of sectoral voluntary codes could become more problematic. The patchwork system of federal/provincial legislation and private sector voluntary codes across Canada is stimulating the call for a "level playing field". Different legislation in different jurisdictions results in "rich and poor" in terms of privacy protection. Some provinces have no legislation at all, while Quebec has legislation covering both the public and private sectors. This could lead to the establishment of "data havens" where companies can locate to avoid privacy protection requirements, thus leading to unfair competition. Therefore, all players are interested in the establishment of a national privacy standard. However, how this is to be done results in different opinions. The main focus of the Discussion Paper centered around approaches to be used in promoting privacy protection in the private sector. Four potential approaches were identified, legislation and regulation, voluntary codes and standards, technological solutions, and education. While there is very little difference in views on the roles to played by the two latter approaches, there is considerable debate on the relative merits of legislation and voluntary codes. The majority of respondents believe that the government needs to take stronger action and establish new legislation. With only two private sector respondents being in favour of legislation, the majority of support for this approach comes from consumer and privacy advocates, privacy commissioners and individuals. The benefits of legislation and regulation are seen as guaranteeing to all Canadians an equal level of privacy protection and providing a legal means of redress, sanctions, complaint and appeal. In addition, such a regime would meet the standards of the EC, thus avoiding potential trade problems. Many suggestions are made as to how this may be accomplished. The preferred method is for legislation to establish a framework for a set of national privacy standards under which private sector codes would operate and be bound. This could be complemented by an independent and impartial administrative body which would enforce compliance, hear complaints, provide redress and deliver sanctions. Suggestions are made that such a system could be based on the Quebec Act. Moreover, lack of bureaucracy, low costs and cost effectiveness are seen as prerequisites. A phase-in period is recommended, together with early consultations with the provinces to harmonize both public and private sector legislation across the country. Other suggestions include amending and updating the federal Privacy Act to bring it into line with the proposed legislation and for the public sector to "clean up its own shop". In effect, it is contended that the federal government must assume a strong leadership role. Meanwhile, opponents of the legislative route point its problems. It is seen as inflexible, incapable of rapid change to accommodate the rapidly evolving technology and marketplace, and possibly inhibiting new initiatives and investment. The time taken to reach a federal/provincial consensus is seen as a problem, as is the fact that it would go against the current trend of deregulation in the global marketplace. Moreover, it would cost more in a period of fiscal restraint. The private sector is generally against legislation. The telecommunications industry, in particular, is against additional legislation for the protection of personal information because it believes that privacy directives issued by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) are sufficient to meet privacy concerns. On the other hand, it is strongly in favour of technology-specific legislation that would make it an offence to intercept radio-based telecommunications and which would generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring radio-based telephones, including cellular phones. Nevertheless, the private sector is not universally against general privacy legislation, provided that it is implemented only after voluntary codes have been given a chance to prove themselves and have been shown not to work. Additional provincial legislation, in the absence of federal legislation, is not seen as viable because it would not lead to uniform standards across Canada. Voluntary codes and standards are mostly favoured by the private sector because of their flexibility and adaptability in meeting the particular needs of different technologies and segments of the marketplace. They are also seen as less costly to operate, can raise the profile of privacy within an organization, and can help to educate consumers. Moreover, they can be national in scope and provide a level playing field within each sector. In addition, they are capable of being made mandatory across all members of a sectoral organization or can be strengthened by peer pressure, compelling competitive interests and consumer demand. The main objection to voluntary codes and standards is that they are just that, "voluntary". Many are not seen as fully responsive to consumer concerns, in that they do not meet the full range of fair information practices and do not have adequate mechanisms for complaint and redress. Also, they are sometimes tailored more to business interests than to consumers' privacy rights. Moreover, they may not meet the "adequate" standards of privacy protection required by the proposed EC directives. This being said, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners are not completely against voluntary codes. They are considered to have an important role to play, because of their flexibility and adaptability, provided they are governed by overarching legislation. In this regard, both the private sector and the consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups strongly support the recent initiatives of the CSA to develop a voluntary privacy code as a national standard. The CSA draft code is being developed by a working committee comprised of representatives of governments, privacy commissioners, consumer and privacy advocates and the private sector. The code, when implemented, could provide a standard against which private sector voluntary codes could be measured and may meet the adequacy provisions of the EC privacy directives. Technological solutions are also seen as having a part to play. Technology can threaten privacy but new developments can now allow privacy protection features to be built in at the outset. In this regard, a number of respondents see the need for privacy impact assessments to be made an essential part of the systems development process. Whether the information highway should be designed to provide high levels of privacy protection and whether it will slow the pace and raise the cost of innovation is also addressed by many respondents. Built in security measures are seen as a key in this regard. New innovations in this area include advanced encryption, the use of smart cards and the implementation of digital technology. Basic protective measures are seen as essential, coupled with additional measures which could be provided at extra cost. Furthermore, it is suggested that the government encourage the development of new protective technologies and provide support for research and development in order to provide new opportunities for Canadian industry. In general, privacy protection measures are not seen as increasing the cost of innovation, provided they are not too excessive. There is a wide variety views on how Canadians can become better involved in the design of potentially privacy-threatening technologies. Avenues already exist, such as involvement in CRTC hearings and participation in the development of new CSA technical standards. However, many in all sectors see the need for more direct involvement at the design stage, provided that it is limited to informal consultations and the provision of advice by such groups as consumer advocates and privacy commissioners. Lack of awareness and confusion on the part of the public are seen as significant problems. Therefore, there is wide agreement that consumer education is essential. Education of employees and businesses on their privacy responsibilities also is seen as necessary. There is a general consensus that both governments and business have a major responsibility in this area. Most businesses indicate commitment and many are already engaged in education programs. As well, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners indicate willingness to become involved, provided that funding and resources are made available. However, it is also recognized that consumers themselves have responsibilities and must also take initiatives in this area. The educational tools available are seen to be many and varied. These range across the publicizing of private sector privacy codes and the CSA code, periodic public awareness campaigns, production of material and brochures aimed at different elements of the public for distribution in information centres and libraries, etc. CONCLUSIONS There is a wide range of real public concerns on privacy matters which, if not addressed quickly, could escalate to the point that the effective functioning of the information highway could be jeopardized. There is a significant divergence of views between the majority of members of the private sector and consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups on the relative merits of legislation and voluntary codes. However, there also is a pragmatic and conciliatory approach to these differences which makes a compromise achievable. No single approach to the resolution of the problems is viable. Therefore, a combination of the approaches outlined in the Discussion Paper is most likely to succeed because they are inter-related and mutually supportive. In order to achieve comprehensive solutions to the various problems identified by respondents, within the minimum possible time frame, a well-coordinated plan should be developed. The following are potential elements of a plan which the Advisory Council may wish to consider. The establishment by legislation of a national framework of privacy standards, probably based on the CSA model privacy code, under which private sector codes would operate and be bound. Revisions to the federal Privacy Act to overcome its current shortcomings, including a revised preamble, provision for the protection and security of personal information, and provision for the establishment of privacy impact assessments within the public sector. Development of a program to reinforce, strengthen and update the application of privacy protection practices within the public sector. Early discussion with the provinces to implement national standards on a country-wide basis. Development of legislation to make it an offence to intercept private radio-based telecommunications, and to generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring radio-based telephones, including cellular phones. Development of a program to systematically promote the development of private sector codes based on the CSA model privacy code. Creation of a joint government/industry program to promote and support the development of privacy protection technologies. Promotion of consultations between industry/government, consumer groups and privacy commissioners on the development of significant and new potentially privacy-threatening technologies and systems. Development of a joint industry/government privacy education program in consultation with consumer groups and privacy commissioners. Establishment of consultations between government and the medical and social research groups to resolve the apparent dichotomy between the protection of personal information and the need to carry out medical and social research necessary to promote the public good. Development by the government of a standard privacy protection clause for all contracts or agreements involving the transfer or exchange of personal information with all institutions outside of government. Issuance of a public announcement after adoption of the plan and ministerial approval. Failure to address the major problems identified by respondents could be followed by increasing public privacy concerns, coupled with avoidance of use of the information highway. Also, it might lead to Canada's privacy protection standards being considered inadequate under the EC privacy directives.WT01-B14-177IA075-000492-B034-21http://www.privacy.org:80/pi/countries/canada/ontario/ 199.34.33.146 19970209035614 text/html 1117HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sun, 09 Feb 1997 03:56:20 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/html Index of /pi/countries/canada/ontario Index of /pi/countries/canada/ontario  Name                   Last modified     Size  Description  Parent Directory       29-Oct-96 17:34      -   ontario_perspective_2..15-Apr-96 01:03    14K   ontario_photo_radar_l..15-Apr-96 01:03     4K   ontario_privacy_acces..15-Apr-96 01:03     6K   ontario_privacy_act.t..15-Apr-96 01:03     7K   ontario_privacy_appea..15-Apr-96 01:03     7K  WT01-B14-178IA075-000492-B034-210http://www.privacy.org:80/pi/countries/canada/report.html 199.34.33.146 19970209035742 text/html 68437HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sun, 09 Feb 1997 03:57:46 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 68264Last-modified: Mon, 15 Apr 1996 05:05:32 GMT Privacy and the Canadian Information Highway TABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Origin of the Discussion Paper Responses Received Basis of Review WHAT IS PRIVACY?

The paper was the first of several discussion documents to be released by Industry Canada on social, economic and technology policy issues. Its purpose was to seek the public's views and to raise the level of debate on privacy issues related to the development and operation of the information highway. Written submissions and/or comments were invited on its contents, including the various options and approaches set out in the paper. Submissions were to be received by December 23, 1993. Copies of the individual submissions are available for viewing, for a period of one year, at the Industry Canada Library, 2nd Floor, Journal Tower South, 365 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa, Ontario, and at the regional offices of Industry Canada in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver. Responses Received The seventy-six responses received cover a wide spectrum of interests and expertise, and range in size from one page to sixty pages. In order to simplify comparisons between them, the responses have been broken down into eight categories to reflect the main affiliation of the respondents. These categories and the relevant number of responses in each are as follows: Medical and Social Research (21); Telecommunications and Technology(12); Individuals (11); Privacy and Consumer Advocates (11); Financial Services, Credit and Marketing Groups (5); Privacy Commissioners (4); Government (4); Miscellaneous (8). The Miscellaneous category is comprised of a labour organization, a standards organization, a telecommunications security company, a journalist, a writer/TV producer, an expert on learning and training, and two international respondents. Summaries of the actual submissions, by category, are contained in Appendix A. Basis of Review Each of the submissions is summarized in regard to general comments on privacy, privacy concerns and various methods of ensuring privacy. Specific proposals and recommendations, stemming from the four main potential approaches set out in the Discussion Paper, are included in each summary, where applicable. These various elements are brought together and summarized in the review itself, which includes conclusions resulting therefrom. WHAT IS PRIVACY? Definition The right to privacy is defined in the Discussion Paper as comprising two elements: the right to be left alone, free from intrusion and interruption; and, the right to exercise control over one's personal information. Both explicitly and by reference to examples, this definition is accepted by most respondents. However in two cases, amendments to the definition are proposed. In the first case, use of the word "interruption" is questioned by one of the technology associations as adding nothing to the concept of privacy because its use suggests that all interruptions - whether welcomed or not - are invasions of one's privacy. Therefore, it submits that the concept of "uninvited" is the key to any notion of privacy intrusion in today's society. The second comment comes from one of the consumer and privacy advocates. In its view, the concept of privacy should be expanded to include the concept of "reputation" (as recognized by the Quebec Charter), in as much as personal information can shape what one thinks of someone. Furthermore, it should also be expanded to include the concept of "dignity" (also recognized by the Quebec Charter), as it relates to one's "informational identity". Who owns personal information? The question of who owns personal information is seen as elemental to privacy rights by some privacy and consumer advocates as well as by the Privacy Commissioner. Their belief that personal information is owned by the individual is perceived as a fundamental premise underlying control over its collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal. Contrary to this view, most of the private sector organizations seem to be more of the view that personal information is a commodity over which the consumer should be able to effect varying degrees of control. However, one technology association likens discussion about the ownership of transactional information as being similar to discussion about intellectual property. Privacy - A Charter Right? A number of respondents, particularly privacy and consumer advocates, believe that the right to privacy should be incorporated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The basis for this view is that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be recognized. However, recognizing the difficulty of amending the Charter, an alternative proposal is that any amendment to the Privacy Act or any new federal privacy legislation should include a preamble that recognizes the principle of privacy. This would be commensurate with a similar provision in the proposed privacy legislation of the European Communities. WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS? Are there real privacy concerns? Confirming the generally accepted view, the vast majority of responses specifically point to a large and growing consumer concern over privacy matters, particularly in regard to the information highway. There is little difference in views in this regard, whether they come from the private business sector, consumer and privacy advocates, privacy commissioners or individuals at large. These concerns are shown to be evidenced by privacy surveys over the last few years and a number of these surveys are specifically quoted. The Ekos survey "Privacy Revealed - the Canadian Privacy Survey" was conducted on behalf of a number of private and public sector organizations in 1992 and is the most oft quoted in the responses. It showed that while 52 percent of Canadians are extremely concerned about privacy, 92 percent expressed at least moderate concern. Moreover, 83 percent strongly believe that they should be asked for their permission before an organization can pass on information about them to another organization, and 71 percent totally agree that privacy rules should apply to both government and business. Also, "there is a pervasive sense that personal privacy is under siege from a range of technological, commercial and social threats". Furthermore, greater concern was expressed about business sector organizations than about public sector organizations. However, as pointed out by some business sector members, the survey also revealed that privacy is of more concern in the abstract. Thus, while Canadians are concerned about controlling their personal information, they are more accepting of its use in specific situations where the purposes and benefits are clearly identified. The 1992 "Equifax Canada Report on Consumers and Privacy in the Information Age" also found that a strong majority of consumers are worried about threats to their privacy. However, an equally strong majority agree that computers give people more convenient access to useful information and services and have improved the quality of life. Moreover, the same majorities responded positively to the use of personal information in setting automobile rates, in approving loans, and in issuing a credit card or establishing credit limits. The report concluded that 62 percent of "Canadians take a pragmatic approach to balancing privacy interests and access to valued consumer benefits, deciding area by area what kind of fair information practices, rules and protection are called for, and who should apply them". In 1994, a poll done by Gallup Canada for Andersen Consulting on "What Canadians Think About the Information Highway" indicated that, while 67 percent of Canadians thought that the information highway was a good idea, 83 percent were very or somewhat concerned about how the highway might affect their privacy. However, contrary to the views expressed in this survey, a 1993 Decima Research survey found that 70 percent of respondents thought that society is relying too much on technology and 61 percent thought that technology makes things more complicated instead of simpler. In the 1994 TELUS Longwoods survey 39 percent of respondents felt that they would be so concerned about privacy invasions that they probably would not use the information highway. These findings are reinforced and renewed by the fact that almost all of the comments received from individuals related to concerns about the protection of personal information and freedom from intrusion. The extent of concerns is very broad, ranging across freedom from intrusion, protection of personal information, lack of knowledge and power, and technology. Concerns re Freedom from Intrusion These concerns are related to the right to be left alone. Although the Discussion Paper lays great emphasis on a discussion of the four approaches which might alleviate privacy concerns related to the protection of personal information, considerable concern is also expressed by respondents on the issue of uninvited intrusion. These concerns are equally expressed by both the business sector and the consumer sector, and may be divided into two broad areas. The first area involves monitoring and surveillance and the second involves unwanted or annoying intrusions into a person's time. Monitoring and surveillance is seen to be by far the most annoying and potentially damaging intrusion and many examples are given. A typical example is the "electronic leash" created by the enhanced tracking capabilities inherent in wireless or satellite-based personal communications systems whereby, in the absence of effective controls, the actual location and movements of an individual can be tracked in an unauthorized manner. Also, the "data shadow" cast by an individual in a series of transactions on the information highway, can be assembled into a pattern which will allow a profile to be developed of an individual's lifestyle, personal habits, and buying power and preferences. Employee monitoring, whether by video surveillance or electronic productivity monitoring, is also seen as a significant issue. Surveillance of E-mail, whether by employers or outside sources, is both a concern and, in regard to employer monitoring, has caused an active debate as to whether the employer has the right to monitor personal messages sent by E-mail. A most vociferous concern re surveillance and monitoring relates to the use of scanners to intercept cellular or other radio-based private communications. This concern is expressed both by the consumer sector and the telecommunications sector, as is the recent issue over call blocking of name display telephone services. Finally, surveillance at home is also seen as a potential problem in the light of proposed systems which will allow the provision of security services by electronic means, electronic monitoring of consumption and service by utility companies, and interactive multimedia services on TV and home computer systems. Nevertheless, surveillance and monitoring are not seen as totally negative. Their significant benefits are recognized in the fields of home security, search and rescue, commercial fleet management, etc. It is all a question of the uses to which monitoring and surveillance are put. Unwanted or uninvited intrusions into a person's time are also seen as a concern but, as evidenced by responses to polls and from respondents, not to the same degree as monitoring and surveillance. While the former is seen as an annoyance, the latter is seen as potentiality threatening. However, telemarketing is deemed to be more of an intrusion than ad-mail, although the recent CRTC decision banning the use of automatic dialing-announcing devices (ADADs) for commercial solicitation and restricting the hours during which "live" telemarketing can occur should do much to alleviate the problem. In any event, the consumer usually has the ability to terminate the intrusion at will.Concerns re Protection of Personal Information A perceived inability to control access to and the use by others of an individual's personal information is seen as the major privacy concern. Allied to this is the unauthorized marketing of personal information. These concerns are equally recognized by business organizations, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners. It is also the concern most frequently expressed by individuals. The unauthorized use of transactional data and the compilation of personal profiles by the matching and linking of personal information are significant issues. Whether they take place as a result of involvement in credit card, direct marketing or banking transactions, etc., or as a result of obtaining medical services, all are seen as being major areas of concern. Lack of adequate security and protective measures is also worrisome. This can be due to lack of knowledge or laxity on the part of employees of the organization holding the personal information or to lack of built-in or established security/protective measures. A number of specific issues related to particular types of personal information are also evident. Of these, use of the Social Insurance Number (SIN) and the protection of medical and health information are the most important. Lack of control on the use of the SIN by both the private sector and by those elements of the public sector which do not have specific authorization for its use are seen as a concern in a number of responses from individuals. Also, the protection of medical and health information related to individuals is seen as particularly sensitive. Concerns in this latter regard come not only from individuals, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners but also from the private sector and the medical research community. Another area of general concern is the issue of cross-border transfers of personal information. Here, the worry is that personal information will no longer be subject to national or provincial jurisdiction and therefore may not be capable of being protected. Seemingly contrary to these concerns, is the concern that the business, economic and social benefits of the collection and use of personal information must be recognized. Business benefits are expressed in terms of the extension of markets and the ability to provide new and better services. Economic benefits are seen as the ability to provide additional employment in such areas as the direct marketing industry, while social benefits are seen to include law enforcement, medical and social research as well as the ability to implement consumers transactions in a more effective, efficient and less costly manner. Not only is this concern expressed by the business community and medical and social researchers, but the benefits also are recognized by consumer and privacy advocates as well as privacy commissioners. Two journalist/writers express fears that privacy initiatives could restrict access to large numbers of records, even though anonymized. This could prejudice the freedom of expression provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Some private sector organizations are concerned that network providers may be seen as the information highway's privacy police. In this regard, a number of respondents agree that this would be an impossible task and that privacy measures should focus on the information providers who interact on the highway. Also, there is concern that it should be recognized that consumers also have a responsibility in the protection of their own privacy. On the matter of privacy in general, a few respondents have noted the strange ambivalence that occurs within the general public. While supporting the need for the adoption of strong privacy principles, particularly when they themselves are directly affected, many are not so concerned when their fellow citizens are affected. This is expressed in the call for information about the whereabouts of convicted criminals who have served their sentences, e.g. rapists and child molesters, the hunger for details of the personal lives of public figures as published in the tabloids, and the support for using new technologies to root out fraud and abuse, eliminate waste and duplication, and streamline inefficient bureaucratic procedures. Concerns re Technology The continuing and rapid evolution of technology, coupled with the benefits it can bring, raise a concern that privacy could become the victim of creeping erosion. It is not so much the actual applications of technology that cause the greatest concern but the fact that privacy may be left behind or overlooked in the "onslaught of technology". Coupled with this, is the equal concern that privacy safeguards are too often not "built-in" to the development of technology but are "bolted-on" as a later and perhaps ineffective appendage. In spite of these concerns, it is acknowledged that there is a growing public acceptance of the use of technology. This is illustrated by the use of automated banking machines (ABMs), the Interac direct payment service, personal computers, modems, the Internet, electronic tax filing, etc. However, a contrary concern, particularly on the side of the business sector, is that privacy concerns or requirements may inhibit the development of new and innovative technologies. Therefore, they see a fair balance as being required between the demands of technology development and privacy protection requirements. Concerns Based on Lack of Knowledge and Power Some of the foregoing concerns can be partially attributed to a perceived lack of knowledge and power on the part of consumers. Individuals become frustrated because they are not aware of exactly what technology can do and therefore may have little understanding of the privacy implications that may be involved. Equally, they feel powerless in many circumstances, particularly because they do not see any effective means of redress for privacy related complaints against the private sector. Specific concerns in this area relate to the fact that very often individuals have absolutely no knowledge of just who might hold information about them. Moreover, they feel vulnerable because of the well publicized cases where privacy infractions or problems have not come to light until well after the fact. Medical and Social Research By far the greatest volume of responses to the Discussion Paper came from the medical and social research community. While fully endorsing the need for protection of personal information, almost unanimous concern is expressed about the potentially negative effect of proposed protection measures on medical and social research. The types of research involved include studies on the continuity and effectiveness of health services, the use of multiple prescription drugs by the elderly, the incidence of serious and fatal diseases such as cancer and heart disease, the outcomes of therapeutic procedures and drugs, environmental effects on health, how families and individuals respond to the changing social and economic environment, etc. This research has important public benefits related to the improvement of health in the community and the ability to make effective decisions in the health and social policy fields. The actual concern revolves around the fact that if Canada adopts identical principles to those included in the draft EC privacy directives it is believed that the ability to carry out essential research in the public interest could be stifled. The reason is that no exemptions are provided in the EC directives regarding prior consent to the collection and use of personal information, and for the retention of personal information only for as long as it is required for its initial purpose. Therefore, the prohibition of long term storage would make it impossible to track case histories over a lifetime, and the need to obtain consent would present prohibitive logistical and cost barriers. The submissions from the medical research community provide great detail on the security measures taken to protect personal information. These include: anonymization of personal data by the use of scrambling techniques; locked research areas; computer security systems; oaths of secrecy; approval and enforcement of project protocols by university and provincial bodies; structural separation of research from administrative functions; etc. Also, none of the respondents is aware of confidentiality ever having been breached. Moreover, the focus is not on individual patients but on groups or populations of patients. Therefore, they consider that there is no justification for applying the same restrictions concerning consent, use and retention of data held for research purposes as is proposed for data held for other purposes in the public and private sectors. As one researcher put it " Are we inventing a cure for which there is no disease?". In overall terms, there is a strong belief, expressed by many respondents from all sectors, that if the various concerns of the general public are not alleviated, the information highway will not be used to its full potential. HOW TO ENSURE PRIVACY? The Canadian Experience Some of the submissions touch on the Canadian experience with privacy legislation, regulations and voluntary codes, by way of background to the current situation. Only six jurisdictions are shown to have effective privacy legislation covering the public sector, i.e. the Federal Government, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. Whereas, only Quebec has legislation governing the private sector. Other federal legislation also has provisions related to privacy. The Telecommunications Act has provisions to protect the privacy of individuals, including the regulation of unsolicited communications. Also, amendments to the Criminal Code and the Radiocommunication Act now forbid the divulgence of intercepted radio-based telephone communications. Furthermore, the new Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act and Trust and Loan Companies Act permit regulations to be made governing the use of information provided by customers. In addition, all English speaking provinces, with the exception of New Brunswick and Alberta, have some form of legislation protecting consumer credit information. At the federal level, there is very little protection of privacy by formal regulations. Recent decisions of the CRTC have restricted the use of ADADs and limited the use of junk facsimiles and live voice calls for solicitation purposes. In addition, it has prohibited the use of pre-recorded or computerized calls for solicitation purposes and has made clear that telephone companies can, on two days notice, cancel the service of ADAD users who violate this provision. In approving "name display service", it has also directed telephone companies to provide free per-call blocking of the display on a universal basis. Finally, it has indicated that it will not grant speedy approval to competitive filings of telephone companies if those filings raise privacy concerns. Under the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act and Trust and Loan Companies no regulations have as yet been established in regard to the use of customer information. In the private sector, a number of industry associations and businesses have instituted voluntary privacy codes. In the telecommunications industry, the then Minister of Communications issued a set of six "Telecommunications Privacy Principles" in 1992. They were to be implemented by a Telecommunications Privacy Protection Agency made up of representatives of industry and consumer groups. However the Agency never got of the ground for a number of political, economic and practical reasons. The Canadian Direct Marketing Association (CDMA), the Canadian Bankers Association, and Stentor have all issued privacy codes for their members. The cable industry also has embedded privacy principles within a general set of industry standards that is administered by the independent Canadian Cable Television Standards Council. In addition, a number of individual companies have developed there own voluntary privacy codes. In summary, however, in spite of the considerable effort put in to these initiatives, many respondents see this as a patchwork approach which is confusing and difficult to understand by the average individual. Nor will this approach address emerging international standards, the dangers of rapidly evolving technologies, or the expectations of the public. International Experiences Many respondents see international experiences as being the root from which Canadian privacy endeavours have grown and as a model upon which future endeavours can be based. In the 1970s many European countries had adopted privacy legislation which often was incompatible among the various countries. Accordingly, the OECD issued a set of guidelines in 1982 on the "Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Information" for adoption by its members. These guidelines which established basic privacy principles, also provided for restriction on the transborder flow of personal information to countries which did not comply with equivalent privacy protection principles. Much of the public sector privacy legislation in Canada is based on the principles in the OECD guidelines. However, although Canada acceded to the guidelines in 1984, the effect of the restriction of transborder data flow provisions has been negligible because of their voluntary nature. Subsequently, in 1990, the EC drafted privacy directives on the "Protection of Individuals in Relation to the Processing of Personal Data", which are aimed at harmonizing all European data protection legislation to offer common and high levels of protection in order to facilitate trade. The directives will have the force of law if passed by the European Parliament. The latest draft of the directives, which build on the OECD guidelines and principles, take into account practical difficulties experienced with the OECD guidelines and somewhat reduce the rigidity of the earlier provisions. Thus, transborder data flows are allowed to countries which have adequate, rather than equivalent, data protection measures. More importantly, they provide for the protection of personal privacy as a basic human right, cover both the public and private sectors and apply to both automated and manual records. Since the 1970s the United States has, at the federal level, passed various pieces of privacy related legislation ranging from a general Privacy Act to sectoral specific legislation covering such areas as credit reporting, computer fraud and privacy in electronic communications. However, none of this legislation covers the protection of personal information across the whole of the private sector. Indeed, in 1977 the Privacy Protection Study Commission explicitly rejected an omnibus private sector data protection law on the European model. It favoured a combination of legislation and non-statutory codes that would be sector specific and thereby more sensitive to the different information-handling practices and the needs of different industries. Moreover, the US legislation has neither oversight provisions nor data protection boards or privacy protection commissions. More recently, however, new studies have commenced in the USA in regard to privacy on the information highway. Similar to this current study by the Advisory Council, they are being undertaken by the National Information Infrastructure (NII) Privacy Working Group, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). New draft general privacy principles have been developed by the NII and a discussion paper has been issued by the NTIA for comment. In addition, new Telecommunications Bills before Congress also deal with telecommunications-related privacy concerns. A number of respondents also favourably review privacy experiences in other countries such as Holland, Great Britain, New Zealand, Hong Kong, etc. Privacy Principles The response to the Discussions Paper's request for comments on the principles that should form the basis of effective privacy protection has been met by a wide range of responses. Therefore, the specific responses are included, where applicable, in each of the summaries of submissions received, as set out in Appendix A. However, some common threads are discernible. Basic to the arguments of some privacy and consumer advocates and privacy commissioners is the premise that the right to privacy is a fundamental human right. Stemming from this, is the view that privacy is too important to be left to the whims of the marketplace and therefore privacy protection should be seen as an integral and necessary part of doing business. The ability of individuals to control their personal information is perhaps seen as the major privacy issue. Such control extends to collection, subject to statutory requirements, as well as to use and disclosure in accordance with fair information practices. An essential element of control is the question of consent. However, this has different interpretations in different sectors. Generally, the consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see this as "informed consent". This is interpreted to mean a clear understanding of the reasons for the collection of information and the uses to which it will be put, and being free from any form of "coercion". Many in the business sector also appear to subscribe to the concept of "informed consent" while not defining it in that manner. Whereas others tend to see consent as being deemed to have been given by the entry into a transaction. Also, whereas privacy and consumer advocates and privacy commissioners see consent as being given by "opting-in", the business sector prefers the concept of "opting-out". Other principles, based in large measure on the OECD guidelines and the provisions of the federal Privacy Act, include: identification of the purposes of collection; limiting collection to information which is necessary for those purposes; ensuring that personal information is as accurate and up to date as is necessary for those purposes; allowing access by individuals to their personal information, including correction where necessary; and, providing mechanisms for complaints and redress. Some additional principles have arisen in recent years due to advances in technology and the changing marketplace. These include the requirement for the protection of personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, and the principle that individuals should not have to pay to maintain basic and existing levels of privacy. Related to this latter aspect, there are some differences of viewpoint. Some maintain that consumers should pay for enhanced privacy above the basic level, whereas others maintain that privacy should not be prejudiced by inability to pay. Another principle entails freedom of individuals to choose whether or not to connect to the information infrastructure, to accept or reject services that may affect their level of privacy, and to be free to subscribe to, and be charged for, only those services they wish to receive. However, they should not suffer reduced levels of service because of their choice. In overall terms, there are not significant differences in views relating to privacy principles between, on the one hand consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners, and on the other hand the business sector. Both groups show strong support for the privacy principles included in the CSA draft model code which are, in the main, equivalent to those set out above. Some of the submissions also advance principles that should govern the development of the information highway, particularly as it relates to privacy issues. These include the principle that privacy measures must be compatible with the dynamic and often unpredictable evolution of the highway, and that the protection of privacy on the highway must be balanced with the rights of creators to know who is using their intellectual property. The Public and Private Sectors Some of the consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see a relatively new and emerging problem in relation to privacy on the information highway. This is seen as a blurring of the distinction between information which is resident in the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector. Therefore, contracting-out of more and more public functions to the private sector is expected to have an increasing effect on the privacy practices of the private sector. As personal information in the public sector is passed to the private sector for the fulfillment of these contracts, the public sector will no doubt ensure that its privacy protection obligations are made part of those contracts. In addition, the increasing matching of public sector information with private sector information, such as the matching of data on welfare recipients with bank or financial information to ascertain eligibility, also are seen to narrow the gap. Likewise, in an evolutionary sense, the continued efforts of privacy commissioners and the press in bringing privacy issues to the fore will also have a spillover effect. In fact, one international respondent believes that the abandonment of the distinction between the public and private sector in the latest draft of the proposed EC privacy directives reflects the fact that the increasing flows of personal information between those sectors renders the distinction irrelevant. Within the private sector alone, further blurring is seen between the individual industries using the information highway. Because of integration of the various media and technologies in a "seamless web", the former clear distinction between telephone companies, cable companies, broadcasters, the press, marketers, etc., is increasingly ceasing to exist. This leads to difficulty in determining where one sector ceases and another commences. Therefore, a potential problem is seen in establishing privacy protection on a purely sectoral basis. A Level Playing Field Reference has been made earlier to the patchwork of federal /provincial legislation and regulations, as well as the multitude of different private sector codes across both Canada and all sectors of the marketplace. This results in concerns arising in both private sector groups and the consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups. The problem seen by some members of all of these groups is that if a national privacy standard is not established across Canada, privacy inequities will continue to occur between different individuals, based on both their respective geographical location and the respective business organizations with which they do business. Moreover, some business organizations may be able to achieve discriminatory and unfair marketing advantages. Failure to create a level playing field could possibly lead to the creation of "data havens," whereby the most lenient jurisdictions may attract businesses that seek to evade privacy protection measures Also, artificial legal distinctions would have to be made about where data is "located" when it travels the highway. Legislation and Regulation By far the greatest debate and difference in views occurs in regard to whether the preferred approach to privacy protection rests with legislation and regulation or with voluntary codes and standards. Each of these views has its supporters and detractors for a wide variety of quite valid reasons. The majority of respondents who addressed this issue believe that the government needs to take stronger action to protect the privacy and security of information. While acknowledging the differences in federal/provincial jurisdictions and the difficulty of harmonizing approaches between them, most of the respondents who seek stronger measures believe that additional legislation and regulation, covering both the public and private sectors, is essential. In addition, the 1992 Ekos privacy survey revealed that "compared to a model of pure voluntary self-regulation by business, Canadians strongly prefer a governmental legislative response". The reasons why legislation and regulation are seen to be required cover a wide range. It is perceived to be the only way to establish a level playing field across Canada and to guarantee an adequate level of privacy protection for the public, free of confusion and regional and sectoral inequities. Moreover, there is a risk that transborder flows of data could be prejudiced if privacy protection measures are not deemed to be adequate under the proposed EC privacy directives. National legislation and standards would meet this requirement. Furthermore, equal legislated national privacy standards for both the public and private sectors would do much to negate the concern related to the blurring of the distinction between information which is resident in the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector. As one consumer advocate indicated, there has been enough discussion and evidence of the inadequacy of voluntary codes over the last ten years that the government must act now and be seen to take a leadership role. Reinforcing this view, is the observation that Canada is one of the few western type democracies that does not have legislation covering both the public and private sectors. The manner in which legislation and regulation can be implemented also covers a wide spectrum. Starting with the public sector, there are suggestions that the government should "clean up its own shop". As a start, there should be amendments to the Privacy Act. A preamble to the Act would clearly establish the principle that privacy is a fundamental right (this is also seen as a requirement in any additional legislation governing the private sector). There should be a provision for the protection and security of personal information. The undertaking of privacy impact assessments as part of the design process of all new or major revisions to government systems and programs would become mandatory. Finally, a process would be established whereby a standing parliamentary committee would hold hearings on the Privacy Commissioner's Annual Report and the annual reports of government departments, similar to the manner in which the Public Accounts Committee reviews the Auditor General's Report and the public accounts of individual departments. In addition, a number of respondents call for the government, in assuming a leadership role, to legislate privacy requirements on organizations that fall within the federally regulated private sector and to take all other means within its control that would promote the adoption of privacy measures by the private sector. In regard to legislating privacy in the private sector, supporters of the proposal tend to favour the establishment, by legislation, of a national framework of privacy standards under which private sector codes would operate and be bound. This would be complemented by an independent and impartial administrative mechanism which would enforce compliance, hear complaints, provide redress and deliver sanctions. A number suggest that such a system could be based on the Quebec Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector which is the only privacy legislation governing the private sector in Canada. However, such a view is not unanimous. One private sector institution believes that the Quebec Act does not achieve a balance between the protection of privacy and the free circulation of information which is so necessary in a market economy. However, another indicated that the Act had had little impact on its policies and procedures although it was viewed as "overkill" in some respects. It is also recognized that such legislation would have to be both framed and implemented in the most non-bureaucratic and cost-effective manner possible. This view is reinforced by one British respondent who states that the data registration provisions of the UK Data Protection Act are largely ignored because they are too bureaucratic and fairly meaningless. Also, it is suggested that any legislation should have a phase-in period in order to avoid economic upheaval in areas such as the direct marketing industry which employs thousands of Canadians. Other suggestions for such legislation include provision for "whistle blowing" against organizations engaged in illegal activities, and the recognition of joint culpability on the part of both senders and receivers. Furthermore, the government is urged to quickly enter into discussions with the provinces with a view to harmonizing both public and private sector legislation across Canada. Opponents of legislation and regulation see a number of problems in taking the legislative route. Legislation is seen as too blunt an instrument which would be inflexible and be incapable of reacting to the accelerating changes and needs of both technology and the marketplace. Moreover, it is also seen as being capable of inhibiting new initiatives and prejudicing investment in these areas. In this regard, the fact that business requirements and technologies differ from one sector to another would only compound the problem. The time it would take to secure agreement between the federal and provincial jurisdictions also is considered to be a major factor against legislation. Furthermore, some believe that voluntary codes and standards are only in their infancy and have not yet been given a chance to prove themselves, therefore legislation should only be used as a last resort. Legislation and regulation also are seen as going against the current trend to deregulation in the global marketplace, as requiring additional public funding in a time of fiscal restraint, and as possibly leading to "micro-management" of the marketplace. In general terms, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners favour legislation, whereas the private sector is against it. However the picture is not completely black and white. One technology association supports legislation in order to guarantee consistent and appropriate levels of privacy protection. Whereas, a telecommunications company believes that the regulated telecommunications industry should be exempted from any future legislation because it is already governed by the privacy provisions of the Telecommunications Act. Other private sector organizations would not be against legislation if it was shown, after a reasonable period of time, that voluntary codes and standards were not working, provided that it recognized marketplace realities. However, the radio-telecommunications industry is strongly in favour of technology- specific legislation. It believes that the government should move quickly to pass legislation to make it an offence to intercept radio-based telecommunications and to generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring radio-based telephones, including cellular phones. In regard to the question as to whether adequate privacy protection can be provided through provincial or sectoral legislation, there are somewhat conflicting views. However, there seems to be general acceptance that such a course would not be sufficient by itself. Strong opponents of legislation are opposed to it whether it be federal, provincial or sectoral, while others agree that, if legislation is to be enacted, it must be based on national standards in order to ensure a "level playing field. There is equal concern about "balkanization" occurring coupled with the establishment of "data havens". In summary, in any move towards legislation, discussions and coordination with the provinces are considered to be essential. Voluntary Codes and Standards The main benefits of voluntary codes and standards are seen to be their flexibility and adaptability. It is pointed out that different sectors are engaged in different business practices and utilize different technologies. Therefore, flexibility allows them to customize their privacy practices to the specific nature of the business and to the needs of their customers. Also, they can more quickly adapt and be more sensitive to changes in business practices, as well as to evolving technology and consumer privacy concerns. Moreover, regular reviews can be undertaken to assess the effects of changing circumstances. Voluntary codes also can be national in scope, providing a level playing field across individual sectors, thus avoiding the problems of different federal/provincial jurisdictions. Additional advantages are also linked to the fact that they can be less costly to operate and responsibility and costs can be focused within the organization. Furthermore, they can raise the profile of privacy within an organization and help to educate the public, thereby building the confidence of consumers while allowing them to fully participate in the benefits of the information highway. Voluntary codes and standards can be implemented in many ways, each tailored to the particular needs of a sector. They can be made mandatory on the members of a given sectoral association, as with the Canadian Direct Marketing Association code, or they can be incorporated in the confidentiality Terms of Service approved by the CRTC, as with the regulated carriers governed by the Telecommunications Act. In addition, the adoption and implementation of voluntary codes can be made necessary by peer pressure, compelling competitive interests and consumer demand, whereby consumers will "vote with their feet" if they are not satisfied that their privacy concerns are being met. One of the most significant developments in voluntary codes at the present time is seen as the CSA draft model privacy code which is strongly supported not only by the private sector but also by consumer and advocacy groups and privacy commissioners. It contains ten principles for the protection of personal information (see Appendix B) which are based on the OECD guidelines. Its main advantage is that it is being developed by a consensus of views emerging from the CSA Technical Committee on Privacy, which is made up of representatives from governments, privacy commissioners, privacy and consumer advocates, labour, and the private sector. Also, it could be the basis for a national standard against which other voluntary codes could be measured. Equally, it could provide a standard against which the international community could judge the adequacy of Canada's personal information protection practices. However, the manner in which it can be implemented is still under study. The main objection to the use of voluntary codes is that they are voluntary and, like chains, they are only as strong as their weakest links. Moreover, they are sometimes only half measures which are not fully responsive to consumers privacy concerns, in that they do not always include the full range of fair information practices. Often they do not include provisions for independent arbitration, provisions for monitoring and measuring performance, provisions for sanctions and penalties, or adequate provisions for complaint and redress. Furthermore, they sometimes lack effective administration at the corporate and sector levels, and may be tailored more to business practices than to the protection of privacy. Also, their coverage within a sector may often be inadequate and inconsistent. Consumers may lack awareness of the existence of voluntary codes and often have little input into their development. Finally, they may not meet the "adequate" standards of privacy protection required under the EC draft directives. Although most of the support for voluntary codes and standards comes from the business sector, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see voluntary codes and standards as having an important role to play, provided they are governed by overarching legislation. In reaching this view, they are cognizant of the shortfalls of legislation, e.g., rigidity, the time taken to implement, etc., as well as the benefits of voluntary codes, e.g. flexibility, responsiveness to particular needs, etc. In this sense, voluntary codes are seen as being a first step towards data protection, as being deserving of legislative back-up if they are to be really effective, and as being an acceptable part of the solution if they can be demonstrated to work. The fact that they can help to raise employee awareness, is also acknowledged. Furthermore, some members of the consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups suggest that they can help industry to "get up speed" before legislation is introduced and, in doing so, can guide legislative drafters on sector specific issues and means of implementation. Technological Solutions There is general agreement that technological solutions have a part to play. While many maintain that the accelerating pace of technology is a threat to privacy, it is also acknowledged that new developments in technology can now allow better privacy protection features to be built in from the outset. This latter factor is seen as being very important; supporting the view that before new technology and systems are developed, privacy impact assessments should be built in as an essential part of the development process. In fact, one respondent has developed a step by step process as to how this can be accomplished and another provides suggested rules for evaluating the privacy impacts of emerging technologies. While many see such impact assessments as adding to the cost of new systems and possibly delaying their development, others see them as possibly avoiding future costs by eliminating expensive retrofits to incorporate privacy protection functions at a later date. Here, the need to add free call-blocking as a requirement for the introduction of name-display by the telephone companies is given as an example, as is the abandonment of the Lotus Marketplace: Households product. The question of whether the information highway should be designed to provide high levels of privacy protection and whether it will slow the pace and raise the cost of innovation is also addressed by many respondents. Built in security measures are seen as a key in this regard. Generally speaking, it is acknowledged that there is a clear responsibility for basic protective measures. However, these measures should be proportionate to the privacy issues associated with each particular application. For instance , the Internet requires little built-in protective measures, whereas banking transactions and access to medical records require a high degree of protection. Between these two extremes, various levels of protective measures could be instituted, with the consumer having freedom to choose, sometimes at added cost. Beyond the normal protective measures, such as the use of access codes, new developments in encryption, such as "public-key" encryption, and the use of smart cards are seen as additional measures. Also, the implementation of digital technology is seen as a significant contribution. Furthermore, it is suggested that the government encourage new technology in this area and support research and development in order to provide new opportunities for Canadian industry. On the question of whether such measures will be more costly or will inhibit innovation, the prevailing view is that this will not occur provided that such measures are not too excessive. However, as one privacy commissioner suggests, the costs, in terms of loss of human dignity and autonomy, are too great not to require high levels of privacy to be built in. In the final analysis, the private sector recognizes that if consumers do not have confidence that the highway will protect their privacy interests, it will not be used to its fullest extent. On the question of how Canadians can become better involved in the design of potentially privacy-threatening technologies and services, there is a wide variety of views. It is pointed that, at the present time, consumers already have the opportunity to become involved. CRTC hearings on the introduction of new regulated telecommunications services is given as one instance. Participation and advice on the development of new CSA technical standards is given as another. Nonetheless, there is strong support from consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners for public participation in the development of all significant new and potentially privacy threatening systems. Two private sector organizations also support public participation on the basis that consultation can forestall delays and possible litigation. An example is given in relation to the current debate on whether fibre optic services should go right into the home or whether they should terminate 100 metres away and then be transmitted by wireless communication. The latter option is less costly but is fraught with privacy protection implications. In any event, advance consultations with consumers and/or privacy commissioners are seen as potentially beneficial to private business, as long they are relatively informal and not the subject of long drawn out public hearings. Consumer Education There is wide recognition of a lack of awareness and confusion among the public in regard to the benefits and services that are and will be available on the information highway. This is coupled with an equal lack of awareness concerning their privacy rights, how to obtain those rights, the consequences of providing personal information, and the protective measures which are available. This leads to vague but real concerns which could prejudice the success of the information highway. Therefore, there is widespread agreement that education of the public on these matters is both essential and urgent in order to reduce concerns and because of the rapid growth of the highway. In addition, it is recognized that both employees and businesses need to be educated on their responsibilities in regard to privacy protection. A general consensus is evident that both governments and business have major responsibilities in this area. Most private sector organizations indicate their commitment. Many are already engaged in education programs, not only for their customers but also for their employees. Moreover, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners indicate their willingness to become more involved, provided funding and resources are made available. In addition, the media is also seen as having a significant role to play. However, it is also recognized that consumers themselves must take the initiative to absorb educational materials provided to them, to shop around for the best balance of services and privacy protection, and to understand their own responsibilities in regard to privacy matters. Equally, businesses must also take the initiative to inform customers of potential privacy problems related to their products and services and not hold back until a crisis occurs. The tools available are seen to be many and varied. Everyday business practices, coupled with the publicizing of industry codes, will be powerful mechanisms, as will the publicizing of the CSA model privacy code. Massive advertising campaigns are not recommended, although periodic public awareness campaigns, which could take many forms, are recommended. The use of information centres, including public and academic libraries, for the distribution of materials and brochures also is considered to be another avenue. Brochures and publications can be directed at different audiences, including the public at large, schools and universities, and customers of businesses. Other suggestions include a privately funded national toll-free privacy "hotline" for consumers and the inclusion of a confidentiality clause in all contracts. CONCLUSIONS Concerns It is quite that evident that there is a wide range of real public concerns on privacy matters which, if not addressed quickly, could escalate to the point that the effective functioning of the information highway could be jeopardized. How to Ensure Privacy? There is a significant divergence of views between the majority of members of the private sector and consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups in regard to the relative merits of legislation and voluntary codes. However, there also is a pragmatic and conciliatory approach to these differences which makes a compromise achievable. No single approach to the resolution of the problems is viable. Therefore, a combination of the approaches outlined in the Discussion Paper is most likely to succeed because they are inter-related and mutually supportive. In order to achieve comprehensive solutions to the various problems identified by respondents, within the minimum possible time frame, a well-coordinated plan should be developed. The following are potential elements of a plan which the Advisory Council may wish to consider. The establishment by legislation of a national framework of privacy standards, probably based on the CSA model privacy code, under which private sector codes would operate and be bound. Revisions to the federal Privacy Act to overcome its current shortcomings, including a revised preamble, provision for the protection and security of personal information, and provision for the establishment of privacy impact assessments within the public sector. Development of a program to reinforce, strengthen and update the application of privacy requirements within the public sector. Early discussion with the provinces to implement national standards on a country-wide basis. Development of legislation to make it an offence to intercept private radio-based telecommunications, and to generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring radio-based telephones, including cellular phones. Development of a program to systematically promote the development of private sector codes based on the CSA model privacy code. Creation of a joint government/industry program to promote and support the development of privacy protection technologies. Promotion of consultations between industry/government, consumer groups and privacy commissioners on the development of significant and new potentially privacy-threatening technologies and systems. Development of a joint industry/government privacy education program in consultation with consumer groups and privacy commissioners. Establishment of consultations between government and the medical and social research groups to resolve the apparent dichotomy between the protection of personal information and the need to carry out medical and social research necessary to promote the public good. Development by the government of a standard privacy protection clause for all contracts or agreements involving the transfer or exchange of personal information with all institutions outside of government. Issuance of a public announcement after adoption of the plan and ministerial approval. Failure to Address the Problem Failure to address the major problems identified by respondents could be followed by increasing public privacy concerns, coupled with avoidance of the use of the information highway. Also, it might lead to Canada's privacy protection standards being considered inadequate under the European Communities' privacy directives.WT01-B14-179IA075-000494-B042-116http://www.privacy.org:80/pi/parts.html 199.34.33.146 19970209032909 text/html 5978HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sun, 09 Feb 1997 03:29:19 GMTServer: Apache/0.8.14Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5806Last-modified: Fri, 24 Jan 1997 11:52:55 GMT Privacy International Home Page PRIVATE PARTS ONLINE The International Privacy Newswire Latest News January 1997 Pakistan Info Bill, ID Cards.

In this paper Simon Davies analyses the key elements of public opposition to ID Card schemes, and profiles the massive 1987 Australian campaign against a national ID card. Following the announcement of an official identity card scheme, there is inevitably a public debate Such debate often occurs as a three stage process: During the first stage of the debate, a popular view is usually expressed that identification, per se, is not an issue related to individual rights. When an identity card is proposed, the public discussion is initially focused on the possession and use of the card itself. At this level of debate, the perceived benefits of ID dominate discussion. People often cannot see past the idea of a card being used strictly for purposes of verification of identity (banks, public transport, travel etc). Invariably, at this early stage of awareness, support for ID cards is high. The device is perceived as an instrument to streamline dealings with authority. The second stage of public debate is marked by a growing awareness of the hidden threats of an identity card: function creep, the potential for abuse by authorities, the problems arising from losing your card. Technical and organizational questions often arise at this level of discussion. As for the question of abuse by authorities (i.e. routine ID checks by police) a common response is still "I have nothing to hide, so I have nothing to fear". The final level of discussion involves more complex questions about rights and responsibilities. At this stage, the significance of the computer back-up and the numbering system come into the picture. Most public opposition to administration strategies such as numbering systems, Identity cards or the census are structured around an organized campaign of negative imagery (Big Brother) and a more systematic process of public education. In the Netherlands and German anti-census movements, and in the campaign against the Australia Card, hostile imagery sat comfortably alongside a strong intellectual foundation of opposition. To the organizers of a campaign, the imagery is important. No government assurances can counteract hysteria. The intangible arguments against national ID cards often include: A fear that the card will be used against the individual A fear that the card will increase the power of authorities A feeling that the card is in some way a hostile symbol A concern that a national ID card is the mechanism foretold in Revelations (the Mark of the Beast). A fear that people will be reduced to numbers - a dehumanising effect. A rejection of the card on the principle of individual rights A sense that the government is passing the buck for bad management to the citizen The tangible concerns that tend to create a more powerful long term campaign focus are: Any card system needs rules. How many laws must be passed to force the citizenry to use and respect the card? A card or numbering system may lead to a situation where government policy becomes "technology driven" and will occur increasingly through the will of bureaucrats, rather than through law or public process Practical and administrative problems that will arise from lost, stolen or damaged cards (estimated at up to several hundred thousand per year) Will the system create enough savings to justify its construction? If the system fails, can it be disassembled? To what extent will the system entrench fraud and criminality? What new opportunities for criminality will the system create? What are the broader questions of social change that relate to this proposal ? How will it affect my children? Concerns over the potential abuse of ID cards by authorities are supported by the experience of countries which have such cards. Complaints of harassment, discrimination and denial of service are, in some countries, quite common. The issue of privacy, which is central to concern about ID cards, tends to embrace all political philosophies. Concern over identity cards is as strong on the right as it is on the left. Libertarians and Conservatives believing that a card will increase the power of government, tend to dislike the notion. The left is often split on the issue, but contains a significant number who fear card systems on the basis of human rights. It is, of course, true that a large number of people will support an ID card in the belief that it will solve many problems of fraud and criminality. Whether a Parliament accepts the notion is another matter. In Australia and New Zealand, MPs have crossed the floor and resigned from their party over this issue. And even when only a minority of the public opposes the card, they do so with vehemence. It cannot be taken for granted that the public will automatically support the ID card concept. The Australian public took almost two years to protest against the card proposal. Within two months of the New Zealand announcement, hundreds of people were protesting in public. The reaction cannot be predicted. The United States has always viewed the introduction of ID cards as a fundamental attack on the relationship between authorities and the citizen, and therefore, a proposal that is politically unsustainable. The government of Ireland recently abandoned plans to establish a national numbering system and ID card.1 The Data Protection Commissioner for Ireland, Donal Linehan, objected vehemently to the proposal. While acknowledging the importance of controlling fraud, the Commissioner observed that the proposal posed "very serious privacy implications for everybody".2 ANATOMY OF AN ANTI-ID CARD CAMPAIGN - THE AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE ID card systems are often made appealing to the public by being marketed as "service cards", offering access to a range of facilities and benefits. The cards are also often marketed as voluntary instruments, thus neutralizing perhaps the key plank of any potential campaign of opposition. These factors have contributed to the dearth of opposition in recent years to card systems. The specter of an Orwellian Big Brother society has also diminished since the fateful year 1984, and apocalyptic scenarios of information brutality by an information-bloated State have also been treated with more skepticism than in the past. Information Technology has been absorbed by the public. Over the past ten years, opposition of ID cards has been confined to a handful of countries. French authorities have encountered opposition to their efforts to make cards machine readable. German authorities have run up against public and constitutional barriers in establishing a national numbering system for the German ID card. The Philippine ID card ran aground in 1991 because of cost factors which were made public through a campaign of opposition by human rights groups. The New Zealand public also opposed the Kiwi Card. The campaign which stands out, however, is the one which stopped the proposed Australia Card. This movement, the largest in recent Australian history, forced a dissolution of the parliament, a general election, and unprecedented divisions within the Labour government. The issues which were raised in this campaign provide important insights into the range of concerns related to ID cards in every country. The Australia Card To the older generation of Australians, the idea of a national identity card was not novel. Australians were given an identity card during the Second World War. This scheme, similar to the British identity card, relied on the imposition of rations as an incentive for registration and production of the card, and it was dropped soon after the hostilities had ended.3 Thirty years passed before the idea of a national identity card was again raised. Three government reports 4 suggested that the efficiency of the Commonwealth Government could be increased, and fraud better detected, through the use of an ID card system. Two Cabinet Ministers of the Fraser Government were reported as viewing such a proposal as politically unworkable, and the idea went no further.5 The Australia Card's genesis can be traced to the early 1980s, with widespread concern about tax evasion and tax avoidance. Coupled with concerns over the extent of welfare fraud, there was a belief expressed in some quarters that an identity card or national registration procedure might assist the government's administration processes. Fears over the extent of illegal immigration added fuel to these suggestions. The identity card idea was then raised at the national Tax Summit in 1985 (initially by Labor MP David Simmons and later by the chief executive of the Australian Taxpayers Association6) and found its way into legislation the following year. Playing on patriotism, the government called it the "Australia Card" (it later became widely known as the "UnAustralia Card and the Aush-tralia Card). The Australia Card was to be carried by all Australian citizens and permanent residents (separately marked cards would be issued to temporary residents and visitors). The would contain a photograph name, unique number, signature and period of validity, and would have been used to establish the right to employment. It would be necessary for the operation of a bank account, provision of government benefits, provision of health benefits, and for immigration and passport control purposes. The plan consisted of six components : * REGISTER A central register containing information about every member of the population, to be maintained by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC). * CODE A unique numerical identifier to be given to every member of the population, and assigned by the HIC. * CARD An obligatory, multi-purpose identification card to be issued by the HIC to every member of the population. * OBLIGATIONS. The law would require all individuals to produce the card for a variety of reasons, and would require organizations to demand the card, apply sanctions to people who refused to do so, and to report the data to the government. * USE The number and the Australia Card register wee to be used by a variety of agencies and organizations as their administrative basis. * CROSS NOTIFICATION Agencies using the system would be required to notify each other of changes to a person's details.7 Despite the extraordinary change that the plan was likely to prompt in the relationships within the Australian Community, the proposal caused hardly a ripple of concern. Early opinion polls showed a seventy per cent public support for the scheme. Not everyone was enthusiastic about the plan. A handful of journalists ran occasional stories raising questions about the proposal. The parliamentary opposition opposed the plan. Most significantly, a small number of committed academics and advocates worked to provide a critical analysis of the scheme and its implications. As early as July 1985, the Privacy Committee of NSW, a government agency, devoted a special issue of its "Privacy Bulletin" to the ID card, warning that the proposal encompassed grave dangers for liberty in Australia. The Committee's view was that this proposal was more than a mere identification procedure. It was, said the Committee, a tool for the centralization of power and authority within the government. Legal centers, civil liberties councils, academics and advocates joined the opposition to the ID card plan. Over the next two years, a strong intellectual foundation was developed. In one of the earliest critiques of the ID card proposal (January 1986) Professor Geoffrey de Q Walker, now dean of law at Queensland University, observed : One of the fundamental contrasts between free democratic societies and totalitarian systems is that the totalitarian government relies on secrecy for the regime but high surveillance and disclosure for all other groups, whereas in the civic culture of liberal democracy, the position is approximately the reverse. 8 Australian data protection expert Graham Greenleaf, one of the pioneers of the anti ID card push, warned : Is it realistic to believe that the production of identity cards by children to adults in authority to prove their age will be "purely voluntary"? The next generation of children may be accustomed to always carrying their Cards, to get a bus or movie concession, or to prove they are old enough to drink, so that in adult life they will regard production of an ID card as a routine aspect of most transactions. 9 As the Australia Card Bill was subjected to increasing scrutiny, the surveillance nature of the scheme received more attention. Greenleaf described the components of the Australia Card as "the building blocks of surveillance". The most obvious of those building blocks were the card, the unique number, the Australia Card Register (containing all the information and acting as an information exchange) and the telecommunications links between different agencies and arms of the Card scheme. Not so obvious, however, were the extensive reporting obligations throughout the government and the community, the automatic exchange of information throughout the government, weak data protection, the ease of legislative expansion of the system, and the effective encouragement of the private sector and state governments to make use of the card's number. Advocates pointed out that whilst it is true that some civil law countries (Spain, France etc) have an ID card, none would have been as intrusive or dangerous as the one proposed by the Australian Government. The Australia Card would have gone much further than the mere identification purpose of ID cards in other countries. It would have created a central information register that would touch many aspects of a person's life. At the end of 1985, the Opposition controlled Senate forced the appointment of a Joint Select Committee to investigate the proposal. The Committee raised a wide spectrum of concerns that eventually came to haunt the government. The majority of the Committee, including one government member, came down against the proposal, warning that the scheme would change the nature of the relationship between citizen and state and create major privacy and civil liberties problems. The committee pointed out that the cost benefit basis for such a scheme was speculative and rubbery, and that all common law countries had rejected such proposals. 10 The fact that no common law country has accepted an ID card was crucial to the whole debate over the Australia Card. Rather than supporting the Australia card option, the Committee's report recommended a number of reforms to Departmental practices and information management. The government ignored the findings of the Select Committee, and proceeded with its proposal. A self proclaimed "unholy alliance" was formed in Victoria between such figures as the Builders Labourers Federation';s Norm Gallagher, Western Mining Corporation chief Hugh Morgan, Civil liberties leader Ron Castan and popular singer Peter Garrett, and had placed advertisements in National publications. Several organizations also publicly opposed the Card, including the libertarian Adam Smith Club and Centre 2000, the NSW and Victorian Councils for Civil Liberties, the NSW branch of the Australian Computer Society, and a number of left wing trade unions. Three academics, Roger Clarke, Professor Geoffery de Q Walker and Graham Greenleaf, provided powerful and persuasive analysis of the government's proposals. The arguments against the card were seldom reported by media, who appear to have generally been persuaded by the government's revenue arguments. The committee's report formed the basis of the Parliamentary Opposition's rejection of the scheme. On two occasions the Government presented the legislation to the Senate, where it does not have a majority, only to see the bill rejected. After the second rejection by the Senate, the Government used the issue as the trigger to employ its constitutional right to call an election on the ID card legislation, and to call a joint sitting of Parliament, where it would have had a majority. As things turned out, the election campaign of July 1987 contained almost no reference to the ID card issue. In the opinion of the media, the ID card was simply not on the agenda.11 The government was re-elected and promptly re-submitted the ID card legislation. Until then, few Australians had taken any notice of the proposal. A rally in Sydney's Martin Place convened by Democrat Senator Paul McLean, succeeded in attracting less than a hundred people. 12 People held concerns privately, but were reluctant to express these fears lest they be branded "friends of tax cheats" (as the government had already labelled the parliamentary opposition). Three weeks after the election, the fortunes of the Australia Card were reversed. On 28th July 1987, seventeen people from wildly different edges of the political spectrum met to plot the card's demise.The meeting involved well known libertarians, communists, mainstream political party leaders, media figures, and business, farming and community leaders. 13 The meeting established a trust (later to be called the Australian Privacy Foundation) and resolved to form a campaign as a last ditch effort to fight the card. The almost complete absence of media interest demanded a publicity stunt, and the group decided to launch its campaign in the Ballroom of Sydney's plush Sebel Town House. 14 The key element in the campaign launch was the diversity of speakers. Right wing broadcaster Alan Jones, Democrat leader Janine Haines, America's Cup hero Ben Lexcen and rock singer Peter Garrett provided an unprecedented mix of famous talent, and the launch enjoyed saturation coverage. Ben Lexcen threatened to leave Australia forever if the scheme proceeded. Peter Garrett called it "the greatest threat Australia has ever faced".15 Once these well known figures had stated their opinion, other highly respected Australians rapidly joined the condemnation of the scheme. Former Westpac Bank chairman Sir Noel Foley stunned his colleagues with the blunt assessment that the card would pose "a serious threat to the privacy, liberty and safety of every citizen". Australian Medical Association president Dr Bruce Shepherd went as far as to predict "It's going to turn Australian against Australian. But given the horrific impact the card will have on Australia, its defeat would almost be worth fighting a civil war for." Fuelled by the unique alliance, newspapers and talk-back shows recorded a logarithmic increase in public concern. More Australians joined the Privacy Foundation to voice protest at the scheme. Right wing academic Professor Lauchlan Chipman, communist author Frank Hardy, former Whitlam Government minister Jim McClelland, and left wing economist Professor Ted Wheelwright all linked arms with their ideological foe to fight the scheme. Within weeks, a huge and well organized movement was underway, Rallies were organized on almost a daily basis. Although these were described as "education nights" the reality was that most were hotbeds of hostility rather than well ordered information giving sessions. The strength of public feeling was never more clear than on the night of September 14th, when 4,000 angry people crammed the AMOCO hall in the central New South Wales town of Orange. One in eight of the cities population attended the meeting. Other towns responded in a similar way. The massive wave of public outrage was generated by scores of ad-hoc local and regional committees from coast to coast. Rallies formed on a daily basis, culminating in a gathering of 30,000 outside Western Australia's Parliament House. The Australian Privacy Foundation, which had organized the campaign, had planned rallies in Sydney and Melbourne that were tipped to have sealed off the Central Business District. The passion of those weeks reached the point of open civil disobedience. The Labor caucus came close to violence on one occasion,16 while public demonstrations against the ID card began to turn nasty.17 The letters pages of most newspapers reflected the strong feelings of Australians. "We won't be numbers!" was a typical letters page headline, with others such as "I have no intention of applying", "An alternative is the ball and chain", Biggest con job in our history", "Overtones of nazi Germany", "I will leave the country" and "Passive resistance gets my vote".18 The cartoonists contributed to the strong feelings, with some constantly portraying then Prime Minister Robert Hawke in Nazi uniform. Historian Geoffrey Blainey compared the extraordinary protest to the Eureka Stockade. "The destruction of the licences at Ballarat, and the stand at Eureka Stockade was a rebellion against the erosion of personal liberty associated with the Australia Card of that era".19 The card had touched a nerve in the national psyche by cutting across what many saw as the national character. A major national opinion poll conducted in the closing days of the campaign by the Channel Nine television network resulted in a ninety per cent opposition to the card. The normally staid Australian Financial Review produced a scathing editorial which concluded "It is simply obscene to use revenue arguments ("We can make more money out of the Australia Card") as support for authoritarian impositions rather than take the road of broadening national freedoms".20 Within weeks of its commencement, the campaign had galvanized Australia against the Card. Despite elements of hysteria, the average Australian came to understand that the introduction of such a scheme would reduce freedoms and increase the power of authorities. Indeed, "freedom" would come to mean the freedoms granted by the card. As the Financial Review had so eloquently observed, Australia's rights and freedoms are far more fragile than those of older counterparts. A government should be committed to strengthening those freedoms. As news of the specifics of the ID card legislation spread, the campaign strengthened. If you were in employment without an ID card, it would be an offence for your employer to pay you (Penalty $20,000). If you were then forced to resign, you could not get a new job, as the law would make it a offence for an employer to hire a cardless person (penalty $20,000). Farmers without ID cards could not receive payments from marketing boards for their produce (penalty $20,000). A person without an ID card would be denied access to a pre-existing bank account, and could not cash in investments, cannot give money to or receive money from a solicitor, or could not receive money in unit, property or a cash management trust. Cardless people could not buy or rent their own home or land (penalty $5,000), nor would benefits be paid to the unemployed, widows, supporting parents, the aged, the invalid or the sick. If your card is destroyed for any reason than cannot be proven as accidental, the penalty would be $5,000 or two years imprisonment or both. A $500 penalty would be imposed if you lost your card and failed to report the loss within twenty one days. Failure to attend a compulsory conference if ordered to by the ID card agency would result in a penalty of $1,000 or six months' gaol. Failure to produce your ID card on demand to the Tax Office would invoke a penalty of $20,000. By this time, the Card's architect, the Health Insurance Commission was well and truly on the nose. Talk back radio hosts had become fond of quoting a paragraph of an HIC planning document on the Australia Card: 'It will be important to minimize any adverse public reaction to implementation of the system. One possibility would be to use a staged approach for implementation, whereby only less sensitive data are held in the system initially with the facility to input additional data at a later stage when public acceptance may be forthcoming more readily.'21 The campaign organizers stressed the pseudo-voluntary nature of the card. Whilst it was not technically compulsory for a person to actually obtain a card, it would have been extremely difficult to live in society without it. Indeed, the government actually coined the term "pseudo-voluntariness" to describe its aspirations. By mid September, the Government was facing an internal crisis. The left of the party had broken ranks to oppose the card 22 while right wing members (particularly those in marginal seats) were expressing concern within caucus. 23 Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Bowen urged the Party to tread with caution, and suggested that a re-think may be necessary.24 Within weeks, in the face of mass public protests, a party revolt and civil disobedience, the government scrapped the ID card proposal. It was provided with the convenient face-saver of a technical flaw in the legislation revealed by opposition senator John Stone. The government had the option of re-introducing the legislation, but did not do so. Journalists reported that the government was overwhelmed with joy that the flaw had been discovered. The Hawke Government made several key mistakes in its preparations for the Australia Card scheme. First, it had made assumptions about the right of government that simply did not match community expectations. People felt that the government did not have a mandate to do as it pleased. Second, the resort to patriotism (calling this the Australia Card) was resented hotly. Finally, and perhaps most important, the Government was simply not able to establish that it and its law enforcement agencies could be trusted with the mechanism. The sophistication of public debate was highly developed. Letters to the newspapers and calls to radio stations put the argument that with the implementation of the card, the onus of proof in day to day transactions would be reversed. Trust within society would be replaced by the demand for formal identification. The government appeared unable to understand people's concern that there would emerge a shift in the balance of power in the relationships between citizen and the state. According to academic experts and privacy advocates leading the campaign, the card would suffer "function creep" and would find its way into many aspects of life. These were fears that could never be countered by government assurances. There can be little doubt that, in addition to the problems listed above, several very substantial privacy and data protection fears were established. These included matters of data security, function creep, incursions related to data matching, improper use and disclosure of data, erroneous data, the establishment of central control and tracking, and the possible development of an "internal passport". Coupled with the government's inability to establish that the system would actually tackle major problems such as the underground economy, even the most conservative government supporters became skeptical. There was a very real fear in the Australian community in 1987 that the fundamental balance of power was shifting. Justice Michael Kirby, President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, observed "If there is an identity card, then people in authority will want to put it to use....What is at stake is nothing less than the nature of our society and the power and authority of the state over the individual". 25 1 Announced in the 1989 - 1993 Programme For Government document 2 Commissioner's Annual Report, 1991, p.2, 42 3 James Rule, Private Lives and public surveillance; Social control in the computer age, Schocken Books, 1974.

Amongst the gravest of problems reported to Privacy International was the over zealous use or misuse of ID cards by police - even where the cards were supposed to be voluntary. One respondent wrote : On one occasion I was stopped in Switzerland when walking at night near Lake Geneva. I was living in Switzerland at the time and had a Swiss foreigner's ID card. The police were wondering why I should want to walk at night to look at the Chateau de Chillon. Really suspicious I suppose, to walk at night on the banks of the lake to look at an illuminated chateau (I am white and dress conservatively). I had to wait for 20 minutes whilst they radioed my ID number to their central computer to check on its validity. Correspondents in most countries reported that police had powers to demand the ID card. A correspondent in Greece reported: In my country the Cards are compulsory. If police for example stop you and ask for identification you must present them the ID or you are taken to the police department for identification research. Police were granted these powers in the late 1980s, despite some public misgivings. Non European countries reported more serious transgressions, In Brazil, for example: They are compulsory, you're in big trouble with the police if they request it and you don't have one or left home without it. The police can ask for my identity card with or without a valid motive, it's an intimidation act that happens in Brazil very, very often. The problem is not confined to the police. Everybody asks for your id when you are for example shopping, and this is after you have shown your cheque guarantee card. We also other similar cards. Nobody trusts anybody basically. Predictably, political hot-spots have seen widescale abuse of the card system: One problem that Afghans encountered carrying these "tazkiras" (ID cards) was during the rule of the communist regime in Afghanistan where people were stopped in odd hours and in odd places by the government's Soviet advisors and their KHALQI and PARCHAMI agents and asked for their "tazkiras". Showing or not showing the "tazkira" to the enquiring person at that time was followed by grave consequences. By showing it, the bearer would have revealed his age upon which, if it fell between 16-45, he would have been immediately taken to the nearest army post and drafted into the communist army, and if he refused to show, he would have been taken to the nearest secret service (KHAD) station and interrogated as a member of the resistance (Mujahideen), imprisoned, drafted in the army or possibly killed. Many countries reported that their ID card had become an internal passport, being required for every dealing with people or institutions. In Argentina, according to this correspondent, the loss of the ID card would result in grave consequences: I got my first personal ID when I turned seven. It was the Provincial Identity Card. It looked like the hardcover of a little book with just two pages in it. It had my name, my photograph, the fingerprint of my right thumb, and some other personal data. I never questioned what was the logic about fingerprinting a seven-year old boy. It was suggested that identification was one of the major purposes for the existence of the Police of the Province which issued the card. It was required for enroling in the Provincial School I attended. Attending the primary school is compulsory, hence everybody under twelve is indirectly forced to have the Card.Well, this Book was required for any sort of proceedings that the person wanted to initiate, e.g. enrol at school, buy a car, get his driving license, get married. Nobody could do anything without it. In addition, it became a prerogative of the police to request it at any time and place. Whoever was caught without it was customarily taken to jail and kept there for several hours (or overnight if it happened in the evening) while they "checked his personal record". In effect, Argentine citizens have never been much better off than South-African negroes during the Apartheid, the only difference is that we Argentinians did not have to suffer lashings if caught without the pass card. As for daily life without the ID, it was impossible. Of greater significance is the information that ID cards are commonly used as a means of tracking citizens to ensure compliance with such laws as military service. Again, in Argentina: The outrage of the military service was something that many people was not ready to put up with. Nevertheless, something forced the people to present themselves to be drafted. It was nothing more or less than the ID. In fact, if somebody did not show up, the army never bothered to look for them. They just waited for them to fall by themselves, because the ID card showed the boy to be on military age and not having the necessary discharge records by the army. Provided that in the country you could not even go for a walk without risking to be detained by the police, being a no-show for military duty amounted to a civil death. Another respondent in Singapore noted that many people in his country were aware that the card was used for purposes of tracking their movements, but that most did not see any harm in this: If that question is put to Singaporeans, they are unlikely to say that the cards have been abused. However, I find certain aspects of the NRIC (ID card) system disconcerting. When I finish military service (part of National service), I was placed in the army reserve. When I was recalled for reserve service, I found that the army actually knew about my occupation and salary! I interpreted this as an intrusion into my privacy. It might not be obvious but the NRIC system has made it possible to link fragmented information together. The consequences of losing ones card were frequently mentioned: A holiday in Rio was ruined for me when I was robbed on the beach and had to spend the rest of the brief holiday going through the bureaucracy to get a duplicate issued. One way round this (of dubious legality) is to walk around with a notarized xerox copy instead of the original. The Brazillian experience shows that the card is often misused by police: Of course violent police in metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro love to beat and arrest people (especially black/poor) on the pretext that they don't have their ID card with them. In some countries, denial of a card means denial of virtually all services: ID cards are very important in Vietnam. They differentiate between citizens and non-citizens. People without an ID card are considered as being denied of citizenship and all the rights that come with it. For example, they cannot get legal employment, they cannot get a business license, they cannot go to school, they cannot join official organizations, and of course they cannot join the communist party. They cannot travel either. (Even though in practice, they bribe their way around within the country, they would face big trouble if got caught without ID card.) The same problem occurs in China: I personally feel that the card has the following drawbacks: It carries too much private info about a person. We have to use it in almost every situation. such as renting a hotel room, getting legal service from lawyers, contacting government agencies, buying a plane ticket and train ticket, applying for a job, or getting permit to live with your parents, otherwise your residence is illegal. In a lot of cases, we are showing too much irrelevant information to an agency or person who should not know that. The card is subject to police cancellation, and thus without it, one can hardly do anything, including traveling for personal or business purposes, or getting legal help or obtaining a job. The government has been using this scheme too often as a measure against persons who run into troubles with it socially or politically. The identity card is showing your daily or every short-term movement, and can be used to regularize and monitor a person's behavior and activity. One Korean professor reported that the national card was used primarily as a means of tracking peoples activities and movements: If you lose this card, you have to report and make another one within a certain period. Since it shows your current address, if you change your address then you must report that and make a correction of the new address. If you go to a military service or to a prison, then the government takes away this identity card. You get the card back when you get out. You are supposed to carry this card everywhere you go, since the purpose is to check out the activity of people. There are fines and some jail terms if you do not comply. If you board a ship or an airplane, then you must show this card to make a record. You need to show this card when you vote. Former presidential candidate Kim, Dae Joong could not vote for his own presidential election because his secretary forgot to bring Kim's card. He had to wait for a while until somebody bring his card. Many government employees make lot of money selling information on this card to politicians during election season. Police can ask you to show this card and check whether your identity number is on the wanted list or not. There is a widespread prejudice between the people of some local areas. This card shows the permanent address of you. And it allows other people to successfully guess the hometown of your parents. One Portuguese man studying in the United States reported an obsession with identity in his country: I keep losing my ID. card, and people keep asking for it. It seems like it's needed for just about everything I want to do, and I should really carry it around my neck or have it tattooed on my palm. The information on it is needed for everything. Many buildings, perhaps most, will have a clerk sitting at a "reception desk" who will ask you for your id. They will keep it and give it back to you when you leave. Few people seem bothered with this, but then they don't keep loosing they're cards like I do. SO I usually threw a little tantrum "Are we under curfew? Why do I have to carry my id with me anyway?" Our tolerant culture invariably leads the clerk to take whatever other document I happen to be carrying -- usually my bus pass, which I loose less often. After a while I surrender and go get myself a new id. card. It takes 1/2 a day or more to do this and -- guess what -- you need your old id. card. It's more complicated if you've lost it. Then finally I am legal again for a while. It's partly due to the Portuguese obsession with identity. Everyone carries both they're mother's and father's last names. Others confirmed the traditional problem of counterfeiting: It costs only 300 rupees ($10) to get a counterfeit ID card. The system hardly works. We all know how fake IDs (one guy's photo, another one's name) can be obtained so people can have their friends take GREs and TOEFLs (national tests) for them.

Powerful technologiesorigionally developed for the military are being adopted by law enforcement andcivilian agencies and private companies to monitor entire populations. This hasbeen further fueled by the end of the Cold War and increasing demands forgreater bureaucratic efficiency. Existing laws and regulations have failed tokeep up with these developments. This one day conference will examine a range of advanced surveillancetechnologies and their impact on privacy and other civil liberties. It willexplore the process of planning and implementation of the technologies, theiroperating conditions, and the people and organizations respnsible for them. Theconference will also examine possible technical, regulatory and legalresponses.

The investigation was sparked by a complaint last yearby Privacy International director Simon Davies, whoobjected to the manner in which the cards had beenpromoted. Davies argued that the word anonymous,used by Mondex to describe its product, was misleadingand incorrect. He said Mondex transactions werelogged by the trader and were known to the bank. In a letter of 21 June announcing the outcome of theinformal inquiry, Robert Gilham of the EnvironmentalHealth and Trading Standards Department in Bromley,South London, confirmed the traders till chip retainsthe last 300 transactions as card number, value anddate. "It appears the customer is identified to the trader...and,ultimately, the bank, by the 300 previoustransactions....These can be monitored by the bank andcould be used for marketing purposes. This is the audittrail and ultimately could be sold to business users forthird party marketing." Gilham observed The potential exists for unauthoriseduse of transaction information by banks, traders or thirdparties but he conceded that no evidence wasavailable to confirm that this stage has been reached. The Department has decided, in view of the embryonicstate of the Mondex trials, not to prosecute, but toresolve the matter through negotiation and discussion. Responding to the outcome, Simon Davies said, "I'mdisappointed that Mondex has escaped further action bythe Trading Standards authority, but I hope the outcomeof this inquiry motivates other projects in this field to bemore honest in the promotion of their product." "During the course of this investigation it has becomeclear that Mondex cards have more in common withcredit cards than cash."

Please forgive the length and detail of thisletter. The complaint involves a complex technicalproject about which there is only limited publicinformation. For this reason I feel it is important that Ipresent a full background to the subject area. I am making this complaint to Bromley Councilbecause I viewed the offending material in theBromley area. This complaint involves the activities of Mondex Ltd,a partnership between the Midland and NationalWestminster Banks. Since June of this year, Mondexhas been engaged in a trial of smart cards whichare designed to replace cash. The trial is beingconducted in Swindon. The Mondex cards (being given to Midland andNational Westminster bank customers) canelectronically store the value of cash authorised froma bank ATM machine or by way of specially adaptedpayphones connected to the customers bank. Instead of handing over cash to a store, customershand over the card, which acts in place of cash. Thecard is inserted into a machine which debits theamount of the transaction. Because it is a debit card(that is, customers have already paid for the value ofcash contained in it) no signature or authorisation isneeded. The relevant amount is electronicallydeducted from the card. Many big High Streetretailers, including Boots, Asda, Safeway, JSainsbury, WH Smith, BP and McDonald's areparticipating in the scheme. Currently, six thousandpeople are using the cards in Swondon, andMondex hopes this will rise to as many as 40,000. Some background I should explain at this point that a smart card is acredit-card size device containing a microchip, whichcan store and process considerable amounts of data.Most smart cards can hold several A4 pages of data.The smart card can independently process this data,and present it in different forms according torequirements. Information on the chip can belocked with a PIN number, and protected through arange of encryption methods. These cards havebeen developed in various countries for health,social welfare benefits, transport, and financialtransactions. The Mondex trial is being eagerly watched by banksand governments around the world. The commonview of these bodies is that cash is a costly,cumbersome and messy commodity. It is insecureand untraceable. UK banks estimate that they spend2 billion a year on cash distribution, and the cost toretailers has been put at 800 million. Banks want tosave money not only by taking cash out of thesystem, but also by charging customers and retailersfor an alternative system that avoids the traditionaldrawbacks. A cash smart card is one way ofachieving this. The Mondex experiment is widely seen as crucial tothe future of electronic cash worldwide. Mondex hassigned up Midland's sister company,HongkongBank, as the first overseas partner.HongkongBank has acquired the rights to franchiseMondex in Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia,Macau, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka,Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. Trevor Blackler,NatWest's chief executive of group services, hasbeen reported as saying discussions are beingconducted with 30 banks in 15 countries around theworld. While the Mondex experiment is at the cutting edge,other banks are not far behind. Barclays and Lloydsare in partnership with Visa International to pioneeran international system that may, in effect, create asingle international cash unit of currency. The VisaInternational project is co-operating with bank-ledgroups in Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, Taiwanand the US. Like Mondex, it plans to create anextensive network of shop-based card readers. The importance of this project, nationally andinternationally, cannot be easily overstated. Theconcept of electronic cash is almost certain to takehold throughout Europe, particularly in the lead-up toa single unit of currency. In 1995, EuropeanCommission premises across Europe are to act ashost to a trial of an electronic multi -currencypayment system similar to the one being pioneeredby Mondex. The technology is known morepopularly in Europe as an electronic purse. Underthe EU's own research programme in InformationTechnology, a seven-country consortium of partnersin industry and academia has developed the purse,which can be loaded with money from the owner'sbank account, then used to meet expenses in ECUand national currencies by down -loading paymentsinto compatible terminals in shops, pay-phones, tollroads, public transport and so on. At the same time, a specialized working groupattached to the European Committee forStandardization (CEN) is on the point of developinga European standard that could open the door tocross-border use of electronic cash. An internationalstandard has already been finalised for point-of-salemachinery for the cards. Thirteen Europeancountries have been involved since 1991 in theeffort. The mechanism of the Mondex system is complex.Each card is linked to an existing bank account. Thecard can be topped up, or the security instructionschanged, by using any ATM or modified pay phone.Although the card is a direct substitute for cash, it canbe made more secure than cash. The owner canencode it with a PIN number which locks the cashvalue, and thus makes the card useless for anyoneelse. The complaint Mondex has consistently promoted its product asprivacy friendly, anonymous, and cash-like. Theseare important selling points of the Mondex product,because many people value their financial privacy,and would support a technology that offers secureand anonymous transactions. However, I disputethe claims made by Mondex, and will set out belowevidence that I believe will show that Mondex has setout intentionally to deceive the public. Transactionsusing the cards are neither anonymous nor are theyprivacy friendly. In the Mondex Home Page - an electronicpromotional advertisement located on the internet,Mondex makes the following statement: What about privacy? In everyday use Mondex transactions are anonymous, just like cash. However, if the card is lost, a unique 16-digit identity number stored on the chip, which will have been registered by a card-providing bank against the personal details of the customer, may be used in order to return the card to its rightful owner. Cards also contain a "purse narrative". The customer's narrative would contain the names of the retailers - letting them know where they have used their card. Only a cardholder will have access to the statement entries on their card which detail transactions. A cardholder will be able to lock their card and prevent unauthorised access. Here, Mondex has made the case for privacy, settingout in very specific terms the way the data will berestricted. The statement Only a cardholder willhave access to the statement entries on their cardwhich detail transactions sets out to reassure thepublic that Big Brother will not be a party to thesystem. The claim is an outright lie. In late September Iinterviewed the project manager of the Swindonexperiment (Rob Jameson) and was told withoutequivocation that Mondex uses a full audit trail of alltransactions. Jameson told me all retailers have acard linked record of all transactions which areavailable to the bank. This directly contradicts thepublicity. Mondex, in fact, uses the same audit trailsystems as any other card system. This is, to myknowledge, the first time Mondex has revealed thisdimension of its system. Mondex consistently makes its claim of being privacyfriendly. Page 15 of the Mondex Media Pack (August1994) states the cards are as anonymous as cash.In defence of its tactics, Mondex might well arguethat the cards are transferable, and thus the audittrail cannot technically link a transaction to anidentified individual in, say, the way a credit cardcould (the credit card requires a signature). Thisjustification is largely irrelevant. I believe Mondexhas conducted research which shows that almostone hundred per cent of transactions are conductedby the owner of the card. I believe Mondex is in clear breach of the TradeDescriptions Act. It has willfully and intentionally setout to mislead the public. I believe the case warrantsprosecution. Mondex must either cease describingtheir product as anonymous and cash like, or itmust remove all transaction recording machinery atpoint of sale. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any furtherinformation. Yours sincerely Simon Davies (transmitted by modem.

Having finally gained access to the internet and read theinformation available relating to Mondex I believe thatthe relative part of that information could be treated asan advertisement. I also noted that words had beenchanged from the original entry which you sent to me. Iwill return to both these matters later in this letter. I took the opportunity to meet Mr Capelthorne of MondexInternational on 12 June to seek explanation of thesystem, having had the chance to see the internetstatements. I understand the following to be the systemoperation. Loading a card shows on customers bank statements.That is to say, there is no other paper record of thetransaction as would be the case in credit cardtransactions having monthly statements. The retailers transaction to pay in Mondex cash showson his bank statement but nothing ties the customer tothe electronic money used. The transaction log on the card can be read by thecardholders electronic wallet. The previous tentransactions are identified as amount, trader and date;this includes personal transfers and load-up, which arenot identified. The traders till chip retains the last 300 transactions ascard number, value and date. The trader cannot tracethe customer as the Personal Identification (PID)Number is only traceable through the card issuing bankand is not disclosed under the banks duty of privacy toits customer. The PID is required in order for the till toread the card and conduct the transaction. In addition, the customer uses a 4 digit PersonalIdentification Number (PIN) to free the card for loadingfrom ATMs and to lock/unlock the card for accessauthorisation. Lost cards can be read if not locked by thecard owner. The card is not defaulted to lock when sent,as it is of no use to anyone until given a PIN by the user.The user must choose to lock the card, and must unlockit for transactions to take place. An unauthorisd usercan only use or read the card if the PIN is known ordiscovered, otherwise, after a set number of attempts todiscover the PIN, the card locks up and is no use toanyone. It appears the customer is identified to the trader, as inparagraph seven above and, ultimately, the bank, by the300 previous transactions. Each of these will soon besuperseded by further transactions and drop off theend of the list. These can be monitored by the bank andcould be used for marketing purposes. This is the audittrail and ultimately could be sold to business users forthird party marketing. I am assured this does not occur atpresent. I am assured that descriptions will beappropriate and data protection issues addressed if thisavenue is pursued. Mondex International has changed the wordanonymous to private as a description within theinternet promotion. This word seems to have moreappropriate meanings than anonymous, reflecting thelimited access to information, equating with the privacyof a (pocket) wallet where the information is not for thirdparty consumption, but is available to unauthorisedpeople. The card system has checks and balances, whichmeans that the amount of information available to thirdparties is protected or currently not available at all. The potential exists for unauthorised use of transactioninformation by banks, traders or third parties, but noevidence is available that this stage has been reached.Currently, no false trade description has beendemonstrated. The POS (Point of Sale) material makesno claim for privacy. The only claim was made in apress release and as explained previously, is not withinthe scope of a trade description. A privacy claim is made, via promotional material(advertisements) on the Internet. I do not believe this isthe issue which should be used to test whether thematerial on the Internet is an advertisement. Morecorrectly, the issue relates to a trial of the card, and thepitfalls discovered should be corrected by negotiationand discussion. To this end I am making my colleagues in the City ofLondon Trading Standards aware of the complaint,since the card company is based in their area. I haveinvited Mondex to discuss with them and concerns orproposed descriptions. Thank you for bringing this complex matter to myattention and for your patience over an enquiry whichmay at times have seemed to have become boggeddown in bureaucracy.

Montana Senator ConradBurns today announced the introduction of legislation designedto promote electronic commerce on the Internet, protectintellectual property rights and put American softwarecompanies on a level playing field with their foreigncompetitors.     Dubbed the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in theDigital Era, or "PRO-CODE," Act, the bill would end theimposition of government-designed encryption (mathematicalcodes used for computer security) standards and would promotethe use of commercial encryption. Current governmentstandards allow American software companies to exportproducts only with a level of encryption regarded as easilydefeated by "hackers." The effect has been to dampen thegrowth of on-line commerce and to place American companiesat a competitive disadvantage with foreign firms not bound bylower standards on the export of encrypted security.     "Everything I do here in Washington, D.C., I do with theinterests of Montanans in mind," Burns said. "We live in a statethat, from northwest to southeast, spans the same distance asfrom Washington, D.C., to Chicago. I can think of no better wayto make our wide-open spaces feel a lot smaller than by makingit easier to communicate and transact business over longdistances."     The PRO-CODE Act restricts the U.S. Department ofCommerce from imposing government encryption standards thatwere not: developed by the private sector, do not provide robustsecurity, require people to relinquish control of a decryptionkey, do not have widespread commercial support andacceptance, do not provide for the ability to securely interactworldwide, and do not protect the privacy of users consistentwith constitutional protections. It also prohibits the departmentfrom setting de facto encryption standards through the use ofexport controls.     In addition, the bill prohibits restrictions on the sale ofcommercial encryption programs and products in interstatecommerce, prohibits mandatory key escrow (requiring that adecryption key be placed in the hands of a third party), andpermitting the export of software and hardware if products withcomparable security is commercially available from a foreignsupplier.     The Burns bill has strong bipartisan support and hasbeen referred to the Senate Commerce Committee, where Burnschairs the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. Heannounced his legislation via a phone call to the Computers,Freedom, and Privacy conference at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology in Cambridge, Mass.     Burns earlier this month was the chief Senate co-sponsor of a bill sponsored by Sen.

BUGOFF! A Primer for Human Rights Groups on Wiretapping October 1995 David Banisar Washington Office, Privacy International Introduction The explosion of telecommunications services has improved the ability for humanrights groups to disseminate information worldwide. New telephone, facsimileand computer communications have created opportunities for human rights groupsto improve organizing and to promote human rights faster and at a lower costthan ever before. However, these new technologies can be monitored bygovernments and other groups seeking to monitor the activities of human rightsadvocates. For this reason, human rights advocates should be aware of thedangers and measures that can be taken to limit surveillance. The scope of this paper is limited to the interception of oral and electroniccommunications commonly referred to as wiretapping and other issues related totelephone communications. It will also discuss methods to avoid surveillance.[1] Why Should Groups be Concerned? Wiretapping is conducted in nearly every country in the world and isfrequently abused. The US Department of State, in its annual Country Reportson Human Rights Practices for 1994, reports widespread, illegal oruncontrolled use of wiretaps by both government and private groups in over 70countries.[2] Human rights groups, reportersand political opponents are the most common targets of surveillance bygovernment intelligence and law enforcement agencies and other non-governmentalgroups. In some countries, such as Honduras and Paraguay, the state ownedtelecommunications companies were active participants in helping the securityservices monitor human rights advocates. In other countries, multiple forms ofsurveillance are used. For example, in 1991, wiretaps and hidden microphoneswere found in the offices of the Mexican Human Rights Commission.[3] More recent press reports estimated that there are200,000 illegal wiretaps in Mexico currently in place.[4] These problems are not limited to developing countries. In the US,litigation conducted by the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibilityunder the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the FBI monitored computernetworks used by political and advocacy groups. French counter-intelligenceagents wiretapped the telephones of prominent journalists and opposition partyleaders during the mid-1980s. There have been numerous cases in the UnitedKingdom which revealed that the British intelligence services monitor socialactivists, labor unions, and civil liberties groups.[5] Thus, there is an obvious need for human rights groups to be concerned withwiretapping: Governments often monitor human rights groups to discover whatthey know, who their sources are, and what their future activities will be.The lack of secure communications creates the threat of physical harm to manypeople in the human rights field. Who Can Do it and What are the Limitations? Most types of electronic communication can be intercepted without a high levelof expertise or expensive equipment. Surveillance equipment is not difficultto construct and is available in many electronics stores. Many manufacturerssell surveillance devices to any buyer, without restrictions. Thus, groupsshould be aware that both governments and private organizations may have thecapability to eavesdrop. This does not mean that everyone should believe that they are always undersurveillance. It is not practical for any government or group to wiretap alltelephones in a country and listen to every conversation simultaneously.Wiretapping is a labor intensive operation and requires considerable resourcesto conduct the taps, listen to, and transcribe the conversations. Because it isnecessary to have a human listen to the conversation, labor and equipment costscreate practical limits to surveillance. The East German secret police employed10,000 people to conduct wiretaps and listen to conversations before the BerlinWall fell.[6] New technologies, such as computerized voice recognition, that can automatesurveillance are being actively developed by Western (and presumably also byother) governments. The Ottawa Citizen reported that the CanadianCommunications Security Establishment has spent over $1.1 million to "isolatekey words and phrases from the millions of signals the CSE monitors every day"and awarded contacts to develop systems to create a "speaker identificationsystem."[7] There were also reports that theUS Government assisted the Columbian government in tracking down drug cartelleaders by using voice recognition technologies on cellular phone calls. Thesenew technologies are not yet generally available to less wealthy countries orlocal police forces. There may also be technical limitations on conducting alarge number of simultaneous taps. Recently, former members of the Soviet KGBdisclosed that they only had the capability of wiretapping 1,000 phone lines inMoscow and another 1,500 for the rest of Russia.[8] Given this, it is not likely that every telephone can be monitored in aparticular city. However, it is possible that the public and private phonesnearest to the offices of human rights organizations or their staffs may bealso monitored. In France, counter-intelligence officers illegally wiretappednot only the telephones of several journalists but also the phones in bars andrestaurants that they frequented.[9] Thus, surveillance is generally limited to those wiretaps installed manuallyand listened to by human agents. This is not an inconsequential threat. Standard Telephones Standard telephone systems are very vulnerable to wiretaps. It does notrequire a high level of skill or technology to intercept a voice communication.There are many locations where a wiretap can be placed. For example,microphones in many older telephones' handsets can be replaced with one thatcan also transmit to a remote receiver. Taps can also be placed at thetelephone boxes in the basements of buildings, on the lines outside the house,or on the telephone pole junction boxes near the target of the surveillance. Acommon technique used by police forces is to remotely monitor calls by havinglines run from a telephone company central office where the local switchingequipment is located to a monitoring station in a government office. Many of these techniques are undetectable to the target, especially in newersystems, where the system is run by computers.[10] In the US, legislation requiring that allcommunications systems be designed with the ability to more easily interceptcommunications was recently enacted at the behest of the law enforcement andintelligence community. [11]This will have aprofound effect worldwide since the US is one of the largest manufacturers andpurchasers of telephone switching equipment worldwide. Scrambling Voice Communications Technology is available to ensure that telephone conversations are not easilymonitored. Secure phones, which use cryptography, a mathematical technique forscrambling conversations, are commercially available from many differentcompanies including Motorola, TRW and AT&T, but these devices may notprovide adequate protection. AT&T recently introduced an telephoneattachment that connects to the handset cord and when used with a duplicatedevice on the receiving device, scrambles conversations. However, it uses aspecialized computer chip, known as the Clipper Chip, for which the keys tounscramble communications are also held the US Government in a system called"key escrow."[12] The U.S. Government hasbeen strongly pushing other governments to adopt the system for theircountries. If other countries also begin using similar systems, it is likelythat keys for users in that country will also reside with their governments. Other devices use the US Data Encryption Standard (DES) or secret companystandards. DES is considered by most security experts to be secure againsteavesdropping except against the most well financed opposition such as largeintelligence organizations. Secret standards may not be as secure becausethey may have weaknesses that have not been publicly disclosed since there isno open review of the algorithms. These devices are also very expensive,costing around $US 2,000 each. There is also the possibility that the devices are deliberately not secure.The United State and some other countries have laws that require governmentpermission to use or export any device or software that contains encryption.In the US, manufacturers are required to design their products that will beexported so that the NSA may still monitor the conversations. Therefore, anydevice that is sold by a US company overseas should not be considered safe forprotecting sensitive information. These controls may be circumvented by purchasing devices designed in countriessuch as Sweden or Switzerland, which do not have export control laws onencryption. However, these devices may have also been compromised by theirdomestic intelligence agencies. Recently, there were numerous news reportsacross Europe that Crypto AG, a company which sells secure phone and faxdevices, is in reality controlled by German intelligence and has deliberatelysold weakened encryption devices. There are also international informationsharing agreements -- such as the Quadripartite Agreement -- betweenintelligence agencies that could result in the weakening of encryption.[13] A recent advance is the development of computer based scrambling that willallow two PC (or clone) owners to talk to each other through their computersover modems or the Internet to scramble their conversations. Several freelyavailable programs are currently under development.[14] These programs are generally available for free andmay be ideal for human rights groups to use. However, they may also requiremore powerful computers to use (at least a 386 or faster machine for the PC,68030 or greater for the Mac) and high speed modems (14.4K or faster) to haveunderstandable speech. Wireless Communications Wireless telephones are becoming more and more popular in western countries.In the US alone, over 40 million cordless phones are in use. There are alsomillions of cellular telephones in use. In developing countries, wirelesscommunications such as cellular and satellite-based telephones are also popularas a means to avoid laying new telephone lines in areas that were previouslyundeveloped. All of these devices are easily interceptable and should not beused by anyone who is discussing sensitive information. Cordless telephone communications are especially easy to intercept. Many ofthe older models broadcast just above the top range of the AM radio band andconversations can be easily overheard with any AM radio. Newer models operatein the 49 MHz range and can be intercepted with an inexpensive radio scannerpurchased at most electronics stores for under $US 100.00. The range ofinterception can extend to nearly one mile. Several phone manufacturers now offer "privacy secure" cordless phones thatthey claim ensure the privacy of phone calls. However, most of these phone usea simple fifty year old technique known as "frequency inversion" that invertsthe sound waves to limit eavesdropping. This system provides minimal securityat best. New digital-based cordless phones may provide a slightly greater level ofprotection from the common listener, but most of these phones lack any form ofsophisticated scrambling that would protect eavesdropping by governmentagencies or wealthy opponents. In addition, it is likely that new scanners willsoon be available commercially that will be able to listen in on theseconversations. Cellular phones have the same problems as cordless. They also broadcast overairwaves like a radio. Inexpensive scanners are also available to interceptconversations. A US law requires that newer scanners limit eavesdropping oncertain frequencies but kits are readily available from electronic stores andmail order companies to remove those protections. In addition, some cellularphones can be programmed to act as scanners to intercept other calls. There isalso equipment available to law enforcement, which can track and monitorcellular conversations as they move around a city.[15] New cellular phones use a digital system which will be more difficult tointercept and also provide for clearer conversations. It is also easier tosecure these telephones from eavesdropping. However, intelligence agencies inthe United States and other countries have attempted to restrict the use ofimproved scrambling technology. In Pakistan, the government shut down thecellular phone company until it provided equipment to allow easy over-theair-interception.[16] In the US, the cellulartelephone industry association agreed to adopt a weakened scrambling standardafter pressure from the National Security Agency. Experts who have seen thestandard state that the standard provides little or no protection againsteavesdropping. Intelligence agencies in other countries have also lobbied tolimit the security features in GSM - the international standard for digitalcellular phones. In Australia, the federal government rejected the request ofthe law enforcement agencies and ordered the operator of a new digital cellularsystem to commence operation without the capability to intercept the over theair portion of the conversation.[17] Cellular phones can also provide information on the location of an individualto within a few blocks, depending on the system. When a cellular telephone isturned on, it regularly broadcasts its location to the local transmitters sothat they can direct calls to the correct location. This information can beused to locate the position of a cellular phone and may also be used to trackits location its owner moves around. A related technology, the wireless pager, can also be easily intercepted.Pagers receive signals over the airways with no scrambling. Numerous programsare available for computers that can monitor the entire frequency spectrum thatpagers operate on and automatically retain every message that is sent. Facsimile (fax) Machines It is also possible to intercept facsimile transmissions. A fax machine isessentially an inexpensive computer system that uses a well known standard forsending and receiving files. Most experts describe intercepting faxes as "veryeasy."[18] Commercial devices are widelyavailable that automatically intercept faxes. In New York City, fax interceptmachines were used as far back as 1990 by local police. [19] Defense News reports that numerous countriessell these devices including the United States, the UK, the Czech Republic, andIsrael and that the "many countries are eyeing low-cost systems...also tointercept political and economic-related information...." It is also possibleto intercept faxes using a computer with specialized software and a fax modem.With the widespread use of Digital Audio Tape (DAT), it may also become easierto record a fax transmission and replay it back into a machine with minimumeffort. Thus, fax machines should be considered as insecure as telephones. There are also fax machines available that provide scrambling to preventinterception. These machines usually cost around $US 3,000 and are availableworldwide.[20] Like secure telephones, faxmachines from the United States must have a weakened encryption scheme to allowfor their export. Companies in Sweden, Switzerland, and other Europeancountries claim their machines are not limited because they have no exportlaws. An expert on encryption should be consulted before purchasing thesedevices to ensure their security. It may also be illegal to use such devices. It has been reported that somecountries, such as Singapore and China limit the use of encryption withoutproviding the keys to the government. In China, the use of fax machineswithout a license is prohibited. Telephone Transaction Information Another area of concern is the transactional information created when atelephone call is placed. In most countries, when a call is placed, the number of the called party isrecorded in the telephone company's computers. This can provide criticalinformation on confidential sources and others. In the US, these records arewidely used by law enforcement against reporters to locate leaks ofinformation, and monitor environmentalists and others.[21] In the former USSR, human rights activistAnatole Sharansky reported that the authorities regularly obtained his overseasbilling records to keep track of who he had spoken to.[22] Computer Communications Computer based communications is the newest and most useful tool for humanrights advocates. It provides fast and inexpensive communications to nearlyevery country in the world. Electronic mail can be used quite effectively tocommunicate and distribute information worldwide at low cost. It is alsopossible to create private mailing lists or post information on publicelectronic conferences such as Peacenet or the USENET newsgroups. Eavesdropping of computer communications is not difficult unless measures aretaken to increase security. High speed modem communications (14.4K, 28.8k) aremore technically difficult but can still be intercepted by law enforcement inthe US. Low speed modem communications (1200,2400) are fairly easy tointercept. Once connected to an international network like Internet, new problems arise.Messages pass through numerous machines on the way to their destination.Currently, sending electronic mail is the equivalent of sending a typewrittenpostcard in the mail. It theoretically can be read by anyone in the computerlink between the author and the recipient and there is also no method toconclusively verify the identity of the message originator. Encryption can also be used to protect these communications. Many human rightsgroups are already encrypting their messages. Groups in Central America,Ethiopia and Burma use encryption to protect their communications and files.[23] It was also reported that the AfricanNational Congress developed and used an encrypted e-mail network for yearswithout it being compromised by the security services of South Africa.[24] Encryption can be used to protect the messages and to verify the identity ofthe sending party. Unlike other communications technologies, encryption forcomputers is widely available for free or at minimal cost. It is also easy touse. Many commercial software packages such as Lotus Notes and the plannedfuture versions of the Microsoft and Apple Computer operating systems will havebuilt-in encryption, although the encryption in these products have beenweakened to allow for export. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)[25] by PhilZimmermann, an American software engineer and human rights activist is commonlyused by human rights groups worldwide. It is available for most computers[26] and can be easily configured to work inseveral different languages, including Spanish, French and German. The programis small and can work on nearly all laptop and personal computers, along withlarger systems. PGP uses "public key" encryption. Each user of PGP creates two keys, a publickey and a secret key. The user then gives the public key to whomever they wishto correspond with and can even publish it publicly like a phone number. Thesecret key is kept in a safe place -usually with the PGP program - andprotected by a password. The public key is used by other people to encryptmessages that they send to the secret key holder and only that person canunscramble the messages. Thus, public key cryptography avoids the need to meetin person or to carry codebooks to safely exchange keys and messages. To use PGP, a person writes out a message using a word processor, runs PGP toscramble the message with the recipient's key, then sends the scrambled file asa mail message instead of the original message. The receiver runs PGP tocovert it back to a readable form. The process only takes an additional minuteor two, depending on the length of the message and the processor speed of thecomputer. For some computer systems, programs have been written to make it anautomatic function of electronic mail. Another feature that PGP and other public key systems can provide is "DigitalSignatures," which ensure the identity of the sender of the message in the sameway that a normal signature at the bottom of a letter usually verifies that aletter is from a known corespondent. Signatures are useful when an electronicmessage is sent to ensure that it was not modified or falsely created bysomeone else. Thus, readers of notices from groups which send out electronicalerts, such as Amnesty International, Americas Watch, Helsinki Watch and theTibetan Government-in Exile, can ensure that the alerts have not been alteredby people wishing to disrupt the group's activities. PGP can also be used to protect files on a computer. It can prevent theaccessing of electronically stored papers or correspondence in case there is aphysical break-in and the computer is taken. Many groups in Central America useit to protect their databases of rights abuses. Another useful program to ensure that IBM PC computers are not accessiblewithout a password is Secure File System (SFS) by Peter Gutman. SFS is aprogram which sits between the disk drive and the operating system,transparently encrypting all data as it is written to disk and decrypting itagain as it is read from disk. To the user, it appears - apart from a slightslowdown due to the encryption - as a normal disk drive. In order to access anencrypted drive, it must be first mounted by entering the decryption password.The drive can later be unmounted with a user-defined key combination, after aperiod of inactivity, or when the machine is reset or turned off. Encrypted disks can be converted back to normal disks, or have their contentsquickly and efficiently destroyed. The software includes various stealthfeatures to minimize the possibility of other programs monitoring or alteringits operation. Conclusion New technologies offer new opportunities for human rights advocates.These same technologies also present opportunities for enhanced eavesdroppingby those opposed to the groups' activities. Wiretapping of human rights groups is not uncommon. However, there arelimits, both technical and labor related, to the number of taps that are ineffect at one time. It is impracticable for every phone in a city to bemonitored simultaneously. Nonetheless, human rights organizations may want totake precautions. There are methods available to prevent eavesdropping and caremust be taken to ensure that the devices purchased actually provide an adequatelevel of protection.

On October 1, 1996, the Administration announced a plan to make iteasier for Americans to use stronger encryption products to protecttheir privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information.The plan envisions a worldwide key management infrastructure with theuse of key escrow and key recovery encryption items to promoteelectronic commerce and secure communications while protecting nationalsecurity and public safety. To provide for a transition period for thedevelopment of this key management infrastructure, this rule permitsthe export and reexport of 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strengthencryption items under the authority of a License Exception, if anexporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and/or marketrecoverable encryption items and to help build the supportinginternational infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware andsoftware.DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective December 30, 1996.    Comment Date: February 13, 1997.ADDRESSES: Written comments (six copies) should be sent to: NancyCrowe, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room2705, Washington, D.C. 20230.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James A. Lewis, Office of StrategicTrade and Foreign Policy Controls, Telephone: (202) 482-0092.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Background    Following upon the Administration's October 1 announcement, onNovember 15, 1996, the President issued the Memorandum directing thatall encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List, exceptthose specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, ormodified for military applications, be transferred to the CommerceControl List. The Memorandum and Executive Order 13026 (November 15,1996, 61 FR 58767) also set forth certain additional provisions withrespect to controls on such encryption items to be imposed by theDepartment of Commerce. The Executive Order also provides forappropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination ofencryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List that are placedon the Commerce Control List. In issuing the Memorandum the Presidentstated:    Encryption products, when used outside the United States, canjeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests.Moreover, such products, when used by international criminalorganizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here andabroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other countries.The exportation of encryption products must be controlled to furtherU.S. foreign policy objectives, and promote our national security,including the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.    This initiative will support the growth of electronic commerce;increase the security of the global information infrastructure; protectprivacy, intellectual property and other valuable information; andsustain the economic competitiveness of U.S. encryption productmanufacturers during the transition to a key management infrastructure.Under this initiative, non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bitkey length DES or equivalent strength will be permitted for export andreexport after a one-time review of the strength of the item and if theexporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and/or marketrecoverable encryption items, to support an international keymanagement infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware andsoftware and will last through December 31, 1998.    The initiative addresses important foreign policy and nationalsecurity concerns identified by the President. Export controls oncryptographic items are essential to controlling the spread abroad ofpowerful encryption products which could be harmful to critical U.S.national security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. Thisinitiative will preserve such controls and foster the development of akey management infrastructure necessary to protect important nationalsecurity, foreign policy and law enforcement concerns.    Encryption software can be used to maintain the secrecy ofinformation, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm nationalsecurity, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. As thePresident indicated in E.O. 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15,1996, export of encryption software, like export of encryptionhardware, is controlled because of this functional capacity to encryptinformation on a computer system, and not because of any informationalor theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, orrepresent, or that its export may convey to others abroad. For thisreason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished fromother software regulated under the EAR.    The government recognizes that several factors, including thedevelopment of common international encryption policies, the need foran international key recovery infrastructure, and technological change,will influence market development in key recovery products. At the sametime, the government is committed to a two-year transition period. Thegovernment will continually evaluate progress towards key recoverythroughout and beyond the two-year period and will tailor theimplementation of its policies in consultation with the public.    This interim rule implements the Administration's policy onencryption exports and reexports. This rule amends the ExportAdministration Regulations (EAR) by imposing national security andforeign policy controls (``EI'' for Encryption Items) on certaininformation security systems and equipment, cryptographic devices,software and components specifically designed or modified therefor, andrelated technology (``encryption items'). ``Encryption items'' subjectto the EAR do not include encryption items specifically designed,developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications(including command, control and intelligence applications). Such itemsremain on the U.S. Munitions List, and continue to be controlled by theDepartment of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls. EI controlsapply to encryption software transferred from the U.S. Munitions Listto the Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15,1996 (61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of thesame date.    This interim rule also amends the Export Administration Regulationsby requiring a license for exports and reexports to all destinations,except Canada, of certain encryption items controlled for EI reasons.Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by BXA in conjunction with other agencies to determinewhether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. nationalsecurity and foreign policy interests. Exporters should allow 40 daysfor the processing of licenses, consistent with E.O. 12981. Thelicensing policy is as follows:    (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Certain encryptionsoftware that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to theCommerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996(61 FR 58767) and[[Page 68574]]pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date may be releasedfrom ``EI'' controls and thereby made eligible for mass markettreatment after a one-time BXA review. To determine eligibility formass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification requestto BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may be eligiblefor 15-day processing. See new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 andSec. 748.3(b)(3) for additional information. Note that the one-timereview is for a determination to release encryption software in objectcode only. Exporters requesting release of the source code should referto paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after aone-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EIcontrols, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EARapplicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market software. If BXA determines that the software is not releasedfrom EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to alldestinations, except Canada, and license applications will beconsidered on a case-by-case basis.    (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recoverable encryption softwareand commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlledfor EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, includingencryption equipment designed or modified to use recovery encryptionsoftware, may be made eligible for License Exception KMI after a one-time BXA review. License Exception KMI is available for alldestinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria andSudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classificationrequest to BXA. Requests for one-time review of key escrow and keyrecovery encryption products will receive favorable considerationprovided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agentsatisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to new Supplement No. 5to part 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or othermaterial/information required to decrypt ciphertext as described inSupplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXAand are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR. Ifthe exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, thenthe exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a keyrecovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. In addition,the key escrow or key recovery system must meet the criteria identifiedin Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent oncontinued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agentidentified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the establishment ofa key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take sometime, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, considerexports of key recovery encryption products which facilitateestablishment of the key management infrastructure before a keyrecovery agent is named, consistent with national security and foreignpolicy. When BXA approves such cases, exporters of products describedin Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish the name of anagent by December 31, 1998. Requests for one-time review of recoverableproducts which allow government officials to obtain, under proper legalauthority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, theplaintext of the encrypted data and communications will also receivefavorable consideration.    (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES orequivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketingplan for exporting recoverable items and services. Manufacturers ofnon-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalentstrength will be permitted to export and reexport under the authorityof License Exception KMI, provided that the requirements and conditionsof the License Exception are met. Exporters must submit aclassification request for an initial BXA review of the item and asatisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail thesteps the applicant will take during the two-year transition periodbeginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and/or market encryptionitems and services with recoverable features. Producers would commit toproduce key recovery products. Others would commit to incorporate suchproducts into their own products or services. Plans will be evaluatedin consideration of good faith efforts by the exporter to promote keyrecovery products and infrastructure. Such efforts can include: thescale of key recovery research and development, product development,and marketing plans; significant steps to reflect potential customerdemand for key recovery products in the firm's encryption-relatedbusiness; and how soon a key recovery agent will be identified. Notethat BXA will accept requests for classification of non-recoverableencryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strengthunder this paragraph from distributors, re-sellers, integrators, andother entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items. Theuse of License Exception KMI is not automatic; eligibility must berenewed every six months. Renewal after each six-month period willdepend on the applicant's adherence to explicit benchmarks andmilestones as set forth in the plan approved with the initialclassification request and amendments as approved by BXA. Thisrelaxation of controls and use of License Exception KMI will lastthrough December 31, 1998. The plan submitted with classificationrequests for the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength must include the elements innew Supplement No. 7 to part 742. Note that distributors, re-sellers,integrators, and other entities that are not manufacturers of theencryption items are permitted to use License Exception KMI for exportsand reexports of such items only in instances where a classificationhas been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. Theauthority to so export or reexport will be for a time period ending onthe same day the producer's authority to export or reexport ends.    Exporters authorized to export 56-bit DES or equivalent strengthnon-key recovery products in exchange for commitments to key recoverywill be allowed to service and support the customers of those productsduring and after the two-year period. Support and service includesmaintenance or replacement of products to correct defects or maintainexisting functionality. It also includes upgrades that do not increasethe strength of the encryption in the product.    Exporters authorized to export 56-bit DES or equivalent strengthnon-key recovery products during the interim period may also exportunder a license additional quantities of those 56-bit DES or equivalentstrength non-key recovery products after the two-year period toexisting customers. Such sales may be made to the customers of anyexporter that was authorized to export such products in exchange forkey recovery commitments during the two-year period. The additionalquantities sold may not be disproportionate to the customer's embeddedbase.    (4) All other encryption items--(i) Encryption licensingarrangement. This is intended to continue without change the regulatorytreatment of the distribution and warehouse arrangements currentlypermitted under[[Page 68575]]the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Applicants may submitlicense applications for exports and reexports of certain encryptioncommodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinationsexcept Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan.Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryptionlicensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periodsspecified by the applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In addition,the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXAcertain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address.    (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under anencryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export andreexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for theexport and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on acase-by-case basis.    Note that all ``EI'' encryption items are not subject to anymandatory foreign availability procedures of the EAA or the EAR. Insection 1(a) of Executive Order 13026, the President states:    I have determined that the export of encryption productsdescribed in this section may harm national security and foreignpolicy interests even where comparable products are or appear to beavailable from sources outside the United States, and that facts andquestions concerning the foreign availability of such encryptionproducts cannot be subject to public disclosure or judicial reviewwithout revealing or implicating classified information that couldharm United States national security and foreign policy interests.Accordingly, section 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of the ExportAdministration Act of 1979 (``the EAA'') * * *, all other analogousprovisions of the EAA relating to foreign availability, and theregulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not beapplicable with respect to export controls on such encryptionproducts.    This interim rule amends part 768, Foreign Availability, to makeclear that the provisions of that part do not apply to encryption itemstransferred to the Commerce Control List.    This interim rule also amends part 734 to exclude encryption itemstransferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control Listconsistent with E.O. 13026 (61 FR 58767, November 15, 1996) andpursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date from the deminimis provisions for items exported from abroad. This rule alsoamends part 734 of the EAR to reflect that encryption softwarecontrolled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 that has been transferred tothe Department of Commerce from the Department of State by PresidentialMemorandum will be subject to the EAR even when publicly available. Aprinted book or other printed material setting forth encryption sourcecode is not itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However,notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in electronicform or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains subject tothe EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3)). The administration continues to reviewwhether and to what extent scannable encryption source or object codein printed form should be subject to the EAR and reserves the option toimpose export controls on such software for national security andforeign policy reasons. Note that there is a new definition of ``exportof encryption source code and object code software'' (seeSec. 734.2(b)(9)).    This rule creates a new License Exception KMI for exports ofcertain encryption software and equipment. This rule also amends part740 and Supplement No. 2 to part 774 to reflect that encryptionsoftware will not be eligible for ``mass market'' treatment under theGeneral Software Note or for export as beta-test software under LicenseException BETA unless released from EI controls through a one-time BXAreview (refer to new Supplement No. 6 to part 742). Encryption itemstransferred from the USML to the CCL prior to November 15, 1996 are notcontrolled for EI reasons. Note that License Exception TMP is availablefor temporary exports and reexports of encryption items except underthe provisions for beta-test software. License Exceptions TMP and BAGeffectively replace the Department of State's personal use exemption.Software and technology that was controlled by the Department ofCommerce prior to December 30, 1996 are not affected by this rule andwill continue to be eligible for the publicly available treatment.Software controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to December 30,1996 will continue to be eligible for mass market treatment under theGeneral Software Note, and License Exception TSU for mass-marketsoftware.    For purposes of this rule, ``recovery encryption products'' refersto encryption products (including software) that allow governmentofficials to obtain under proper legal authority and without thecooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of encrypted dataand communications. Such products fulfill the objectives of theAdministration's encryption policy. Other approaches to access andrecovery may be defined in the future.    This interim rule also amends part 742 to reflect the new combinednational security and foreign policy controls imposed by this rule, andadds a new Supplement No. 4 titled ``Key Escrow or Key RecoveryProducts Criteria'' that includes product criteria, a new SupplementNo. 5 titled ``Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Criteria, SecurityPolicies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures'' that includesinterim requirements for key recovery agents, a new Supplement No. 6titled ``Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request for a MassMarket Software Product that contains Encryption'' that includes thecriteria for the one-time review of classification requests for releaseof certain encryption software from EI controls, and a new SupplementNo. 7 titled ``Review Criteria for Exporter Key Escrow or Key RecoveryDevelopment Plans.''    This interim rule also amends part 744 to add a general prohibitionin Sec. 744.9 with respect to technical assistance in the developmentor manufacture abroad of encryption commodities and software controlledfor EI reasons and makes conforming changes throughout the EAR.    This interim rule makes conforming changes in part 748 forclassification requests, amends part 750 of the EAR to reflect theDepartment of Justice role in the review of encryption licenseapplications, adds new definitions to part 772, and amends the CommerceControl List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774) by adding new EI controlsunder ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, and 5E002 for commodities, software andtechnology that are placed under Commerce Department jurisdiction,consistent with E.O. 13026, by Presidential Memorandum.    In certain cases, semiannual reporting requirements on quantitiesshipped and country of destination will be imposed on exporters, inorder to allow the United States to fulfill the reporting requirementsof its international obligations, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement.    The scope of controls on the release to foreign nationals oftechnology and software subject to the EAR may be amended in a separateFederal Register Notice.    This rule involves no new curtailment of exports, because thetransfer or removal of items from the United States Munitions List tothe CCL maintains a continuity of controls. Therefore, the[[Page 68576]]provisions regarding the impact of new controls do not apply, andcontract sanctity also does not apply to this imposition of controls.    U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals issuedby the Department of State prior to December 30, 1996 may shipremaining balances authorized by such licenses or approvals under theauthority of the EAR by filing Shippers Export Declarations (SEDs) withDistrict Directors of Customs, citing this Federal Register Notice andthe State Department license number. Such shipments shall be inaccordance with the terms and conditions, including the expirationdate, existing at the time of issuance of the State license. Anyreports required for distribution and other types of agreementspreviously authorized by the Department of State, valid at the time ofthis publication, should be henceforth submitted to the Department ofCommerce. Actions pending at the Department of State on December 30,1996, including pending license applications, must be refiled with theDepartment of Commerce. Export violations, including the terms andconditions of export, shall hereafter constitute a violation of theEAR.    Consistent with the provisions of section 6 of the ExportAdministration Act, a foreign policy report was submitted to Congresson December 24, 1996, notifying the Congress of the Department'sintention to impose controls on certain information security systemsand equipment, cryptographic devices, software and componentsspecifically designed or modified therefor, and related technology thatwill be controlled on the CCL and that will be subject to new controlprocedures.    Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20,1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic PowersAct and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, theprovisions of the EAA and the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August19, 1994, notice of August 15, 1995 (60 FR 42767), and notice of August14, 1996 (60 FR 42527).Rulemaking Requirements    1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant forpurposes of E.O. 12866. A cost benefit analysis has been prepared andis available upon request by contacting James A. Lewis at (202) 482-0092.    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person isrequired to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penaltyfor failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), unless thatcollection of information displays a currently valid OMB ControlNumber. This rule involves collections of information subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Thesecollections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budgetunder control numbers 0694-0048 and 0694-0088. This rule also containsa new collection-of-information requirement subject to the PRA that hasreceived emergency approval under OMB control number 0694-0104. The newinformation requirement and estimated public burden hours include:marketing plans (40 hours each); semiannual progress reports (8 hourseach); safeguard procedures (4 hours); recordkeeping (2 hours); andannual reports (4 hours). These estimates include the time forreviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering andmaintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing thecollections of information. Send comments regarding these burdenestimates or any other aspect of these collections of information,including suggestions for reducing the burden, to OMB Desk Officer, NewExecutive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.    3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment underExecutive Order 12612.    4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity forpublic participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicablebecause this regulation involves a military and foreign affairsfunction of the United States (Sec. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Further, noother law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and anopportunity for public comment be given for this interim rule. Becausea notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public commentare not required to be given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. or by anyother law, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 et seq.) are not applicable.    However, because of the importance of the issues raised by theseregulations, this rule is issued in interim form and comments will beconsidered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, theDepartment encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do soat the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration oftheir views.    The period for submission of comments will close February 13, 1997.The Department will consider all comments received before the close ofthe comment period in developing final regulations. Comments receivedafter the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, buttheir consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not acceptpublic comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of thematerial be treated confidentially because of its business proprietarynature or for any other reason. The Department will return suchcomments and materials to the person submitting the comments and willnot consider them in the development of final regulations. All publiccomments on these regulations will be a matter of public record andwill be available for public inspection and copying. In the interest ofaccuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform.    Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which willalso be a matter of public record and will be available for publicreview and copying. Communications from agencies of the United StatesGovernment or foreign governments will not be made available for publicinspection.    The public record concerning these regulations will be maintainedin the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information RecordsInspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street andPennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Records in thisfacility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizingthe substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied inaccordance with regulations published in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Codeof Federal Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying ofrecords at the facility may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureauof Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the aboveaddress or by calling (202) 482-5653.    This rule has been determined to be a major rule as defined in 5U.S.C. Sec. 804(2) for purposes of Congressional review under 5 U.S.C.ch. 8. Notwithstanding 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(a)(3), this rule is effectiveDecember 30, 1996 pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. Sec. 808(2) asthere is good cause to waive the requirement to provide notice andpublic procedure thereon. This action implements an Administrationinitiative that is intended to protect the national security andforeign policy interests of the United States and streamlines exportcontrols for encryption items. Therefore,[[Page 68577]]notice and public procedure that would delay implementation of thisrule is contrary to the public interest.List of Subjects15 CFR Part 730    Administrative practice and procedure, Advisory committees,Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Strategic and critical materials.15 CFR Parts 732, 740, 748, 750, and 768    Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade,Reporting and Record keeping requirements.15 CFR Part 734    Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Parts 736, 738, 742, 772, and 774    Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 744    Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and Recordkeeping requirements.

Section 734.2 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(1) and(b)(2)[[Page 68578]]introductory text and by adding a new paragraph (b)(9) to read asfollows:Sec. 734.2  Important EAR terms and principles.* * * * *    (b) Export and reexport--(1) Definition of export. ``Export'' meansan actual shipment or transmission of items subject to the EAR out ofthe United States, or release of technology or software subject to theEAR to a foreign national in the United States, as described inparagraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. See part 772 of the EAR for thedefinition that applies to exports of satellites subject to the EAR.See paragraph (b)(9) of this section for the definition that applies toexports of encryption source code and object code software subject tothe EAR.    (2) Export of technology or software. (See paragraph (b)(9) forprovisions that apply to encryption source code and object codesoftware.) ``Export'' of technology or software, excluding encryptionsoftware subject to ``EI'' controls, includes:* * * * *    (9) Export of encryption source code and object code software.

(Refer to Secs. 742.15(b)(1) and748.3(b) of the EAR for information on item classifications regarding aone-time BXA review for release from EI controls.)* * * * *PART 742--[AMENDED]    25. Part 742 is amended by revising Sec. 742.15 to read as follows:Sec. 742.15  Encryption items.    Encryption items can be used to maintain the secrecy ofinformation, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm nationalsecurity, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. As thePresident indicated in E.O. 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15,1996, export of encryption software, like export of encryptionhardware, is controlled because of this functional capacity to encryptinformation on a computer system, and not because of any informationalor theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, orrepresent, or that its export may convey to others abroad. For thisreason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished fromcontrols on other software regulated under the EAR.    (a) License requirements. Licenses are required for alldestinations, except Canada, for ECCNs having an ``EI'' (for``encryption items'') under the ``Control(s)'' paragraph. Such itemsinclude: encryption commodities controlled under ECCN 5A002; encryptionsoftware controlled under ECCN 5D002; and encryption technologycontrolled under ECCN 5E002. (Refer to part 772 of the EAR for thedefinition of ``encryption items'). For encryption items previously onthe U.S. Munitions List and currently authorized for export or reexportunder a State Department license, distribution arrangement or any otherauthority of the State Department, U.S. persons holding valid USMLlicenses and other approvals issued by the Department of State prior toDecember 30, 1996 may ship remaining balances authorized by suchlicenses or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing ShippersExport Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs, citingthe provisions of this section effective on December 30, 1996 and theState Department license number. Such shipments shall be in accordancewith the terms and conditions, including the expiration date, existingat the time of issuance of the State license. Violations of suchauthorizations, terms and conditions constitute violations of the EAR.Any reports required for distribution and other types of agreementspreviously authorized by the Department of State, valid prior toDecember 30, 1996, should be henceforth submitted to BXA at thefollowing address: Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign PolicyControls, Bureau of Export Administration,[[Page 68581]]Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room2705, Washington, D.C. 20230.    (b) Licensing policy. The following licensing policies apply toitems identified in paragraph (a) of this section. This section refersyou to Supplements No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 to this part 742. Forpurposes of these supplements, ``products'' refers to commodities andsoftware. Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on acase-by-case basis by BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, todetermine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S.national security and foreign policy interests.    (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Consistent with E.O.13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767), certain encryption softwarethat was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the CommerceControl List pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of November 15,1996 may be released from ``EI'' controls and thereby made eligible formass market treatment after a one-time review. To determine eligibilityfor mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classificationrequest to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligiblefor a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may beeligible for 15-day processing. Refer to Supplement No. 6 to part 742and Sec. 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information. Note thatthe one-time review is for a determination to release encryptionsoftware in object code only unless otherwise specifically requested.Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer toparagraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after aone-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EIcontrols, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EARapplicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market software. If BXA determines that the software is not releasedfrom EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to alldestinations, except Canada, and license applications will beconsidered on a case-by-case basis.    (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recoverable encryption softwareand commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlledfor EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, includingencryption equipment designed or modified to use recovery encryptionsoftware, may be made eligible for license exception KMI after a one-time BXA review. License Exception KMI is available for alldestinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria andSudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classificationrequest to BXA. Requests for one-time review of key escrow and keyrecovery encryption items will receive favorable consideration providedthat, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agentsatisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to Supplement No. 5 topart 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or othermaterial/information required to decrypt ciphertext as described inSupplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXAand are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR. Ifthe exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, thenthe exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a keyrecovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. In addition,the key escrow or key recovery system must meet the criteria identifiedin Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent oncontinued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agentidentified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the establishment ofa key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take sometime, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, considerrequests for eligibility to export key recovery encryption productswhich facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructurebefore a key recovery agent is named, consistent with national securityand foreign policy. When BXA approves such cases, exporters of productsdescribed in Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish thename of an agent by December 31, 1998. Requests for one-time review ofrecoverable products which allow government officials to obtain, underproper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of theuser, the plaintext of the encrypted data and communications willreceive favorable consideration.    (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES orequivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketingplan for exporting recoverable items and services. (i) Manufacturers ofnon-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalentstrength will be permitted to export and reexport under the authorityof License Exception KMI provided that the requirements and conditionsof the License Exception are met. Exporters must submit aclassification request for an initial BXA review of the item and asatisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail thesteps the applicant will take during the two-year transition periodbeginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and/or market encryptionitems and services with recoverable features. Manufacturers wouldcommit to produce key recovery products. Others would commit toincorporate such products into their own products or services. Suchefforts can include: the scale of key recovery research anddevelopment, product development, and marketing plans; significantsteps to reflect potential customer demand for key recovery products inthe firm's encryption-related business; and how soon a key recoveryagent will be identified. Note that BXA will accept requests forclassification of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit keylength DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph fromdistributors, re-sellers, integrators, and other entities that are notmanufacturers of the encryption items. The use of License Exception KMIis not automatic; eligibility must be renewed every six months. Renewalafter each six-month period will depend on the applicant's adherence toexplicit benchmarks and milestones as set forth in the plan approvedwith the initial license classification and amendments as approved byBXA. This relaxation of controls and use of License Exception KMI willlast through December 31, 1998. The plan submitted with classificationsfor the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit keylength DES or equivalent strength must include the elements inSupplement No. 7 to part 742.    (ii) BXA will make a determination on such classification requestswithin 15 days of receipt. Exports and reexports of non-recoverableencryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strengthwill be authorized under the provisions of License Exception KMI,contingent upon BXA's review and approval of a satisfactory progressreport related to the ongoing plan submitted by the applicant. Theapplicant must submit a letter to BXA every six months requestingapproval of the progress report. Note that distributors, re-sellers,integrators, or other entities that are not manufacturers of theencryption items are permitted to use License Exception KMI for exportsand reexports of such items only in instances where a classificationhas been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items or aclassification has been granted to the distributors, re-sellers,integrators, or other entities. The authority to so export or reexportwill be for a time period[[Page 68582]]ending on the same day the producer's authority to export or reexportends.    (4) All other encryption items--(i) Encryption licensingarrangement. Applicants may submit license applications for exports andreexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimitedquantities for all destinations except, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, NorthKorea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved withextended validity periods specified by the applicant in block #24 onForm BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the salesterritory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require thelicense holder to report to BXA certain information such as itemdescription, quantity, value, and end-user name and address.    (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under anencryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export andreexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for theexport and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on acase-by-case basis.    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are notavailable for license applications reviewed under this section.    (d) [Reserved]    26. Part 742 is amended by revising Supplement No. 4 and SupplementNo. 5, and by adding a new Supplement No. 6 and a new Supplement No. 7to read as follows:Supplement No. 4 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery ProductsCriteriaKey Recovery Feature    (1) The key(s) or other material/information required to decryptciphertext shall be accessible through a key recovery feature.    (2) The product's cryptographic functions shall be inoperableuntil the key(s) or other material/information required to decryptciphertext is recoverable by government officials under proper legalauthority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user.    (3) The output of the product shall automatically include, in anaccessible format and with a reasonable frequency, the identity ofthe key recovery agent(s) and information sufficient for the keyrecovery agent(s) to identify the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt the ciphertext.    (4) The product's key recovery functions shall allow access tothe key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt theciphertext regardless of whether the product generated or receivedthe ciphertext.    (5) The product's key recovery functions shall allow for therecovery of all required decryption key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext during a period ofauthorized access without requiring repeated presentations of accessauthorization to the key recovery agent(s).Interoperability Feature    (6) The product's cryptographic functions may interoperate with:    (i) Other key recovery products that meet these criteria, andshall not interoperate with products whose key recovery feature hasbeen altered, bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative;and    (ii) Non-key recovery products only when the key recoveryproduct permits access to the key(s) or other material/informationneeded to decrypt ciphertext generated or received (i.e., onedirection at a minimum) by the key recovery product.Design, Implementation and Operational Assurance    (7) The product shall be resistant to efforts to disable orcircumvent the attributes described in criteria one through six.    (8) The product's cryptographic function's key(s) or othermaterial/information required to decrypt ciphertext shall beescrowed with a key recovery agent(s) (who may be a key recoveryagent(s) internal to the user's organization) acceptable to BXA,pursuant to the criteria in Supplement No. 5 to Part 742. Since theestablishment of a key management infrastructure and key recoveryagents may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure isbeing built, consider exports of key recovery encryption productswhich facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructurebefore a key recovery agent is named.    Exporters of products described in this Supplement No. 4 to part742 are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31,1998.Supplement No. 5 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery AgentCriteria, Security Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery ProceduresKey Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Requirements; Security Policies; KeyEscrow or Key Recovery Procedures    This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department ofCommerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approvalof the export or reexport of key recovery encryption itemscontrolled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Anyarrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the key recoveryagent must reflect the provisions contained in this Supplement in amanner satisfactory to BXA, in conjunction with other agencies. ThisSupplement outlines the criteria for employing key recovery agentpersonnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for eligibilityto export or reexport key recovery items shall provide, or cause theproposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXA sufficientinformation concerning any proposed key recovery agent arrangementsto permit BXA's evaluation of the key recovery agent's securitypolicies, key recovery procedures, and suitability andtrustworthiness to maintain the confidentiality of the key(s) orother material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. The keyrecovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicantfor the classification request. When there is no key recovery agentinvolved, or the customer will self-escrow abroad, with or without alegal obligation to the exporter, the customer must be approved byBXA. BXA retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, torevoke eligibility for License Exception KMI if BXA determines thata key recovery agent no longer meets these criteria. Therequirements related to the suitability and trustworthiness,security policies, and key recovery procedures of the key recoveryagent shall be made terms and conditions of the License Exceptionfor key recovery items. BXA shall require the key recovery agent toprovide a representation that it will comply with such terms andconditions.    Note: Use of key recovery agents located outside the U.S. ispermitted if acceptable to BXA in consultation with the hostgovernment, as appropriate.I. Key Recovery Agent Requirements    (1)(a) A key recovery agent must identify by name, date andplace of birth, and social security number, individual(s) who:    (i) Is/are directly involved in the escrowing of key(s) or othermaterial/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (ii) Have access to key(s) or other material/informationrequired to decrypt ciphertext, or    (iii) Have access to information concerning requests for key(s)or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (iv) Respond to requests for key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (v) Is/are in control of the key recovery agent and have accessor authority to obtain key(s) or other material/information requiredto decrypt ciphertext, and    (b) Must certify that such individual(s) meet the requirementsof the following paragraphs (b)(i) or (b)(ii). BXA reserves theright to determine at any time the suitability and trustworthinessof such individual(s). Evidence of an individual's suitability andtrustworthiness shall include:    (i) Information indicating that the individual(s):    (A) Has no criminal convictions of any kind or pending criminalcharges of any kind;    (B) Has not breached fiduciary responsibilities (e.g., has notviolated any surety or performance bonds); and    (C) Has favorable results of a credit check; or,    (ii) Information that the individual(s) has an active U.S.government security clearance of Secret or higher issued or updatedwithin the last five years.    (2) The key recovery agent shall timely disclose to BXA when anindividual no longer meets the requirements of paragraphsI.(1)(b)(i) or (ii).    (3) A key recovery agent must, to remain eligible for LicenseException KMI, identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, andsocial security number any new individual(s)[[Page 68583]]who will assume the responsibilities set forth in paragraph I.(1)(a)of this Supplement. Before that individual(s) assumes suchresponsibilities, the key recovery agent must certify to BXA thatthe individual(s) meets the criteria set forth in subparagraphsI.(1)(b)(i) or (b)(ii) of this Supplement. BXA reserves the right todetermine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness of suchpersonnel.    (4) If ownership or control of a key recovery agent istransferred, no export may take place under previously issuedapprovals until the successor key recovery agent complies with thecriteria of this Supplement.    (5) Key recovery agents shall submit suitable evidence of thekey recovery agent's corporate viability and financialresponsibility (e.g., a certificate of good standing from the stateof incorporation, credit reports, and errors/omissions insurance).    (6) Key recovery agents shall disclose to BXA any of thefollowing which have occurred within the ten years prior to theapplication:    (a) Federal or state felony convictions of the business;    (b) Material adverse civil fraud judgments or settlements; and    (c) Debarments from federal, state, or local governmentcontracting.    The applicant shall also timely disclose to BXA the occurrenceof any of the foregoing during the use of License Exception KMI.    (7) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) to bethe security and operations officer(s).    (8) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user'sorganization and may consist of one or more individuals. BXA mayapprove such key recovery agents if sufficient information isprovided to demonstrate that appropriate safeguards will be employedin handling key recovery requests from government entities. Thesesafeguards should ensure: the key recovery agent's structuralindependence from the rest of the organization; security; andconfidentiality.II. Security Policies    (1) Key recovery agents must implement security policies thatassure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of thekey(s) or other material/information required for decryption of theciphertext.    (a) Procedures to assure confidentiality shall include:    (i) Encrypting all key(s) or other material/information requiredto decrypt ciphertext while in storage, transmission, or transfer;or    (ii) Applying reasonable measures to limit access to thedatabase (e.g. using keyed or combination locks on the entrances toescrow facilities and limiting the personnel with knowledge of oraccess to the keys/combinations).    (b) Procedures to assure the integrity of the database (i.e.assuring the key(s) and other material/information required todecrypt ciphertext are protected against unauthorized changes) shallinclude the use of access controls such as database passwordcontrols, digital signatures, system auditing, and physical accessrestrictions.    (c) Procedures to assure the availability of the database (i.e.assuring that key(s) and other material/information required todecrypt ciphertext are retrievable at any time) shall include systemredundance, physical security, and the use of cryptography tocontrol access.    (2) Policies and procedures shall be designed and operated sothat a failure by a single person, procedure, or mechanism does notcompromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability ofkey(s)or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext.Security policies and procedures may include, but are not limitedto, multi-person control of access to recoverable keys, split keys,and back-up capabilities.    (3) Key recovery agents shall implement policies that protectagainst unauthorized disclosure of information regarding whoseencryption material is stored, the fact that key(s) or othermaterial/information required to decrypt ciphertext was requested orprovided, and the identity of a requester. Procedures to assure theconfidentiality of this information shall include those described inparagraph II.(1)(a) of this supplement.    (4) Key recovery agents shall provide to BXA prompt notice of acompromise of a security policy or of the confidentiality of key(s)or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext.III. Key Recovery Procedures    (1) Key recovery agents shall maintain the ability to make thekey(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertextavailable until notified otherwise by BXA. Key recovery agents shallmake requested key(s) or other material/information required todecrypt ciphertext available, to the extent required by the request,within two hours from the time they receive a request from agovernment agency acting under appropriate legal authority.    (2) Key recovery agents shall maintain data regarding keyrecovery requests received, release of key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, database changes, systemadministration access, and dates of such events for purposes ofaudits by BXA.    (3) The key recovery agent must transfer all key recoveryequipment, key(s) and/or other material/information required todecrypt ciphertext, key recovery database, and all administrativeinformation necessary to its key recovery operations to another keyrecovery agent approved by BXA in the event that:    (a) The key recovery agent dissolves or otherwise terminatesescrowing operations, or    (b) BXA determines that there is a risk of such dissolution ortermination, or    (c) BXA determines that the key recovery agent is no longersuitable or trustworthy.Supplement No. 6 to Part 742--Guidelines for Submitting aClassification Request for a Mass Market Software Product That ContainsEncryption    Classification requests for release of certain mass marketencryption software from EI controls must be submitted on Form BXA-748P, in accordance with Sec. 748.3 of the EAR.

Davies Department of Law University Of Essex United Kingdom Simon@privint.demon.co.uk "Information Technology & People", Vol 7, No. 4 1994 Abstract The evolution of information technology is likely to result in intimateinterdependence between humans and technology. This fusion has beencharacterized in popular science fiction as chip implantation. It is, however,more likely to take the form of biometric identification using suchtechnologies as fingerprints, hand geometry and retina scanning. Some applications of biometric identification technology are nowcost-effective, reliable, and highly accurate. As a result, biometric systemsare being developed in many countries for such purposes as social securityentitlement, payments, immigration control and election management. Whether ornot biometry delivers on its promise of high-quality identification, it willimperil individual autonomy. Widespread application of the technologies wouldconflict with contemporary values, and result in a class of outcasts. INTRODUCTION The accurate identification of individuals is a key concern for many governmentagencies and corporations. It is important to them because it contributessignificantly to administrative efficiency and the control of fraud, and canoffer benefits to clients as well. A key focus of information systems securityin recent years has been the intensification of efforts to establish accurateidentity. The application of identification systems involves conflict between twoconditions. On the one hand, flawed identity checking results in unnecessaryduplication, fraud, and client disruption, with resultant costs and risks; andon the other, a rigorous identification procedure is invasive, and itseffectiveness may be undermined by unpopularity and resultant falsification andevasion. Three conventional forms of identification are in use today. The first issomething you have, such as a card. The second form is something you know,such as a password or PIN. The third is something you are, such as a patternof ridges on a fingertip; or something you do, such as writing or speaking.This third form of identification is known as 'biometrics'. Schemes based on the items and knowledge which people possess have manyweaknesses. For example, fake 'blanks' of even the highest integrity cards aregenerally available in East Asian countries within weeks of the first cardsbeing issued (Davies 1992a, p.42). The general availability of sophisticatedmanufacturing equipment has placed the ability to forge such documents into thehands of a much wider group of criminals than was previously the case (Carroll1991, pp. 10-13). A high-integrity biometric system appears, from the perspective of informationusers, to be an ideal solution to such problems. The development andapplication of technical standards has meant that communications among theinformation systems of different organisations is increasingly simple. Theapplication of a biometrically-based identifier for each individual would be anatural further step. Yet, from the perspective of individuals, any move towards a biometricidentifier carries enormous risk. Many systems do not live up to expectationsbecause they prove unable to cope with the enormous variations among largepopulations, or fail to take into account the practicalities of humanbehaviour, and the needs of people. Individual autonomy and freedoms may becompromised by the need for a high level of compliance with the scheme. Inmany western nations, the stigma of criminality is associated withfingerprinting, and, by association, with other biometric techniques. If ascheme is applied across multiple organisations, behaviour in relation to oneorganisation might lead to a domino effect of 'cross-enforcement' activities,involving suspension of entitlements or benefits by other organisations.Individuals who cannot, or will not, use the prescribed system may becomeoutcasts on the edge of society. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of biometric systems, anddiscuss the justifications for its implementation and the dangers inherent inthem. Because biometric technologies, their application, and their workingenvironment are all in their infancy, the research on which this paper is basedhas relied heavily on case studies, literature search, primarily in the popularand trade press, and interviews with leading figures in the field. Whereapplicable, studies and working documents have been incorporated. BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES Biometrics has been applied in a variety of ways since at least the time of thePharaohs, who used height measurement. Automated biometric technology wasfirst applied in controlling access to premises and to computer networks.Modern biometric schemes generally rely on sophisticated computer scanningtechnology, of such aspects of the body and its behaviour as the micro-visualpattern on the retina, the geometry of the hand or a finger, the patterns onthe surface of the skin of the thumb or fingers, the aural pattern of thevoice, the pattern of handwriting or signatures, and facial appearance. Ineach case, an artifact analyses a sample presented to it, and compares themeasurement with a verified sample digitally stored in the system. In recent years, biometric technology has attained a very high degree ofsophistication, and accuracy has been achieved at a level which far surpassesall other forms of identification. The Iriscan system, for example, conducts ascan of the eye, and, according to claims made by the manufacturer, isgenerally accurate to 1015 on the first scan, and 1022 onthe second (BTT 1993a). Iris recognition does, however, suffer from theshortcoming that many people feel very sensitive and protective of their eyes,and find such technology disquieting. To address at least some of thisconcern, research is currently underway to scan the eye at a range of up tothree meters. Currently the most popular form of biometry is fingerprinting. Nationalcomputerised fingerprint systems exist in several countries, the first nationalsystem having been established in Australia in 1987. The Japanesetelecommunications giant NTT recently announced the development of afingerprint recognition method that it claims provides further improvements inspeed and accuracy. Recognition of a fingerprint takes place in an average of2 seconds on a personal computer or 1 second on a workstation, with accuracyclaimed to be above 99.9%. Among its diverse potential applications, it couldbe used to confirm that the bearer of an identification card is the person towhom it was issued (TA 1993). Meanwhile, the Biometric Technologies Company ofthe U.S.A. is developing a fingerprinting system using neural networks.Laboratory tests commissioned by the manufacturer are reported to show anaccuracy of 0.0001% and a probability of wrongly rejecting a genuine client of0.1%. Known as Printscan 3, the device is intended for release in the earlypart of 1995 at a cost of $US600 per unit (BTT 1993b). Hand geometry, involving a scan of the shape and characteristics of the entirehand, has been applied in a variety of situations in over 4,000 locationsincluding the Colombian legislature, the San Francisco International Airport, aday care centre at Lotus Corporation in the U.S.A. and a Los Angeles sperm bank(Miller 1994, p.25). Evaluation of biometric technologies will be essential to their acceptance, butto date only limited independent testing has been undertaken. In 1991, theU.S. Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories released the resultsof its second round of tests. The significance of these results remains opento question, however, since they assessed equipment from only six U.S. vendors:Indentix's Touchlock fingerprint system, Recognition Systems' ID-3D-U handgeometry system, Eyedentify's Model 8.5 retinal scan system, Autosig's Sign/Onsignature dynamics system, and Alpha Micro's Ver-a-tel and InternationalElectronics' VoiceKey voice verification systems (Sherman R.L. 1993). The tests showed that dynamic signature verification was by far the cheapest ofthe evaluated products, although it rejected a high proportion of properlyenrolled individuals. Hand geometry had a very low rate of false rejections,especially if more than one attempt was made, and was very much better thansignature dynamics in this respect; however it cost more than twice as much. CASE STUDIES In order to provide some depth of understanding of the nature ofbiometrics-based identification, this paper documents several schemes. Thefirst is a single-purpose scheme in pilot operation, and the second amulti-purpose system currently under development. Several other applicationsare identified. National Border Crossings In 1993, the U.S. immigration authorities opened a new lane at New York's JohnF. Kennedy airport. It differs from traditional immigration procedures in thatit uses biometric technology called FAST (Future Automated Screening forTravellers) to automatically identify and process passengers in as little astwenty seconds. The project is called INSPASS (Immigration and Naturalisation Service PassengerAccelerated Service System). Applicants for registration are interviewed, andtheir identity confirmed. They place the palm of a hand onto the surface of ascanner, which records measurements of the hand's contours. These areconverted into a 'template' and stored on a card. This is currently a papercard, but is soon to be a 'smart card'. In case the hand geometry systemproves to be inadequate, fingerprints are also taken and recorded. When INSPASS members arrive at the two test airports (John F. Kennedy andNewark), they bypass the main immigration queues, and enter a kiosk. The cardis presented to the terminal. The hand is placed onto a scanner, which matchesthe biometry of the hand with the template encoded into the card. Immigrationdatabases are consulted. Once the last of five green lights appear at the tipsof the fingers, the glass exit door opens, and the passenger continues to thebaggage claim and customs zone. INSPASS is currently operating as a voluntary system for frequent travellers toand from the U.S.A., who are U.S. or Canadian nationals, or nationals ofcountries involved in the U.S. visa waiver scheme. More than thirty thousandpeople have so far enrolled, and by mid-1994 this was increasing by onethousand per week. Governments in 26 countries are monitoring and cooperatingwith the project (BTT 1993b, Davies 1994b). If the INSPASS trial is successful, the technology may render conventionalidentification card and passport systems redundant. As a trade-off for fasterimmigration processing, passengers are accepting a system which has thepotential to generate an increased amount of international traffic in theirpersonal data. INS officials appear confident that a multi-purpose scheme canbe established, using common international standards and a smart-card systemthat can cope with either a hand geometry or a fingerprint scan. Immigrationcontrol could be linked to a wide spectrum of information, such as police andtaxation systems. The system has been approved by a preliminary feasibility audit, and looksincreasingly like being implemented in several countries. The trial may be theforerunner of a linked biometric system that involves many nations. Social Welfare In the Canadian province of Ontario, there is considerable public concern aboutthe existence of nearly twelve million identities in the health system of aprovince with a population of ten million. It is perceived that many U.S.citizens are using Canadian health care facilities without entitlement. Toaddress the problem, the provincial government is developing a proposal for agovernment-wide biometric scheme variously called the Ontario Client PositiveIdentifier Proposal or Service Card Ontario. It is being championed by theCommunity Services Department of Metro Toronto, an agency which disseminatesaround $Can2 billion ($US1.4 billion) per annum in welfare services. A committee representing the majority of Ontario Departments is currentlydiscussing mutual identification and administration problems, and the potentialfor creating a universal strategy for dealing with these issues (Davies 1994a).Officials are hopeful that a register of thumb scans can be established by 1996as the basis for a 'once-and-for-all' identity. Scanners would be located atmany locations in all Ontario Government agencies, and connected to athumb-scan registry and to the computers of relevant agencies. Discussions areunderway with Federal agencies with regard to integration with immigrationsystems. The Request For Information (TMS 1993) envisaged that the system wouldinvolve: - digitised photographs and hand geometry stored in a central database; - a plastic identity card, possibly with a magnetic strip, containing facialimage, client signature, client date of birth, a variety of security features,and possibly a fingerprint; - authorised users at multiple sites using data scanned from a person's hand tosearch the databank for matches; and - interfaces with existing information systems. Five of thirteen companies providing submissions were shortlisted. Theprincipal difficulty for suppliers appeared to be the capability to interfacewith existing technologies. A Request For Proposal was subsequently issued(TMS 1994). The total cost for hardware, software, maintenance, training andperipherals was indicated to be in the range of $Can3-4 million. According toproject staff, this expenditure would be recovered from administrative andpayments savings. The project team recognises that there are significantadministrative barriers, but hopes to overcome them. The Department has announced that it intends pursuing a policy of 'openness andhonesty' in the development of the system, and will appoint an external adviserto monitor its performance and impact. The Privacy Commissioner for Ontario,however, has had minimal involvement to date, and has expressed gravereservations about it. Issues of identification are still divisive in Canada(Phillips 1994), and the pursuit of the project may require considerablepolitical will. Emergent Applications Reports in the trade press suggest that biometric systems are being developedfor a wide spectrum of purposes. Major retail and banking organisations inAustralia, Europe and North America are adopting biometric systems for internalsecurity. Blue Cross and Blue Shield in the U.S.A. have plans to introducenationwide fingerprinting for hospital patients. This may be extended intoother medical applications. The Jamaican Government is planning to introduceelectronic thumb scanning to control elections. Social Security verificationusing biometrics is being planned in several countries including Spain andSouth Africa (BTT 1994a, 1994b). In 1994, the U.K. Department of Social Security (DSS) developed a proposal tointroduce a national identification card, which it is hoped will assist inreducing the estimated [[sterling]]1 billion of welfare fraud annually. TheDSS recommended a computerised database of hand-prints of all of the 30 millionpeople receiving a government benefit. Applicants for a benefit or subsidywould have their hand-prints tested against existing entries (Sherman J. 1993). The proposal is expected to be one of the options contained in a Green Paperon an identification card, to be released in the Spring of 1995. In Europe, tests are being undertaken of the feasibility of storingcard-holders' fingerprints on their credit cards, so that a device at the pointof purchase can compare the card-borne data with the bearer's fingerprint. InAustralia, the technology is being applied to staff who access automated tellermachines. Government officials in The Netherlands say that biometrics has a"real chance" of being accepted as a form of identification. According to theChip Card Platform, which is coordinating the project, there has been apolitical 'change of wind' in recent years, and an understanding amongst thepublic of the role of information technology. Officials acknowledge that thischange of attitude has taken them by surprise (Davies 1994a). THE ACHIEVABILITY OF BIOMETRICS' POTENTIAL BENEFITS The potential benefits of an integrated biometrics-based identification systeminclude improvements in: - the cost of administration; - the integrity of identification; - the integrity of information; - access to information held by organisations; - the speed of delivery of services and benefits; - the accuracy and quality of research and statistics; and - the level of technical security of communications. In many countries, information technology is being successfully applied toparticular business and administrative functions within particularorganisations. The majority of these success stories have in common amanageable size, a limited geographic spread, a single purpose, and modest andeasily defined goals. Where biometric technologies are applied to specificpurposes, some confidence may be felt in the system's ability to deliver theintended benefits. On the other hand, many failures and disappointments continue to occur, evenamong seemingly straightforward projects. A report commissioned by the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services noted that a vast gulf exists betweenthe promise and the reality of savings from computer systems (HHS 1993). Astudy by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment found thatcomputer-based information systems, once implemented, often result in"unforeseen costs, unfulfilled promises, and disillusionment" (OTA 1993). Large-scale government schemes have been shown in several countries to be muchless cost-effective than was originally estimated. Years after the governmentsof the United States and Australia developed schemes to match public sectordata, there is still no clear evidence that the strategy has succeeded inachieving its goals. The audit agencies of both federal governments have castdoubt that computer matching schemes deliver savings. Achieving the potentialbenefits of large-scale applications of information technology is difficult,and the outcomes are erratic, unpredictable, and commonly considerably lessthan expected. Complex systems embody greater levels of risk of failure, and resultantvulnerability of organisations and individuals dependent on them. An exampleof this was the shutdown of more than half of AT&T's network due to acomputer virus in the network switching system (Davies 1990). The greater thecomplexity of a system, the more permutations of failure appear to be created.The case for multi-faceted integration of complex personal information systems,whether or not based on biometrics, must be viewed with some skepticism. THE DANGERS OF BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION The pursuit of high-quality identification involves significant technical,organisational, social, legal and political issues. Many of the these areconcerns about computerisation in general, and the sharing of data amongorganisations in particular. For a review of the dangers of data surveillanceto individuals and society, see Clarke (1988). Biometric identification relies on technology that is far from proven, andmajor organisational adjustments are needed to cope with it. There are manypractical problems involved in complex and largely automated schemes, and incoping with exceptions, system outages and claims of database error. Theimposition of intrusive identification procedures changes the nature ofrelationships and transactions between clients and organisations. There is atleast a perceived, and probably a real, increase in the power of organisationsover individuals. Biometrics, much more so than other identification schemes,may imperil the sense of individuality. Systems that entail a central registry of personal identities raise much moresubstantial issues. The adequacy of data protection laws in dealing with theseissues to the satisfaction of the public is in doubt. A biometric print may,for example, be considered to be in the public domain. Alternatively, peoplemay find that they are required to provide a biometric print in many unforeseenor unintended future circumstances. The history of identification systems throughout the world provides evidence of'function creep' - application to additional purposes not announced, or perhapseven intended, at the commencement of the scheme. Uses of the Social SecurityNumber in the U.S.A, the Social Insurance Number in Canada, the Tax File Numberin Australia, the SOFI number in The Netherlands, and the Austrian SocialSecurity Number have been extended progressively to include taxation,unemployment support, pensioner benefits, and in some cases health and highereducation. The existence of a relatively high-integrity scheme would createirresistible temptations to apply it widely, and inter-relate many hithertoseparate collections of personal information (Holvast 1991, Clarke 1992, Davies1992a). Privacy protection involves resistance to the establishment or consolidation ofmonolithic information systems. Informational chaos and functional separationamongst agencies have ensured that the individual has not become a servant tothe state. Variety, choice, and chaos have also had the effect of insuring thefree movement, rights, and free choice of individuals against errors in thesystem. Several countries, including Australia, Canada, the United States and NewZealand, have witnessed public disquiet over identification schemes. Abstractfears that have been cited include : - that people will be de-humanised by being reduced to codes; - that the system will enhance the power over individuals of particularorganisations and the State; - that high-integrity identification embodies an inversion of the appropriaterelationship between the citizen and the State; - that the system is a hostile symbol of authority; - that society is becoming driven by technology-assisted bureaucracy, ratherthan by elected government; - that exemptions and exceptions will exist for powerful individuals andorganisations, and that the system will entrench fraud and criminality; and - that such identification schemes are the mechanism foretold in religiousprophecy (e.g. 'the Mark of the Beast'). There is some evidence that the public may be moving away from traditionalnotions of privacy, and cautiously accepting fraud control and administrativemechanisms that would have been politically untenable in the 1970s and 1980s.For example, both the Dutch and Australian public rejected national informationand identification schemes en masse several years ago, but have reactedmore passively to equally intrusive (though less blatant) schemes in the 1990s.In Germany, where the introduction of an identity card caused major controversyfifteen years ago, the public now appears to be more willing to accept anational 'smart card' scheme for the health sector. There may be many factors at work in the apparently greater public acceptanceof privacy-invasive schemes. Proposals are being brought forward in a morecareful and piecemeal fashion, which may be lulling the public into a falsesense of security. There is increasing popularity of computers and networksfor personal use. The use of personal information systems by Nazi Germany toenable the identification and location of a target race are becoming a vaguememory. It is an open question, however, as to whether public acceptance is real, oronly apparent. A change of attitude may merely await a catalyst.Alternatively, an increasing proportion of people may ignore official processesand organisations and opt instead for 'black markets' and 'black society'.Many countries have substantial sub-cultures of outcasts, usually resultingfrom poverty, racial differences or illegal immigration. To these may be addeda significant number of people who choose not to participate in a generalidentification scheme. CONCLUSIONS Biometry is, in many senses, a natural extension of technological evolution.Like the modern automobile, it signals an intimacy with the client. Whetherthe public senses a danger in the establishment of such a fusion will depend onits sensitivity to privacy and autonomy. High-quality identification offers the promise of the avoidance of error andfraud, and privacy advocates often have difficulty expressing their oppositionto it. Nevertheless, the use of biometrics needs to conform to the standardsand expectations of a privacy-minded society. Specific-purpose biometricschemes raise serious issues which need to be addressed. General-purposeschemes represent real threats to the fabric of contemporary society.

Full Text of Report (remote fast link) or (local slow link) Link to US State Department 1994 Human Rights Guide Glossary of acronyms and terms SUMMARY This report presents a detailed analysis of the international trade insurveillance technology. Its' primary concern is the flow of sophisticatedcomputer-based technology from developed countries to developing countries -and particularly to non-democratic regimes. It is in this environment wheresurveillance technologies become technologies of political control. Surveillance technologies can be defined as technologies which can monitor,track and assess the movements, activities and communications of individuals.These include an array of visual recording devices, bugging equipment, computerinformation systems and identification systems. These innovations are used bymilitary, police and intelligence authorities as technologies of repression. The surveillance trade is almost indistinguishable from the arms trade. Morethan seventy per cent of companies manufacturing and exporting surveillancetechnology also export arms, chemical weapons, or military hardware.Surveillance is a crucial element for the maintenance of any non-democraticinfrastructure, and is an important activity in the pursuit of intelligence andpolitical control. Many countries in transition to democracy also rely heavilyon surveillance to satisfy the demands of police and military. The technologydescribed in this report makes possible mass surveillance of populations. Inthe past, regimes relied on targeted surveillance. Big Brother Incorporated is the first investigation ever conducted intothis trade. Privacy International intends to update the report from time totime as more information becomes available. The report identifies the trade with such countries as Nigeria, China, Angola,Rwanda Zambia and Indonesia. More than 80 British companies are involved,making the UK the world leader in this field. Other countries, in order ofsignificance, are the United States, France, Israel, the Netherlands andGermany. It is derived from company information, trade fair data, annual reports andmedia reports. It lists the companies, their directors, products and exports.In each case, source material is meticulously cited. Addresses and contactnumbers are as current as possible but in some cases these will be out ofdate. OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT Numerous investigations and reports in the past decade have highlighted theextent to which the global arms trade nurtures and supports brutal andrepressive regimes across the world. The industry and its participants havebeen put under the microscope by a number of parliamentary inquiries in Europeand North America. Without exception, these have uncovered a complex andprofitable trade with few controls and with no ethical compass. Big Brother Incorporated is concerned with a parallel activity involvingmany companies involved in the arms trade. The international trade insurveillance technology (sometimes known as the Repression Trade) involves themanufacture and export of technologies of political control. These technologiesinvolve sophisticated computer-based technology which vastly increases thepower of authorities. Amongst the products involved are : * telephone interception equipment * bugging devices * police and military information systems * ID cards * "System X" telephone systems * communications logging systems * micro-cameras * parabolic microphones * automatic transcription systems * infra red scopes * night vision equipment * advanced CCTV equipment * geographic information systems * vehicle tracking technology * automated fingerprint systems * biometric technology * cellular intercept systems * computer intercept systems * crowd analysis and monitoring technology * data matching programs Much of this technology is used to track the activities of dissidents, humanrights activists, journalists, student leaders, minorities, trade unionleaders, and political opponents. It is also useful for monitoring largersectors of the population. With this technology, the financial transactions,communications activity and geographic movements of millions of people can becaptured, analyzed and transmitted cheaply and efficiently. The emerginginformation and communications infrastructures of countries can be hijacked forlimitless surveillance purposes. In the absence of meaningful legal or constitutional protections, suchtechnology is inimical to democratic reform. It can certainly prove fatal toanyone "of interest" to a regime. Western surveillance technology is providing invaluable support to military andtotalitarian authorities throughout the world. British computer firm ICL(International Computers Limited) provided the technological infrastructure toestablish the South African automated Passbook system, upon which much of thefunctioning of the Apartheid regime depended. In the late 1970s SecuritySystems International supplied security technology to Idi Amin's brutal regimein Uganda. In the 1980s, Israeli company Tadiram developed and exported the technology forthe computerized death list used by the Guatemalan police. Meanwhile, companiessuch as PK Electronics routinely provide the Chinese authorities with buggingequipment and telephone tapping devices. The extent of Western support for inhumane regimes is widespread. The notorioushuman rights abuses in Indonesia - particularly those affecting East Timor -would not be possible without the strategic and technological support ofWestern companies. Amongst those companies supplying the Indonesian police andmilitary with surveillance and targeting technology are Morpho Systems(France), De la Rue Printak (UK), EEV Night Vision (UK), ICL (UK), MarconiRadar and Control Systems (UK), Pyser (UK), Siemens Plessey Defense Systems(UK) Rockwell International Corporation (USA) and SWS Security (USA). These andother corporations supply the intelligence gathering and identification systemsnecessary to pursue a program of ethnic cleansing. This technology is exported to virtually all countries with appalling humanrights records. Nigeria is supplied by such companies as Codalex (Canada) andContinental Microwave (UK). Companies supplying to Chinese authorities arenumerous, but include Phillips (Netherlands) EEV Night Vision (UK), GEC Marconi(UK), GPT-Plessey Telecom (UK), Pilkington PE Ltd (UK) and Siemens Plessey(UK). The Thailand Central Population Database and ID card system, developed by theUS based Control Data Systems, involves sophisticated intelligence that hasbeen used for political purposes by the Thai military. This integrated systemcreates an ID card, electronic fingerprint and facial image, and electronicdata link involving the entire population. It spans most government agenciesand is controlled by the powerful military/police dominated Interior Ministry. Databases in the Thai system include : Central Population Database, NationalElection System, Political Party Database, Political Member Database, Voterlisting, Electronic Minority Group Registration System, Electronic FingerprintIdentification System, Electronic Face Identification System, Population andHouse Report System, National Tax Collection System, Village InformationSystem, Secret Information System, Public Opinion System, CriminalInvestigation System, National Security System, Social Security System,Passport Control System, Driver Control System, Gun Registration, FamilyRegistration, Alien Control System and Immigration Control System. Similar ID card and "smart" card systems have been marketed to more than twodozen developing countries. Without exception, they result in wholesalediscrimination and hardship for vulnerable people. Such systems can adverselyaffect the delicate balance pursued by an emerging democracy. The adoption ofInformation Technology (IT) involves a change to the relationship betweencitizen and the State. The use of surveillance technologies vastly increasesthis change. The justification advanced by the companies involved in this trade is identicalto the justification advanced in the arms trade - i.e. that the technology isneutral. Privacy International's view is that in the absence of legalprotections, the technology can never be neutral. Even those technologiesintended for "benign" uses rapidly develop more sinister purposes. The UKmanufactured "Scoot" traffic control cameras in Beijing's Tianamen Square wereautomatically employed as surveillance cameras during the studentdemonstrations. Images captured from the cameras was broadcast over Chinesetelevision to ensure that the offending students were captured. The emerging Information Superhighway also poses fundamental threats todeveloping countries (the Superhighway is a metaphor for the convergence ofinformation and communications systems to form a national and internationalinformation web. The 1995 summit of the G7 (the seven richest industrialpowers) linked arms with some of the most dominant corporations in thetechnology industry to form a consensus about how the Superhighway should bebuilt. They agreed to a set of principles that would maximize growth,development and profit. Relatively little attention was paid to the negativeimpact of the Superhighway on developing countries and on the rights andprivacy of citizens of all countries. Martin Bangermann, Europe's Commissioner in charge of information technology,has remarked "We will not achieve the Information Society unless we give thefree market a free rein". In the context of the trade in surveillancetechnologies to third world countries, this signals a "hands off" policy. Anunregulated Superhighway is likely to maximize surveillance and increase thepower of institutions in control of the technology. It should be a source of grave concern that the world's telecommunications andcomputer companies have been moving to force government to back away fromregulating information technology. In 1994, under the leadership of US Centerfor Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a consortium of the world'sleading companies have formed the Global Information Infrastructure Commission(GIIC). Headed by the president of Mitsubishi, the chairman of EDS, and thevice chairman of Siemens Corporation, the GIIC intends to create a conglomerateof interests powerful enough to subsume government interest in regulation. The effort is being funded to a large extent by the World Bank, which in early1994 appears to have been persuaded by CSIS that unregulated economicinvestment was more important to developing economies than social and politicalreform. The corporate sector, argued CSIS, can deliver this economic reformalong the Superhighway. And they can do it best if they, not the governments,take the lead. The unregulated development and export of these technologies creates grave andunnecessary threats to developing countries. The trade requires scrutiny andregulation to help minimize the fatal impact that it can cause. Whether thisimpact is intended or unforseen, the surveillance industry has a responsibilityto ensure that the export and development of its products conform to scrupulousethical standards. Developed countries should ensure that the export industryis regulated. Technological assessment must be a pre-requisite. This report is by no means comprehensive. It omits numerous government-ledsystems. For example, the notorious PROMIS surveillance software marketedthroughout the world by the US Justice Department has led to widespread fearsabout the creation of an international tracking system for individuals "ofinterest". The US, French and British governments' moves to limit effectiveencryption systems is also of profound importance to developing countries, butis not dealt with in any detail here. These and many other issues will beexplored in updates of Big Brother Incorporated We are hoping thatinterested people will contact us to provide further information on this trade.We also welcome "clarification" of the facts by the companies named in thisreport.

The abuses reported included illegal wiretapping, widespread informer networks, interception of mail, and warrantless searches of homes. The report, entitled "U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1995," is based on reports from US embassies, human rights groups, and other information. It is produced by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the State Department, headed by Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck. The country reports cover a wide range of civil and political rights ranging from disappearances to labor rights. The scope of privacy issues covered is limited to traditional American Fourth Amendment concerns relating to search and seizure of private property, and the interception of mail and communications. Information privacy issues are only mentioned in a few countries. No mention is made of any privacy or data protection commissions. Important issues such as the collection of personal information by governments and private companies, and id cards are also mostly ignored. Constitutional and Legal Protections According to the report, almost all of the countries in the world have either a constitutional or legal right to privacy. 110 countries are reported to have a specific provision in their constitutions guaranteeing the right of privacy. These vary from the protection from unlawful searches and wiretaps to countries such as Spain and Slovenia, which have data protection specifically enumerated in their Constitutions. Another 55 countries are reported as having laws which protect privacy in the absence of a Constitutional right. Frequently, these protections are unenforced. In addition, a number of countries have enacted laws authorizing privacy violations in the name of national security or emergency legislation which override constitutional and legal protections. Wiretapping and Mail Interception Illegal wiretapping was prevalent throughout the world in 1995. The State Department cites reports of taps in over 90 countries. The abuses varied from systematic monitoring by military and government officials to occasional abuses by private entities. Most of the countries where these abuses occurred have laws prohibiting warrantless taps. Additionally, in many countries, prosecutors and police officers can issue warrants, rather than independent judges. The most frequently mentioned targets of illegal wiretapping are foreign residents, political opposition, dissidents, human rights workers, and journalists. In most countries where illegal wiretapping is conducted, the unauthorized interception of mail is also reported. Regional Breakdowns Africa A majority of the countries of Africa have poor records on privacy. While 31 countries have constitutional, and another 12 have legal protections of privacy, illegal wiretapping was reported in thirty out of the 49 countries in that region. Widespread illegal searches were reported in at least 23 of the countries. Incidents of unlawful interception of the mail were reported in 13 countries. Many countries engage in systematic surveillance against their citizens. For example, in Angola, the report states that, "the Government maintains a sophisticated security apparatus dedicated to surveillance, monitoring and wiretapping of certain groups, including journalists, opposition party leaders, members, and suspected sympathizers of UNITA, National Assembly deputies, and foreign diplomats." Kenya maintains "a network of informants to monitor the activities of opposition politicians and human rights advocates." In Sudan, a "wide network of government informants conducts pervasive surveillance in schools, universities, markets, workplaces, and neighborhoods" and is used to "keep key opposition figures under frequent surveillance." In some countries, the laws authorize and encourage surveillance. In Gambia, the report notes, "existing constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search and seizure were abrogated as part of Decree 45. AFPRC priorities in security matters and corruption investigations override all constitutional safeguards." In Kenya, the Constitution permits searches without warrants in cases "to promote the public benefit." A 1995 money laundering decree allows the Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency to, "monitor telephone conversations, access computer systems, and obtain bank and financial records." Decrees in Sierra Leone allow the government to, "monitor actions or conversations within homes, to prevent a person from acting in a manner deemed prejudicial to public safety." Latin America and the Caribbean Nearly all of the countries in the region - 28 of 34 - have Constitutional rights of privacy. Most of the remainder have legal protections. In nine of the countries, the State Department reports that there are "effective legal sanctions" to illegal searches. Illegal wiretaps were reported or suspected in ten countries. In Brazil, they were commonly used until a scandal involving the wiretapping of a presidential aide led to a temporary ban on their use. In Chile, a new law was enacted on November 20, 1995 prohibiting unauthorized taps. Even as democratic reforms progressed, illegal taps continued to occur in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In Honduras, "the armed forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the national telephone company to monitor telephone lines of influential people in government, the military, and the private sector without authorization from the appropriate civilian judicial authority." Once again, Cuba was listed as a major human rights violator with a pervasive system of surveillance designed to limit any dissent. The war on drugs also continued to have an impact on privacy rights. In Venezuela, suspensions of the constitutional guarantees were lifted in June 1995 after 13 months but still remain in border areas. In Jamaica, Barbados, Bolivia, and Columbia, warrantless searches were reported. Some countries are reported as improving their records. In Chile, a law was enacted on November 20 that "bars obtaining and dissemination of information by undisclosed taping, telephone intercepts and other surreptitious means." In Suriname, "the military command curbed invasions of privacy by the military such as the illegal monitoring of telephone calls, monitoring of the movements of human rights advocates, and threatening government officials, policemen, politicians, human rights workers, and journalists. Although some persons continued these activities on occasion, the military authorities reportedly did not authorize them to do so." Authorities in Guatemala continue to investigate the presidential security mail interception unit scandal that broke in 1993. East Asia and the Pacific In this region, of the 32 countries, 9 countries had constitutional provisions and 13 had legal protections for privacy. Illegal wiretapping was reported in 10 nations. Many of the countries including Singapore, Fiji, China, Cambodia, Burma, Malaysia, North Korea reportedly tapped the phones of social and political critics. In South Korea, a new law limits wiretapping but many groups believe that illegal wiretapping still continues. In addition, Internet surveillance also was an issue in China, where the government limited new access until it could determine how to prevent access to antigovernment materials on the Net. The report contains an extensive country report critical of China's record. Ironically, China responded to the report with a number of articles criticizing the U.S. on its lack of workplace privacy laws. Other countries in the region also harbored repressive regimes. In Burma, "the military ruled unchecked by any outside authority, and the State continued to interfere extensively and arbitrarily in the lives of private citizens. Through its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely monitored the travel, whereabouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly those known to be politically active. Security personnel selectively screened private correspondence and telephone calls, and conducted warrantless searches of private premises." In Indonesia, the government continues to exert "strong pressure against antigovernment critics, independent journalists, and labor activists." One improvement was "a phasing-out of a discriminatory symbol on the identification cards of ex-political prisoners and their families." Europe The European region had a mixed record on privacy. While the western countries generally had good records (though several had wiretap scandals), many of the former states of the Soviet Union are still reportedly being run by the vestiges of the KGB. Many Central European countries continued to struggle as they moved towards market economies. Thirty countries in the region have constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to privacy. Another 18 have laws protecting privacy. In addition, other agreements, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, also apply. Nonetheless, illegal wiretapping was reported in 22 countries. Many of the nations that made up the former Soviet Union had poor records. The State Department reported that in many of the countries, the security apparatus set up by the KGB remained intact and maintained control over the country. In Russia, a law enacted in August 1995 allows the security apparatus to, "open mail, tap telephones, monitor other forms of communication, and enter a private residence without a court order in cases of emergency that may lead to the commission of a serious crime or if Russia's political, military, economic, or environmental security is threatened." In Kazakstan, "the KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the procuracy, can and do arbitrarily interfere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence." In Turkmenistan, even with a Constitutional guarantee, "Security officials use physical surveillance, telephone tapping, electronic eavesdropping, and the recruitment of informers. Critics of the Government, and many other people as well, report credibly that their mail is intercepted before delivery." In Estonia, "a political scandal erupted when then Minister of Internal Affairs Savisaar was implicated in the illicit recording of his conversations with other politicians. Parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the matter, including the contacts of police with private security firms. Savisaar was dismissed, the cabinet resigned, and a new governing coalition was formed. Security police and parliamentary investigations were continuing at year's end." At the same time, U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation director Louis Freeh toured the region and encouraged countries to conduct more wiretapping to fight organized crime. Western European countries were also not exempt from abuses. In Greece, a new data protection law was enacted in September. However, "the security services continued to target human rights activists, non-Orthodox religious groups, and minority group representatives and to monitor foreign diplomats who met with such individuals. On several occasions, information about such private meetings was given to the press, apparently by government representatives. Human rights activists also reported the continuation of suspicious openings and diversions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently published in newspapers with apparent links to Greek security services." In France, "a wiretap of an official who was believed to be involved in a political corruption case was found to be illegal in February by a Paris appeals court." In Spain, "the press published allegedly leaked official documents suggesting that the National Intelligence Agency (CESID) intercepted and recorded telephone conversations between 1984 and 1991. Private calls made by the King, various ministers, and other prominent figures were apparently taped and stored at CESID. The scandal resulted in the resignation of CESID's director, the Minister of Defense, and the Vice President." In Turkey, a partial state of "emergency rule" has abrogated constitutional rights, "in the 10 provinces under emergency rule, the regional governor can and does empower security authorities to search without a warrant residences or the premises of political parties, businesses, associations, or other organizations." Near East and North Africa Only nine of the eighteen countries in the region have constitutionally protected privacy rights. Another three countries are reported to have legal protections. Illegal wiretapping is prevalent in the region, with fifteen countries having reports of violations. In many of the countries with constitutional and legal protections, massive abuses occur anyway. In Egypt, "the Emergency Law has abridged the constitutional provisions regarding the right to privacy...The Emergency Law empowers the Government to place wiretaps, intercept mail and search persons or places without warrants. Security agencies frequently place political activists, suspected subversives, journalists, foreigners, and writers under surveillance, screen their correspondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes, and confiscate personal property." In Syria, "the Emergency Law authorizes the security services to enter homes and conduct searches with warrants if security matters‹very broadly defined‹are involved. The security services selectively monitor telephone conversations and facsimile transmissions, and interfere with the mail. The Government opens mail destined for both citizens and foreign residents. It also prevents the delivery of human rights materials." In Yemen, "despite constitutional provisions against government interference with privacy, security forces routinely search homes and private offices, monitor telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for alleged security reasons. Such activities are conducted without legally issued warrants or judicial supervision. Security forces regularly monitor telephone conversations and have interfered with the telephone service of government critics and opponents." Some countries have began steps to improve their situation. In Lebanon, "the Prime Minister announced that he would refer cases to the Prosecutor-General to prevent the intelligence services from tapping telephone conversations. Additionally, in a note to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, the Prime Minister said that he would hold private cellular phone companies responsible should they allow government agencies to tap cellular phones without warrants." South Asia In this region, three out of eight countries have constitutionally protected privacy rights. Another three countries have legal protections. In half of the countries, there are reports of illegal wiretaps. In India, "The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, including monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail‹in case of public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or tranquillity." These powers have been used by every state government." In Pakistan, "the Government maintains several domestic intelligence services which monitor politicians, political activists, suspected terrorists, and suspected foreign intelligence agents. Credible reports indicate that the authorities commonly resort to wiretapping and occasionally intercept and open mail. On July 1, the Government suspended cellular phone, card pay phone, and pager services in Karachi and Hyderabad. The Government accused the MQM/A and criminals of using these services to commit crimes in Sindh." Conclusion Overall, the report paints a grim picture of a worldwide lack of government respect for privacy rights. Flouting internationally recognized rights and ignoring their own laws and constitutions, governments in developing and developed countries continue to abuse rights in the name of national security or other reasons.
