Deutsche Post wanted to keep 40percent of the capital and divide the rest between the other twobidders (see EB 118). Schroders has put Postbank's current market valueat between DM4 billion and DM5.1 billion.Wolfgang Botsch, Minister for Post and Telecommunications, whosupported this hostile bid, seems to like Schroders's idea so far, buthas not made a definitive statement. Postbank is adamant that the stakeshould be between 15 percent and 20 percent. It would not accept a 25percent stake unless"certain conditions (not defined) were met", aspokesman said.Schroders has recommended that Postbank get rid of its 80 specialisedoutlets in post offices, carry out marketing jointly with Deutsche Postand sell its products over the post office counters. This would openthe way for recruiting other financial services partners, Schroderssaid.No doubt Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re would want a piece of this action,along with the partners that Postbank sought out for a counter attack -BHF Bank and Volksfursorge, the insurance group.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

SE-Banken stated that the Luxonen losses werecovered by SKr1 billion provisions made in 1994 and that restructuringthe group would strengthen rather than weaken its position.In the first six months of 1995, however, SE-Banken made furtherprovisions of SKr2.9 billion to cover Luxonen losses. First halfprofits dropped from SKr2.2 billion to a mere Skr19 million (see EB117).The stock exchange disciplinary committee has imposed a SKr2.14 fine,corresponding to two annual listing fees.SE Banken admits that it was not fully aware at the time ofthe"complicated construction" of the swap contracts held by Luxonen,which caused much of the loss, a spokeswoman said.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FRANCE READY FOR CONSOLIDATION?Some recent deals seem to indicate that the French banking industry iswilling to consider the type of consolidation that has become common inEurope in recent yearsFOUR EVENTS toward the end of 1995 suggest that, faced with anunprecedented crisis, the French banking industry has embarked on along overdue period of consolidation and rationalisation.In December, after many hiccups, Credit National finally announced theterms of its public offer to acquire Banque Francaise de CommerceExterieur (BFCE) and its intention that the two banks' operationsshould eventually merge.Each of the banks is already among the top 15 banks in France by assetsand combined they will have total assets of Fr350 billion ($71 billion)and a corporate loan book of Fr195 billion. This will give CreditNational "the means to assert itself as one of the top Frenchinstitutions", according to the bank's chairman Emmanuel Rodocanachi.In itself, the deal is likely to have only a limited impact on thebanking industry. Credit National and BFCE have small branch networksand are involved in sectors where commercial banks barely tread. CreditNational, for example, focuses largely on long-term corporate loans tolarge and medium-sized companies, capital markets and equity financingbusiness. BFCE's activities are concentrated on the corporate sector;international trade financing and cash management services.The true significance of the deal lies in its symbolic value. Theproposed merger is, in fact, the first such operation of consequence inFrance since the merger of Banque Indochine and Banque de Suez et del'Union des Mines to form Banque Indosuez in 1975. It is testimony ofthe French banking industry's willingness to contemplate the type ofconsolidation that has become common in Europe in recent years.The second significant event pointing toward long-overdue consolidationwas the news that GAN, a major insurance company, is to sell a majoritystake in its banking subsidiary Groupe CIC as part of itsprivatisation. Groupe CIC is the seventh-largest bank in France sothere are likely to be suitors aplenty although, like many Frenchbanks, CIC is barely profitable. It has an abysmal cost-to-income ratioof 80 percent.Societe Generale and Credit Mutuel have already expressed an interest,although banks from outside France (possibly the Dutch bank ABN AMRO)may also be tempted to add CIC's network of around 1,300 branches totheir empires.The ardour of some suitors may, however, be tempered if it is decidedto sell the different regional CIC networks separately. The acquisitionof consumer finance specialist Sovac by giant US conglomerate GeneralElectric Capital (GE Capital) at least shows a revival of foreigninterest in investing in those parts of the French financial industrythat remain profitable.Foreigners' interest in making an important banking acquisition inFrance has long been frustrated by various kinds of unavowedprotectionism. At the beginning of this decade, for example, DeutscheBank's international division was able to show journalists 36 fatfiles, each one representing an acquisition target in France that hadto be ruled out for a series of reasons.Now, in one fell swoop, a major international company has become one ofthe major consumer credit providers in a market that has beentraditionally divided between a handful of national competitors and thesubsidiaries of the big commercial banks.The acquisition, the third significant event in French banking inrecent months, has had the effect of a bombshell on the French retailfinancial services industry and may herald a period of intensemanoeuvring. Already, rumours are rife that Banque Sofinco (anotherconsumer finance specialist and subsidiary of the troubled Suezconglomerate) could come on the market, as may Credit du Nord, the weakretail banking subsidiary of the Paribas group.The fourth and final event demonstrating a new openness in the Frenchbanking sector is the decision to end Credit Foncier de France's quasi-monopoly over the distribution of subsidised housing loans, calledPAPs. This may be a sign that the state is beginning to contemplateending other privileges reserved for a number of state and quasi-statebanks.Likewise, the decision to replace these PAPs with interest-freemortgage loans that are open to all banks to distribute is anindication that the authorities are conscious of the serious problemsfacing the French financial industry.That said, French banking remains ridden by a host of specialprivileges accorded to some banks and not to others. The commercialbanks (members of the Association Francaise des Banques) periodicallymount campaigns to have the same right to flexible opening hours as thesavings and mutual banks and the post office. For a number of years,they have also been striving to obtain the same access to fiscallyadvantaged products as the mutual and savings banks. It remainsunlikely that, in this respect at least, French banking will changeradically in the near future.The sudden increase in the tempo of change in French banking in 1995follows a lot of soul searching among the financial industry, at theroot of which is a series of events, including bail-outs (mostspectacularly that of Credit Lyonnais) and the collapse last year ofBanque Pallas-Stern. The failure of the latter bank is especiallysignificant in that, for the first time in memory, a bank'sshareholders did not respond to the Bank of France's "invitation" tohelp refloat their investment. This spells an end to France's much-vaunted banking solidarity and points to the growing vulnerability ofsmall banks.In addition, the AFB estimates that its members' net banking incomefell by 10 percent in 1995, having already dropped by 8 percent in1994.French banks in general can only look with envy on their "Anglo- Saxon"cousins which, on average, have operating margins and returns on equitythat are two or three times higher than theirs. In the latest annualsurvey of bank profitability undertaken by rating agency IBCA, the mostprofitable French bank (Credit Immobilier de France) ranked only 84thout of 300 institutions in the world.In the words of one Paris analyst,"whereas French banks used to be ableto take justifiable pride in their quality of service and technologicalprowess, now they have had to become seriously worried with the morebasic themes of low profitability and how to survive in a frighteninglycompetitive environment".Perhaps even more telling in the current upheaval is the growingrealisation that banks' real estate problems (which some analystsestimate could cost a cumulative Fr100 billion-Fr200 billion by the endof this decade) are not going to go away soon.Here, too, a sea change can be detected. In 1994 and the first half of1995 the Suez group, a financial and industrial conglomerate, took thecourageous step of writing down the massive real estate losses itsvarious subsidiaries had accumulated in previous years instead ofposting provisions that do not necessarily take into account possiblefurther falls in market values, as all Suez's domestic rivals havedone.This provisioning effort cost Suez a total of Fr11.7 billion in the 18months up to mid-1995 and contributed largely to the consolidatedlosses of Fr8.8 billion in the same period.At least this exercise should ensure that the much-troubled group seesthe light at the end of the tunnel fairly quickly. This may not be thecase for a number of other unfortunate institutions in France.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

In fact, SalomonBrothers's only proviso on a buy recommendation on Lloyds is that thebank's shares have passed the #8.25- #8.50 price mark.Both the C&G and TSB purchases fit the Lloyds criterion for asuccessful financial institution of widening the gap with otheroperators: C&G for its low-cost production in the mortgage market,strong image-based technology and turnaround skills; and TSB for thepotential integration savings it offers as well as general insuranceskills that Lloyds has up to now had to buy in.Salomon Brothers is particularly enthusiastic about the UK, despite thefact that shares rallied so strongly in 1995. Buy Barclays, Lloyds,NatWest and HSBC Holdings, Salomon Brothers advises, with a hold onAbbey National. The favoured buy is HSBC, because the shares havelagged the recovery in UK bank shares.Salomon is less enthusiastic about other markets. In France, where itconsiders the banks are not particularly good value in relation toearnings, it has a hold recommendation on the major banks, althoughpreferring the quality of Societe Generale.Italian banks, although cheap on book value, are expensive on anearnings basis, Salomon argues, and better share performance will onlyhappen in the (currently unlikely) event of an improvement in politicaland economic conditions. Top Italian choice is Istituto MobiliareItaliano (IMI) (see page 6).Despite the fact that Salomon Brothers is bearish about operatingconditions in the Spanish market, it has upgraded its recommendation onArgentaria to buy from hold in the light of the mounting speculationabout mergers and acquisitions. Salomon argues that the Spanishgovernment has no real interest in keeping any investment in Argentariain the medium term. Argentaria's break-up value is a lot higher thancurrent market capitalisation and the likely change of government in1996 will allow a rethink of the privatisation agenda, the reportpredicts.Salomon Brothers has also kept a buy recommendation on Bank BilbaoVizcaya, another bank which focuses on shareholder value. Luis Bastida,chief financial officer of BBV, told Salomon Brothers' GlobalConference that BBV has established ROE objectives of about 15 percentfor all main business lines. The bank will repurchase more stock ifmarket price falls below adjusted book value and is continuing tomaximise cost cuts from the 1998 Banco Bilbao/Banca Vizcaya merger.In Germany, the favoured bank shares are Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.In Switzerland, Salomon Brothers has downgraded its only buyrecommendation - Swiss Bank Corporation - to hold and cut the estimateson the other three major banks, citing stagnant domestic bankingconditions and poor credit quality.Salomon Brothers considers the Nordic banks, particularly ChristianiaBank, as among the best buys in Europe.Global bank share performance, absolute and in dollars,1991 - YTD 1995                   Absolute bank performance                   1991    1992    1993    1994    1H 95   YTD 1995US                 55.2%    28.3%    6.5%   -7.2%   24.8%   51.6%Canada             39.0    -10.1    26.0    -5.3     7.6    14.8UK                 16.8     28.7    54.7   -16.1    10.7    42.1Spain               6.7     -8.3    39.7    -8.8    -1.2    11.0Australia          45.9    -24.5    58.0   -13.3    14.9    31.2Switzerland        21.8     10.1    62.3   -22.6     5.6    16.4Germany             5.0      1.4    42.4   -15.7    -2.6    -2.3Japan              13.8    -22.2    13.4     0.0   -21.9     0.5France              7.8     16.9    42.2   -26.4   -14.6   -15.0Mexico              7.8     -7.2    62.8   -52.2   -31.6   -21.9                   Dollar bank performance                   1991    1992    1993    1994    1H 95   YTD 1995US                 55.2%    28.3%    6.5%   -7.2%   24.8%   51.6%Canada             38.9    -17.9   -20.4   -10.5    10.2    18.2UK                 13.0      4.4    51.2   -11.2    12.8    40.1Spain               5.3    -22.7    12.2    -0.9     7.7    18.9Australia          43.8    -31.5    55.6    -0.9     5.1    25.0Switzerland        15.0      1.7    60.2   -12.2    20.4    30.3Germany             3.5     -4.9    32.7    -6.1     9.9     5.6Japan              23.7    -22.0    26.5    11.9    -8.0    -1.1France              5.9      9.9    33.1   -18.6    -5.8    -8.8Mexico              6.0     -9.3    63.3   -69.8   -46.0   -49.7Source: Salomon Brothers Inc.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEW CHANCES, NEW COSTSWhile the large banks are in a good position to take advantage of thenew European financial regulations, the directives could be just toomuch for many smaller players to handleTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has added two further pieces to the singlefinancial services market jigsaw - the Investment Services Directive(ISD) and the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD).Both came into effect on January 1 of this year and are likely to leadto increased competition between stock exchanges and investment banksalike, with larger players set to come out on top.Only seven of the 15 member states were ready to implement the ISD atthe start of the new year, although all are adopting an "open door"policy, according to the European Federation of Stock Markets. Thosethat met the requirements were the UK, Ireland, Denmark, theNetherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.The main thrust of the ISD is to create a "European Passport" for non-bank investment firms to carry out activities such as order collecting,dealing and portfolio management more easily across borders.Under the terms of the directive, any institution regulated in one EUcountry can operate in all of the others without having to comply withadditional requirements.The British Banking Association "warmly welcomes" the directives,because they reinforce the basic right to cross-border financialservices, according to Peter Vipond, assistant director.As in the case of the Second Banking Directive, the Association isconcerned that the interpretation of the ISD should not be conservativeor ambiguous (see EB 120).Larger banks, already present in more than one EU country, can expectlower costs as a result of the ISD but the directive will not have asignificant impact on their cross-border activities, predicted JohnLeonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. Although somemember states have been strict on foreign players in the past, mostlarge banks have been free to operate where they choose."The ISD will have no effect whatsoever on our business, as we alreadyhad the passport," said Dominique Hoenn, member of the board ofmanagement at Groupe Paribas, France's second-largest banking group."It is a bit of a non-event for banks."Smaller players operating in countries which have no regulations forsecurities traders will, on the other hand, find themselves needingauthorisation for the first time.The costs of keeping up with regulations may be too much and firms andbrokers could become overshadowed by the bigger investment banks whichwill find it easier to adapt, Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury andcapital markets at Price Waterhouse, forecast.One market observer suggests that in terms of increased cross- borderactivity US investment houses, such as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanleyand Goldman Sachs, will be particularly keen to avail of theopportunities presented by the ISD. Their authorisation in London willallow them to spread out further into Europe.A second objective of the ISD is to open up stock exchange membershipin all member states to all types of investment firm, whether bank ornon-bank entities. It will allow them to choose between indirect accessto membership through a subsidiary company or direct access through abranch.The ISD will lead to a surge in "remote membership" of stock exchanges,according to market analysts, as it permits regulated markets operatingwithout a physical floor to provide terminals to investment firms andbanks in other member states.This move will boost continental exchanges which have dramaticallymodernised recently, said Jean-Pierre Paelinck, secretary general ofthe European Federation of Stock Exchanges.Indeed, the London exchange is on shaky ground at the moment after itschief executive Michael Lawrence was forced to resign on January 4because the board "lost confidence" in him. The board insists that thishas nothing to do with Lawrence's push for reform of trading on theexchange this year. Few are convinced by the argument and a selectcommittee of the House of Commons has launched an inquiry into thedismissal."Our objective is to be a market of choice," said John Kemp- Welch,chairman of the board, who has taken over the chair of the executivecommittee until a new chief executive is found. "To achieve that, wehave a large programme of work in train and this will be pursuedvigorously."On the same day as Lawrence's departure, the board announced theformation of a steering committee, which will oversee the decisiontaken at the Stock Exchange Board meeting of November 30, concerningmarket structure and regulation. The decision provides for theExchange's service to include full electronic trading and ordermatching.UK stockbroker NatWest Securities added fuel to the fire on January 2,when it started to trade on the Swedish stock exchange from its officesin London. It was the first leading UK market- maker to questionpublicly the London Stock Exchange's function as a centre forinternational trading.Before the ISD came in, UK firms wanting to trade continental stockshad to set up offices in other countries and apply for membership oradvertise their prices on Seaq International, the London Exchange'selectronic bulletin board for international dealing.In Germany, Gruppe Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock andderivatives markets, has reacted to the ISD by installing "accesspoints" in London and Zurich to link to its systems and harmonising thecommunications fees abroad with those at home, facilitating access tothe German market for foreign entrants.Deutsche Borse plans to extend its electronic network to othercountries in the future, with the aim of bringing down all roundtelecommunications costs.Investment banks are likely to feel the effects of the Capital AdequacyDirective (CAD) most, although the Directive also covers non-bankinvestment firms. Under the directive, investment banks are requiredfor the first time to examine market risks when allocating capital.Under the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive of 1993, banks cancarry out securities-related activities in addition to core bankingbusiness, which means that banks and non-banks can be in directcompetition with each other in this area.The CAD distinguishes between a bank's "trading book" and the rest ofits business (its investment portfolio and loans portfolio). It appliesbroadly similar rules to the trading book as apply to the securitiesbusiness of non-bank investment firms in defining regulatory capitaland rules relating to the measurement of risk.The rest of the bank's business is still subject to the requirements ofthe Solvency Ratio Directive, which sets out an 8 percent minimumcapital requirement in respect of weighted credit risks.Another element of the CAD is that banks and investment firms mustmonitor risks at all times, keeping a close eye on large exposures.Trading exposures to a single client will have to be restricted in mostcases to less than 25 percent of the capital base, for instance.Analysts agree that market risks have been neglected in the past."Considering that Swiss banks make 29 percent of their total revenuesfrom trading, and the Barings collapse, it is clear that there arerisks there that should be dealt with," said Mark Rubenstein, Europeanbanking analyst at BZW. "Banks will have to sit down and look morecarefully at the capital they need."Banks have had two years to prepare for the CAD so on the whole theyare relatively unshaken by its arrival. The overall effect on holdingcapital will be neutral and won't make much difference to banks,according to Ian Linnell, investment banking analyst at Standard &Poor's."The CAD will give a good kick to the market," he said, "but as a riskmanagement tool, it is not a magic silver bullet, it's too cumbersome".Linnell suggests that investment banks themselves delegate risk controlin a much more efficient way than the CAD, a view held by many of thebanks themselves. Paribas is a case in point. Its own risk model uses250 points of observation. "It is not clear whether we are permitted tocontinue with our internal model," said Hoenn. "It would be stupid tohave to invest more in developing a new system just to comply with therules."Indeed, the CAD will require increased expenditure on upgradingtechnology, as it is a systems-based approach. "Everyone is investinglots of money in systems, because they have one additional set ofcalculations that has to be done concurrently and accurately," saidLeonard. IT investment among Europe's top banks ranges from as littleas 0.5 percent of asset value, according to a 1995 review of the top100 largest spenders on IT by Spikes Cavell, the market intelligenceproviders. Three banks appeared in the top ten spenders: Barclays wasnumber three spending $1.3 billion; ABN AMRO was number five with $960million and Deutsche Bank ranked ninth with $814 million.Smaller players may be crippled by the new overheads brought on by thedirectives. At the end of the day, this factor, along with otherhandicaps, such as lack of controlling models, will mean that theincreasingly "global" European market will become a stomping groundmainly for big investment banks and investors."Larger banks can exploit their muscle on a wider front, and thedirectives offer significant re-engineering opportunities," saidAggarwal."The odds are definitely tilting towards larger players."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Handlowy would take over Pomorski Bank Kredytowy and theTreasury's remaining 46.6 percent stake in Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy(BPH).Until now, the government has sold off four of the nine regional banksone at a time - Bank Slaski, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, BankPrzemyslowo-Handlowy and, most recently, Bank Gdanski. At the end oflast year, it sold a domestic tranche of 35.8 percent of the Gdanskishares, and foreign investors bought all 25 percent of shares on offerabroad. Poland's eleventh- largest bank, Bank Iniciatyw Gospodarczych(BIG) bought 24.07 percent of the bank.Privatisation of the institutions remaining in state hands is expectedin late 1996 or in 1997. Although the new strategy of grouping thebanks could simplify an eventual privatisation "a more jaundiced viewheld by some market players is that the consolidation strategy ismerely a ploy for reasserting control over the banking system, a theorythat would be borne out if Bank Handlowy and Pekao are not privatised,"points out rating agency Standard & Poor's.Shareholders of BPH and of PBR, as well as the management of theregional banks, have raised objections. The plan can only succeed ifthe two banks are free of political influence, Handlowy presidentCezary Stypulkowski has said.Standard & Poor's also argue that the consolidation "would notsignificantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range forzloty-denominated obligations".The rating agency points out that in the near term the mergers wouldbring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio and thatintegration could be difficult."However, longer term, the greater diversity and market share could bepositive factors. Bank Handlowy would gain more retail deposits andcommercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution networkand possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertiseof Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail brokerstrength."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN BANKER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996THE UNWANTED DISTRACTIONWhile Italian banks are keen to grow, in recent times they have beencutting back on foreign expansion. Now the smaller, more flexible banksseem to be in the best position to exploit opportunities quicklyTHE ONGOING troubles of Italian banks as they come to terms withderegulation, privatisation and a more open and competitive market havebeen well documented. A less well-publicised aspect of the large-scalechanges underway has been the quiet scaling down or even completewithdrawal from operations abroad.Most of the Italian banks' foreign expansion happened in the 1980s, onthe back of a buoyant economy at home when politically- controlledbanks could afford prestigious offices in major capitals and branchnetworks in the more important markets. More recently, though,recession and the arrival of private investment have brought morepressing concerns at home and foreign expansion appears to have becomean unwanted distraction.IMI, the Rome-based bank privatised last year, was one of the moreactive and successful of the Italian banks abroad. Determinedlyindependent from political interference, it became an efficientoperator in international investment banking and capital markets.In 1993 Massimo Amato, managing director, of IMI International inLuxembourg, echoed the bank's president when he said optimisticallythat "IMI is a truly international bank and our intention is to becomea European institution of the highest calibre".The bank certainly had the right credentials for satisfying theambitions of its management and may well have achieved their objectivesbut for one costly mistake - the acquisition of the US investment bank,Mabon Securities, for around $20 million in 1991. Little is known ofexactly what went wrong, but only two years after the purchase the bankwas said to be looking for a buyer. Problems appear to have beenconcentrated in the subsidiary, Cedar Street, particularly in London,where management walked out en masse to join a rival.In September 1995 IMI announced that it was restructuring itsinvestment banking operations so that it could concentrate on Italianmarkets and its lira-denominated products. It also revealed that IMICapital Markets, the sole owner of Mabon Securities, was to have $30million injected into it. Little over a month later Cedar Street wassold to a US securities dealer, MKI. There has been no mention oflosses and little coverage in the Italian press, although IMI's balancesheet could be L60 billion ($38 million) the worse in 1995 and MabonSecurities faces liquidation.The mistake severely compromised IMI's other foreign operations and thebank also closed its Frankfurt-based venture, leaving the Luxembourgbank as the only serious foreign-based bank. Even Luxembourg's role wasdowngraded and Massimo Amato returned to a high ranking position with amedium-sized bank in Italy last year.Banca Nazionale del Lavoro has also had well-publicised problems in itsforeign subsidiaries and has reduced its once large US operation to itsNew York offices.Other groups have suffered from market pressures. Comit, the bankinggroup containing Banca Commerciale Italiana, is looking to cut itsoperation in France. Comit entered the French market at much the sametime as IMI was beginning its foreign expansion programme, buying BancaSudameris France. Losses in the French operation have forced the bankto look for buyers of most of the 19 branches.Banco di Napoli may also be looking for buyers in France. The Naplesbank had record losses last year and other Italian banks have bailed itout on condition that it implements an effective restructuringprogramme. This will almost certainly include the disposal of foreignoperations in France and Luxembourg.Another casualty of the tough French market was the bank owned byOlivetti owner Carlo De Benedetti, Dumenil Leble, which after L900billion losses over the last five years will be put into liquidation atthe end of January.In many cases, the purpose behind withdrawal has been to concentrateresources on the home front where, ironically, foreign banks arebecoming increasingly active. Leaner foreign banks are increasinglylooking to exploit weaknesses in the cumbersome Italian banking system.One of the major recent problems is the rift between Italian industryand its banking counterparts over lending rates. The needs of smallerexporting companies for competitive rates are quite clearly not beingmet. All leading banks in Italy raised their lending rates by O.5percent to 0.75 percent in November leaving industrialists dissatisfiedand rebellious.Mario Carraro, head of the Veneto region's industrial association, haslittle doubt that foreign banks are exploiting the rift and Italiancompanies are responding."Working with strong currencies we can get loans at 8 percent," hesaid. "Our [local] economy is primarily based on exports . .Republic or Poland we need advice and support from banks."The largest Italian banks appear to be the ones finding this sort ofservice more difficult to offer. Often it is the smaller banks withstrong roots in particular regions that are now exploiting theopportunities presented abroad. For example, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-Credito Varesino, which bought the Swiss Banque de Depots et de Gestionin 1994, says that foreign expansion is limited to creating a networkin the areas that have strong links with the home base in Lombardy.Similarly, the Banca Popolare di Verona group, which is based in theeastern region of Veneto, has opened offices in eastern Europe"becausethat is where our clients are going for their work".The new approach to international expansion is much more pragmatic andoften the players are the second-tier banks. This creates something ofa contradiction for the industry. On the one hand, Italy's banks arekeen to grow, with even the biggest groups small by internationalstandards. On the other hand, it seems to be the smaller flexibleoperators which are better able to exploit openings quickly.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Theother Landesbanks would be well-advised to follow suit, EB reportsTHE RECENT co-operation agreement between Westdeutsche Landesbank(WestLB) and Bank Austria has created a three-way alliance betweenGermany's largest Landesbank and its counterparts in Austria and Italy,where Cariplo forms the third point of the triangle.The strategy marks a further departure from the Landesbanks'traditional business profile, although it is still too early to saywhether these co-operation agreements will generate significant newbusiness.It is some years now since WestLB moved beyond its original jobdescription as local banker and lender of last resort to the publicsector in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. As competitive pressuresgrew on the local savings banks (Sparkassen), which buy their wholesalebanking services from WestLB, the Landesbank found it needed to offerbetter products and services and to earn more than their traditionallow-interest municipal lending business could offer.That way of thinking led WestLB to move into corporate business andthen, as a natural consequence, into capital markets and internationalcommercial banking. WestLB has since grown to become Germany's third-largest bank and is currently bolstering its London investment bank,known as West Merchant Bank, into a significant rival to private-sectordomestic competitors, Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank.Under the terms of the German bank's agreement with Bank Austria, whichwas signed just before Christmas, each becomes the other's"preferredpartner" for cross-border financial transactions, particularly inforeign commercial business, international payments, currency clearingand securities business.Bank Austria's experience in eastern Europe will be invaluable. WestLBhas established branches in a number of central and eastern Europeancapitals but does not have the broad network that the Austrians havealready established.The German's other partner is Cassa di Risparmio delle ProvincieLombarde (Cariplo), the Italian bank. WestLB's ultimate aim is toconstruct a network of partner banks in all the main European markets.WestLB's aspirations in investment banking have taken up plenty of timeand resources over the past year and the man with chief responsibilityfor the new alliances with Cariplo and Bank Austria is Hans-HenningOffen, deputy chairman of the board of management and one of the twoboard members responsible for investment banking. Bank sources say itwill take a good year before any substantial progress can be announced,although quicker results might be achieved in cross-border payments.It is clear that WestLB, the wholesale banker and umbrella for 150local savings banks in the Rhine and Ruhr region, has chosen to rely onalliances with other savings bank institutions. Bank Austria is asavings bank sector institution and, like WestLB, has grownprodigiously. Cariplo comes from the same roots and is often referredto as the world's largest savings bank.These upper-tier banks choose to co-operate with one another becausethey understand the difficulties of convincing local savings banks tomarket new products to customers rather than being able to approachcustomers directly. The structure of the savings bank sector in almostany European country usually means delays and it sometimes results inpainful, politically charged compromises.Other state-owned banks understand that the German Landesbanks areobliged to take on some unrewarding business, such as low- interestcredits or the administration of subsidies, for local authorities.Since they understand each other better than private sector bankswould, the alliances between WestLB, Cariplo and Bank Austria have abetter chance of success.WestLB's recent activities in the capital markets suggest that theLandesbanks are still wary of liaisons with private sectorinstitutions. West Merchant Bank in London is being fashioned into acompetitor for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner/Kleinwort Benson.Possibly because there is no savings bank institution with sufficientexpertise in investment banking, WestLB has chosen to go it alone. Eventhe domestic competition was ousted: Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, aminority shareholder in West Merchant Bank, was bought out so thatWestLB could avoid internal competition from German or foreign bankswith similar constituencies.As for Bayerische Landesbank, NordLB, Helaba and the other GermanLandesbanks, it is a fair bet that their future strategy will beinspired by that of WestLB, which has long been the largest and mostinternational of the 13 Landesbanks.Bayerische Landesbank, in particular, is investing heavily in otherEuropean markets. Over the past two years, chief executive FranzNeubauer has purchased shareholdings in the Hungarian Foreign TradeBank, the Czech Savings Bank in Prague, the Sudtiroler Sparkasse inItaly - and now the Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft in Vienna.Others are more tardy. One reason is that their energy is being sappedby problems and challenges at home - and by the constant effort ofexpanding in order to keep level with WestLB. Norddeutsche Landesbank,Helaba and Bayerische Landesbank are negotiating a far-reaching co-operation on everything from edp systems to international strategy.NordLB has already bought a stake in BGB.Traditional banking alliances are still being made with banks inemerging markets. Bayerische Landesbank has just signed an agreement onthe financing of German exports to Russia with Inkombank, the country'slargest commercial bank. But the Bavarians are not taking any risks:all the long-term deals concerned will be covered by the German exportguarantee agency Hermes; others will be guaranteed by the RussianMinistry of Finance or covered by barter deals. Indeed, Bayern LB hasbeen sensible enough to keep its initial objectives modest.But the other Landesbanks will have to move quickly into more strategicalliances if WestLB, Cariplo, Bank Austria and whichever new partnernext emerges are not to steal away their regional business. AlthoughWestLB is still formally committed to the Rhine/Ruhr region, it nowacts for corporate customers all over Germany.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF) is displacing thetraditional bank deposit. The volume of assets held in MMMFs nowexceeds the cash held in call or demand deposits. Conventional mutualfunds are winning market share in the longer-term savings market.Overall, around 30 percent of US households own mutual funds.In the UK, however, mutual funds have failed to arouse the same depth -and breadth - of interest. Indeed, in some respects the UK mutual fundsector lags behind that of mainland Europe.Unit trusts, the UK equivalent of the open-ended investment fund, havehad their moments, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.More recently, the sector experienced a minor boom in 1993 on the backof rising stockmarkets.In the intervening periods, however, the unit trust has failed toexcite the British punter. The number of unitholder accounts reached apeak of 2.4 million in 1970 and declined throughout the 1970s, reachinga trough of 1.72 million. Interest in unit trusts recovered during the1980s on the back of booming stockmarkets but it was not until 1985that the 1970 peak was exceeded.Interest subsided following the crash of 1987 before moving onto newhighs during the 1990s. Currently the Association of Unit Trusts andInvestment Funds (AUTIF), the sector's trade association, estimatesthat there are 6.58 million unit trust accounts, with total assets of#109 billion ($168 billion).Since investors typically hold units in more than one fund, the overallnumber of unit trust holders is probably much less. In 1993 AUTIFestimated that there were only around 1.5 million individual investors - around 3 percent of the total population.There are a number of reasons for this situation. The fact that UKbanks have tended to pay interest not dissimilar to money market rateson bank deposits has diminished the attraction of MMMFs. Unit trustshave had to compete on an unfavourable basis with the attractions ofalternative long-term savings products such as life assurancecontracts. Until the advent of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP), mutualfunds were not in receipt of any form of fiscal privilege. By way ofcontrast, until 1984 tax relief was offered on life assurance premiums.The relative attraction of life assurance contracts was enhanced by thefact that they were a preferred way of funding residential mortgages.For a significant part of the post-war period residential property hasbeen perceived by the average Briton as the investment par excellence.From the manufacturer's point of view, life assurance contracts offeredother attractions. The fact that the investment value of a lifeassurance policy was relatively opaque - investors just assumed thatthey would receive a large sum of money when the contract wasterminated - obscured the risks associated with this type ofinstrument. More pertinently, in an age of non- disclosure, it openedthe way for high costs and fees to be passed directly to the customer.Unit trusts were more transparent. Investment losses or poorperformance quickly came to light. Costs were also much more visibleand off-putting. The nature of the contract permitted only limitedopportunities for realising commission income. In contrast to theirpeers in the US, the UK mutual fund companies seemed incapable ofcoming up with anything that would positively enhance the unit trust'simage.In fact, they often seemed intent on the reverse. Loads and annualmanagement charges were allowed to creep up. UK companies even turneddown the UK government's invitation to introduce legislation permittingthe introduction of open-ended investment companies (OIECs), a mutualfund structure which has become the norm elsewhere.There is at last evidence, however, to suggest that the tide may beturning, irrespective of the behaviour of stockmarkets (always animportant factor as far as the public's appetite for unit trusts isconcerned).A key element in this respect was the decision by the UK government tomake qualifying unit trusts fully eligible for inclusion in PEPs.Investors can now shelter from both income and capital gains tax up to6,000 of unit trust investments per annum. For the first time, unittrusts have a more favourable tax status than life assurance contracts.The relative attraction of life assurance contracts has been underminedby a combination of factors. The scandals associated with the way inwhich these and other long-term savings contracts such as personalpensions were sold, the advent of disclosure and the inflexibility ofthese contracts have all impeded their sale.More importantly, competition has finally arrived. There has been anexplosion in new products, especially"life-style products" such as unittrust savings plans linked to school and college fees, mortgagerepayments and pensions. Price competition has also picked up. No-loadfunds, with very low annual management fees, are becoming increasinglycommon.As is often the case, when the history of the UK mutual fund sectorcomes to be written, credit for these changes will probably beattributed to an outsider: Virgin's Richard Branson. His launch of alow-cost index tracking fund in early 1995 was an important catalyst.Close on Branson's heels, HSBC, River & Mercantile, Legal & General andFidelity Investments have all introduced low-cost index trackers.Indeed, since the index tracker appears to have captured the public'simagination, other suppliers are set to join them in the near future.Will the UK be converted to the merits of the mutual fund? Thesituation is certainly much more promising. The arrival of the OIEClater this year, low-risk corporate bond trusts, low costs, lowinterest rates and (hopefully) booming stockmarkets, coupled withgreater marketing awareness on the part of the fund companies, shouldprovide the basis for take-off. As usual, however, time will tell.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

But, if demand isweak, banks could be left holding the stock themselves for months oreven years.By that simple logic, it seems self-evident that the banks will tryevery tactic and ruse to encourage investors to buy the nation's firsttelecoms shares. That is what the German government hoped when itdecided last year not to create new tax breaks on share ownership inorder to encourage the German public to buy Telekom stock.Instead, the government and Deutsche Telekom's own management haveappealed to the banks to invent (and pay for) whatever incentives theythink necessary to make the new shares attractive.By placing the ball so firmly in the banks' court, the Germangovernment is perpetuating the old belief that banks are not justcommercial organisations which aim to maximise profits for theirshareholders but also have a duty to offer financial support todeserving parts of the economy.It is a curious reflection of the German consensus model that banks tooare regarded as official sponsors of economic and social change.Banks may rage about this outdated view but the Telekom debate has putthem in a difficult dilemma. All of the major banks were so eager towin places in the Telekom issuing syndicate that they were driven tomake extravagant promises.Deutsche Bank, one of the global coordinators, and Dresdner Bank,coordinator for the German market, are said to have made a personalpledge to German chancellor Helmut Kohl that the Telekom issue would bea success at all costs. And the government's favour is all-importantfor banks which want a prominent role in future privatisation issuessuch as Deutsche Bahn and Postbank.In January 1996, just weeks before the marketing campaign begins for amammoth placement that cannot be postponed any longer, it is nowevident what responsibility the banks face. That burden restsparticularly on the shoulders of Dresdner Bank.Unless the banks forgo bank charges, they may not be able to sellsufficient stock to establish investor confidence. And if demand isweak the banks will be blamed - and will end up forced to buy theunwanted shares. Indeed, outsiders may never find out how much genuinedemand there really was for Telekom stock.We can only speculate what the results of the Telekom issue will be. Ifbanks do have to provide special incentives for private investors, thatwill set a trend for all future privatisations and could have a radicaleffect on bank charges in Germany.It will also create a new interdependence between the retail bankingand capital markets division of the big German banks. That will beunwelcome at institutions which are trying to create more autonomy ineach division, but it may be unavoidable.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Credit Suisse, for instance,recently launched a direct brokerage in Germany.The appearance of foreign competitors is nothing new. US-basedinvestment banks created a stir in the late 1980s when they establishedoperations in Frankfurt and began to attract capital markets businessaway from German institutions. The expertise they brought to Frankfurtpropelled German banks into acquiring the same experience themselves.With hindsight, German bankers agree that the foreign investmentbankers have been beneficial for the Frankfurt marketplace.They are still classified as"foreign banks" and few belong to themainstream Association of German Banks, but in fact institutions likeSalomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Swiss Bank Corporation now pursuemuch the same objectives as domestic banks. That recognition is the keyto the successful development of Finanzplatz Frankfurt in future.All 135 foreign banks in Frankfurt - even the branches which simplyadminister commercial business for clients from home - are concernedabout the minimum reserve requirement, the supervision of derivativesbusiness, the new electronic systems of the Frankfurt Stock Exchangeand the improvement of international payment systems.Although the financial legislation of 1994 introduced some reforms,notably the establishment of a securities trading supervisory office,both Germans and foreign banks complain that the changes have not yetgone far enough. The finance ministry in Bonn is being lobbied byvarious banking groups which hope to see a number of changes in theforthcoming Third Financial Markets Promotion Act.Ideally, the banks would like to see abolition of the minimum reserve,rapid implementation of the capital adequacy directive and immediateissue of short-term government debt.With the finance ministry still smarting from the decision of the bigGerman banks to shift important capital markets operations to London orNew York, it is important for the banking community to present a unitedfront. That will be enormously beneficial in persuading both thefinance ministry and the Bundesbank that a free-market and not aprotectionist approach will best secure a promising future forFinanzplatz Frankfurt.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Thegroup's net profit went up to Sch2.2 billion ($215 million) in 1995from Sch1.9 billion a year earlier. Its operating result rose to Sch5.9billion, up 4 percent and 40 percent higher than that of the domesticoperation Creditanstalt- Bankverein AG.Domestic business suffered from weak credit demand, a shift to low-interest, short-term loans and pressure on the interest margin, GuidoSchmidt-Chiari, group chairman, said on January 9. Earnings fromindustrial holdings were up but provisions for loans to domesticcustomers were up to Sch3.1 billion, from Sch2.7 billion in 1994.In its recent Banking System Outlook for Austria, Moody's rating agencyexpressed concern about the country's poor banking returns. AfterBelgium, Austria is the most overbanked country in the European Union -at end 1994 one bank or bank branch served only 1,384 people.Unlike Austria's bankers, Moody's is not sure that the thin returnswill deter foreign entrants. This might, Moody's believes, "(a) only betrue during the near-term, and (b) hold only for the more plain vanillabanking products and services".Creating shareholder value has not been an overriding strategicobjective for Austrian banks. The politicised system has not onlycontributed to the delay in selling the government's 49 percent stakein Creditanstalt and 20 percent of Bank Austria but means that it willbe difficult for banks to improve their cost structure, Moody's argues.Inherent competitive cost advantages "may enable more efficient foreignentrants to compete against domestic institutions with some success",the report says. It predicts that the country's financial markets willbecome more exposed to domestic asset and savings disintermediation andto cross-border competition "that is likely to focus on niche marketssuch as mutual funds, lease finance and credit cards".Faced with pressure at home, Creditanstalt, like Austria's otherleading banks, has been turning its attention to eastern Europe. Inthis region, where Creditanstalt has to date invested Sch1.9 billion,the bank's accumulated operating result rose from Sch330 million toSch366 million.Moody's warns that competition may, in the medium term, make bankingactivities in eastern Europe less attractive than they lookedinitially. It also cautions that the extent and volatility of risk isdifficult to quantify.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

At that time, the companies set up two jointcontrol and development holdings: Midi Participations, which is 60percent owned by Finaxa and 40 percent by Generali; and Generali MidiExpansion (GME), which is 60 percent held by Generali and 40 percent byAXA.Under the new agreement, Midi Participations will be dissolved andGenerali will buy back AXA's 40 percent reciprocal stake in GME. Thegroups have also agreed to finalise a shareholder agreement by February15, reaffirming their intention to seek joint development opportunitiesand "barring unforeseen circumstances" to maintain their shareholdingsat current levels.Generali observers have been speculating about possibly heavier Frenchinvolvement since June last year, when Eugenio Coppola di Cazanostepped down as Generali chairman and chief executive for healthreasons. He was replaced as chairman by Antoine Bernheim, generalpartner of Lazard Freres, the Paris financial group which owns 4.7percent of Generali's equity.At the beginning of that month, Generali had signed an agreement tofuse its French subsidiary with La France group, indirectly controlledby Lazard Freres, creating France's 11th-largest non- life insurer,Generali France Holding.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The European Commission in Brussels is shortly dueto spell out clearly how the bank is to proceed in selling off 35percent of its commercial banking assets abroad, including 50 percentof those in Europe outside France, before the end of 1998 - the pricethe bank has had to pay for its massive state bail-out (see EB).This would mean dismantling the French banks' expensively acquiredbranch network, with the exception of BfG Bank in Germany, the largestand most profitable of Credit Lyonnais's European units and the one itmost earnestly wants to keep.But this would also seem to be in contradiction of the assertion byPhillippe Cloes, managing director of Credit Lyonnais Belgium, that hisbank was "not on the list of sell-offs" and a similar statement made bymanagers at Credit Lyonnais's Swiss unit.The protocol signed between the Commission and the French state whichstipulates that the 1998 deadline can be extended if the sale of assetsleads to "large losses" or "forces the main shareholder [the state] togive fresh financial support". The bank's own board of directors hasstated that it will be "very careful that future disinvestments do notlead to a decline in the bank's financial standing".Credit Lyonnais has also announced the opening of a branch in theNetherlands, designed to serve the bank's corporate customers. Thiscomes just a few months after the sale of the scandal-ridden CreditLyonnais Bank-Nederland to the Belgian Generale de Banque as part ofthe rationalisation of its non-domestic network.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It closed nine ofits 46 branches and let go 30 of its 280 staff in late December lastyear in a bid to halve these losses by the end of 1996."The branches were simply unprofitable and had too few customers." saidLothar Lanz, board member at HSB. So far Hypo- Bank has invested aboutDM50 million in HSB, which currently has 110,000 customers and abalance sheet total of DM1.5 billion.Deutsche Bank has built up a network of 400 branches in the new FederalStates in two-and-a-half years and plans to maintain it, a spokesmansaid. "It makes sense to build up a branch network, although not allare profitable," he said. Germany's number one bank acquired 120 ofthese offices through a joint venture with Deutsche Kredit Bank,formerly an exclusively east German bank. It currently has 90 branchesin west Berlin alone.Bayerische Vereinsbank has a widely spread network of over 100 branchoffices, built up since reunification. The bank expects corporatebusiness to get riskier in the coming years because a lot of stateschemes will peter out.It also expects margins to narrow in the retail sector becausecompetition will be largely price-based and, for this reason, ispromoting phone banking and on-line banking.Dresdner Bank, which has 250 branches in the new federal states, sees"no need for cuts".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Sorcha Corcoran reportsOFTEN DESCRIBED as the only true pan-European retail bank, Citibank,the banking arm of US multi-finance group Citicorp, now generatesnearly one-third of its total revenues in Europe. Germany continues tobe Citibank's European shining star but the bank is also pushing itsglobal strategy of providing services "anywhere, anytime, anyhow", inBelgium, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and, most recently,the UK.There have been rumours that Citibank will reorganise its Europeanretail operations in view of former head of retail banking VictorMenezes' recent promotion to corporate finance officer at Citicorp. Adecision on reorganisation will be made in the next couple of monthsbut no comment is available yet.Up to now, Citibank in Europe has stuck closely to its global retailstrategy, pursued in 41 countries worldwide. This is to provideupscale, premium financial services, with a multinational servicenetwork, through a minimal number of branches, supplemented withtelephone and ATM service."We aim to deliver private customers the same bank services in the samebranches across Europe," Folkert Mindermann, managing director ofCitibank Privatkunden AG, the German consumer bank, told EB. "It is aregion where we expect considerable growth in revenues."The bank's considerable success in the lucrative European consumermarket is largely due to the fact that its niche strategy minimisesfrontal attacks, argued a recent study of the Citicorp organisation,Citicorp Europe - Refashioning Itself for the Nineties, published byanalysts Salomon Brothers.Citibank has defined its retail target as "internationally aware,performance demanding and located primarily in large populationcentres". The middle-income market needs most attention in the nearfuture, Mindermann said.Excluding the card business, Europe contributed $1.5 billion toCitibank's total consumer revenues in 1995, representing 30 percent oftotal revenues, Mindermann said. There are 500 consumer branches inEurope, nearly half the world total of 1,200, and the bank employs7,000 people in the region. Assets came to $50 billion last year.The consumer business is as much a marketing company as a bank. Theaim: to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Colais to the soft drinks industry. All European branches now sport theCitibank label and Citibank has introduced the "model branch" concept,in which the same signage, architecture and operating systems are usedin Citibank branches around the world.In these branches, consumers have access to Customer ActivatedTerminals (CATs), an advanced touchscreen system that recognises fromthe customer's PIN what language to use. Every Citibank customer has aCiticard, which can be tied to several accounts, even with differentcurrencies.An important feature of Citibank's Euro-attack is its integratednetwork, Mindermann said. The bank moved nine consumer banking datacentres scattered around Europe to a single location at Meerbusch,Germany in 1994. All European branches now have access to accountinformation on line."Citibank is the only European bank with one integrated system,"Mindermann said. "For this reason it is the highest ranked in Europe interms of consumer orientation."The integrated electronic data processing system improves cost andcontrol and allows Citibank to roll out new products more quickly,Salomon Brothers notes. The bank need simply transfer "existingsystems, products and methodologies using infrastructure, experienceand language skills available elsewhere in the network", the reportpoints out.One key business area in Europe is cards. Citibank had 1 million creditcard accounts in 1995 and by the end of the millennium this should growto 5 million, predicted Roberta Arena, head of cards in the US andEurope. To minimise unit costs, the bank is transferring Europeantransactions across the Atlantic to Citibank's processing centre inSioux Falls, South Dakota.Citicorp started its regional credit card effort in 1989, beginningwith four countries - Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain. In fiveyears, the card base had grown to 500,000. The bank has become thelargest issuer in Greece since then and is now opening accounts in twonew countries each year.Establishing cards businesses was a "gruesomely expensive" five yeareffort, Arena said. High entry costs will, however, benefit Citibank bydiscouraging other players from entering its selected markets, sheforecast.Arena expects Citibank to be the number one card issuer in Germanybefore long. At the end of 1994 it ranked fourth and was within 50,000cards of Deutsche Bank.In a move which alarmed traditionalists, Citibank has launched a co-branded card with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway. The dual-brandingoffer allows holders of the Bahncard rail discount card to add a Visaor Electron payment function at no additional charge.A legal battle ensued as the German competition authority, Zentrale zurBekampfung des unlauteren Wettbewerbs, opposed the deal, deeming itunlawful. Citibank won the case in November and now claims that itsBahncard has the potential to revolutionise the cards industry in amarket viewed by many observers as still underpenetrated. There arealready 3 million Bahncard holders in Germany, and their numbers areset to rise to 5 million over the next couple of years.Indeed, Germany stands out for Citibank in more ways than one. As thelargest and oldest retail bank (founded in 1926), Citibank PrivatkundenAG generates over 50 percent of European revenues. Of the 500 Europeanbranches, 300 are German, and 4,000 of the 7,000 employees are locatedthere.At end-September 1995, the balance sheet total of Citibank PrivatkundenAG came to DM15.9 billion ($11 billion), up from DM15.2 billion at theend of 1994. It now serves 2.5 million customers with 4.4 million bankaccounts, insurance policies, Citibank Visa cards and home savingsagreements.Mindermann attributes much of Citibank's German success to theacquisition of Kundenkreditbank in 1974. "Kundenkreditbank was verystrong at that time, with a good branch network," he said.Although among the highest returning banks in Germany for many years,the bank was traditionally a blue-collar-oriented company with limitedgrowth. Citibank revamped the bank in 1989, establishing a more upscaleimage through enhancing service and marketing.Unique to Germany so far is CitiPhone Direct Banking, a full bankingand financial service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with personalservice by telephone. Citibank, as the pioneer of telephone banking inGermany in 1989, started the new service in October 1995.Previously only cash transactions were possible over the phone. Now,customers use a personal password and identification number fortelephone handling of savings-account, investment, securities, creditand insurance business. Only one signature is needed for all accounts."CitiPhone Direct Banking has got off to a very good start," saidMindermann. "Already we have reached more than 3,000 new customers, andare receiving an average of 1,500 calls a day. Most people areinterested in all the services offered."Citibank plans to use the Aachen-based telecentre for CitiPhone DirectBanking to target customers in other European countries. Aachen is wellsituated for this purpose in the German, Dutch and Belgian bordertriangle, close to France and within easy reach of the UK, so thatstaff with mother tongues can easily be recruited.In order to tap new market potential in Germany, Citibank entered inDecember into an extensive collaboration agreement with HDIHaftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie, the country's seventhlargest insurance group.HDI is taking over the entire insurance operations of the CitibankGroup in Germany through the purchase of all shares in its insuranceholding company, Citifinanzleistungen GmbH. This company holds all theshares in Citi Lebensversicherung, set up in 1985 and in CitiVersicherung, set up in 1992. A purchase price has not been disclosed.Under the agreement, Citibank will integrate the products of HDI intothe marketing channels of its banking operations - both the branchnetwork and telephone banking channel - and HDI will, in turn, offerits private clients the banking products and services of Citibank."HDI's 1.8 million private insurance customers will provide us withvery good cross-selling business,", Mindermann said.Citi Leben, whose product range covers individual, whole life and riskinsurance, had total sum insured by end-November 1995 of DM16.7billion, up 4 percent on 1994. HDI notched up consolidated premiumincome totalling DM8 billion in 1994 and a net profit of DM134 million.This kind of co-operative agreement will be important for Citibank inEurope in promoting its concept of a "multi- finance service in bankingoperations", Mindermann said. In linking up with HDI, Citibank iscontinuing along the path already taken in offering home financing(together with Rheinboden), home savings agreements (with mh) andhealth insurance (with Barmenia) in order to optimise its own financialservices business by exploiting "intercorporate alliances".The most recent European market Citibank has targeted with its consumerservices is the UK. During 1995, it opened five branches, all followingthe same strategy as elsewhere on the globe."We simply rolled out what's been happening in Germany, France andSpain," said Mike Dennehy, consumer banking and marketing director forthe UK. "The UK is such a mature and sophisticated market that we hadto be sure we got the formula exactly right before starting a consumeroperation."Account structures differ around Europe but the UK has adopted variousfeatures from other Citibank markets. For example, if a customer has abalance of over #2,000 on all of his/her accounts, there is no bankingcharge, a feature of the Belgian operation.The UK has also taken on the Greek policy of instant credit cardissuance. Customers can receive a card on the spot, if they fulfil allthe requirements, simply by filling out a form.The biggest obstacle to setting up a retail operation in the UK was thefact that Citibank was so well known as a corporate bank, Dennehy said.In the UK since 1902, Citibank now employs 3,000 people, 400 of whichare now in the consumer business. The bank has been offering mortgagesfor 25 years. Dennehy stressed that Citibank in the UK is only after aniche market - clients earning #30,000 ($46,418) and above with an"international element to their lives"."We're not looking for hundreds of thousands of customers, but tens ofthousands," he said."They could be someone who works in Belgium oneweek out of four, or has a house in France, for instance."Citibank Germany - Key Statistics 1990-1995 (DM million)                                                       to Sep to Sep                           1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995Total Assets               10,881 12,683 14,394 15,158 15,190 15,854Net Incomea                  69.3   62.9   97.4  170.0      -      -Return on Assets             0.64%  0.53%  0.72%  1.12%     -      -Return on Equity             12.1%  10.5%  14.8%     -      -      -Customer deposits           8,637  9,878 11,187 12,139 12,344 13,000Lending volume              9,305 10,769 11,933 12,089 11,924 11,971Insurance in force         11,197 13,321 15,002 15,673      -      -Number of policies in force 2,021  2,331  2,577  2,795      -      -Number of accounts          2,965  3,274  3,578  3,658      -  4,400Visa Cards (000s)             170    202    260    302    342    383Total customer relationships              3,264  3,620  4,012  4,173      -      -Number of customers (millions)                   1.9    2.1    2.3    2.4      -    2.5Number of branches            303    304    303    304      -    300Number of employees         3,331  3,444  3,714  3,870      -  4,000Source : Citibank and Salomon BrothersCopyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

According to reports, Citibank'sFrench subsidiary is attempting to sell its small and medium-sizedenterprise portfolio and its small branch network in the provinces inorder to concentrate on its consumer banking business in the Parisarea. Among the possible candidates set to take over this portfolio isthe Banques Populaires group.The rumours, on which Citibank would not comment, come hard on theheels of news that prestigious names such as Banca Commerciale Italiana(Comit), Barclays Bank, La Caixa and American Express are all in theprocess of lowering their retail banking ambitions in France.Comit, for example, is thought to be discussing the sale of part of its19-branch network (most of which is on the Cote d'Azur, apart from fivebranches in Paris) to Banques Populaires. The Italian bank lost Fr495.8million ($100 million) in France in the period 1992-1994, mostlybecause of its involvement in speculative property loans.Less prominent names such as Banco di Napoli, ASLK-CGER Bank of Belgiumand the Banque Franco-Portugaise have also announced lay- offs anddecisions to refocus their businesses.The news also comes shortly after the release of figures by theAssociation Francaise des Banques which suggest that the chances ofsurvival of small niche-based retail banks (many of which are owned bynon-French institutions) are extremely slim. These suggest that netbanking income and operating profits have continued to fall steadilythrough the first half of 1995.As foreign banks in France generally lack the critical mass towithstand this downward pressure and increasing competition, theirattempts to carve out a branch-based business have been frustrated.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

(454 words) A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORS (150 words) CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993PORTUGAL BEATS GERMANY TO TOP LEAGUE OF SAVERSThe Portuguese appear to be the thriftiest people in Europe, accordingto OECD data.The surprising figures push Italy and Germany into second and thirdplaces in terms of household savings as a proportion of disposableincome.In absolute terms, the Germans save more than any other Europeans -simply because there are more of them, each with more money at his orher disposal than the majority of other Europeans.The reunification of the two German republics in October 1990 makeshistorical comparisons and projections in the area of personal savingsproblematical.But in round figures, German households could put away something likeDM150 billion (Ecu 77 bn) this year in long-term financial investments- including life assurance and occupational pension funds.Besides being among Europe's heaviest savers, the Germans also have thedistinction of being the steadiest.In comparison with other states they show a batch of remarkablyconsistent savings ratios:  total savings (including investment inhousing) as a percentage of disposable income;  financial savings as apercentage of total resources available for investment; or long-termfinancial savings in relation to short-term - all follow aconspicuously regular pattern.Another distinguishing feature of German households is a low level ofindebtedness, particularly compared with the French and the British.Although there is evidence that in Germany (as in the United Kingdom)consumers regard borrowed money in very much the same way as income, aspart, in other words, of their normal budget, a recent survey showedthat nearly half the adult German population still feels uneasy aboutthe idea of having to take out a loan.Higher consumer confidenceAccording to the OECD, from  data supplied by the Ministry of Financeand the Bank of Portugal, Portuguese households save a greaterproportion of their income than anyone else in Europe.Throughout the 1980s the personal savings ratio, as defined above,averaged 25.9 per cent.The ratio reached a peak of 28.3 per cent in 1985, but declined bynearly six percentage points over the next three years.Although real disposable income grew at the record rate of 6.5 per centin 1990, its rate of increase has since eased to 2.8 per cent in 1992.At the same time, the savings ratio has also continued to decline, andin 1992 was 21.6 per cent.The decline was probably due to a number of factors.  The slowing downof consumer price inflation, with its positive impact on households'net worth was one.Added to this were higher consumer confidence, the progressive relaxingof liquidity constraints, expectations of higher permanent incomes asfuture employment prospects improved, and (until 1991, at least) thenotably sharp rise in retirement pensions.But a household savings ratio of 21.6 per cent of disposable income isstill well above the ratios of the other OECD countries, and a numberof social and economic factors are at work to maintain such a highrate.It is estimated that there are some 4.3 mn  Portuguese living abroad(one million of them in other EC countries), compared with a residentpopulation of 10.4 mn.Remittances from emigrant workers, although showing a decline in 1992,have made and still make a substantial contribution on current accountto the Portuguese balance of payments, and although no data areavailable to allow one to distinguish this specific flow of funds,these remittances may be assumed to give a significant boost topersonal sector savings.A comparatively high proportion of the resident workforce is self-employed, and motivated by the consequent volatility of income andcomparatively low social protection to maintain a fairly high level ofprecautionary saving.A further element in personal saving is probably intended to maintainor restore the net wealth of households subject to erosion  by a rateof inflation which, although falling since 1990 is still the secondhighest (after Greece) in the European Community.Finally, the relatively under developed consumer credit market may alsoplay a part in Portugal's high household savings ratio, as it certainlydoes in Italy.Italy has the highest household savings rate of all the major OECDcountries -  in recent years even above Japan by between one and twopercentage points.Although the rate has declined steadily since its peak around 26 percent in the 1960s and early 1970s, in the last three years it hasaveraged more than 15 per cent, compared with just over 8 per cent inthe United Kingdom and 12 per cent in Germany.The fact that Italy's savings rate is so high is at first sightsurprising, and probably not consonant with what many people outsideItaly take to be the national temperament.  But the causes of such ahigh rate are not immediately cultural, but technical.Low development of capital marketsIn a paper1 presented to an international conference on savingsbehaviour held in Helsinki in 1991, a team of Italian economists foundthat the low development of Italian capital markets was the main reasonfor three conspicuous characteristics of the Italian savings rate(whether national or private): its high level; its substantialreduction in the past three decades; and its strong correlation withthe growth of the national economy.The authors of the paper showed that Italian credit and insurancemarkets are considerably smaller, relative to GDP, than those of othercomparably developed countries.Credit finances a trivial share of household consumption andinvestment, Italy's small credit market being explained by the terms ofconsumer credit (high down payment levels; a wide spread betweenborrowing and lending rates) rather than by demographic or culturalfactors.One consequence of these technical factors is that the Italian mortgagemarket is one of the smallest among OECD countries, and expressed as apercentage of private consumption expenditure, only a small fraction ofthe average of the seven major (G7) countries.  This factor alone,according to Sig Guiso and his co-authors,  may account for some two orthree percentage points in the aggregate savings ratio.Italians still buy little life insuranceItalians still buy very little life insurance, in comparison with thecitizens of other G7 countries, particularly.  Life assurance premiumincome is now increasing rapidly (by 22 per cent in 1991, compared with19 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany), but the level oflife assurance per inhabitant is still only a fraction (between  20 and25 per cent) of the level in those other two EC countries.The authors of the Helsinki paper give reasons, however, for supposingthat credit market imperfections outweigh imperfect insurance marketsin explaining the behaviour of Italian households.They also discount any special bequest motive in explaining the highpersonal savings rate, arguing that the rate at which the elderly shedtheir assets is actually greater in Italy than in Japan or the UnitedStates.`The  evidence,'  they conclude, `suggests that Italians are notdifferent in any major respect from other OECD citizens;  rather, it isItalian capital markets that are different.'1  Luigi Guiso, Tullio Jappelli, and Daniele Terlizzese, `Saving andcapital market imperfections: the Italian experience', Helsinki, May1991.Financial saving and borrowing of Italian households1990-1992 (L'000 bn)Current savings            1990        19913       1992Cash                        1.5         6.3         8.4Sight deposits             33.6        41.9        -5.7Other deposits             54.9        37.1        46.1Short-dated securities     29.0        17.1        57.5Medium- and long-dated securities                55.5        71.9        30.1  of which: Treasury bills and bonds (46.0)      (53.1)      (24.3)Investment funds            0.8         5.3         0.7Equities                   15.2         5.0         6.4Foreign assets              4.0        16.2        17.5Other financial assets, incl. claims on insurance companies       22.0        25.9        39.8Total savings1            216.7       226.7       200.8Ecu bn equivalent2        142.2       147.9       126.5BorrowingShort-dated debt           10.2        10.8         7.2  of which: debt with banks           (9.7)      (10.7)       (7.1)Medium- and long-dated debt                      18.6        20.2        11.5  of which: debt with banks           (7.1)       (9.4)       (4.8)  debt with special credit  institutions             (8.6)       (9.0)       (7.3)Other financial liabilities incl. consumer credit            2.5         5.8         7.8Total borrowing            31.3        36.8        26.5Ecu bn equivalent2         20.5        24.1        16.71 Discrepancies due to rounding2 At annual average rate of exchange3 Change in methodology in 1991 makes earlierfigures not always strictly comparableSource: Bank of Italy}}Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993RATIONALE OF THE RATIOSIn spite of their importance to national economies, household orpersonal savings are defined by official statisticians essentially as aresidual item.Savings from their point of view are simply that portion of anindividual's income that he or she refrains from spending.  They'rewhat's left, in other words, after consumers have stopped consuming.Official statisticians also like to refer to `disposable income', bywhich they mean income, from whatever source, after taxes have beenpaid and social security payments or receipts have been netted out.Flows of personal savings are calculated in effect as the surplus ofcurrent income over current expenditure, and disposable income isallocated for the purposes of national accounts entirely between savingand consumption.Consumption is estimated from a variety of data, and simply deductedfrom income in order to arrive at savings.The figures on savings are supposed to be checked against otherindicative data, but this enterprise tends to show up some prettyglaring discrepancies, which official statisticians seek to correct byfalling back on conveniently undefined `balancing items'.In any case, household savings, as featured in national accounts,include investment in housing, both in house or apartment purchase andhome renovation or improvement.In some countries, spending on consumer durables is also sometimescounted as saving.Realistic measure of savingsFinancial savings, which are mainly what this newsletter is concernedwith, are therefore only a part of household savings, as habituallydefined.But if the numerator in the household savings ratio is too broad toindicate the magnitude of purely financial savings, the denominator istoo narrow to determine households' financial resources.Because apart from actual income, derived from salaries, wages andinvestments, householders (which in practical terms include millions ofindividuals who do not actually hold a house) also often borrow money,and perhaps not quite so often, inherit it.For this reason, more and more analysts of savings trends in a numberof countries are focusing attention on the financial resourcesavailable to households, rather than on income as usually defined.The practical implications of what may seem to be conceptual nuancesare enormous.From the point of view of financial services, as pointed out by DrDavid Fleming in his paper, Time for a realistic measure of savings1,,`a high-savings, highly-borrowed market is very different from a low-savings, lightly-borrowed market, even if the net savings level is thesame in each case.'Why bother, then, with the traditional household savings ratio?The only answer to this is that for the time being it is the most fullydocumented and consistently estimated savings indicator available.

These funds may beconstituted within the assets of an individual company.Self-employed workers and tradesmen and free-lance professionals,grouped by trade or profession or territorial sector, or by their tradeassociations, may constitute defined benefit plans.The benefits, the size of which will be determined by the statutory andcontractual choices made at the act of constitution of each pensionfund, will be paid in the form of income (rendita), though members mayreceive a lump sum (capitale) equivalent to 50 per cent of the currentvalue of the amount accrued.Length of service benefits will be paidMembers who have contributed to the new funds for at least five yearswill be eligible for old age pension benefits when they reach thepensionable age laid down in the compulsory system.Length-of-service benefits will be paid to individuals who have beenmembers of the funds for at least 15 years, and who are not more thanten years younger than the age envisaged in the compulsory system(which will be raised gradually from 60 to 65 years for men, and from55 to 60 for women).Fund members for whom severance pay (trattamento di fine rapporto -TFR) has been accrued for at least eight years may be granted advancepayments for medical treatment or for the purchase of a house as first-time buyers.For tax purposes, employers may deduct contributions up to 50 per centof the quota taken from the TFR.Members' contributions will benefit from a 27 per cent tax deduction onamounts up to a maximum of L3 mn.This applies to all contributors, whether they are employees (for whomcontributions are also made by their employers and from the TFR) orself-employed (for whom such contributions are not paid).The L3 mn limit also includes other deductions that may be made for thepayment of life policy and health premiums.The contributions made out of the annual allocation to the TFR are nottaxable, but when the TFR is liquidated, these quotas are taken intoaccount in determining the amount of tax to be paid.All payments into the fund will be subject to a withholding tax of 15per cent per annum, but members are allowed a tax deduction of 17.6 percent on the income or capital they eventually receive.Company payments are subject to a 10 per cent `solidarity contribution'to the national institute for social security (Istituto nazionale diprevidenza sociale - INPS).The supplementary pension funds are not allowed to undertake insurancecommitments directly.Their assets may be managed under agreements concluded with threedistinct types of entity.The first is the so-called SIM - societe di intermediazione mobiliare,a type of company instituted in December 1990 which as well as carryingout brokerage, dealing, market making and underwriting operations mayalso manage assets.Banks rank with SIM for this purpose, as well as other ECintermediaries that perform the same activity and that have obtainedmutual recognition.The second category of pension fund asset managers comprises  insurancecompanies authorised to handle life assurance and capital redemptionpolicies.  Indeed, plans with defined benefits and guaranteed rates offinancial return are allowed to manage their resources only throughcontracts with these insurance companies.Financing by workers and employersFinally, fund assets may be managed by entities already managingcompulsory pension schemes (principally the INPS).With the permission of the anti-trust authority, the INPS may concludeagreements with the supplementary pension funds for the collection ofcontributions and the disbursement of benefits.`Open' (as distinct from defined group) pension funds may be institutedby the intermediaries authorised to manage ordinary pension funds(brokers, banks, insurance companies, social insurance institutions) aswell as by the companies that manage investment funds (fondi comunid'investimento).Membership of open pension funds is available only to workers coveredby the compulsory pension system and employed by companies that havenot established complementary pension schemes, and to workers who havelost the requirements for participating in the group schemes to whichthey would normally belong.Financing the complementary pension funds is the responsibility of theworkers and the employers.No one may contribute more than 10 per cent either, in the case ofemployees, of the annual wage taken as the basis for determiningseverance pay, or, in the case of the self-employed, of annual income.The government is expected to make some changes to the decree,particularly concerning its tax provisions, perhaps changing the 15 percent withholding tax and introducing instead a 15 per cent obligatoryinvestment in convertible bonds to encourage privatisation.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  RECLASSIFICATION OF SICAVS AND FCPSThe French stock market supervisory body, the Commission des operationsde Bourse  (COB), has revealed details of its plans to change theclassification of all managed funds operating in France.All Sicavs and fonds communs de placement (FCPs) sold in France will beaffected by the new classification, due to take effect from January 1,1994.The new system involves five descriptive categories and three sub-categories, and replaces an out-of-date 13-category classificationintroduced in 1985 before derivative products became an important partof funds, and before Sicav monetaires took off.The new categories are designed to inform savers more clearly whether afund is invested in equities, bonds, or monetary instruments, whetherit has a guarantee, or whether it involves potential currency exposure.For investors this is expected to give a better appreciation of riskthan the old system which, while giving an idea of equities, bonds andshort-term investments, divided these into several sub-sections withminor differences.The COB says that the new system will also help multi-service groupssuch as banks and financial intermediaries determine theirresponsibilities in relation to investors and their depository bodies.France is the only European country to have an obligatory fundclassification system that has such an impact on the day-to-dayoperation of funds.The new classification requires an equity fund to remain at least 60per cent invested in equities at all times.  A monetary instrument fundis restricted to a maximum of 10 per cent investment in equities.Funds holding convertibles must declare whether their convertiblesbehave more like an equity or more like a bond.Fund managers now have four months to decide which categories theirfunds fall into, and to make any necessary adjustments to managementaims and techniques.The COB will then give its approval to the self-declared allegiance, orsuggest a recategorisation.Any fund managers who disagree with COB recommendations can move to thediversified section, which covers all funds not eligible for `pure'categories.Although the new system of classification was not prompted by the ucitsdirective, it is expected that French funds will remain compatible withit.Foreign funds sold in France are unlikely to have to change theirmanagement practices, as they fall straightforwardly into the foreignequities, foreign bonds, or foreign monetary categories in the case ofsingle-instrument products or, for mixed funds, into the catch-alldiversified products category, which will also include all funds underdiscretionary management, as well as funds invested in convertiblestocks.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993SPAIN:  FIRST PROPERTY FUNDS LIKELY BY AUTUMNProperty investment funds - fondos de inversion inmobiliaria - are thelatest arrival on the investment scene in Spain, under a royal decreeissued last month.The concept of such funds has existed in Spanish law since 1964 but itwas not until July last year that a new law specifically laid out theframework for an instrument that is well established in many other ECmember states.And only in May this year, with the issuing of royal decree 686/1993,was the earlier framework fleshed out with the detail needed for thecreation of the first property funds, which may be launched as early asthe autumn.One of the benefits that Spanish officials hope to reap from this newsavings instrument is a stimulus to the housing market, at present deepin the doldrums.Property investment funds tend to flourish in a relatively deep andwell-developed property market, where they may boost its developmentand enhance its stability.Opening the way for small savers to enter the housing market via fondosinmobiliarios will mean `new financing for the property market',according to a top executive of the Groupe Pelloux.Spanish officials also hope that the new funds will fill a specific andimportant market gap: that of rental housing, which is scarce in Spain.The July 1992 law clearly referred to the role it is hoped the fundswill play by calling them in the preamble `a component of thegovernment's housing policy.'  But some experts say this narrow focusis a weak point of the 1992 law.A needed long-term investment vehicleAnother great benefit of property investment funds in Spain is thatthey will provide a new and much-needed long-term investment instrumentin Spain.According to the same Groupe Pelloux spokesman, the funds will fill agap in Spanish capital markets, which at present have only 10-yearTreasury bonds as long-term instruments, whose volume is still quitesmall.The 1992 law specifies that property investments may not exceed between70 and 80 per cent of the fund's assets.  The remainder can be investedin tradable securities, either equities or bonds.A new fund must have assets of at least Ptas1.5 bn (Ecu10 mn).It must have at least 100 participants, and no individual investor mayhold more than a 25 per cent share in the fund.Property assets will be valued at least once a year by assessorsregistered with the bank of Spain.Another feature of the law is that it aims to encourage medium-and long-term investment by tying tax benefits to a minimum four-year period ofownership of property by the fund.Still to be defined by the Ministry of the Economy are the rules to beapplied to the diversification of funds' real estate holdings, to avoidthe risks inherent in undue concentration in a single property.The Ministry must also decide what types of property will be open toinvestment by the funds - whether, for example, building lots can alsobe included.Limits will also have to be set on the amount of outstanding loans thata fund may contract.But although these details have still to be clarified, an official ofthe Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), the stock marketregulatory body that will supervise the funds, claims that there isalready more than one candidate waiting to be the first on the market.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  SHARE OWNERSHIP SET TO REVIVEThe first quarter of the year showed Sicav managers increasing theirexposure to equities.With only part of the increase attributable to the strength of thestock market, the value of shares in their portfolios rose by FF90 bn(Ecu13.7 bn).French fund managers increased the proportion of the CAC-100 indexaccounted for by Sicavs from 5.88 per cent to 6.36 per cent, accordingto the Dealers' Book.That is a tiny fraction compared with their counterparts across thechannel, but an increase in the funds' exposure to equities is anecessary condition for the success of the privatisation programme.But there may still be a lot of resistance to overcome.Spectacular fall in equity fund ownersAccording to a study conducted by Sofres, the polling agency, on behalfof the Bank of France, the number of private individuals holding shareshas dropped by some 900,000 to 4.5 mn since April 1991, the last timethe survey was conducted.The number of people owning equity funds dropped even morespectacularly, from 7.5 mn to 3.2 mn, but the numbers owning moneymarket funds rose from 4 mn to 5.6 mn over the same  period.Of the approximately FF1,000 bn (Ecu150 bn) held in Sicav monetaires,some FF700 bn (Ecu135 bn) is invested by private individuals, and therest by companies that use the funds as short-term means of cashmanagement.The Bank of France and the Societe des Bourses francaises  (SBF - theexecutive authority governing the day-to-day operations of the stockmarket) remain optimistic, however, that share holding will rise again,as historically privatisation programmes have been major periods ofincrease, when young persons particularly are tempted to invest inequities.The managing director of the Commission des operations de Bourse (COB),M. Pierre Fleuriot, predicts that employee share schemes and the tax-favourable equity savings scheme introduced in September 1992 (the pland'epargne en actions - PEA) will also have the effect of lifting shareownership.The importance of small investors is shown by the fact that over halfthe people in France owning equities have a portfolio worth less thanFF50,000 (Ecu7,600).Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993GERMANY:  GERMAN EQUITIES BRING GREATER REWARDS...Mr Ralf Conen, head of quantitative capital markets analysis atDeutsche Bank, has recently completed a study of stock market yields inGermany covering three historical periods  1876-1913; 1924-1941; and1949-1992.In each of these periods the average annual yield from equities wasconsiderably higher than the yield from fixed-interest securities, themost striking yield gap appearing in the period since 1949.Since 1949, according to Mr Conen, equities have shown an average realpost-tax return of 12.08 per cent a year, while bonds have shown anegative yield of 0.09 per cent.In another computation, the Deutsche Bank study claims that a Germaninvestor  who started in 1949 to put DM10,000 every year into equitieswould have been a millionaire in constant 1949 terms by 1977.But his next door neighbour who put the same amount into bonds eachyear would not be a genuine 1949-vintage millionaire until the year2059.Mr Conen is evidently making some pretty bold assumptions about thecourse of German taxes and consumer prices over the next 66 years, buthis general conclusion that the long-term German investor is paid apretty hefty risk premium for investing in equities seems unassailable. One of the more detailed findings of the study  is that, the longerthe time-span under consideration, the greater the probability that aninvestment in equities is more rewarding than one in bonds.If single years only are considered, equities were more profitable in56 out of the 97 years covered by the research.If periods of five years are taken as the basis of comparison, however,in 62 out of 85 possible runs, equities were more profitable; and inten-year periods, 54 out of 70.In percentage terms, this means that equities were more profitable in58 per cent of one-year periods, in 73 per cent of five-year periods,and in 77 per cent of ten-year periods.When periods of 20 years or more are taken as the basis of comparison,equities are found to have scored from 83 per cent up to 100 per centof the time.In spite of the higher performance of equities, however, the Germanpublic still show a marked preference for  bonds, at least when itcomes to putting money  into investment funds.Last year, for example, bond funds (both German and foreign) attracteda total of DM53.4 bn (Ecu27.3 bn) new money, equivalent to no less than86.5 per cent of the total inflow into German funds.As it happens, over the last year German bond funds have performed onaverage better than German equity funds, benefiting both from highyields on the bonds in their portfolios and from bond price risesresulting from the lowering of interest rates.But over the last ten years, for example, German equity funds haveoutperformed German bond funds by a considerable margin.According to the Bundesverband Deutscher Investment-Gesellschaften BVI(the German Investment Fund Association), German equity funds showed anaverage rise in unit value of 163.6 per cent in the ten years to theend of March, 1993, with the top-performing fund, SMH-Special-Fonds 1,registering an advance of 254.9 per cent.Compared with this, the best performance shown by German bond funds wasa 113.9 per cent gain by Universal's BERENBERG-UNIV.-RENTENFONDS (thefund which also turned in the best performance over 20 years).The average of the 28 funds in this sector to have a ten-year or longertrack record was a 98.2 per cent increase in unit value - a mere 60 percent of the equity fund average.This persistent preference for bond funds can only be based on short-term considerations.In any given year since 1949, bonds showed a minimum yield of 2.6 percent, whereas while the highest average yield of equities reached 47.2per cent in one year, there was a year in which investors saw anaverage loss of 14 per cent.But if the risk of losing money persuades German investors to forego thechance of enjoying more substantial returns, it also apparently focusestheir attention mistakenly on current values to the neglect of theerosive action of inflation , which in West Germany, though less thanhalf the EC average, has averaged nearly 4 per cent a year in the last20 years.`If you want to eat well, buy shares,' runs a German saying.  "If youwant to sleep well, buy bonds.'There may be something in that, but if consumer prices are rising whileyou sleep, your dream of a bond-invested nest egg could well turn intoa nightmare.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993UNITED KINGDOM:  PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE USED AS 'SOFT SELL'Although private medical insurance (PMI) is not in itself a savingsproduct, its development in the United Kingdom is linked to trends inthe broader savings market.It appears that life companies - especially those that operate throughtheir own direct sales forces - are getting into the PMI market as asoft way of prospecting clients for more lucrative business, such asprivate pensions.The tied sales agent must have a full range of products to offer inorder to prevent the client from going elsewhere for one particulartype of product, and then perhaps being seduced by a new company intobuying savings products as well.A newly-launched product is easier to sell, and health insurance hasproved attractive to an industry ever hungry for new products.Branching out into PMI offers the agent a pretext  to visit customersto see if this area of their financial planning is covered, when theroutine annual updating visit may have lost its sales pull.In recent years, tied agent companies such as Allied Dunbar and LloydsAbbey Life have entered the market, as well as major composites likeNorwich Union, Sun Alliance (through its purchase of Mutual of Omaha),and the guaranteed bond specialist General Portfolio.Allied Dunbar added PMI to a range which already comprised criticalillness cover (first offered in 1989) and permanent health insurance(1985).  Allied Dunbar make their own underwriting arrangements onthese two contracts through their life funds.  Their PMI contract isunderwritten by Lloyds syndicates.Allied Dunbar claim that one in five of all critical illness plans inforce in the United Kingdom is theirs, though in the PMI market theyare not yet a significant force, with only 20,000 contracts inexistence.Norwich Union made a major entry into the PMI market in 1990, settingup a new division which at the end of March 1993 claimed 375,000clients, an estimated one-third share of all new and switched businessin 1992, and a 6 per cent share of the total market.The managing director of Norwich Union Health Care, Mr David Cavers,says that PMI was seen to be a market capable of rapid growth,dominated by a couple of provident institutions (British UnionProvident Association - BUPA - of London and Private Patient Plan - PPP-  of Tunbridge Wells), only one of which has put a lot of money intomarketing.Norwich Union Health Care expects premium income of close to #100 mnthis year.The only link between Norwich Union's PMI product and other savingsplans is the distribution chain - both are sold largely throughintermediaries.Mr Cavers sees PMI as an under developed product for the intermediary.Brokers had not been selling it actively until the last four or fiveyears, when specialist advisers began to appear.`Intermediaries have now woken up to the fact that they can sellmedical plans to savings customers,' says Mr Cavers.The effect of such competition has been to make heavy inroads into themarket share of the leading companies, BUPA and PPP, with BUPA downfrom 80 per cent of the market to less than 50 per cent over the lastfive years.Continental firms enter the UK marketThe most recent development in the PMI market has been the link-upbetween the French healthcare mutual Strasbourgeoise and Clinicare, theUK specialist health insurer.Strasbourgeoise entered the British market in 1990 with a plan offeringa number of features not available in standard UK plans, but probablybecause of its high cost the plan did not attract a large market share.A standard view of the PMI market is that in the current economic andpolitical climate, it is bound to grow.But in practice, the market has disappointed expectations in recentyears.About seven million persons in the United Kingdom currently have healthinsurance.  The industry hopes to see 18 million insured by the end ofthe century.But rising claim rates and rising medical costs have hit insurers hard,and premiums have had to be increased by more than 10 per cent a yearfor several years.In 1992, so far from growing, the market is estimated to havecontracted by between 6 and 10 per cent.In spite of this, more companies are entering the market.  The DutchPMI company OHRA entered the United Kingdom market in March.A new joint venture between Cornhill Insurance and DeutscheKrankenversicherung AG is in the process of development, and its launchis expected in the next few monthswith a full range of products specialising in the hospital sector.No more major UK insurers are expected to launch PMI products, thoughit is thought that both Royal Life and the Prudential have been lookingat the market.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993UNITED KINGDOM:  SCOTTISH EQUITABLE GOES DUTCHPolicyholders of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life assurancecompany, will vote at the end of this month on a deal whereby the Dutchinsurer Aegon will buy a 40 per cent share of Scottish Equitable's unit-linked business.With-profits policyholders with Scottish Equitable will continue to own100 per cent of their fund.Scottish Equitable's rise has been meteoric in the independentfinancial adviser pensions market.In 1981, premium income was #105 mn.  By 1992 it had grown to #1,004mn.Recent comment suggests that Scottish Equitable has been a victim ofits own success: further expansion will be difficult without aninjection of capital, which is made more difficult by the company'smutual structure.Aegon - one of the top ten insurance groups in Europe, with 1992revenues equivalent to more than Ecu7.5 bn (nearly two-thirds of itrelated to life assurance) - will pay #200 mn into the Scottishcompany's with-profits fund, and a further #40 mn to capitalise the newholding company, which will be 60 per cent owned by the with-profitsfund and 40 per cent by Aegon.This arrangement has been arrived at because it is estimated that fulldemutualisation would have cost Aegon as much as #700 mn.Scottish Equitable and Aegon are waiting for confirmation from the ECCommission that the proposed deal is not anti-competitive, as well asfor the approval of policyholders.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993UNITED KINGDOM:  SECOND-HAND DEALERS FLOURISHPolicy Portfolio, the North London-based market maker in second-handwith-profits endowment policies, announced last week its intention toseek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange.The move will make it the only second-hand policy market maker to belisted in its own right.Recession in the United Kingdom has seen a surge in the fortunes ofdealers in second-hand policies.According to the managing director of Policy Portfolio, Mr Isaac Rubin,more than 50 per cent of with-profits policies taken out in the UnitedKingdom are surrendered before they reach maturity.Owing to clawback of commission and other effects of policy charges,surrender values can be poor, even after the policy has been in forcefor several years.Policyholders can get a better return by selling the policy on toanother investor, who then collects the final policy value on maturityor the death of the original owner.Policies `overvalued'Several market makers are now in business in Great Britain.  Oneinvestment trust has been set up by Kleinwort to hold second-handpolicies, and two further investment trusts are planned, one fromBarclays de Zoete Wedd market maker Beale Dobie, and the other frommarket maker Gerald Edelman.Insurance companies offering the original policies fear that they maybe overvalued and that the market is not big enough to support all theplayers at present in it.The Kleinwort fund, launched in July 1992, raised #30 mn, of which lessthan half has so far been invested, because of a shortage of suitablepolicies.The Financial Intermediaries', Managers' and Brokers' Association(FIMBRA), one of the United Kingdom's self-regulating organisations,recently introduced a ruling to make market makers modify their claimsfor the projected values of the policies being sold.The leading with-profits company Standard Life has also causedcontroversy recently by writing to holders of second-hand policies tosay that only the normal policy benefits will accrue to such policies.The company has been quoted as saying that prices `have been bid upbeyond reasonable levels'.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  BIG GROUPS TO BE PRIVATISEDWhereas some 50 conservative deputies either abstained or voted againstthe law to give the Bank of France greater independence, the unveilingof the list of state enterprises that are candidates for privatisationcaused far less contention among the government's supporters.Most commercial and industrial companies are considered privatisable,and it appears that the government has no intention of holding on toeither the three state-controlled insurance giants (AGF, GAN and UAPwhich between them account for about 28 per cent of new life assurancebusiness in France) or banks like Banque Nationale de Paris - BNP andCredit Lyonnais, which do not look particularly attractive buys at themoment owing to their exposure to small companies, entertainment andproperty.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993FRANCE:  PUBLICITY DRIVE FOR POSTE AVENIRLa Poste, the French post office, is giving a huge publicity spin(television ads in prime time and inserts in every TV listingsmagazine) to its already established Poste Avenir savings and lifeassurance contract.Managed by the state-controlled Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP),France's leading life assurer, Poste Avenir is guaranteeing 8 per centnet of management fees for sums (minimum FF3,000) invested before June30.As this is a life-related product, it also gives rise to useful taxbreaks - reductions of FF1,000 per adult and FF250 per dependent childin the family.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993INSURERS LOSE OUT TO BANKSThe longer institutions are involved in bancassurance, the wider thescope of products and services they aim for, with banks getting themost benefit from integration.This is one of the key findings of a paneuropean survey, Makingbancassurance work, published  by Coopers&Lybrand and based oninterviews with senior management of 54 leading players inbancassurance in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and theUnited Kingdom.As an example of what they mean by `integration` the authors of thesurvey cite a move from a marketing agreement between a bank and aninsurance company to an exclusive arrangement involving joint training,product and sales development.Similarly, a merging of a bank's insurance subsidiary's marketing orinvestment management department into one group-led department alsorepresents more integration.According to Mr Angus Hislop, a consultant with C&L's financialservices group, banks have gained much more from bancassurance thaninsurers. With life products in particular, they have succeeded inreaching many more of their own customers.UK institutions the exceptionWhile over two-thirds of all the institutions interviewed for the C&Lsurvey stated that a major integration had either already been appliedor was planned for at least one of five business functions (salesforce/distribution channels; marketing; service departments;administration; and senior management), seven out of the 11 UKinstitutions were not planning any integration at all.In other words, the UK institutions show the inverse of the trend amongthe continental institutions surveyed.This, suggest C&L, may be due to a traditionally more short-termorientation; greater opportunities for early reduction of the unusuallyhigh distribution costs without integration; and a more scepticalattitude towards the achievement of economies of scale in distributionand operational functions.In contrast to the continental institutions, half of the UKinstitutions do not plan to realise scale effects in sales anddistribution.But 30 out of the 43 continental institutions plan to integrate theirdistribution channels and sales forces, and 32 of them plan tointegrate marketing functions.The reasons for developing bancassurance cited most often by thesurvey's respondents were factors such as recognising changes inclients' needs, such as, for example, the demand for more personalwealth management; building closer ties with clients; and serving themat all stages of their lives.This last factor was singled out by all the institutions planning orapplying major integration of business functions as a driving impulsebehind bancassurance.Defensive and offensive strategyDefending their customer base is another major driving factor,especially for institutions integrating their market approaches andstructure.The survey cites the example of a large French institution whoseprimary goal is to sell life assurance.  If the client does not want tobuy at a particular moment, savings products are used to maintain therelationship with the customer.A few years later this client will be approached again for lifeassurance, and bancassurance is therefore implemented to protect thecore insurance business.  (We might add, however, that the distinctionbetween life and savings products is not so clear in France as in otherEC countries).A similar approach has been used by French banks that have successfullyoffered money funds to their clients to discourage them fromtransferring to other institutions.In Italy, more than one institution indicated that life assurance, witha link to a current account, is an effective way to tie the client infor the medium term.Seen in this light, bancassurance is as much a defensive strategy toward off threats to an institution's client base as an offensive one toexploit opportunities made possible by integration of businessfunctions.Further information on the survey is obtainable from: Angus Hislop,Coopers&Lybrand.

These loans now amount to closeto DM3 bn, equivalent to 1 per cent of the banks' domestic mortgageloans.Most of the credit granted abroad has been to German clients, and theUnited Kingdom, France and Netherlands are the main countriesconcerned.The mortgage banks have loans to foreign local authorities to a totalof DM7.5 bn on their balance sheets, equivalent to 2.4 per cent oftotal local authority loans.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993GERMANY:  LIFE INDUSTRY PYRAMID SALESMEN UNDER ATTACKNew life assurance contracts to the tune of DM 400 billion were writtenin Germany in 1992, and pyramid sales companies probably accounted formore than one-fifth of that colossal total.The Strukturvertriebe, to give them a name which they do not alwaysacknowledge, have been the German life industry's success story of thelast decade.They first appeared on the scene in the aftermath of the IOS debacle,and after a comparatively slow start could still claim only about 8 percent of total new life business by 1985.But their share of the market more than doubled in the next five years,and although its rate of growth has slowed down, it is still expanding,and by the end of the decade on present form could well be nudging 25per cent of the total.A hierarchy of eight levelsNot only have the Struckis - as the pyramid salesmen are colloquiallyknown in Germany -  been capturing a rapidly increasing share of themarket, but the total market is itself growing apace.To take one indicator, since 1980 life assurance gross premium incomehas increased at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 9 per cent,and in 1992 amounted to a massive DM69.4 billion.More recently, however, the rate of growth has been accelerating, andin the last three years it has averaged more than 12 per cent.In part this acceleration is due to the accession in October 1990 ofthe former East German Lander, where a population of 16 million couldnot boast a single life assurance policy between them beforereunification.Significantly enough, the Struckis have been particularly active inthese Lander, where it is claimed they may have as much as 30 per centof the market.A Strukturvertrieb consists of a number  of teams reporting upwardsthrough a hierarchy of as many as seven or eight levels.Senior managers (typically known as regional directors) owe theirposition entirely to the constant generation of sales income by thosebelow them in the structure.Recruits are usually drawn from outside the financial services sectorbut, prompted by their companies, they tend to call themselvesFinanzberater or Vermogensberater (literally, wealth or assetsadvisers).And if these self-styled advisers often prefer not to be known asinsurance salesmen, the companies, too, would rather be known to thepublic as Allfinanzvertriebe, and like to get the word Beratung(`consultation') into their registered name.Officially, indeed, such a company is likely to be registered as anindependent sales force (eigenstandige Aussendienst), while beingwholly or partly owned by an insurance company.But a Strukturvertrieb's independence may be genuine to the extent thatit does not sell exclusively own-house products, but a fairly widerange of insurance and investment products from a number of suppliers.In the former East Germany, one product that has been particularlypopular is a short-term savings contract taking advantage of a Stateincentive and designed to release capital for house purchase orrenovation.Companies selling their products through Struckis have to pay highercommissions than they offer to brokers or to their own tied agents(considerably higher in the latter case).An excessively high lapse rate for policies sold by Struckis - reportedto be as high for some as 18 per cent, or four times the rateexperienced on average by other sales methods - adds significantly tothe acquisition costs of pyramid sales.Salesmen thoroughly trainedA necessary feature of the system is that commissions received by theStruckis are never passed on intact to the salesmen..As much as one-third may be deducted immediately for company overheads,and the balance then percolates through the structure in everdecreasing percentages, so that a junior salesman usually receivesbetween 1 and 1.5 per cent.An established insurance company agent, by comparison, receives acommission of 3.5 per cent.The Strukturvertriebe give new salesmen a thorough training not only inselling financial products, but in recruiting new potential salesmen.One of the leading Strukturvertriebe, Bonn Finanz Vermogensberatung AG(100 per cent owned by the insurance company Deutscher Herold, recentlybought by Deutsche Bank), mounts a 12-week training course.This consists of three five-day residential seminars backed by workexperience, for which the aspiring salesman has to pay DM2,500.In general, however, the demands of a system that requires the newrecruit to force through as many sales as he can in the shortestpossible time and to persuade other people to work for him lead to anexceptionally high dropout rate.In fact, it is claimed by critics of the pyramid sales  system thatonly about one recruit in five survives the first year of selling.But that is probably the mildest criticism levelled against theStrukturvertriebe.The main objections are raised against the Struckis' high pressureselling methods.Legally obliged to give good adviceBrokers belonging to medium and small firms, particularly (the largefirms not usually being concerned with mass personal lines insurance)feel themselves at a disadvantage, because unlike the Struckis they arelegally obliged to give their clients good advice (not yet `bestadvice'!) about the growth prospects of investments and protectionagainst risks.The Struckis benefit from the fact that in Germany the emphasis in thesupervision of insurance is on products, the design and pricing ofwhich have to conform to strict guidelines.Distribution of products, on the other hand, is comparativelyunregulated.  There is, for instance, no provision under law for thelicensing or testing of insurance intermediaries, whether they work ascompany tied agents or in the independent sector.One man who has mounted a vigorous campaign to have tougher rulesapplied to independent financial intermediaries is Hans-Wolff Graf, thechairman and chief executive of the Munich-based financial servicescompany efv-AG (Erste Finanz- und Vermogensberater Aktiengesellschaftin Deutschland).Mr Graf began his own career with IOS and then continued with two ofthe largest Allfinanzvertriebe before setting up his own company, andhe brings the missionary zeal of a religious convert to his  campaign.`To sell a pork cutlet in Germany,' he says, `you have to study forthree years and then work constantly under the vigilant eye of the law.`Nothing like this is required from anyone selling financial contracts,including life assurance policies.'Mr Graf has submitted a draft law governing independent financialintermediaries to the authorities and has set up a registeredassociation to pursue his cause.Embarrassed by sales techniquesOne of his more startling claims is that unqualified salesmen, or`pseudo-consultants' as he calls them will have received more than DM10 billion in commission last year from new contracts that will sooneror later be cancelled prematurely.So far Mr Graf has received little encouragement from Bonn, but theBerlin-based supervisory authority, the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur dasVersicherungswesen, is said to be embarrassed by the Struckis'aggressive sales techniques and the flamboyant public image of some ofthe leading figures in the sector.But while these misgivings may be shared by the life assurance industryin general, many insurance companies have lost members of their tiedagent force to the independent sector, and in the process have becomeheavily dependent on Struckis for their new businessSome companies have bought majority or even total share holdings in aStrukturvertrieb, and although stricter requirements may one day beimposed on the training and professional standards of the pyramidsalesmen, a system bringing as much as DM 15 billion a year in premiumincome is bound to have some keen champions even among the older Germanlife assurance companies.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993PYRAMID POWER ON THE WANE?While the authorities may be slow to tighten their supervision of thepyramid salesmen, the Strukturvertriebe may become the victims of theirown excesses.According to a recent article in manager magazin (published in Hamburg), Germany's second largest Allfinanz- or Strukturvertrieb is faced witha number of problems.Objektive Vermogensberatung GmbH (OVB) was founded in 1970 by OttoWittschier, one of the most senior former IOS salesmen still active inGermany.  The company's principal shareholder is Deutscher Ring, butOVB sells a variety of insurance and savings products on behalf of asmany as 18 companies, including Equity & Law, American Express, andDeutsche Bank's DWS investment fund company.Data for such items as sales forces are always given in suspiciouslyround figures for Strukturvertriebe, but a figure of 15,000 salesmen(nearly one-third of them recruited in the former DDR) is frequentlyquoted for OVB.  But many of these salesmen are reported to becurrently doing little or no business.Selling mainly life assurance, investment funds, and house purchasecontracts, OVB's salespersons raised the company's turnover from DM4.4bn in 1989 to DM12.7 bn in 1990, and then to DM15.4 bn in 1991.  But in1992, turnover plummeted by an ominous 19 per cent to DM12.5 bn.One reason for the fall in new business appears to be a drying up ofthe east German market, where OVB had scored some of its most strikingsuccesses.  But there are also difficulties between Mr Wittschier andhis two co-founders and the parent company.Under a contentious agreement between the two, Deutscher Ring has tobuy the founders out if they so demand, but Deutscher Ring is reportedto be unwilling to do this.Further problems are being created by the departure of key personnel atthe top of the company's hierarchy.  One former OVB salesman, MrCarsten Maschmeyer, left while still in his 20s in to found his owncompany, Allgemeiner Wirtschaftsdienst, in 1988, and the possibility ofnew rivals (one's own former star salesmen, as likely as not) appearingin such an unregulated field must always threaten the establishedcompanies.One casualty of OVB's present plight is its ambitious plan to extendoperations to other European countries.  After, according to managermagazin, spending half a million marks on studies and analysis, it hasput its intended Italian operation on the back burner.  In Austria,where OVB established itself in 1991, the level of business has beendecidedly modest, and in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, onlythe legal formalities have been completed.  OVB was also reported tohave had plans to start up in the United Kingdom, but if there everreally were such plans, they seem to have been dropped.Back to Headline List CopyrightEUROPEAN SAVINGS MARKETS via NewsNetJune 24, 1993A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORSApart from demographic changes, the single factor to have most impacton future savings trends in Germany will be the growth of personalincomes. This will affect both the volume of savings and the way theyare allocated between the various available vehicles.Over the next two decades, for the first time since 1945, a wholegeneration of German citizens will come into substantial inheritedwealth. According to estimates made by banks, this generation ofGermans will have aggregate assets of DM 2,500 bn, and their attitudestowards investments will be vastly different from that of previousgenerations who experienced hyper-inflation coupled with economic andpolitical turmoil. Banks believe they will be more receptive towardsnew savings products..Some market researchers claim that there is a new generation of jungenAufstiegsorientierten, akin to yuppies, who demand a wider range offinancial products more finely tuned to the individual's requirements.Back to Headline List WT02-B39-3IA074-000493-B040-250http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi87.html 205.156.212.5 19970122010324 text/html 74823HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:01:19 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:09 GMTContent-length: 74636Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi87.html Sample Issue Copyright FINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNet January 5, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES COMING OF AGE IN PRAGUE (997 words) ANALYSTS BULLISH ON 1996 PROSPECTS (452 words) STRATTON MOVES INTO MEDIA (420 words) EBRD SELLS COKOLADOVNY STAKE (185 words) LIST OF BIDDERS FOR GSM GROWS (361 words) BANKERS TRUST BUYS INTO FUNDS (372 words) POLITICAL JITTERS FOR STOCK EXCHANGE (552 words) MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUES PLANNED (285 words) MPP GAINING MOMENTUM (403 words) BUDGET LOOKS FOR $720M OF STATE ASSET DISPOSALS (435 words) BANK GDANSKI IPO A SUCCESS (334 words) GSM AUCTION REMAINS TROUBLED (296 words) LUCCHINI IN MODERNIZATION PROJECT FOR HUTA WARSZAWA (419 words) FRENCH PURCHASER FOR TOBACCO WORKS (410 words) IMF DEAL IN SIGHT, BUDGET PASSED (391 words) MATAV RAISES A FURTHER $852M (662 words) SERVIER ACQUIRES MAJORITY OF EGIS (611 words) BRISTOL-MYERS LAUNCHES OFFER FOR PHARMAVIT (512 words) GE CAPITAL, EBRD ACQUIRE BUDAPEST BANK (566 words) POLITICAL FEARS KEEP INVESTORS AWAY DESPITE BOOMING ECONOMY (1076 words) POWER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURED (267 words) $50M AGREEMENT SIGNED (230 words) EBRD INCREASES UKRAINE FUND CAPITAL (248 words) TACIS FUNDS THREATENED (841 words) CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996COMING OF AGE IN PRAGUETHE focus of attention this year  in the Czech Republic will inevitablybe on the parliamentary elections in the summer. Politicalconsiderations have already hit an ambitious plan to sell minoritystakes in the country's 16 gas and electricity distribution companies(eight of each), which has been postponed indefinitely. In the weekbefore Christmas Roman Ceska, head of the National Property Fund, thestate holding company, said there would be no further strategicprivatizations before the election.The action, however, is likely to be elsewhere. The last quarter of1995 saw what many feel could be the start of a new trend - a series oftakeovers, some of them hostile, and large investments by foreigninvestors. Among the most notable are Bankers Trust's $250 millionpurchase of stakes in two investment funds from Ceska Sporitelna (seepage 4), and the acquisition of stakes in seven leading industrialcompanies by Stratton Investments in partnership with Viktor Kozeny'sHarvard fund management group.Michael Dingman, the Bahamas-based US millionaire who owns Stratton,has made much of the ground-breaking aspect of his investment company,with some justification. Stratton's alliance with Harvard allows apowerful and rich entrepreneur to team up with an equally powerfulentrepreneur with a good reputation for innovation but with littlefinancial firepower.Stratton's strategy appears so far to be paying off. Daniel Arbess, asenior Dingman associate, acknowledges that its original investment isgreater than the $140 million initially mentioned, and is "closer to$200 million". But he says the stakes, before recent increases in twoof them, are now worth $240 million. Stratton and Harvard have alsogained control of Sepap, the paper group, and the glass holding companySklo Union, through boardroom reshuffles.Bankers Trust's acquisition is the biggest deal yet on the Praguecapital markets. Although the opportunity was relatively rare - CeskaSporitelna was under pressure from the Czech National Bank and itsauditors to reduce the stakes it owns in the funds it runs - fundmanagers are increasingly taking the view that this type of developmentis both inevitable and desirable.As an investor, Dingman says he sees less risk in the Czech market thanin a Dow Jones index above 5,000. Whether other investors feel that waywill depend on several issues that should be clarified in 1996.The first is whether an amendment to the securities law is approved.Tomas Jezek, author of the amendment and a proposed chairman of the PSEfrom next summer, is proposing substantial reform of the market thatshould offer greater protection to small investors, establish clearrules for takeovers, and make the stock market more transparent.But Jezek's proposal is ground down in parliament, which is not likelyto debate it until February, at the earliest. It is facing oppositionfrom fund managers anxious to preserve the secrecy that currentlysurrounds share-dealing. Stratton and Harvard were able to exploit thissecrecy and lack of disclosure to the hilt in developing their allianceand short term strategy for the companies they targeted. Jezek says heis confident of having his amendment approved but does not yet knowwhen that is likely to happen.The second crucial influence will be the attitude of the bank-run andindependent investment funds to the new wave of foreign money cominginto the market. Ales Barabas, director of capital markets atZivnostenska Banka, says fund managers have no objection in principleto ceding control of their funds to new managers. But he doubts whetherthe market is mature enough to ensure that the process is orderly.He cites the example of Motoinvest, a financial conglomerate thatemerged in November when it made hostile takeovers for some bank-runfunds. Motoinvest's campaign was characterized by secrecy and elementsof greenmail, and its intentions are still not entirely clear.Executives at the financial group strongly deny greenmail charges andpoint out that the promise of more active management they offer hassimply caused larger fund managers to freeze them out.Barabas says recent developments suggest that, far from being ready forthe next phase of development as a more mature market, recentdevelopments show the PSE still in "a privatization phase", where banksare still keen to exert control of assets. There is the potential forthe so-called "third wave" of privatization, he believes, but not thewill among the main shareholders in the market.Further pressure on the shareholding structure inherited from massprivatization is likely to be exerted by a third factor that will comeinto play in 1996 - Czech membership of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development. Analysts suggest that one of the firstresults of membership will be a re-rating of the country as aninvestment location, which could spark a fresh wave of capital forlonger term investment. Both Stratton and Bankers Trust are beingtouted as examples of this development.This in turn leads to a fourth consideration - of what action the CzechNational Bank takes on the koruna's exchange rate against the dollarand deutschemark. Economists say they expect a move early in the NewYear to widen the band against which the koruna fluctuates - currentlyhalf a percentage point either side of parity - to perhaps five pointseither side. This could lead to an early but temporary revaluation, tobe followed by a more gradual move towards devaluation, perhapsencouraged by the monetary authorities ahead of the election to boostexports.The Czech market is clearly at a turning point, with pressure buildingon several fronts for more consolidation, a freer currency, and greatertransparency in its operations. Policy makers will have to play adelicate balancing act between the demands of the market on the onehand and political considerations on the other in what will be a truetest of the country's maturity as a grown-up member of the club of richnations.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996ANALYSTS BULLISH ON 1996 PROSPECTSCentral Europe watchers think the Czech economy is poised to surgeahead this year, building on the dynamic growth of 1995.Industry has boomed, pushing third quarter 1995 GDP 6.3 per cent higheryear-on-year, mostly on the back of strong home demand. Analysts areconfident of further gains in 1996. "We should see growth of 4.7 percent in the light of the [1995] third quarter results, and [in 1996] itwill probably be between 5.0 and 6.0 per cent," says Pavel Sobisek ofZivnostenska Banka. Real GDP for the first nine months of 1995 stood at4.8 per cent, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU).Scott Riedel, treasurer of Citibank in Prague, also expects strong 1996growth but says the country is far from emulating levels seen in theAsian Tiger economies. "We're looking at around the five per cent levelof 1996 and that's probably conservative. But this economy is quiteyoung still, and it's a long way behind Far East countries likeMalaysia in terms of sustainable high growth," says Riedel.While the Czech Republic stands at the higher end of the East Europeangrowth table, it has yet to attract the sort of huge foreign investmentthat sparked rapid growth in Southeast Asia. To close the gap with therich Western economies more rapidly - something that many in Easternand Central Europe see as a primary goal - investment must accelerate,analysts say. "It is necessary, but I'm just wondering whether we'llsee sustainable increases," says Riedel. The Asian tigers continue todevour much of the foreign direct investment (FDI) earmarked foremerging markets.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus hopes the feel-good factor arising from thebooming economy will win his centre-right coalition government anotherterm in office in this summer's elections. The Czech reform process hasbeen considerably more stable than in other former Soviet bloccountries, with year-on-year inflation at eight per cent in Novemberand unemployment standing at 2.8 per cent. But official figurescompiled by the EBRD in its transition report for 1995 showed sharpfalls in real GDP in the first years of reform.The EBRD recorded a 14.2 per cent drop in real GDP in 1991 followed byfurther, but less spectacular, declines in the next two years, beforean upturn in 1994 when growth hit 2.6 per cent. Even with EBRD-projected growth of five per cent in 1995, the organization put 1995real Czech GDP at just 85 per cent of the level before the fall ofcommunism in 1989. It warned, however, that such comparisons should betreated with caution because of conceptual and data collection problemswhen comparing market and planned economies.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996STRATTON MOVES INTO MEDIAStratton Investments, owned by the Bahamas-based investor MichaelDingman, has made a further push into the Czech market with anagreement in principle to buy a 15 per cent stake in Premiera TV, acommercial television station.Stratton said on December 6 it would buy the stake from Investicni aPostovni Banka (IPB), one of the main commercial banks. If the purchaseis approved by the state broadcasting council IPB's stake in Premierawill fall to 30 per cent. The bank has been seeking a buyer for thestake for several months."The deal launches Stratton's investment in the media industry inCentral Europe and CIS countries. We look forward to working togetherwith IPB on this and hopefully other investments in the future,"Stratton said. Terms were not disclosed.It is also a departure for Dingman, who stormed into the market inOctober, buying stakes in seven industrial companies from ViktorKozeny's Harvard fund management group. Premiera is the firstacquisition from a local investor other than Harvard.Stratton said it was ready to provide Premiera access to "all world-wide programming resources" and with "foreign experts with a high levelof broadcasting knowledge." Premiera currently reaches less than halfthe nationwide audience and is seeking to expand in the teeth of fiercecompetition from Nova TV.Nova, majority-owned by Central European Media Enterprises, which is inturn controlled by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, became easternEurope's first commercial TV station in early 1993. It has captured ahuge slice of the local advertising market with a successful mix ofimported mass-market series.Earlier this year IPB was reportedly in talks with companies connectedto Turner Broadcasting and Capital Cities/ABC, the US media giants.Scandinavian Broadcasting System, which is partially owned by CapCities, has also been mooted as a buyer.Separately, Stratton bought additional stakes in two of its originalseven investments from the fund management arm of Ceska Sporitelna, thesavings bank. These transactions took its stakes in PrazskaTelparenska, the heating utility for Prague, and in glass industryholding company Sklo Union to 43 per cent and 66.5 per centrespectively. The stakes are held jointly by Stratton and Harvard.Stratton and Harvard have also taken control of the entire managementboard of Sklo Union, appointing seven representatives of Harvard at ashareholder meeting on December 5. The move is similar to the takeoverof the board of Sepap, the paper group now controlled by bothinvestment companies.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996EBRD SELLS COKOLADOVNY STAKEThe EBRD has sold its 12.07 per cent stake in the confectionery companyCokoladovny to Copart, a joint venture between Nestle of Switzerlandand Danone of France that already owns 56 per cent of the chocolate andbiscuit maker.Terms were not disclosed but the EBRD said in a statement on December 6that the sale and price of the shares to Copart was agreed at the timeof the privatization of Cokoladovny in 1992, when the EBRD firstacquired its stake. The stake has a market value currently of about $35million.Guy de Selliers, deputy vice president of banking at the EBRD, said inthe statement that the Cokoladovny stake represented the bank's mostmature investment in the country, and was also its first divestment.Describing Cokoladovny as a successfully transformed company able tocompete and succeed in its markets, de Selliers said the sale was "anatural departure for the EBRD." The bank expects the proceeds of thesale to be used for other investment purposes in the Czech Republic asits focus shifts to investing in post-privatization industry.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996LIST OF BIDDERS FOR GSM GROWSTeleDanmark and Telenor, of Denmark and Norway respectively, are tomake a joint bid for a 49 per cent stake in a GSM mobile telephonelicence, one of two being awarded by the government. The companies saidon December 20 that they would be "equal partners" in their jointventure but that TeleDanmark would have a majority stake to abide byrules of a tender for the stake.Separately, the electricity generator CEZ said it would be making ajoint bid for the licence stake with RWE Telliance of Germany. A thirdpartner may join that consortium, but TeleDanmark and Telenor said theywould not be seeking a local partner.The two alliances join a growing list of domestic and internationalbidders seeking to win the stake in the licence. The domestictechnology group Ceske Radiokomunikace, which operates television andradio signal transmission in the country, will own 51 per cent of thelicence.The licence will cost about $15 million but developing a nationwide GSMnetwork is set to cost "several hundred million dollars," said HaraldGrytten of Telenor, the dominant Norwegian telecoms provider. Industryanalysts have put the cost of a new network at between $300 million and$500 million. Most of the finance to develop it will be provided by theselected partner.A second GSM licence is being awarded to EuroTel, a joint venturebetween the national operator SPT Telecom and the US groups BellAtlantic and US West. EuroTel was the first Czech/foreign joint venturecreated after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and has been providingmobile services since 1990 using low-frequency NMT technologythroughout former Czechoslovakia.Other groups and consortiums bidding for the stake in the licenceinclude AirTouch of the US, France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom,Mannesmann of Germany in partnership with the engineering group SkodaPlzen, and a consortium of domestic energy distribution companies in aprobable alliance with Telecom Finland.Bids for the stake, setting out development plans and a timetable forcreating the GSM network, are expected to be sought by the end ofJanuary.

It will pay forthe stakes by issuing five-year zero-coupon notes to the savings bank.During the life of the notes Sporitelna will retain all dividends onthe shares and retain the voting rights on three quarters of eachstake.Bankers Trust will repay the notes in cash or shares or a combinationof both, depending on whether it has been able to sell the shares inthe funds on to new investors. If it retains any shares in the fundsafter five years these shares will be returned to Sporitelna to pay offthe notes.Sporitelna has been under pressure from its auditors and the CzechNational Bank for some time to reduce the stakes it holds in its owninvestment funds.  Under current legislation a bank cannot own morethan 10 per cent of any non-banking asset, including investment funds.The bank acquired the shares when thousands of its clients defaulted onloans it issued using individual shareholdings in its funds ascollateral following a slide on the Prague stock exchange during 1994.Bankers Trust has been developing a relationship with Sporitelna forseveral years and is understood to be planning an issue of globaldepository shares for the savings bank as part of a long-term strategy.But Sporitelna is regarded as the weakest of the big four Czech banksbecause of its failure to diversify sufficiently away from its coresavings business.Sporitelna is the biggest lender on the Prague interbank market and hasbeen hit hard by the instability of some of the country's smallerbanks. It has been exposed to two recent collapses; those of AB Banka -which it subsequently acquired - and Ceska Banka, which is inliquidation after collapsing in the autumn. The disposal of the stakesin its investment funds should enable it to strengthen its balancesheet.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996POLITICAL JITTERS FOR STOCK EXCHANGERecent political events have taken their toll on the Warsaw StockExchange. Its main WIG indicator has slipped by 7 per cent since thelast session on November 17, when investors were still confident thatLech Walesa would win the presidential election.The news that former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski had won by anarrow majority took 3.8 per cent off the WIG and the market's slowrecovery in the weeks following was ended by another 3.5 per cent fallon December 20 in the wake of a public accusation that prime ministerJozef Oleksy was a Russian agent.The setback, against the background of low morale on the stock exchangedating back to before the summer, has caused companies hoping to profitfrom stock exchange listings to have second thoughts. Examples includeForte, a Polish-German furniture producer, which delayed its initialpublic offer sine die, and chemicals producer  Boryszew, due to openits IPO of 600,000 shares priced at Zl 15 at the end of November, butwhich has now postponed it until January 10.January will also see the public offer of 3 million shares in the OceanCompany, a fledgling retail chain, and Lodzka Drukarnia Akcydensowa,which specializes in printing for packaging, will be offering between625,000 and 1.7 million shares priced at Zl 5. The issue by thecompany, which has been owned by its management and employees since1991, has been underwritten by Polish Development Bank (PBR) and theLodz-based Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy (PBG), which have agreed to take300,000 shares for a 5 per cent fee.Polisa, the private insurance company which came to prominence duringthe presidential campaign when it transpired that the wives of bothKwasniewski and Oleksy hold its shares (see FEE 5:23) has seen theplacement of 1.2 million of its shares in a public offer of between800,000 and 3.2 million shares priced at Zl 8. Reportedly thepurchasers of around 60 per cent of the shares placed were Bel Leasingand Forin, two companies controlled by Bank IG, which seems to beplanning to add an insurance arm to its group.In another development Bank Handlowy has taken a 13.1 per cent stake inthe Wolczanka shirt producer. The stake comes from the bankrupt BankPrzemyslowo Handlowy (BHK) in Katowice, which is currently being woundup. The securities commission has given Heineken permission to purchaseBHK's stake in the Zywiec brewery, increasing its stake from itspresent 24.9 per cent to 31.8 per cent. The Zywiec stock price hasfallen by 10 per cent recently in the wake of an announcement by AdamLoewe, the brewery's chief executive, that he would be resigning in thenew year.Bank Handlowy's move in taking a larger stake in Wolczanka reflectspart of a wider strategy towards the textile sector. Recently the BHannounced that it would be part of a consortium including Wolczanka,Prochnik and Vistula which aims to bid for the DT Centrum chain of citycentre department stores which are to be privatized this year.

Thecoupons, priced at Zl 20, are currently trading at between Zl 50 and Zl60 and have even been reported as being accepted as common currency(notoriously in one example by a "social agency", a local euphemism fora brothel).The allocations of the equity in the new companies brings the numbernow involved up to 513 and the new tranche include valuable assets suchas the Nowiny cement works, the Gryf confectionery producer as well asthe successful Morliny meat processing works in Ostroda near Olsztyn.Meanwhile the Solidarity-led opposition is keeping up a drum beat ofcriticism of the scheme ahead of a referendum planned for February 19.Poles are to be asked whether they are in favour of "enfranchisement",Solidarity's word for Czech-style coupon privatization which the tradeunion movement argues spread ownership more democratically than themodes favoured by successive governments in Poland. Critics say Polishprivatization has so far supported efforts by the former Communistnomenklatura in gaining control over the economy. This argument has nowgained some credibility after President Walesa's electoral defeat.Deputies from the governing Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) have howevervoted through parliament a number of additional questions to be askedin the referendum. These include a query on the extension of the MPP byadding more companies (the SLD's coalition partner the Polish PeasantParty (PSL) was opposed on the grounds that the scheme should be giventime to prove itself before it is expanded). Other new questions dwellon whether state assets now worth an estimated Zl 75 billion should beused to capitalize pension funds envisaged under welfare spendingreforms as well as to compensate government employees and pensionerswho suffered unlawful wage cuts at the hands of the administration in1991 and 1992. Finally the opposition Freedom Union (UW) managed toforce through an amendment which specified that privatization couldinclude "coupons", which helped to define the enfranchisement questionoriginally put forward by Solidarity and backed by Lech Walesa.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BUDGET LOOKS FOR $720M OF STATE ASSET DISPOSALSDisposals of state-owned corporate assets in 1996 are expected to raiseZl 1.8 billion ($720 million) according to the draft budget for theyear. This is slightly more than the Zl 1.7 billion raised last yearfrom sales of treasury-owned companies or 13 per cent more than thefigure written into the 1995 budget target.At the same time the government intends to continue to squeezeprivatization advisory costs which ran to 5 per cent of revenues lastyear down to 4 per cent of this year's inflows. This suggests that theprivatization ministry will continue to favour local companies intenders for advisory work.However it can be expected that the sale of a minority stake in thegiant copper producer KGHM Polska Miedz SA will see the appointment ofa foreign adviser. A tender has been announced and bids have to be inby January 23 for what could be the largest sale of the year throughboth GDRs and the Warsaw Stock Exchange.Other major sales will be DT Centrum, the state-owned chain ofdepartment stores which controls a series of city centre sites in thecountry's largest towns and Ruch, once the all powerful newspaperdistribution network. PHS, which is what remains of the state'swholesale network is to be another "infrastructural" sale in 1996.In all privatization minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek hopes to dispose ofaround 90 companies to local and foreign investors. These will includebreweries in Tychy and Zabrze in southern Poland and Lezajsk in thesouth east. A start is also to be made on the heavy chemical sector,with three bidders shortlisted for two chemical producers,  Janikosodyand Soda Matwy. These are RhOne Poulenc, Brunner Mond and state-ownedchemicals and pharmaceuticals trader Ciech. Other sectors which willsee disposals according to Kaczmarek are cement, furniture and meatprocessing.The minister has also outlined a number of possible public offers whichcould include the Celuloza paper works in Swiecie, three fertilizerproducers in Pulawy, Tarnow and Kedzierzyn Kozle. Also included areZelmer, a white goods producer in Rzeszow and Polar, which specializesin washing machines and cookers in Wroclaw.The list could be supplemented by any one of the three tobaccoproducers in Krakow, Poznan or Lodz which the ministry still has onoffer after receiving unsatisfactory bids from investors who includePhilip Morris and Reemstma.Impexmetal, the still state-owned metals trader which has purchased theKonin aluminium mill and has plans to swap its debts for equity in theZawiercie steel mill, is also expected to be listed this year.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BANK GDANSKI IPO A SUCCESSBank Gdanski's privatization, which saw the first use in Poland ofGDRs, drew to a successful conclusion just before Christmas with 60.06per cent of the equity in private hands and a slight upward trend onthe Warsaw Stock Exchange following the bank's listing at its initialpublic offer price of Zl 24.However the sale was only saved thanks to Bank IG, which took two-thirds of the domestic tranche and ended up with a 24.07 per cent shareof Gdanski's equity. It was the first time that one of the new smallbanks has forged a strategic link with one of the, larger, regionalbanks hived off from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in 1989.Hitherto private sector banks have concentrated on buying up smallerinstitutions to extend their branch network.Bank IG's move, initiated by its founder and chairman Boguslaw Kott, a46 year-old former finance ministry official, meant that 527,518 shareswere moved from the foreign to the domestic tranche leaving 7 millionshares or 35.7 per cent of Bank Gdanski's equity in local handsalongside the treasury's 37 per cent stake.The reduction in the foreign tranche which HSBC Investment Services,the government's adviser for the sale, had originally set at between5.9 million to 6.5 million shares (30 per cent to 33 per cent of theequity) still saw foreign demand for the BG shares falling short ofsupply. In the end HSBC and Daiwa Europe, who acted as joint leadmanagers, and were backed by Schroders and Creditanstalt actingtogether with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, SBC Warburg and MC Securities,guaranteed a mere 4.8 million shares, which ended up with Bank of NewYork as the security for the GDRs.The underwriters took a 4 per cent fee for the service and havereportedly placed the stock with institutions in Europe and NorthAmerica.

Themost domestic-ally oriented consortium seems to be the third, led bythe Petrochemia Plock oil refinery and includes KGHM, the domesticcopper conglomerate, PSE, the Polish Power Grid Company, and TeleDanmark. Foreign partners are limited by the terms of the tender to nomore than 49 per cent of the equity in each group.But problems and recriminations remain. France Telecom Mobile lookslikely to take the government to court, joining Ameritech, which hasalready gone to arbitration to wrest one of the licences from theauthorities. Both companies are basing their claim on a letter writtenby the government in 1991, when they won a tender to develop an NMTmobile telephone system, promising them the GSM licence when therequisite frequencies became available.Under the conditions of the tender winning consortia will have to payan initial ECU 100 million licence fee augmented by annual payments fora set period thereafter. The total investment costs of each project areestimated at $1.2 billion. One factor which is worrying prospectivebidders is that the tender documents do not specify the size of theinterconnect fee the mobile operator will have to pay TP SA, the state-owned land system operator, for connections with land-basedsubscribers. This, according to the tender, will be negotiated with TPSA once the winners of the bid have been chosen.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996LUCCHINI IN MODERNIZATION PROJECT FOR HUTA WARSZAWALucchini, the Italian private steel maker, which took over the HutaWarszawa steelworks in Warsaw three years ago, has embarked on a three-stage ECU 161.1 million modernization project for the works.Lucchini's modernization project, which is financed by the IFC, theEBRD and a consortium of Italian banks, has been delayed by problemswith establishing the tenure of the land on which the Huta Warszawa islocated. However the group expects to report an around Zl 20 millionnet profit for the plant for 1995 following a Zl 1.5 million net profitin 1994 and a Zl 2.7 million loss the year before. The ECU 65.2 millionfirst stage will see the steel mill refurbished using equipment fromDanieli of Italy.In all the modernization programme which will be completed in theautumn of 1998 will increase the plant's capacity to 1 million tonnesof steel a year. Last year Huta Lucchini Warszawa produced 380,000tonnes of steel products and this will rise to 400,000 tonnes thisyear.Meanwhile Stalexport, the listed steel trader, which was forced lastOctober to withdraw a new share issue which would have raised betweenZl 30 million and Zl 150 million, has completed the construction of aZl 155 million modern mini mill at its Labedy works in Silesia. Thiswill give the mill $30 per tonne savings in energy costs on an annualoutput of 350,000 tonnes of semi finished castings. Labedy, whichStalexport plans to take over when the steel sector is privatized,specializes in supplies for the Polish coal mining industry.The equipment for the mini mill was supplied by Mannesman-Demag as wellas Concast Standard from Switzerland and was 28 per cent paid for withsupplier credits as well as a loan amounting to 40 per cent of the costfrom Poland's Environmental Protection Fund (NFOS). The remaining 32per cent came from Stalexport and the Labedy works.Stalexport's prospects for a return to its planned new share issueremain dim. Major existing shareholders like Bank Handlowy and thePioneer investment fund who paid Zl 34 per share at the initial publicoffer are insisting that any new issues should be priced at around thislevel. Meanwhile the company's current share price is languishingaround the Zl 24 per share mark and shows little sign of rising in thenear term.

The sale follows the purchase of theAugustow works by BAT Industries and leaves the government with afurther three companies in Krakow, Lodz and Poznan still on offer.Seita has agreed to pay $64 million for a 33 per cent stake in Radomwith the option to purchase a further 32 per cent of the equity for anominal fee after completing a $40 million investment programme overthree years. Earlier BAT agreed to pay $88 million for a similar stakein Augustow, which controls 12 per cent of the market and promised toinvest $70 million in the plant.Market shares however are changing following a pre-privatizationgovernment decision to have the country's cheaper brands, which wereonce made throughout the industry, located in Radom and Krakow. Plantsin Krakow, Poznan and Lodz are the other three producers currently onoffer.This decision means that Radom's market share will rise to around 24per cent, according to a text in the Rzeczpospolita newspaper writtenby the head of Burston Marsteller, a PR company retained by PhilipMorris which is bidding for Krakow. Krakow will also see its preallocation share of 35 per cent rise slightly although its expected netprofit of $26 million for 1995 is expected to fall to $24 million as aresult of the decision. The greatest loser, however, is Poznan whose28.5 per cent market share will be hit and whose pre-allocation netprofit of $9.2 million will fall to around $6.4 million. Reemstma ofGermany is thought to be interested in taking Poznan over.So far the government has judged offers for the three remaining plantsfrom bidders such as Philip Morris and Reemstma to be inadequate.However the Burston Marsteller text would suggest that Philip Morrisvalues the Krakow works at between $286 million and $327 million andthus would be willing to pay around $200 million for a 65 per centstake. The same text, written before the Radom deal was struck withSeita, valued the Radom works at between $83 million and $78 millionwhile the price Seita paid valued the works at $98 million. Thissuggests that the government will try to hold out to get PM to improveits offer by around 10 to 15 per cent.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996IMF DEAL IN SIGHT, BUDGET PASSEDHungary reached the basis of an IMF agreement on a much-delayed 18-month stand-by loan at the end of a mission in mid-December.However - much to the anger of the trade unions and social securityofficials - the agreement is conditional on parliament's passingsatisfactory budgets for the two state social security funds whichhandle health and pensions payments. Parliament is not expected to passthe budgets of the semi-independent funds before late February.The unions and fund administrators say they are being blackmailed intoagreeing with finance ministry suggestions for the 1996 fund budgets asotherwise they will be blamed for scuppering the IMF deal. Economistssay the IMF's condition should at least encourage an early solution towhat has been a highly contentious issue. The funds and the financeministry have been locked in discussions over spending plans for 1996for some time.Leslie Lipsitz, head of the mission, said the government and IMF hadagreed on the key economic targets until end-1997 and that he was veryhopeful an agreement could be reached and approved early next year. Hesaid another mission would not be necessary and that the loan could goto board approval within a couple of weeks of parliament passing thesocial security budgets.Ever since a Socialist-led coalition took office in July 1994, Hungaryhas been keen to secure an IMF stand-by to boost its standing oninternational markets and with foreign investors. Central banksofficials have said that Hungary, which recently repaid some of itsearlier IMF loans ahead of schedule, may not even draw on the presentplanned stand-by likely to be worth $300 million.Lipsitz said Hungary aimed to bring down inflation to 20 per cent bythe end of 1996 and to 15 per cent by late 1997. GDP is forecasted torise by 2-3 per cent this year and by more than 3 per cent from 1997onwards, up from an estimated 2 per cent in 1995. The budget deficitfor this year is put at 4 per cent and is due to fall to 3 per centnext year.

Matav becomes thefirst national telecoms operator in the region to pass to majorityforeign ownership.In late December, Magyarcom, the consortium formed by the two companiestwo years ago, agreed to pay $852 million for a further 37 per cent ofMatav, bringing their total stake to around 67 per cent. The sale,together with the US-German consortium's purchase of a 30.3 per centstake for $875 million in December 1993, is the region's largestprivatization to date and the largest foreign investment in Hungary.However, the deal - the culmination of a spate of year-end sales by APVRt, the state privatization agency - nearly fell through at the lastminute. Ron Sommer, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's management board,and Walter Catlow, Ameritech vice-president, flew into Budapest to signthe purchase contract only to run into an eleventh-hour hitch requiringfurther negotiations. The deal was finally clinched after delays ofseveral hours.Sources said the Hungarian side failed to include all the consortium'scontractual rights in the purchase document and also sought guaranteesthat Magyarcom would not exit its investment within a fixed period oftime.APV Rt said the consortium, in which Ameritech and Deutsche Telekomhave equal shares, had undertaken to float the company and reduce itsstake from 67 per cent to 50 per cent plus one vote by the end of thecentury.The state is due to retain a 25 per cent plus one stake in Matav, oneof Hungary's leading blue chip companies, while management andemployees are to be offered up to 2.7 per cent. Hungary was advised onthe sale by CS First Boston.In the summer, when Hungary appointed CSFB as adviser, most analystsdoubted Hungary would sell a majority stake to Magyarcom. Stateofficials also indicated they would prefer to bring in institutionalinvestors and float the company in line with a government policy toboost the Budapest Stock Exchange through privatization when possible.But the consortium consistently argued against an early public offer onthe grounds that the company would fetch more once it had completed athree-year Ft 210 billion ($1.5 billion) investment and restructuringplan begun last year. An offer at a lower price than the consortiumpaid would also have forced Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom to writedown their investments at a loss.Magyarcom also wished to have full control of the company. Although itgained significant management control in 1993, including a power ofveto over some decisions, it frequently had to spend much timenegotiating issues with its Hungarian partners. It took several months,for example, for the two sides to agree on a new managing director inearly 1995.At the signing ceremony, Sommer said the consortium was committed todeveloping further Hungary's telecoms infrastructure and to makingMatav, the region's leading telecoms company. As part of its successfulbid in 1993, the consortium agreed to make Matav an internationaltelecoms hub and to increase the number of telephone lines by 15.5 percent annually - a target it exceeded by some eight percentage points in1995.Matav has a monopoly on national long-distance and international callsuntil 2001 and will also be the exclusive operator in 39 out of 54local network regions during this time. In addition, it has majoritystakes in two out of three local mobile telephone companies.Catlow said the company had decided to increase its stake in Matav asthe Hungarian telecoms sector was the most attractive for investment inthe region. Ameritech is in dispute with the Polish government which italleges has reneged on a promise to grant it a digital mobile telephonelicence.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996SERVIER ACQUIRES MAJORITY OF EGISServier, the privately-held French pharmaceuticals company, formed astrategic alliance with and acquired a 51 per cent stake in Egis, oneof Hungary's leading pharmaceuticals producers, in late December.Servier, France's third largest pharmaceutical supplier, acquired 30per cent of the company from the EBRD and the balance from NatWestSecurities.The purchase price was not disclosed. However, the company's marketcapitalization at the end of trading on December 15, the last daybefore the purchase, was $184 million. Peter Reiniger, joint head ofthe EBRD's Hungary team, told FEE  that the bank, which paid $45million for its stake in late 1993, had made a profit on thetransaction. He said the value of the deal reflected the company'sshare price as well as a premium for the purchase of a controllingstake.Egis, Hungary's second largest pharmaceutical company after RichterGedeon, was the leader on the local market in 1994 with a 13 per centmarket share. Exports accounted for 44 per cent of total sales. Thecompany, which went public in June 1994, made a profit of Ft3.8 billion($31 million) on turnover of Ft14.4 billion in the first nine months of1995.Last summer the state's remaining 28 per cent stake in Egis was sold toNatWest Securities at a price of Ft2,550 a share, compared to Ft3,275in December, making the company the first of the country's largepharmaceutical companies to become 100 per cent private.The sale to NatWest, however, caused considerable controversy after itemerged that the EBRD had urged the government to sell its shares toNatWest - whose corporate finance division had been appointed to adviseon the sale - rather than to rivals including CS First Boston.Brokers say the sale to NatWest without a proper tender for the shareswas in contravention of Hungary's new privatization law, passed lastMay. However, the EBRD insisted on the sale to a "friendly party" onthe grounds that its 30 per cent stake would be worth less unless soldin tandem with the government's remaining stake. EBRD officials toldFEE they had initially urged the government to sell its stake lateronce a strategic partner had been found but that APV, anxious to raiseprivatization revenues, had insisted on divesting its stake in thesummer. Only then had the EBRD stepped in and ensured the two stakescould still be sold together.The sale is one of only two "exits" made by the EBRD - earlier inDecember it sold on its stake in a Czech chocolate maker. Officialssaid the two sales reflected the growing maturity and stability inHungary and the Czech Republic and were also textbook examples of therole the bank was set up to play. In both cases the bank got involvedin the companies' privatizations, acting as a "bridge" between thestate and private buyers.Analysts said the sale also reflected Hungary's leading role in theregional pharmaceuticals industry. The deal came only days after thelaunch of a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a medium-sized privatedrugs producer (see following article), and just weeks after the saleof 78 per cent of Biogal, another former state-owned pharmaceuticalcompany, to Teva of Israel for $26 million (FEE 5:22). Sanofi of Franceowns a majority stake in Chinoin while Richter Gedeon has been floated(FEE 5:22) and is now majority-owned by institutional and localinvestors.The Egis acquisition is Servier's first in central and eastern Europe.Servier officials said they had negotiated the purchase in just sixweeks and had not yet decided whether they would increase their stakefurther.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996BRISTOL-MYERS LAUNCHES OFFER FOR PHARMAVITBristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), the US pharmaceuticals giant, has launcheda $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a rapidly expanding localpharmaceutical company, set up in 1988. The offer, which is for 100 percent of the company, is Hungary's first public takeover of a companylisted on the Budapest Stock Exchange and one of the first suchtakeovers in the region.BMS said it had already reached agreement to buy 77 per cent of thecompany from its majority owners Dr Imre Somody, Pharmavit chiefexecutive and founder, and Genericon Pharma, an Austrianpharmaceuticals company. Its offer to both majority and minorityshareholders is to be at the same price even though Hungary has fewregulations governing takeovers and ensuring minority shareholderprotection.BMS has offered $62.35 per share or $12.47 per global depository share,each representing one fifth of a share - a significant premium over thecompany's stock market price. GDSs were trading at $7.25 in the LondonOTC market the day before the offer was announced in December, downfrom an offer price of $57.5 when the company went public in June 1994.BMS said its offer which closes on January 26 was conditional on itgaining 90 per cent of Pharmavit and that it intended to withdraw thecompany from the BSE. The vast majority of the 23 per cent stake notowned by the majority shareholders is held by foreign institutionalinvestors.BMS is being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK investment bank,together with Creditanstalt Securities Budapest - the same team whichthis year advised on the flotation of OTP, the national savings bank,and on the placement of a further tranche of Richter Gedeon, Hungary'slargest pharmaceuticals company.Pharmavit made pre-tax profit of Ft632 million ($5.7 million) onturnover of Ft4.1 billion in 1994, up from Ft533 million on turnover ofFt2.4 billion in 1993. It is Hungary's leading producer of vitaminpills - mainly through its Plussz effervescent tables. Most of itssales are in Hungary but the company also has sales subsidiaries in theCzech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.The company is one of a growing breed of eastern European companies,set up at the beginning of market-led changes, which are nowsufficiently mature to attract the interest of a multinational company.Since 1990 the company has also produced generic drugs and over-the-counter medicines. Its main pharmaceutical product is Diclofenac, ananti-inflammatory drug developed by Ciba-Geigy.Before setting up Pharmavit, Somody, 37, was a director at Chinoin, thelocal drugs company now owned by Sanofi of France. He will stay on ashead of BSM in Hungary - although Pharmavit is to retain itsindependence. BSM intends to use Pharmavit, its first acquisition inthe central and eastern Europe, to expand further in the region.Somody recommended that minority shareholders accept the offer.

The deadline wasset in late 1994 when the government agreed to transfer Ft12 billion instate securities to the bank - to make it more attractive ahead ofprivatization - on condition it was sold by December 15 1995. In theend, the deadline had to be extended for two weeks while the deal wasfinalized. Senior GE and EBRD officials, including ChristopherMacKenzie, GE Capital's chief executive in Europe, flew into Budapestwith the expectations that a deal would be signed by the 15th only toleave empty-handed. A technical hitch appeared which could only beresolved by finance minister Lajos Bokros, who was away at the time. Itappears that liability for at least one court case involving BudapestBank had not been fully resolved in the sales contract, causing a three-day delay in the signing.Under the terms of the agreement, GE Capital, which will take a 27.5per cent stake, will assume operational control of the bank. Togetherwith the EBRD, which has a 32.5 per cent, GE has an option to increaseits stake by 22 per cent within five and a half years. Until the salethe state held an 82.6 per cent stake in the bank.Hungary was advised on the sale jointly by Salomon Brothers and LehmanBrothers. Salomon initially won the adviser's contract but was obligedto share it with Lehman after much of its banking team left to joinLehman.The sale is a significant boost to government efforts to sell off statebanks, many of which have borne the brunt of the country's difficultpost-communist transition and have proved hard to privatize. The dealis only Hungary's second sale of a large commercial bank to a Westernstrategic partner. It follows the sale of a 25 per cent plus one votestake in Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank, the foreign trade bank, toBayerische Landesbank in mid-1994.GE Capital, which is expanding aggressively into Europe through astring of recent acquisitions, entered the bidding for Budapest Bank,Hungary's fifth largest commercial bank, relatively late. It was notone of the three companies which tendered for the bank in late 1994.Then, Credit Suisse was named preferred bidder ahead of ING and AlliedIrish, only to withdraw abruptly in March after conducting duediligence.GE Capital and the EBRD signed a letter of intent to purchase the bankin October and subsequently conducted due diligence. The buyers areunderstood to have initially offered around $100 million but scaledback their offer to $87 million after due diligence. Like other banks,Budapest Bank has suffered from bad loans and in the middle of lastyear had to make 15 per cent risk provisions. The bank has assets ofaround Ft215 billion and 74 branches.GE Capital, whose parent company is one of the biggest investors inHungary, said it would bring in new financial products and moderntechnology. It is expected to keep on Bela Singlovics, the bank's chiefexecutive.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996POLITICAL FEARS KEEP INVESTORS AWAY DESPITE BOOMING ECONOMYFor 1995, Slovakia should achieve the second-highest growth rate amongeast Europe's emerging markets behind Albania, with gross domesticproduct rising by 6 per cent. Economists expect a similar growth ratein 1996 as key industries such as chemicals and steel continue tobenefit from booming export markets and as domestic demand grows.Whether this rosy scenario leads to a reassessment of the country bydomestic and foreign investors will depend crucially on whether theprime minister, Vladimir Meciar, is prepared to settle his damagingconstitutional row with President Michal Kovac. It is this powerstruggle more than anything that has caused Slovakia to lag behind itspeers in the Visegrad group of countries - the Czech Republic, Hungaryand Poland - in the eyes of foreign observers, to the detriment of itsreputation abroad.There appears to be little likelihood of an early reconciliation, anddiplomats in Bratislava say they can see no way out of the deadlock."Meciar must make the first move, and he does not appear willing to doso," one diplomat said before Christmas. Until he does, the diplomatadds, Slovakia will remain in limbo.So far, however, the political row has not had an adverse impact on theeconomy. Indeed, there is much progress on all fronts, includingprivatization, which has speeded up considerably since the governmentabandoned coupon sell-offs early in 1995 and replaced them with an adhoc series of sales to a narrow group of owner/managers. The keyquestion in 1996, as privatization reaches a climax, is: What next?There were good reasons for abandoning coupon privatization. It is slowand can be an administrative nightmare. It results in widely dispersedownership and to be truly successful it requires the immediateimplementation of rules to protect small investors (which are not yetforthcoming in, for example, the Czech Republic).On the other hand, it has a measure of transparency and fairness inthat all adult citizens can participate, making it politically popular.The government's main argument for abandoning the coupon plan was thatdispersed shareholdings meant there was no clearly identified owner.There was also the unstated fear among the nationalists that the backdoor would be opened to foreign investors to pick up assets on thecheap.Critics argued that these were excuses for abandoning privatizationaltogether. In fact, the reverse has happened. The adoption of"standard methods" of privatization has quickened the paceconsiderably, with hundreds of sell-offs in the second half of thisyear with an estimated book value of $1 billion.  These range fromsmall factories to a big chunk of the Slovnaft petrochemical group .The speed of the sell-offs is admirable. About 65 per cent of grossdomestic product is now generated by the private sector, according toofficial estimates. The vast majority of these sales have been made toexecutives and workers at the enterprises involved.Meciar defends the methods used to reduce state ownership: "Variouslobbies say our methods are undemocratic. We think they are necessaryand inevitable," he says.Yet there are clear signs of a wider agenda in the current bout ofprivatization fever. Assets are often sold at knock-down prices andbuyers have 10 years to pay for them. If the enterprise is deemedimportant enough, a controversial and ambiguous law on strategicenterprises enables the state to retain a golden share that allows itto wield influence long after the stake has been sold.Most contentiously, critics say assets are sold only to those deemedloyal to Meciar's all-embracing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.Eugen Jurzyca of the Centre for Economic Development, a think tank,doubts the wisdom of what he terms "family circle privatization".Selling companies on the cheap throws away money that could be used forsocial spending and the relief of bad debts. It also promotesinequality by concentrating potentially valuable assets among a narrowgroup who can then sell them on at great profit to themselves.There is also growing concern about how these assets are being paidfor, in a country chronically short of capital. Those managers who buythe stakes will owe substantial sums to the state holding company, theNational Property Fund (NPF), over the 10-year period of the payment.The fear is that company cash flow will be diverted in the form ofdividends to owners to make those payments.Few Slovak companies have the cash flow to afford this. "The company ispaying for its own acquisition in the end," notes Jean-Christophe Ganz,manager of ING Bank in Bratislava.Economists play down the political dimension of privatization. For theNational Bank of Slovakia the important thing is that it is continuing,says Elena Kohutikova, head of the independent central bank's monetarypolicy unit. "It is difficult to decide which privatization policy isthe best one," she says.So far the government's policy has not had an adverse impact oninflation, but nor has it enabled substantial inflows of fresh capitaland know-how. This raises two further questions. The first is how thecost of the bond issue will be met.Each coupon holder is to receive a nominal Sk 10,000 ($345) bond backedby the assets of the NPF. The bonds can be used for things like payingfor an apartment or contributing to a private pension scheme, requiringearly redemption, and they are also likely to be transferable.The bonds are due to mature in 2001, requiring the NPF to have up to Sk35 billion ($1.2 billion) available to pay out. Meantime there isannual interest based on the discount rate (currently 9.75 per cent).Although not all holders are expected to retain the bonds to maturity,economists warn that the potential cost of the scheme could be as highas Sk 50 billion ($1.7 billion). This is a giant mortgage on the NPFthat it must be able to discharge.The second question is how industry will be restructured. Key companieslike Slovnaft and the big VSZ steel plant have largely modernized andare helping to fuel economic growth. Many others await the kiss oflife.Foreign investment is one obvious solution, and some observers expect apush to attract it in 1996. This would be a volte face for thegovernment, but one that Meciar may be pragmatic enough to pull off.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996POWER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTUREDThe EBRD is backing Ukraine's power sector with a loan of $61.9 millionto support the restructuring of the country's power sector. Followingan EU and UK Know-How-Fund commissioned study on Ukraine's powerindustry, the government is set to re-organize the thermal powersector, to include the creation of thermal generating companies,broadly following the pattern established during the privatization ofBritain's power industry.The loan will go to the country's four newly created thermal generatingcompanies to finance repair and maintenance at the largest thermalpower plants in order to improve the reliability of power generation.The loan will also pay for more accurate meters, investments requiredto start a wholesale electricity market, which is to be set up soon.Funds will also pay for managerial assistance to provide modernaccountancy measures and financial management techniques.The loan was signed during President Leonid Kuchma's official visit toLondon in December, when the EBRD signed a total of $75 million infunding to Ukrainian enterprises. In view of the continued operation ofthe Chernobyl nuclear power station, which Western experts unanimouslywant closed down, it is a top priority to help provide a more reliablepower industry to replace the Chernobyl plant."Perhaps the most urgent issue for Ukraine today concerns the country'senergy sector," said Kuchma during his London visit. "With the EBRD'sloan we can strengthen our existing resources, in this case thermalpower plants."In the longer term, the project will include a "twinning" programme formanagement with a Western power company. The actual company has yet tobe chosen.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996$50M AGREEMENT SIGNEDPresident Kuchma's London visit saw the signing of an important projectaimed to grease the wheels of trade in Ukraine. The EBRD has signed a$50 million trade finance agreement under which it will guarantee thepayments of participating Ukrainian banks to their foreigncorrespondent banks. The Ukrainian Innovation Bank (Ukrinbank), aprivate bank, is the first to sign up to the programme. Other banks areexpected to join the programme shortly.The programme was first started in Russian and Macedonia. Day-to-daytrade is stifled by a chronic shortage of trade finance, covering bothexports and imports from the East European countries. Under theprogramme, the EBRD guarantees six-month letters of credit issued byselected financial institutions. This guarantee allows banks toestablish reliable reputations with Western financial institutions,enabling them to adopt normal correspondent relations with banks inEastern Europe. The programme may be expanded later to cover banks inEastern Europe and in "lost" markets, such as India, where Ukrainianenterprises used to export five years ago.Under the programme, the Ukrainian bank informs the EBRD which foreignbank it wants to deal with and pays the EBRD a fee to cover theguarantee. The EBRD guarantees up to 80 per cent of the letter ofcredit thus allowing importers and exporters to get out of the currentstalemate and re-establish trade on a normal footing.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996EBRD INCREASES UKRAINE FUND CAPITALThe EBRD is backing equity funding by increasing the capital base ofthe Ukraine Fund, the first private venture funds to be established inUkraine. Set up two years ago, the fund has lent $5 million to 18companies. The EBRD will now increase its capital base by a further$6.5 million. Equity funding has been provided to companiesmanufacturing medical equipment, construction materials and foodprocessing and distribution.The fund was established with a group of international investors,including Bank of Boston and Claflin Capital Management. Despite thedifficult economic conditions, the Fund was oversubscribed andinitially raised $12 million as against a target of $10 million.The EBRD is backing further infrastructure investment with aninvestment of $5 million to assist in the construction of a fertilizerterminal, Transinvestservice at Odessa. The terminal is part-owned bythe Ukrainian State Property Fund, the Norwegian company, Norsk Hydroas well as local investors. The terminal will be used mainly for theexport of fertilizers from Ukraine and other CIS countries to LatinAmerica and Asia.These investments bring the value of signed commitments to a total ofabout $312 million for this year. EBRD president Jacques de LarosiArenoted that the bank is able to achieve this due to the improved macro-economic situation in the country and the growth of the private sector.This total compares favourably with the EBRD projects approved in 1994,when Ecu 153.9 million was committed in only three projects.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCE EAST EUROPE via NewsNetJanuary 5, 1996TACIS FUNDS THREATENEDTechnical assistance programmes to the CIS countries are under threatfollowing a top-level move to block funding from the European Union.Spain is demanding tougher controls and greater participation inawarding contracts under the TACIS programme, which funds technicalassistance programmes to the 12 CIS member countries.No agreement has been reached to authorize the TACIS budget of Ecu 500million for 1996. While this dispute will not stop the programme in itstracks, unless there is a resolution soon, the effects will be felt inthe future."We have the legal base to operate by extending the present regulationsfor one year, but the budget is unclear," said EU official, Per Winter.Although TACIS officials agree on financial commitments within eachbudgetary year, which runs to December 31, the drawdown period canextend for up to three years. Winter added that there is always a rushto complete commitments by the end of the year in order to spend thefull annual allocation. If there is agreement within the first fewmonths of 1996, then officials are confident that the programme will beable to fulfil commitments for the year. Funding for the programme willbe discussed again early in 1996, when it is hoped that Spain and otherpossible allies might be persuaded to authorize a budget.Spain is objecting to the way TACIS is run, mainly because so farSpanish companies have only won 2 per cent of the programme'scontracts. EU officials claim they have tried to interest Spanishcompanies in the programme, but with little success. They point outthat Spain scoops the pool in Latin America, but have little experienceor language skills in Eastern Europe. Spain wants to introduce a newsystem of monitoring contracts and reduce the financial threshold forcontracts that are tendered, proposals resisted by other Member States,who fear it would create a larger bureaucracy and lead to delays.The TACIS programme had earlier been attacked by the European Court ofAuditors for inefficiency and poor targeting of funds, criticism thatthe PHARE programme, aimed at the Central European countries hadearlier suffered. PHARE has been re-drafted, changed its bureaucraticstructure and focus to enable it to prepare the Central Europeancountries for joining the EU.At the Cannes meeting in June, the EU decided to change the fundingmechanism for PHARE from an annual budget system to a five-year budgetof Ecu 6.7 billion, to avoid the annual scramble to commit funds by theend of the year. The civil service oversight was also changed from asectoral to a country basis. There are now country desks and theseofficials hold monthly meetings in the countries' capitals to determinethe future programmes in agreement with the individual governments.Contracts under the PHARE programme have also changed from a series oftechnical assistance contracts to a cohesive pre-accession strategy.There are three main strands of the PHARE strategy.The primary aim is devoted to helping the countries prepare formembership of the EU. Each country has to work out a programme ofaction that includes passing new legislation, preparing and ensuringits enforcement and introducing European technical norms and standards.While the programmes are driven by the individual countries, if EUofficials feel that the programmes do not make a realistic contributionto EU integration, then they can reduce the funds available.The second priority for PHARE funding is for infrastructure in areassuch as telecommunications, environment, gass and electricity networksand road and rail transport. In transport, the EU has designated Trans-European Networks, which integrate Central Europe's roads and railwayswith existing networks in Western Europe and in particular easingbottlenecks at border crossings. PHARE has now expanded into also providing finance in order tocatalyse foreign investments. Typically this might take the form ofputting up the government's share in an investment programme. The firsttime this was done was two years ago, when the World Bank and theEuropean Investment Bank were looking to the Polish government to kickin 10 per cent of the money needed to upgrade the E20 railway line fromBerlin to Warsaw. The Polish government re-drafted its proposed PHAREprogramme to allow the money available to be spent on the railwayproject.EU officials are confident that the accession of the Central Europeancountries will be the best prepared of any new Member States. Thetiming of their entry remains in the air, and it is also undecidedwhether they will come in singly or in groups. What is certain is thatPoland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will be the first, withofficials speculating that the likely entry date is the year 2000.Meanwhile, Slovenia, which would also qualify for early entry, has notsigned an Association Agreement yet, because of a dispute with Italy,while Macedonia, having solved its dispute with Greece, now qualifiesfor PHARE assistance. The eligibility of the other former Yugoslavrepublics remains in limbo.Back to Headline List WT02-B39-4IA074-000493-B040-290http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi88.html 205.156.212.5 19970122010348 text/html 88462HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:01:46 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:07 GMTContent-length: 88275Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi88.html Sample Issue Copyright FINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNet March 1, 1994 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT (683 words) SEC REPROPOSES "LARGE TRADER" REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (1197 words) PROGRESS IN INTERSTATE BANKING LEGISLATION (976 words) FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSES REVISIONS TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS (468 words) SEC PROPOSES RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEMS (451 words) STOCK EXCHANGE FINALISES DISSEMINATION OF PRICE-SENSITIVE INFORMATION (951 words) SIB PUBLISHES CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON COMPENSATION FUNDING (816 words) THE TRADED SECURITIES (DISCLOSURE) REGULATIONS 1994 (344 words) THE VALIDITY OF CLOSE-OUT NETTING UNDER JAPANESE LAW (1175 words) ASAHI BANK WILL BE FIRST CITY BANK TO OPEN SECURITIES SUBSIDIARY (381 words) NEWS MORE INFORMATION ON PAYOUT POLICIES URGED (73 words) TSE SENDS MISSIONS TO ASIAN EXCHANGES (112 words) CCPC'S FIRST YEAR (322 words) LISTING RULES TO EFFECT RESTRICTIONS ON MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS (143 words) INCREASE IN SFC FEES (79 words) HKMA ACCEPTS WIDER DEBT INSTRUMENT RANGE (137 words) PROPOSED CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN ANNUAL BUDGET (145 words) CONSULTATIVE PAPER ISSUED BY THE HONG KONG STOCK EXCHANGE (1330 words) PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR "BANCASSURANCE" (970 words) CENTRAL BANKS HOLD FIRE OVER HEDGE FUNDS (451 words) REVISED INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (314 words) ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATIONS UNDER THE EEA TREATY (850 words) OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS (207 words) SUPER PRIMARY DEALERS (154 words) CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENTThe UK Securities and Investments Board (SIB), under its chairman,Andrew Large, is entering a new phase in its attempt to police London'sfinancial markets.The SIB's early years were mainly taken up with detailed rule-setting;subsequently there was a shift away from detailed rules in favour ofbroader principles which the self-regulating organizations (SROs) couldthen apply; and now, following some spectacular financial scandals, theemphasis is on enforcement.The background to this problem is the fragmentation of responsibilityfor tackling market abuse. The multifinance enforcement agenciesinvolved include the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury,the Crown Prosecution Service, the Services Fraud Office, theSecurities and Futures Authority, the Stock Exchange - and, of course,the SIB.The SIB Chairman is now proposing a much more centralised and effectiveenforcement regime, based partly on US experience. Firstly, he wants tosee the development of a central transaction database covering on-exchange and off-exchange transactions in both cash and derivativesmarkets, so that abuse can be better detected. Secondly, theinvestigation of abuse needs to be strengthened, particularly wheremisconduct is of a criminal nature. And, finally, there should be moreeffective enforcement action to deal with cases where abuse has beenestablished - as already reflected in the SIB's willingness to use itspowers under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act to ban peoplefrom the investment industry.In the areas of investigation and enforcement the SIB is now focusingits efforts on more rigorous monitoring of the performance of the SROsthat come under its wing. This is being done through on-sitesupervisory reviews of both the SROs themselves and (morecontroversially) individual regulated firms. However, the SIB believesthat it is handicapped through insufficient statutory powers:specifically, powers relating to the appointment of officers of SROsand the imposition of monetary penalties on SROs where there is afailure to comply with regulations.In addition, the SIB would like to possess punitive powers overauthorised firms (eg the power to impose fines). The belief is thatfallback enforcement powers of this kind would encourage more decisiveaction by SROs who would wish to avoid any need for the SIB tointervene.But the most radical new ideas on enforcement concern the interfacebetween the civil and criminal law. Mr Large has pointed out that inthe US, market abuse may be dealt with both under the criminal law andas an administrative "offence", for which the SEC may impose penaltiesof three times the profit made. The most serious cases are dealt withby criminal prosecutors but in many other cases the civil route ispreferred, the public interest being served by the payment of financialpenalties to the SEC, which passes them to the US Treasury. This regimeis further buttressed by a plea-bargaining system which often avoidsthe need for protracted legal proceedings.Mr Large evidently sees much to be admired in the US enforcementregime, and on the particular issue of plea-bargaining he expressed hisviews forcefully earlier this month:"I believe it cannot be beyond the wit of man, and certainly not beyondthe combined brain power of our best legal minds, to devise a fair andopen system of plea-negotiations which respects the role of thejudiciary in sentencing, a guilty defendant's desire to own up quicklyand on all fronts, and the needs of our criminal and regulatory-enforcement agencies to secure their respective objectives withoutwasting valuable resources - that could command real publicconfidence."The fact is that the law, and the law enforcement agencies, havefallen into disrepute following a succession of failed prosecutionsinvolving allegations of financial fraud and market abuse. The publicperception is that the UK legal/ regulatory system is simply incapableof dealing with serious misconduct based on sophisticated exploitationof London's increasingly complex financial markets. The SIB chairmanclearly wants to do something about this, but it will require the co-operation of Parliament and, above all, the legal profession, iffinancial law and order is to be restored.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994SEC REPROPOSES "LARGE TRADER" REPORTING REQUIREMENTSIn reply to an unusually large volume of negative comments, theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has modified its earlierproposed rule requiring reporting by "large traders" both inside andoutside the US on transactions effected in "publicly traded securities"using US market facilities. (For a description of the originallyproposed rule, see FT-FRR January 1992.)As re-proposed, Rule 13h-1 would require large traders to identifythemselves to the SEC, and require their brokers to maintain records ofthe large traders' activity, to be provided to the SEC upon request. Alarge trader is a person who, for an account he owns or controls,effects transactions, during a calendar day where the account islocated, in publicly traded securities, aggregating at least the lesserof (a) 200,000 shares with a fair market value of $2 million, or (b)$10 million fair market value, or that constitute "program trading."("Program trading" is either index arbitrage or any trading strategyinvolving the related purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or morepublicly traded securities with fair market value of at least$1,000,000.)The modifications are designed to reduce the number of tradersaffected, as well as the burdens and costs of the proposed system onboth large traders and their brokers. This is accomplished through:clarifying the definition of a large trader; increasing the minimumlevel of trading that requires reporting; reducing the amount ofinformation required for filing; streamlining the filing itself, aswell as providing for an inactive status; improving the instructionsfor filing; reducing record keeping requirements; providing specialreporting requirements for execution times; and defining a safe harbourfor the broker's duty to supervise his large trader clients.The large trader reporting system, if approved as re-proposed, willrequire large traders to file Form 13H with the SEC to obtain a largetrader identification number (LTID). Each trader is then responsiblefor advising his brokers of his LTID and all accounts to which itapplies. These brokers must maintain records of the trades for theaccounts, which they will be required to provide to the SEC uponrequest. The brokers must also supervise their clients' compliance withthe rule. The large traders themselves are required to update Form 13Hannually.In the re-proposal, the large trader definition has been clarified toinclude a person who effects transactions "for an account that he ownsor controls" in place of the original "for his own account or anaccount for which he exercises investment discretion." According to theSEC, this change is merely a clarification and does not change thefunctional meaning of the definition. The re-proposal includes similarclarifications with regard to the definitions of "person," "account,""ownership," "control," and "transaction." The revisions are designedto limit the reach of the large trader definition by limiting thenumber of accounts that are deemed to be owned or controlledindirectly.Probably the most important modification is that of the increase in thelevel of activity which identifies one as a large trader. Theidentifying activity level for any 24-hour period would increase fromactivity involving 100,000 shares or a fair market value of $4 millionto 200,000 shares or a fair market value of $10 million. In addition,those 200,000 shares must have a fair market value of $2 million, ineffect excluding from large trader status many who trade in largevolumes of lower priced securities. The re-proposed activity levels arealso intended to minimise the impact of the rule on natural persons whoinfrequently trade large amounts of securities.To simplify the identification of activity which requires reporting,the SEC has proposed to change the 24-hour period to "a calendar daywhere the account is located." The change will preclude the need toaggregate trades occurring on different days, or to "correct" for timezone differences. An account is deemed to be located at the principalplace of business of the broker, not where the client is located.The re-proposal narrows the scope of the rules for aggregation ofaccounts and transactions. This is accomplished partly through themodifications to the definitions of "ownership" and "control." Inaddition, aggregation of accounts will not be required where theaggregation would include accounts of a person who would independentlyqualify as a large trader. On the other hand, aggregation will berequired to include accounts of any other person who would notindependently qualify as a large trader. Further, under nocircumstances shall a person or group acting in concert toward a commoninvestment objective be allowed to disaggregate where thatdisaggregation would permit them to avoid large trader identification.Modifications to the filing requirements provide that a large tradermust file its original Form 13H within 10 days after it initiallyreaches the identifying activity level; and within 60 days after theend of each year thereafter. The re-proposal has rejected the originalrequirement that large traders submit a new Form 13H each time the"information contained therein becomes inaccurate for any reason," infavour of the single annual update. In addition, the new form providesfor "inactive status" filing, by which a trader is exempt from annualfiling requirements until and unless it subsequently reaches theidentifying activity level. At that point, the trader again has 10 daysto "reactivate" by filing Form 13H.Form 13H and its schedules and instructions have been modified toreflect the changes in the Rule and have been generally simplified. There-proposed Form 13H allows for incorporation by reference ofinformation already on file with the SEC. The requirement for detailedinformation regarding persons who own or control large traderorganizations has been largely eliminated. The schedules for listingnew accounts have also been revised, corresponding to the largetrader's status as owner, controller or custodian/ nominee of theaccounts.With regard to the duties of broker-dealers, the rule requires thatthey report electronically transactions that reach a certain level forpersons who they know or have reason to know are large traders. Thelevel of trading activity that must be reported is increased in the re-proposed rule from 1,000 shares or a fair market value of $40,000 to2,000 shares or a fair market value of $100,000. This change alsoincorporates the change from a 24-hour period to a "calendar day." TheSEC recommends that brokers inform persons they have reason to know arelarge traders of their obligations to identify themselves to the SEC.Although the principal responsibility for compliance in placed on largetraders, brokers have a duty to identify large traders. The re-proposalprovides "a safe harbour" for brokers in this regard, provided theyadopt and follow reasonable procedures to identify large traders.Finally, the SEC maintains that the burdens imposed by the proposedrule on foreign entities are "necessary and appropriate" and "notunduly burdensome," given their uniform application to foreign anddomestic entities. The re-proposal points out that, through theredefinitions of identifying activity level as well as the concepts of"ownership" and "control," the effect of the rule on foreign entitiesis greatly reduced.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994PROGRESS IN INTERSTATE BANKING LEGISLATIONBoth the Senate and House Banking Committees have now passed theirversions of interstate banking legislation, and prospects are good thatboth Bills will pass the respective Houses of Congress before the July4 holidays. That will provide time before the end of the Congressionalyear for a conference between the Houses to resolve differences betweenthe two Bills, and passage of a landmark interstate banking Bill thisCongress.HouseThe House Banking Committee passed HR 3841, the "Interstate BankingEfficiency Act of 1994", by a vote of 50-1, and it should be reportedto the full House of Representatives within the next 30-60 days. Seniormembers of the Committee are considering placing it on the portion ofthe agenda of the House known as the suspension calendar, usuallyreserved for non-controversial Bills. While that may not succeed, sincetwo-thirds of those voting are required to pass such a Bill, the merefact that it is being considered shows that the Bill has solid strengthand will very likely pass the full House.The Bill is similar to the Bill passed by the Financial InstitutionsSubcommittee, changed only by modest amendments related to branchclosing requirements, statistical data collection, and inter-affiliateagency activities. Efforts to impose crippling amendments sought by con-sumer activists were soundly defeated.The House Bill would permit acquisitions of banks across state linesone year after passage of the Bill with no authority for states toprohibit such acquisitions. Consolidation of interstate banks within aholding company into a single branch network could take place 18 monthsafter passage. States would be able to prohibit branching by passinglegislation any time within three years after passage of the Bill, andif a bank holding company had consolidated its subsidiary banks withinsuch states into an interstate branch network before the passage ofthree years, it would be required to convert them back into banks asthey existed prior to the consolidation.De novo interstate branching, as opposed to acquisitions andconsolidations, could take place only if a state expressly permits itby statute. States would also be able, during a three-year periodfollowing passage of the Bill, to prohibit interstate branching throughacquisitions.Branches of national banks would be subject to the laws of the hoststate with respect to con-sumer protection, fair lending, and communityre-investment as though they were branches of a state bank chartered inthat state. Branches of state banks would be subject to the laws of thehost state as though they were branches of a state bank chartered inthat state.Foreign banks would be free to branch interstate with wholesalebranches and would not have to establish a subsidiary bank to do so,but no change is made in the current law which requires establishmentof a subsidiary bank for conducting retail banking activity, whethersuch activity be conducted through a branch or a bank. In other words,if a foreign bank wished to engage in interstate retail bankingactivity, it would have to do so through a US subsidiary bank.SenateThe Senate Banking Committee passed its interstate banking Bill,currently unnumbered and known as the "Interstate Banking and BranchingAct of 1994", by unanimous vote, and it is expected to pass the fullSenate before the Easter recess. It differs from the House BankingCommittee Bill in some key respects.Interstate acquisition authority mirrors the House Bill, and nosignificant differences need be debated in conference on that part ofthe Bill. In the Senate Banking Committee Bill, interstateconsolidation, however, may not occur until two years after passage, asopposed to 18 months in the House Banking Committee Bill.Under the Senate Banking Committee Bill branches of national bankswould be treated in a host state as though they were branches of anational bank chartered in that state. Branches of state banks would betreated as though they were branches of state banks chartered in thatstate.Foreign branches do not fare as well under the Senate Banking CommitteeBill as under the House Banking Committee Bill. While a foreign bankwhich had established a subsidiary bank to engage in retail bankingwould be permitted to branch (as would any other US bank) it appearsthat it would not be permitted to establish interstate wholesalebranches without first establishing a subsidiary bank, unless the statelaw expressly permitted such activity. It appears, however, that itwould continue to be able to have representative offices, agencies, andloan production offices in all states not specifically prohibited bystate laws, as long as those entities only conducted wholesale bankingactivities.Under both the Senate and House Banking Committee Bills there arelimits on the aggregate amount of deposits which can be retained in afirm which expands by acquisition, although those limits differslightly.PrognosisInterstate banking seems to be alive and doing well in this Congress.While passage of onerous provisions urged by consumer activists maystill derail final passage in the House, the prospects now are goodthat an interstate Bill will pass this year.The conference between the two Houses on the Bill will be difficult.Significant differences exist on a wide range of subjects such asdetermination of applicable law governing interstate branches, timingand effect of state actions vis-e-vis branching, effect on foreignbranch activity, concentration limits, and the effective date for theconduct of activities permitted by the Bills.Similarly, the shadow of serious disruption of Congressional activitywhich might be occasioned by hearings into the "Whitewater" affair arebeginning to build, and what Bills that might retard or scuttle areunpredictable.Still, for the first time since the McFadden Act was passed in 1927,Congress appears to be prepared to liberalise laws governing interstatebanking and branching activity.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSES REVISIONS TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDSThe Federal Reserve Board ("the Board") has proposed revisions toexisting risk-based capital standards as part of the implementation ofthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).In line with the Basle Accord, US banks currently calculate theirregulatory capital requirement on the basis of credit risks associatedwith broad categories of assets and off-balance-sheet instruments.Institutions are required to maintain a level of capital equal to atleast eight per cent of their risk weighted assets.The proposed modifications would seek to adjust capital standards so asto take into account the following factors:1 The degree concentration of credit risk in a bank's loan portfolio.2 An institution's ability to manage credit risk.3 An institution's ability to manage the risks posed by involvement innon-traditional activities.Although the Board recognises that there is no generally acceptedapproach to identifying and quantifying the risks associated withconcentration, it proposes that institutions with significant levels ofcredit-risk concentration should hold additional capital. They notethat the information to achieve this is already available. Banks canidentify and track loans by industry, geographical location, country,and loan type. This information would form the basis for the newstandard.While the Board recognises that there are potential gains in riskreduction through portfolio diversification, it is aware that there arealso potential pitfalls. For example, it is concerned that a bankshould not seek to achieve diversification by "lending in unfamiliarmarket areas to out-of-territory borrowers or by rapid expansion of newloan products for which the situation does not have adequateexpertise." They are anxious that any new regulations will not createfalse incentives for management that will unintentionally decrease thesoundness of the banking industry.The proposal does not identify specific categories of non-traditionalactivities that it proposed to monitor. The Federal Reserve recognisesthat new developments in technology and financial instruments have ledbanks to become involved in activities that have not been associatedwith their traditional business. They are aware of claims that any newregulations could limit the ability of institutions to compete with non-bank competitors. However, they are concerned that the risks associatedwith any new activities should be promptly analysed and that capitalshould be increased appropriately.

The SEC now believes, in light of the favourablefindings of its Market 2000 Study (See FT-FRR February, 1994 for adescription of that study), that enhanced record keeping and reportingwill be sufficient for purposes of detecting potentially or actualfraudulent, deceptive and manipulative practices and protecting thepublic interest in the automated trading arena.The rule is intended to assist the SEC in evaluating the role ofcomputerisation and automation in the securities industry, with an eyetoward the goals of the national market system, to monitor the effectof BDTSs on competition, and to reassess whether broker-dealerregulation remains the appropriate method for monitoring these systems.The proposed rule would apply only to those systems through whichactual execution or at least matching of orders occurs automatically,excluding those systems which merely automate the collection of ordersor the routing of orders but do not provide for automated matching ofbuy and sell orders within the system. BDTS sponsors will be requiredto maintain records of daily summaries of trading; time-sequencedrecords of all trades; information regarding system participants aswell as applicants who have been denied participation; and all noticessent by the sponsor to the participants. The sponsors will be requiredto file with the SEC an initial description of their system and itsoperation; quarterly summaries of activity; and notification ofmaterial changes or cessation of operations. The proposed rulespecifies no particular format for these submissions, in recognition ofthe variance in internal procedures already established by BDTSs.The SEC stated in its proposal that the anticipated costs to sponsorsin order to comply with these requirements "do not appear to besignificant," as many sponsors already maintain their own records andthe automated nature of the systems facilitates accurate and timelydata collection.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994STOCK EXCHANGE FINALISES DISSEMINATION OF PRICE-SENSITIVE INFORMATIONMore than 70 organizations responded to the Stock Exchange'sConsultative Document on the dissemination of price-sensitiveinformation (see FT-FRR November 1993 pp 7-8).The following points raised have resulted in changes:False market. Several respondents indicated that they were unclearabout the scope of the obligation in the Listing Rules to avoid thecreation of a false market in their shares. Are they obliged to correctany errors in market perception which lead them to feel that theirshares are wrongly valued? Many companies consider that theirresponsibility to correct errors in market perception should only arisewhen the cause of the error originates - or appears to originate - fromthe company or its agents.Companies should not have to be "incessantly concerned" with commentson their performance, their sector or their competitors. The Exchangewill be examining, in consultation with the Treasury and marketparticipants, possible changes to its Official Listing Rules to clarifythat a company which is keeping the market properly informed only has aregulatory obligation to correct misconceptions in the market when thesource of the error is itself or its agents. Factual correction ofinaccurate information from a third party should be a matter ofsensible judgement and good practice by the company.There will have to be further consultation by the Exchange on the basisof the text of the revised rule. The present text of the guidancereflects existing Listing Rules.Confidential. Concern had been expressed that the draft guidance doesnot fully reflect the situation where a company should not make anannouncement. There may be occasions when a company's duties to itsshareholders, employees and creditors conflict with any duty of promptdisclosure to the market as a whole. In response to this, the WorkingParty has included a new paragraph on the handling of confidentialinformation. The Working Party did not intend this guidance to implythat companies could not keep commercially sensitive informationconfidential until the appropriate moment for its announcement.Responsibility for issuing information. The revised guidance makes itclear that in the Working Party's opinion, policies concerning thehandling of price-sensitive information must be set by the Board of acompany, though the implementation of the policy may be delegated.Annual General Meeting. Some commented that public occasions such asAnnual General Meetings were unsuitable for intelligent discussionbetween directors and shareholders because they were so sparselyattended.The Working Party would "deplore" a situation where the publicproceedings at the AGMs remain anodyne, whilst influential audiencesare briefed privately on sensitive matters. Companies must remembertheir obligation to announce formally - either before or at the time ofthe meeting - any price-sensitive information which is to be given atthe meeting.Significance. Some consultees have suggested that the guidance, iftaken to extremes, would require a company to monitor constantly allcomments about itself, its competitors and its marketplace to see ifthey created the need for some statement of clarification. The guidancehas been amplified to stress that an assessment must always be made ofthe significance of information. The guidance is not intended to leadto a stream of inconsequential announcements.Status of guidance. The Working Party was strongly urged to clarify thestatus of the guidance in proceedings either in a court or as a resultof action by the Exchange as Competent Authority. The guidance cannotconstrain any regulatory body and compliance with it will notnecessarily constitute a defence in the event of regulatory actionbeing taken. However, the Board of the Stock Exchange has agreed thatthe Exchange will take into account judgements made by companies inaccordance with the guidance.List of what constitutes price-sensitive information. No respondentbelieved that price-sensitive information should be defined byreference to a given percentage movement in share price, but a fewsuggested that a list of likely price-sensitive events might behelpful. The Working Party has gone some way to meeting this requestbut has emphasised that any list is inevitably deficient in those greyareas where companies may be most anxious for guidance.Making people insiders. Some respondents suggested that the very act ofasking a shareholder if he consents to become an insider will conveyprice-sensitive information to him, in that he may well have a shrewdidea of what he is likely to be told. If shareholders wish to avoidbeing placed in this position and are reluctant to lose their abilityto trade, even for a short period, they should make this policy known.Quarterly statements. In general, respondents did not wish this part ofthe guidance to become prescriptive and endorsed the tone of theconsultative paper. Some thought that it was inappropriate for themarket to be given figures which had not been externally verified. TheWorking Party disagrees that the market will be misled by suchinformation provided that its status is made completely clear at thetime of the announcement.Analysts. The guidance now contains some observations on how analystsshould behave in the conduct of their relationships with companies.Many analysts are employed by firms which are members of the Exchangeand, even if the Exchange has no statutory responsibility for theirconduct, it feels it should encourage best practice, especially ascompanies are expected to handle their side of these contacts withgreat care.Small companies. The guidance is applicable to every size of company.It is acknowledged that companies whose progress is followed by only afew analysts will have particular problems if those analysts are wildlywrong in their forecasts and may well need to consider whether theyneed to make a correcting announcement.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994SIB PUBLISHES CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON COMPENSATION FUNDINGThe Securities and Investment Board has announced proposals to endcross-contributions for SFA and IMRO members with regard to theInvestors Compensation Scheme.The proposals have been drawn up in the light of comments which the SIBhas received in response to its Discussion Paper, "Financing InvestorsCompensation", published in October 1993.The proposals are as follows:* to end cross-contributions, as of April 1 1994 for SFA and IMROmembers, and on recognition of PIA for members of FIMBRA, LAUTRO andSIBRO;* to set up separate contribution arrangements for SFA, IMRO and, ifrecognised, PIA, with a cap of #100 million for each SRO;* to treat SIBRO firms as belonging to the relevant SRO forcompensation purposes;* to continue with a unitary scheme, administered, as now, by ICS, withseparate SRO funds;* to change the basis for allocating management costs to an activity-related basis, as far as possible;* to give SROs increased control over, and responsibility for, lookingafter their own arrangements for financing their own compensationliabilities.Cross-contributionThere was unanimous support for the proposed ending of cross-contribution and the SIB proposes to set up separate contributionarrangements for individual SROs, with no cross contribution betweenthem. However, there was concern about the proposal that there shouldbe caps of #100 million for each of SFA, IMRO and PIA.The fact that an SRO has a cap of #100 million does not necessarilymean that it has to levy the full #100 million on its membership in anyone year. It would be open to an SRO to avoid having to do this byborrowing on its own credit.Treatment of "SIBRO" firmsThe ending of cross-contribution raises the question of how SIBRO firmsshould be treated. The SIB last year indicated its preference thatdirect regulation should be available only as a last resort. TheDiscussion Paper proposed that, instead of remaining a separateconstituency with its own cap, SIBRO firms should be treated, forcompensation purposes, as belonging to the relevant SRO.This was the only other proposal in the Discussion Paper which arousedsignificant comment. Concern related to: the inappropriateness ofbreaking the link between compensation and regulation; the requirementin s54(3) that so far as practicable an SRO's contribution to ICSshould reflect claims experience in its own constituency; and thepracticalities of identifying the appropriate SRO.However, the SIB did not find these arguments persuasive and remainsconvinced that the original proposal is the most appropriate wayforward. Rather than breaking the link between compensation andregulation, the SIB sees the proposed approach as emphasising the valueof community of interest as between investment firms in the threeeventual groups (SFA, IIRO and PIA) in effective regulation. Apart fromSIBRO members who are applicants for membership of a SRO, who will betreated as belonging to that SRO's group, the presumption is that therelevant SRO will be PIA (if recognised) unless a firm is predominantlyengaged in dealing (in which case, it will be SFA) or managing (inwhich case, it will be IMRO).Separate SRO fundsor separate schemes?There was very little support for the idea of entirely separate SROschemes, each with their own administration. Accordingly, the SIBproposes to proceed on the basis of a unitary scheme, administered byICS, but with separate SRO funds.Management costsThe SIB proposes that the first #300,000 of management costs should betreated as fixed costs and that these should be divided equally betweenSROs. The SIB proposes that the variable costs element should beallocated on an experience-related basis according to a 3-year rollingindex which takes account of the number of defaults occurring in eachconstituency and the number of claims related to each constituencyhandled by the Scheme in that three-year period.Methods of financingSRO members' liabilitiesUnder the present arrangements, SROs are given the status ofadministrators of the Scheme for the purpose of the levy procedureonly. In other respects, they act as agents of ICS and it is the SROmembers, rather than the SRO, which owe the liability to the Scheme.The SIB proposes to change the rules so that the SROs will beconstituted as the administrators of the Scheme for the purposes ofraising the amount required - whether by levy or otherwise - from theirmembers. The initial liability to pay ICS will thus fall on theindividual SRO, but ICS will retain a right over the SRO's members inthe event of a failure by the SRO to pay or collect and pay over thesums due to ICS.The SIB also proposes to enable an SRO to defer - at least, in part -its members' obligation to pay for compensation liabilities by means ofborrowing.Representations in respect of the proposals should reach the SIB byMarch 25 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994THE TRADED SECURITIES (DISCLOSURE) REGULATIONS 1994On March 1 1994, The Traded Securities (Disclosure) Regulations 1994came into force, to give effect to Article 7 of the EuropeanCommunity's Council Directive (89/592/EEC) of November 13 1989 whichsought to co-ordinate regulations on insider dealing.Article 7 requires that:"all companies and undertakings, the transferable securities of whichare, whatever their nature, admitted to trading on a market which isregulated and supervised by bodies recognised by public bodies,operates regularly and is accessible directly or indirectly to thepublic, should be under an obligation to inform the public as soon aspossible of any major new developments in the issuer's sphere ofactivity which are not public knowledge and which may, by virtue oftheir effect on the issuer's assets and liabilities or financialposition or on the general course of its business, lead to substantialmovements in the price of the securities admitted to trading".The regulations stipulate that the above will apply to securitiestraded on any regulated market in the United Kingdom, except where therecognised investment exchange, which regulates and supervises theregulated market on which an issuer's securities are admitted totrading, exempts the issuer from this obligation.  It may do so ifsatisfied that the disclosure of the particular information wouldprejudice the legitimate interests of that issuer.The regulations go on to state that in the event of failure on the partof an issuer to comply with such disclosure of information, the rulesof the recognised investment exchange (on which those securities aretraded) must:* discontinue the admission of the securities to trading; and/or* suspend trading in the securities; and/or* publish the fact that the issuer has failed to comply with theobligation; and/or* itself make public any information which the issuer has failed topublish.The Regulations thus impose important reporting requirements on issuersof securities traded on regulated markets, although those listed on theStock Exchange are already subject to similar rules set out in Chapter9 of the Yellow Book entitled - Continuing Obligations.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994THE VALIDITY OF CLOSE-OUT NETTING UNDER JAPANESE LAWOn December 27 1993, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance (MoF)notified banks that there was no need to refrain from entering intoclose-out netting agreements. It was said that the MoF had consultedwith the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the MoJ had come to theconclusion that close-out netting provisions would be held valid in theexisting framework under the Bankruptcy Act, the CorporateRehabilitation Act and the Civil Code. Strictly speaking, however, eventhough Japanese banks are now allowed to enter into close-out nettingagreements with foreign counterparts, the question of validity willultimately have to be decided by the Japanese courts, this point beingacknowledged by both ministries.There has been some substantial discussion among Japanese lawyers onthis issue. The main question appears to be whether a contractualagreement entered into with a view to setting off, under certaincircumstances such as insolvency of one party, debts which are not dueand payable and are denominated in different currencies will be heldvalid under the Japanese insolvency law. Two main points at issue are:* whether a set-off will work on a cross-currency basis (the "currencypoint"); and* whether an agreement to set-off debts which are not due and payablewill stand under the Japanese insolvency law (the "timing point").As to the currency point, Article 403 of the Civil Code provides:"Any debt denominated in a foreign currency may be paid by the debtorin Japanese currency, the amount of which shall be determined inaccordance with the exchange rate available in the place of payment."There is also a rule established in a Supreme Court decision that, inconnection with a debt denominated in a foreign currency, the creditor(not the debtor) may require the debtor to pay in Japanese currency.The combined effect of these is that one of the parties to a swapagreement will be able to convert all the outstanding foreign currencydebts into those in Japanese currency, thus enabling such party toeffect set-off as if they were in the same currency. Since this happensby operation of law, it is argued that there is no reason why anagreement to set-off on a cross-currency basis should be held invalidunder Japanese law.As regards the timing point, there is a well established Supreme Courtauthority which states that an agreement made between a bank and acustomer to set-off debts which are not due and payable will defeat theclaim of the customer's creditor who obtains a garnishee order over adeposit which the customer has made with the bank. It is generallyunderstood that the above rule will apply where a liquidator isappointed for the customer.On the basis of these observations, there does not appear to be anydifficulty in affirming the validity of a close-out netting agreementunder the Japanese insolvency law. Such an argument has been advancedby a leading academic lawyer in Japan and it appears that there hasbeen an implicit consensus of opinion on these lines among Japaneselawyers.Insofar as there are remaining objections, they are likely to relate tothe argument that, while a right to convert currencies is availableunder ordinary circumstances, it would be quite another matter for itto be available in an insolvency situation. The reason behind this isthat to allow creditors who have multi-currency mutual debts toexercise such a right in an insolvency situation, would give themfurther priority over those creditors who do not have such a right,such as depositors (although the contrary argument can be that sincethe right of set-off is firmly established and those creditors having aright of set-off are given priority over other creditors, it will beregarded as a relatively minor step to expand the scope to multi-currency mutual debts). Another problem with the above argument isthat, since the argument is based on Article 403 of the Civil Code,there is some uncertainty as to a close-out netting agreement embodiedin a contract governed by a legal system other than Japanese law.It should be noted that the Supreme Court decision referred to withrespect to the timing point took a substantial approach, in which it isconsidered that the majority opinion upheld the validity of contractualset-off against the claim of the garnisher on the basis that such afunction of set-off would enhance convenience in trading and be ofbenefit to society as a whole. Although the said Supreme Court decisiondealt only with the timing point, the basic idea may well apply to thecurrency point. Such a consideration would probably strengthen theconclusion reached by Japanese lawyers and would be useful to overcomethe difficulties pointed out above.It is worth noting that in the Supreme Court decision referred toabove, one of the respected judges added, that if such a right ofcontractual set-off was widely acknowledged in a business community,its validity should be upheld in that business community. It isinteresting that the judge intimated that there could be a speciallegal system which would govern a business community. Such an idea hasnot been discussed in detail among Japanese lawyers, but would beuseful in this context.If there is any concern about upholding the validity of close-outnetting, it would be that creditors will be able to erode the principleof pari passu distribution easily by an agreement with the debtor.According to the above intimation, however, the validity of close-outnetting will be limited to financial institutions active in the market(if "business community" may be translated as "market"). It is truethat to protect those financial institutions in such manner would havea negative impact on other creditors (such as depositors) when afinancial institution goes into liquidation. However, other creditors(in particular, depositors) would be protected more properly by thecapital adequacy requirements, the deposit insurance scheme and otherregulatory measures.Although it may still be arguable as to how the validity of close-outnetting should be substantiated, it must be emphasised that almost alllawyers (including the officials of the MoF and the MoJ) who havefocused on this issue recently have come to the conclusion that a close-out netting agreement should stand up under Japanese insolvency law. Inorder to minimise or even remove the risk, however, it is advisablethat some steps should be taken, which now appear to be possible asJapanese lawyers have almost reached a consensus. It may be consideredthat some relevant institution should formalise the Japanese position,but it is questionable whether there is any institution which wouldperform such a function. More importantly, the Japanese courts, as amatter of policy, resist being influenced by outside opinions. In sucha judicial climate as exists in Japan, it will probably be moreappropriate to introduce recognition of close-out netting bylegislation.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994ASAHI BANK WILL BE FIRST CITY BANK TO OPEN SECURITIES SUBSIDIARYThe Ministry of Finance (MoF) has selected Asahi Bank as the first citybank to establish a securities subsidiary. Asahi will be permitted toopen its subsidiary for business from July this year. Under theFinancial System Reform Act, enacted last April, the MoF removed theoriginal firewalls between commercial banking, trust banking andsecurities industries.Last July, Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), Long-term Credit Bank ofJapan and Norinchurkin Bank set up securities subsidiaries. However,the MoF delayed the establishment of subsidiaries by city banks becauseof strong opposition from the securities industry. The city banks arefeared for their large financial resources, great influence over manyindustries and highly trained staff. Because of these fears the MoF hasrestricted the activities of bank subsidiaries to dealing andunderwriting bonds.From the existing 11 city banks:In July:Asahi bank has the green light to commence securities operationsthrough a subsidiary.In November:Six other city banks will commence securities business. Dai-Ichi KangyoBank, Mitsubishi Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Sakura Bank and SanwaBank.In March 1995:In the near future the MoF is expected to approve this date as theentry point for Tokai Bank and Takushoku Bank to the securitiesbusiness.Of the two remaining city banks, Daiwa Bank took over its securitiessubsidiary "Cosmo Securities" last August in a rescue bid. Finally, theBank of Tokyo has no immediate plans to enter the securities business.The MoF announced that it deliberately spread out the entry times sothat the securities industry would not be too disrupted by theentrants. According to the MoF, by the end of January 1994, thesubsidiaries had underwritten approximately Y50 billion worth ofdomestic corporate straight bonds, approximately Y3 billion worth ofdomestic convertible bonds and some Y50 billion of overseas bonds.Last month Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank came to the rescue of KankakuSecurities by extending subordinated loans of Y70 billion. The twofirms already have close ties but Kankaku stated that it has nointention of becoming a subsidiary of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as a resultof the rescue. In the case of Daiwa Bank's bailout of Cosmo Securitieslast August, Cosmo issued new shares that were bought by Daiwa, makingthe securities firm its subsidiary.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994MORE INFORMATION ON PAYOUT POLICIES URGEDIn a move designed to support shareholders' rights the Tokyo StockExchange (TSE) is urging companies to provide more detailed informationon their dividend payment policies.

So far 65city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, life and non-lifeinsurers have used the CCPC to liquidate troubled debts. The number offinancial institutions using the CCPC is likely to rise in March 1994,when many companies end their financial year. Estimates of the value ofbad debts that will be sold to the CCPC in March are put in excess ofY1 trillion.The banks sell bad debts to the CCPC at a discount, then charge theloss against their profits, so cutting their tax bills. The CCPC isthen supposed to liquidate the loans by selling the underlyingcollateral to private investors. So far it has only been able to sellY17 billion of collateral, due to weak demand for real estate. Incontrast the CCPC has bought Y1.33 trillion worth of bad debts with aface value of Y2.86 trillion.In the 1993/94 financial year the Ministry of Finance (MoF) restrainedthe sales of bad loans to the CCPC, to avoid large tax losses. Thispolicy has now changed and the MoF wants to accelerate the banks' write-offs dramatically. The goal of the MoF is to strengthen banks' balancesheets in the face of unprecedented enormous bad debts.Banks' property sales to the CCPC              No. of     Face value     Discount     Loss borne             properties     Y bn        to book %    by banks Y bn1993March          229          681.7        33.7           229.6April            1            0.1        20.0             0.02May              9           10.0        33.0             3.3June            12           24.3        27.5             6.7July            14           64.2        59.3            38.1August          60          130.8        49.0            64.1September      414          954.7        49.1           469.0October         16           54.1        45.8            24.8November        19           51.4        60.7            31.2December       116          231.2        54.6           126.21994January        103          187.6        47.3           88.8February       226          467.0        54.2           253.1Total         1219         2857.1        46.7          1334.92Source: James CapelBack to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994LISTING RULES TO EFFECT RESTRICTIONS ON MULTIPLE APPLICATIONSThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange has announced that changes to the ListingRules have been approved, which prohibit multiple applications forpublic offerings of securities and which should limit the occurrence ofundetected multiple applications.

It has invited comments on thepaper by April 22 and expects the strategic plan to be publicised inmid-1994.The consultative paper summarises discussions that have been held withmarket participants of issues facing the market and possible waysforward. It also indicates the Exchange's response to each of theproposals, which ranges from specific measures, through invitingfurther suggestions, to stating that it does not intend to take theproposals further. The list of market participants with whom theExchange held discussions includes as well as issuers, stock brokersand fund managers, a wide range of interested bodies and individualssuch as The Hong Kong Association of Banks, The Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority, The Hong Kong Society of Accountants, academics andinformation providers. The stated purpose of the paper is to get anindication of the market's general views. If the market shows supportfor a particular course of action, the Exchange may conduct a separatemore detailed consultation at a later stage.The main emphasis of the consultative paper is on identifying ways inwhich the Hong Kong's stock market can maintain its competitiveness inan international context, as well as facilitating its role as a sourceof international funds for the continued economic expansion in China.The paper identifies certain key issues which are facing the Exchange:* the maturity of the Hong Kong market in terms of domestic listingsand the need therefore to attract more listings of overseas companiesin order to maintain growth;* the significance of overseas investors to the recent growth in theAsian markets and the need to maintain and promote this interest;* the importance of China's economic development to the future of theExchange and the role the Exchange can play in helping to fund thatdevelopment;* the increasing demand for sophisticated derivative products for riskmanagement purposes or as trading vehicles;* the need to be up-to-date in the secondary market in terms of marketautomation, to facilitate higher trading volumes and meet theincreasingly complex demands of investors;* the competition from other Asian exchanges, and the need to stayahead or at least equal with their development of derivative productsand automated dealing systems; and* the need to promote the growth of the bond market in Hong Kong,possibly as an alternative means of raising funds for Chinese companiesrather than equity issues.Recurring themes in the consultative paper are the need to provide amarket that has the highest level of transparency and efficiency andthe need for a market which attracts investor attention. In thisrespect, the Exchange believes that the emphasis must now be on an"international" rather than local solution, as had been the case in thepast.The consultative paper outlines options for the development of theExchange which should meet the stated aims of transparency, efficiencyand international competitiveness.Some of the options involve building on existing developments. Theseinclude the introduction last year of the Automatic Order Matching andExecution System (AMS) and the first direct listings of Chinaincorporated enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as the ongoingdevelopment of a traded options market, expected to be launched inearly 1995, and improvements to the debt listing regime.Other options involve establishing a new direction for the Exchange aspart of the search for international solutions. New developments whichthe Exchange is considering further include:* re-orientating the Listing Rules of the primary market towards theinternational arena by basing them on a listing philosophy similar tothe US, which would rely on extensive disclosure and self-regulation byissuers and financial advisors, backed by strong sanctions against non-compliance;* relaxing the rules that require overseas entities to provideshareholders with the same standard of legal protection as under HongKong law. It is suggested that the US approach of requiring compliancewith the overseas entity's domestic corporate governance regime butwith the US accounting disclosure and accounting requirements would beattractive to overseas entities;* strengthening the corporate governance regime for listed companies,for example by making audit committees and properly qualified financedirectors and company secretaries mandatory;* improving the current disclosure requirements, such as requiring moredetail in the annual report, involving the auditors in interimannouncements and requiring annual asset valuations in the accounts;* establishing a formal regime for the regulation of sponsors andfinancial advisors, which may be backed by legislation;* including members' internal control systems in the Exchange'sinspection programmes and considering whether further measures arenecessary to improve members' internal control systems;* improving the automation of the market and considering thepossibility of off-floor trading;* improving the provision of real-time trading information to themarket and developing a "quality of market" function to monitor andfacilitate improvement in market transparency on a more formal basis;* introducing appropriate training programmes and allowing theinterface of AMS terminals with members' in house systems to facilitatethe development of sophisticated trading strategies in the secondarymarket;* extending the trading hours of the market which may allow a shortover-lap with the start of trading in London;* reforming the current disclosure regime arising from the Securities(Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance, which is thought to be onerous insome respects and inadequate in others;* increasing the current requirements for the minimum public float ofsecurities in a listed issuer and improving monitoring procedures;* abolishing the board lot system and the rules for spreads, inconjunction with the full immobilization or de-materialization of sharecertificates;* dissolving the Fidelity Fund or merging it with the clearing house'sguarantee funds and increasing the size of the maximum payment ofcompensation by the Compensation Fund in the case of member defaults;* considering the appropriateness of penalties for misconduct and thefeasibility of establishing arbitration facilities for disputes betweenmembers and between members and their clients;* enabling listed issuers to include their repurchased shares in theirbalance sheets as treasury stock held for subsequent re-sale; and* reviewing the relationship between the Exchange and the Securitiesand Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange to ensuregreater co-ordination of responsibilities and resources andconsolidation of the different statutory instruments and non-statutorycodes covering the securities market.In addition, the paper identifies areas where improvements or newmeasures might be welcome and the Exchange specifically invitessuggestions for future developments in these areas. They include:* developing listed Hong Kong depository receipts on regional blue chipcompanies; and* measures, beyond those for streamlining the listing process currentlybeing considered by the Exchange, to develop the bond market further.The paper identifies three proposals which the Exchange does not intendto take any further. These are marketmaking for stocks, introducing asecond-tier board for smaller companies which do not meet the fullListing Rules requirements and introducing a trading-only board, withno compliance requirements for the issuers concerned.Although in the Foreword to the consultative paper the Exchangestresses that these are tentative proposals which are open to commentat this stage, in the body of the paper the Exchange identifies thedirection of the strategy for the years to 1997 and beyond. Thisdirection is focused on attracting overseas issuers and investors,possibly by moving towards a US style disclosure-based regulatoryregime, and increasing the role of automation and sophisticatedproducts in the secondary markets. Press response in Hong Kong to theproposals has been favourable, although doubts have been raised as tothe feasibility of introducing a US style disclosure regime in the nextthree to five years, and the appropriateness of such a regime, whichwould include reduced vetting by the Exchange, for new issues in HongKong.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR "BANCASSURANCE"A joint approach to the supervision of "bancassurance" in the EuropeanUnion is still a far way off. While there is agreement on some basicprinciples such as the need for transparency of group structures, theexchange of information, the role of auditors and the monitoring ofintra-group exposures, the main point of contention remains thequestion of group surveillance of capital.Consolidation would be the "natural" tendency of bank supervisors;however, it has not been conclusively shown that this method isadaptable for the control of insurance groups. Insurance supervisorspropose the "solo-plus" approach, whereby pure solo supervision of eachof the components of a group is extended to include elements of group-wide risk assessment. The issue was the subject of a "jumbo" meeting ofEU finance supervisors in Brussels on February 23, and discussed duringa seminar held at the Central for European Policy Studies (CEPS) onMarch 15.Financial conglomerates are defined as "group of companies withspecific control relationships or under joint management, and whoseactivities consist largely or exclusively of providing services in atleast two of the following financial sectors: banking, securities,insurance." This refers in practice to many different structures: theycan be horizontal or vertical, headed by a supervised or unsupervisedentity, which may be a financial or a mixed-activity holding. Accordingto recent data, there are more than 200 financial conglomerates in theEU. Some Member States already allow consolidated accounts ofconglomerates, although it is far from clear whether this would bepermitted under EC legislation.While the European Commission does not want to stop the development offinancial conglomerates, which they see as a source of strength for theUnion's financial services sector, Member States' supervisoryauthorities disagree on the way to control the capital adequacy of suchconglomerates at the group level. Different regulatory rules and testsare applied at national and Community level, and wide variations existin the accounting treatment. There is however agreement on two basicpropositions, as Patrick Pearson of the Commission's DG XV said at theCEPS seminar: all solo supervisors should monitor the full risks of theconglomerate; and sufficient capital should be appropriatelydistributed and available in the group to cover risks.Some "easier" issues regarding financial conglomerates have alreadybeen dealt with in the draft BCCI follow-up Directive. This proposalsets a 20 per cent participation as the threshold for the inclusion ofa company in a group. It requires group structures to be transparentand says that the head office should be in the same Member States asthe registered office. It furthermore requires auditors to providerelevant information to the supervisory authorities. However, thedefinition of groups was criticized at the CEPS seminar by an industryrepresentative as an example of excessive regulation, and it wasquestioned whether reporting obligations could be strengthened by law.But there was agreement that further efforts should be undertaken tolower the obstacles to the exchange of information among supervisoryauthorities, and that a lead supervisor should be designated for thecontrol of conglomerates. Reference was in this respect made to the"protocol" model applied by the Dutch authorities.On the matter of how best to tackle the most striking problem in thecontrol of financial conglomerates, the prevention of double gearing,the opinions of regulators diverge. Double gearing is the double use ofregulatory capital in the different entities of the group. Banking andinvestment firms supervisors would adopt consolidated supervision totackle this problem, but it is not obvious that this is the method toapply to control bancassurance groups, since it is not proven that thecapital requirement for both parts is identical. The way therefore todeal with double gearing in the immediate future is the automaticdeduction of participations, or the deduction of a minimum solvencymargin. However, automatic deduction is not required under the EUbanking and insurance Directives.Other prudential concerns should also be dealt with in the near future.Capital requirements can be circumvented through the use of unregulatedentities, such as leasing and factoring firms. In the other direction,the holding company controlling the group can be used to distort thecapital standards. The latter problem was partly addressed in theamendments to the consolidated supervision Directive (92/30). However,it thereby only applies to financial holding companies, controllingcredit institutions, and it does not include mixed-activity holdingcompanies nor insurance companies in the consolidation. One proposal isto introduce "fit and proper" criteria for the shareholders of aholding company, but it remains to be seen whether this is feasible. Afurther problem is "incestuous capitalisation", whereby own fundselements are purchased by other intra- or extra-group entities, apractice which cannot be prohibited by regulators. Limits should alsobe set for intra-group loans and large exposures. The latter limitsexist in the banking and investment services sector, but not ininsurance. It might for example bring the banking arm of a conglomerateto place its large exposures within the insurance undertaking.As a medium-term solution, it was proposed that the solo-plus approachshould be adopted, whereby extra elements are added to the solocontrol, namely the exchange of information, the monitoring of intra-group transactions and transparency, and a minimum solvency for theparents' company capital. Banking supervisors will however continue topush for full consolidation. As Jean-Louis Duplat, President of theBelgian Banking & Finance Commission and Vice-Chairman of the EuropeanCommission's Banking Advisory Committee, said: "The solo-plus approachoffers a suitable solution for the time being, . . . the principle ofsupervision on a consolidated basis, completed with aspects of solosupervision, and, if necessary, sub-consolidated per pole (banking andinsurance pole), should be the final objective."Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994CENTRAL BANKS HOLD FIRE OVER HEDGE FUNDSDespite widespread speculation in late February that market volatilitymay have been increased by activities of US hedge funds (in sellingbonds and trading financial derivatives), the central banks governorsdecided at their meeting in early March against any immediate movestowards curbing hedge funds' activities.Hedge funds are not under the direct control of central banks, since,although mainly managed in the US, they are normally based offshore.However, their activities have still caused concern to the regulatorsfor a number of reasons:* their activities appear to have added to market volatility;* heavy losses following unsuccessful speculation (eg on currencymovement) might lead to defaults on loans from banks where a hedge fundis highly geared;* failure to settle a contract could lead to a chain of defaultsoccurring throughout the financial system.Any attempt to increase control over hedge funds would, however,encounter difficulties, whether the chosen approach was one of directregulation or an increase of existing indirect control (via supervisedbanks). Direct regulation would be difficult, since it would need totackle cross-border issues, define "hedge funds" and also try toisolate the particular activities causing concern (given that short-term leverage risk is in itself a common investment strategy). Thealternative of an indirect approach by the central banks would insteadfocus on loans made by supervised banks to hedge funds for the purchaseof assets. Both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board arecurrently studying the implications of the ensuing credit riskexposure, in light of the banks' common practice of only holding assetsto the value of the cash lent, with a margin of around 5 per cent orless to cover risks. The concern here is that such margins would not belarge enough to cover sudden changes in hedge funds' positions,particularly given that the credit risk of hedge funds is hard toanalyse, since they are not credit rated, have complex structures andholders may also not provide net asset valuations. Additionally, recentnetting and market risk proposals by international supervisors seemlikely to reduce the requirement for banks to set aside capital againstsuch hedge fund exposures.For the present therefore, the central banks appear happy simply tomonitor the situation, whilst keeping a closer eye on hedge funds'activities. Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman ofthe G-10 governors, summarised this approach, saying:"We are willing to examine closely what is going on with these newtechniques, but we do not think that there is for the time being anyneed for specific regulations. We think we have got to live with thesenew techniques, but will follow closely what is going on."Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994REVISED INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSThe International Accounting Standards Committee ("IASC") has issued arevised proposed International Accounting Standard on financialinstruments (Exposure Draft E48) for comment. This draft results from areconsideration of an earlier proposal (Exposure Draft E40) issued inSeptember 1991.The draft covers the accounting for the disclosure, recognition,measurement and presentation of all types of financial instruments andsets out the proposed treatment for the financial assets and financialliabilities so created, in the accounts of the respective enterprises.A financial instrument in this context is a contract that gives rise toboth a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability orequity instrument of another enterprise. Financial instruments includeboth primary instruments such as cash, receivables and equitysecurities, and secondary or derivative instruments, such as options,futures and forward contracts relating to financial instruments andinterest-rate and currency swaps. Various interests, such as those inassociates and subsidiaries and commodity contracts, were excluded fromE40. The new draft also proposed to exclude from the scope of theStandard insurance contracts and assets held specifically to providefunds for satisfying obligations under insurance contracts.Other significant changes from E40 include:* the criteria for recognising and subsequently discontinuingrecognition of a financial asset or a financial liability now refers tothe transfer of substantially all of the risks and rewards associatedwith the asset or liability;* a legally enforceable right of set-off must exist before a financialasset may be offset against a financial liability and the net amountincluded in the balance sheet;* impaired monetary financial assets and impaired non-monetaryfinancial assets are now treated separately under the Standard ;* hedge accounting is now permitted for price risk exposure whereexpected future positions are highly likely to materialize;* financial instruments that hedge currency (foreign exchange) risk arenow within the scope of the hedge accounting requirements of theStandard.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATIONS UNDER THE EEA TREATYThe coming into force of the European Economic Area (EEA) Treaty onJanuary 1 1994 led to substantial changes in the regulation of manycommercial areas in Norway, including the regulation of financialmarkets.The changes relate both to the implementation in Norway of the generalprinciples of EEA law, like for example non-discrimination of EEAnationals, and the implementation of the various EC Directives relatingto financial markets. There follows an overview of some of the changesrelating to both banking and investment business.BankingThe Norwegian regulations contained various provisions regardingnationality and residence of persons acting as board members of a bankand the founders of a bank. Originally these persons had to beNorwegian nationals and resident in Norway. These requirements havebeen changed to cover persons who are nationals of an EEA state andresident in such a state. The restrictions on foreign ownership ofNorwegian banks remain applicable since Norway can, according to theEEA Treaty, benefit from a transitional period for its investmentcontrols until January 1 1995 when it has to lift its restrictions inrespect of EEA nationals.The various EC Banking Directives have been implemented in Norway,including the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive as a result ofwhich EEA Member State banks may provide services to, and establishbranches in Norway. The services provided for, relate to the taking ofdeposits as well as the services set out in the Annex to the Directive.The relevant regulations open possibilities for the imposition ofvarious rules on these branches to the extent that they are necessaryfor the public good, as provided for in the Directive.The Norwegian regulations in respect of banking activities have alsobeen amended in other respects to comply with the various EC bankingdirectives including regulations in respect of consumer credits andmoney laundering.InvestmentAs far as intermediaries are concerned, the rules now provide anexemption for branches of EEA credit institutions in Norway to conducttheir securities activities through a separate legal entity. Norwegianbanks are under an obligation to organise their securities marketbusiness in a separate legal entity. The activities must also beseparated physically from the other activities of the bank. Branches ofEEA credit institutions do not have to comply with these rules. Thelegislation further provides a basis for the adoption of additionalrequirements on EEA credit institutions offering securities servicesthrough a branch in Norway.In addition, the obligation on Norwegian residents to make purchases offoreign securities through a Norwegian broker has also been amended.The rules now provide that Norwegian residents can buy and sellsecurities which are regularly traded in the EEA without the mediationof a Norwegian securities broker. In addition, these securities nolonger need to be kept in the securities deposit of a Norwegian bank orsecurities broker. Although the exemptions are mainly directed tosecurities traded in EEA member states, the regulations also providethat the exemptions can be made applicable to securities traded instates which have supervisory standards similar to those of the EEA.The listing requirements of the Oslo Stock Exchange have been amendedto comply with the various directives in this field, including therules in connection with the preparation and recognition ofprospectuses. The Norwegian regulations in connection with the offeringof non-listed securities have also been amended.If the securities to be issued have a value of more than 5 millionkrone and the offer is directed to more than 50 persons, then theissuer has to prepare a prospectus which complies with detailedrequirements. The prospectus must be sent to the board of the OsloStock Exchange, where the contents of the prospectus will be checked inorder to ensure that they comply with the relevant regulations. If thesecurities are listed on an EEA stock exchange, a similar prospectusneeds to be prepared if the value of the issue is more than 300,000krone or if the offer is directed to more than 50 persons.Different prospectus requirements apply to issues which are directed tomore than 50 persons and have a value of between 300,000 krone and 5million krone. In such cases, a less elaborate prospectus will need tobe prepared. The prospectus must also be sent to the board of the OsloStock Exchange, however this is for filing purposes only. There are anumber of exemptions to these prospectus requirements which should alsobe considered.In addition, there are more general rules in connection withinvitations to subscribe or the corresponding acquisition of shares inconnection with the incorporation of a company or capital increases,founder shares and bonds with a term of more than 12 months. In suchcases a prospectus must be prepared which complies with some basicrequirements. These rules apply only to the extent that a prospectus isrequired pursuant to, for example, company law or when a prospectus isissued in connection with the issue.The regulations relating to investment institutions have been amendedand now also incorporate the UCITS Directive.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTSSince the beginning of March, options on futures contracts have beenquoted on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time on an"experimental" basis. The wording of a standard contract for theseinstruments is currently being settled by the management committees ofthe "Mif" (Government Bond futures exchange) and by the "Mts" (theGovernment on-screen trading market). It is expected that regulartrading will commence in earnest sometime in April 1994.The underlying instruments will be futures contracts on ten-yearTreasury Bonds (BTp decennali) and will be based on the American model(ie exercisable at any time from the date of purchase to the date ofexercise). There will be nine striking prices, exercisable at fiftybase-point intervals, and the premium will be payable upon maturity ofthe option or upon its exercise.In order to ensure the efficient management of the new instruments, theCassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (the national clearing house) enteredinto a contract last August with the Options Clearing Corporation inChicago for the supply of specialised software which will also be usedfor the other new products which are shortly to be introduced onto themarket, namely three-month Eurolira futures and stock exchange index-linked futures.Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL REGULATION REPORT via NewsNetMarch 1, 1994SUPER PRIMARY DEALERSIn March, a Decree Law of the Ministry of Treasury introduced a newplayer in the Italian markets namely, the "Super Primary Dealer", whowill operate in both the Italian primary and secondary markets inTreasury Bonds.The "Super Primary Dealer" is a Primary Dealer who is able to satisfycertain strict pre-requisites (in particular, it must have assets worthat least Lit. 75 billion, and have been awarded a market sharecalculated on the basis of a year's trading, equal to at least one percent in respect of each category of bonds and no less than three percent of the of total volume of Treasury Bonds issued on the primarymarket over the same period).

(Lynn Busing, Servantis Systems Inc.,770/840-1434.)Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL SERVICES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR BUSTING FRAUD     Credit card institutions must be more proactive in their fraud-fighting strategies or risk significant losses from fraud, riskmanagement experts say.      To nip fraud losses in the bud, credit card departments must beon the lookout for current fraud schemes, such as account boosting,account takeover and counterfeit cards, say anti-fraud specialists. Issuers also should implement new procedures and programs for theentire lifetime of an account to prevent these new forms of fraud.       Increased transactions are translating into an uptick in fraudlosses (Visa estimates that for 1994, it had $409 million in fraudlosses in the United States out of $290 billion total sales;MasterCard's fraud figures are believed to be similar to Visa's).  Reactive vs. Proactive     The banking and credit card industries have, historically, hadmore of a "reactive stance" to fraud, taking action only once thecardholder alerts the bank to some fraudulent activity, such as astolen card or a charge-back item on a bill, said one consultant.       The more effective way to keep fraud losses down, however, is toidentify fraud schemes before they reach the individual cardholder. "Don't wait until the cow is out of the barn," advised Larry Hay, vicepresident of risk management at Plainview, N.Y.-based CardholderManagement Services, a firm specializing in card marketing, processingand consulting.     How can you become more proactive instead of reactive aboutfraud?  Consider these strategies, offered by credit card fraudexperts:Beware of Account Boosting     Card executives need to be attuned to every kind of new fraudscheme because they're faddish -- one form of fraud may be populartoday and virtually non-existent tomorrow, card industry observerssay.  Fraud schemes change frequently as law enforcement groups, card associations and financialinstitutions devote attention to one type.  Subsequently, criminalswill look for new methods.     Visa has begun to alert its member institutions about "accountboosting," a scheme where criminals obtain legitimate credit cards,accrue balances, then send issuers, via overnight courier services,stolen or counterfeit checks that exceed the balance amount, "boosting" the account's credit line. Federal law requires banks to post credit payments before checksclear, so, the next day, the fraud perpetrators go to an automatedteller machine (ATM) and withdraw the excess amount on that cardaccount and the check later bounces.     Visa has been helping the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S.Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) track down one large accountboosting case in Los Angeles, which resulted in 41 arrests recently,said Allan Trosclair, vice president of fraud control for Visa.       Some account-boosting cases also are being linked to bankruptcyfraud -- individuals accrue massive card debt knowing they will filefor bankruptcy and have no intention of repaying the card debt.  TIP:  Card executives should be wary of any payments coming in throughovernight services, Trosclair warned.  They also should watch forlarge payments or payments that exceed what a cardholder owes.       "If I send in a $6,000 check, and my credit limit is only $5,000,there's something wrong," he said.  Banks may also want to monitor forbankruptcy fraud behavior, by keeping track of accounts that suddenlyhave high purchase volumes or uncharacteristically extravagantpurchases.  "There are several systems available which develop aprofile of normal purchasing activity of an individual cardholder andwhen that [behavior] is severely changed and warrants some attention,"said Hay.  Prevent Account Takeovers     MasterCard has been alerting its member institutions to watch foran increase in "account takeover" fraud in which a criminal obtains acardholder's basic information (address, phone number, accountnumber), sometimes through old receipts, records or by stealing thereal cardholder's mail.       The criminal calls the card issuer, assuming the cardholder'sidentity, and requests that a new card and personal identificationnumber (PIN) be sent to a new address because the card was lost orstolen and the cardholder has moved.  "What happens is that the [real]cardholder may not get a statement for a couple of months, thecriminal may pay off the minimum balance [to avoid detection] and thenstart [using the card]," said Nancy Elder, a MasterCard spokesperson.TIP:  To reduce account takeover fraud, issuers can include a three-digit code, determined by the bank, on the back of a credit card nextto the account number.       Account representatives should be trained to be suspicious forthe three characteristics of account takeover:  a request for a newcard, a new PIN and a change of address.  Representatives should askfor the three-digit code.  "If they say they don't have the card onthem, respond by saying 'call us back when you have the card inhand,'" said Elder.Use Technology, Training To Stop Fakes    Issuers also must be alert for another kind of fraud: counterfeit cards.  These illegal products declined in the early 1990swith the advent of the hologram; however, fake cards recently havegained in popularity as holograms have become easier to replicate,according to James Steel, regional vice president of security and riskmanagement at MasterCard.      To prevent more counterfeit card fraud, both MasterCard and Visahave implanted secret card validation algorithms in each card'smagnetic stripe.  MasterCard calls it a card validation code (CVC) andVisa calls it a card verification value (CVV).      When a merchant swipes the card through an authorizationterminal, the code enables the issuer to detect if there has been anyalteration of the stripe, and if so, to deny authorization for thetransaction.      An increasing number of transactions, however, are suspectable tocounterfeit card fraud because of purchases made at retail locationsthat don't have on-line authorization terminals, or by telephone wherecards cannot be checked.TIP:  One of the best ways to reduce counterfeit card usage is toensure that merchants are adequately trained in counterfeit carddetection, fraud experts say.      MasterCard's Holiday Fraud Prevention Seminar Program, forexample, helps merchants understand different types of credit cardcrime by touring U.S. malls and educating merchants.  Acquiringinstitutions also should require that their merchants offer trainingto telephone operators, clerks and sales associates to help them learnhow to detect credit card fraud schemes.Implement a Review Policy    Issuers can use proactive strategies even after the fraud hasoccurred by having a purposeful chargeback review methodology, saidHay of Cardholder Management Services.  TIP:  Review a charged-off account for improper authorization codesand irregular activities, such as major purchases.      Improper authorization codes may indicate merchant collusion,experts say. Irregular activities also may offer leads to criminals --a purchase of a piece of furniture, for example, may have an addresswhere the furniture was delivered.

The system also allowed the bank to more than double the numberof random interest rate scenarios it can create and reduced the timeneeded to meet regulatory reporting requirements, Bancorp executivessay.    Asset/liability management software uses computer simulationsunder random rate scenarios to monitor interest rate sensitivity,liquidity position and capital adequacy.  Although such services areoffered by banks as part of their corporate services package, somelarge companies have purchased asset/liability software for in-housetreasury management, consultants say.    However, treasurers largely have shown lukewarm interest in thesoftware as systems can be costly, tough to maintain and difficult touse, consultants note.System Reduces Analysis Cycle    Bancorp installed RADAR, a UNIX-based asset/liability managementapplication from Risk Management Technologies Inc., of Berkeley,Calif.    RADAR simulates up to 100 randomly generated, interest ratescenarios and presents a statistical and graphical view of eachpotential outcome.  Companies can use this data to look at statisticalprobabilities and begin to generate strategies for the best balancesheet mix.    The system also analyzes product risks.  For example, banks canuse the system to look at commercial lending across their subsidiariesand provide information to various business managers on optimal feestructures and interest rates, explained Rick Simpson, asset/liabilitymanager at Bancorp.    In addition, RADAR reduced by two weeks Bancorp's time needed toconduct rate analysis and issue reports for different business lines. "Today we are performing the same reporting in two weeks, which givesus the second half of the month to [plan] how to use the information,"Simpson explained.    Although Bancorp hasn't calculated the interest rate savingsRADAR has provided, trimming just one basis point on the spreadbetween assets and liabilities means an additional $1.8 million to thecorporation, he noted.    Bancorp also can run a full balance sheet analysis for one of itsbanking concerns in two minutes.  Simpson estimated it takes a fewhours for the bank to run a hundred different scenarios.     RADAR uses RAM-resident, interactive modeling and supports bothvalue-at-risk (VAR) and risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)analytical approaches.Software Not a Hit with Corporations    Sumitomo Bank Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, the world's fourth largestbank, plans to implement a RADAR system for asset-liabilitymanagement, interest rate risk management, transfer pricing, strategicand product planning and product and customer-service performancemanagement, its executives say.      Sumitomo will create a bank-wide data warehouse for use by thesystem.    National Computer Systems of Minneapolis offers DataWriter,another software application for asset/liability management.      The Windows-based system generates detailed reports on any aspectof an asset management operation, including specialized assetmanagement.  Treasurers can use DataWriter to produce multiple reportssimultaneously.     In addition, the system allows treasurers to use point-and-clickfeatures to define data and maintain libraries for storing andindexing reports.    Asset/liability software is not widely used by corporate treasurymanagers, notes consultant Jim Sagner of Sagner-Marks in West Orange,N.J.      "Even the most popular software which does account analysis hasbeen purchased by only a few corporations.  Many of them use theirsystems just once or twice a year, and probably are sorry they spentthe money," he said.    Most treasurers use asset/liability software provided by banks aspart of their information systems and balancing and reportingservices, Sagner said.  He believes treasurers are reluctant to buycustom asset/liability systems because banks are providing adequateservices at competitive prices.  "Banks usually cut deals on theseservices to win other business with corporations," he explained.    However, only banks with sophisticated treasury workstationproducts offer asset/liability services as part of their standardsoftware package for corporations, notes Henry Waszkowski, head oftreasury consulting at Wachovia Corp. in Atlanta.  The packagesgenerally feature debt modules, funds need forecasting and investmentmodules, which do little analysis, Waszkowski said.      He said corporations often have to buy asset/liability modulesfrom vendors to implement on existing treasury workstations.  Manyother companies gather rate forecasting information from consultingfirms or by polling banks they do business with and subscribing toeconomic services, Waszkowski noted.    "Full-blown" workstations that include asset/liability managementsoftware make the most financial sense for corporations with more than$1 billion in sales annually and operations expanding overseas,Waszkowski said. Treasurers Scared Off by Price of Software    Sagner said another reason asset/liability software gets alukewarm reception from corporations is that treasurers are afraidvendors won't be able to provide long-term support for the systems. He also believes treasurers are turned off by the $10,000 to more than$100,000 price tag for the software.      "The little bit of money treasurers have as discretionary budgetis used for industry conferences or visits to vendor or bank sites,"he noted.    Sagner recommended treasurers avoid asset/liability systems thatare not bank-supported.  Otherwise, there is a chance that thesoftware vendor will go out of business and its system will becomeobsolete and tough to maintain.    TIP:  If you are keen on buying custom software, get a handle onvendorinstallation costs, which inflate greatly the price of off-the-shelfsoftware.Look for Flexible Asset/Liability Software    Jeffrey Wallace of Greenwich Treasury Advisors in Greenwich,Conn., suggests treasurers also avoid asset/liability systems that usestatic gapping models, which compute debt-equity ratios withoutfactoring in the yield curve.  "The real issue is how the yield curveimpacts bucket limits," Wallace said.    "[Treasurers] won't care if they are long on the three-month sideand short on the six-month side if the yield curve is relativelyflat," he said.  "But if the curve is inverted, they might beconcerned about their gap restrictions."     Wallace suggested treasurers look for asset/liability softwaremanagement software that allows them to simulate a variety of interestrate scenarios.    TIP:  Keep in mind that PC-based asset/liability packages arelimited by the PC's processing capacity, memory and storage capacity. To compensate, they use aggregated data, which is not as accurate,Simpson cautioned.

Back to Headline List CopyrightFINANCIAL SERVICES REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 3, 1996MECA SOFTWARE GAINS MORE FINANCIAL BACKERS    Banks looking to support personal financial management (PFM)software may have to consider another major player.    Competition in the PFM software business continued to heat uplast week as three new bank-investors pledged their moneys toFairfield, Conn.-based Meca Software's Managing Your Money PFMproduct.     FirstBank Systems, Fleet Financial Services and the Royal Bank ofCanada all bought stakes in Meca, which is co-owned by San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank Corp..  Each of the fiveinstitutions will own a 20-percent share of Meca.     The five Meca partners have a combined customer base of more than40 million customers and represent more than $655 billion in assets,giving Meca -- whose software is used by more than 600,000 consumersand small businesses in North America -- a significant competitiveboost, industry analysts say.     However, some banks do not believe the Meca partners will be ableto work together and create a competitive product.     The overwhelming market leader for PFM software, with more than 8million copies sold, is Intuit's Quicken.  Microsoft's Money PFMproduct -- launched earlier this year -- is a distant third to Meca.PFM Maneuvering     The Meca deal continues a six-month trend, which has seen PFMmanufacturers aggressively seeking out bank partners to offer on-linehome banking.  Both Microsoft and Intuit have struck agreements withmore than 19 banks across the United States.  Many of theseinstitutions including Chemical Bank, CoreStates Bank and Wells FargoBank will offer both Money and Quicken to its customers.Advantages     Meca's owners said the deal gives them an advantage in the PFMmarketplace over the Microsoft and Intuit banks because institutionsnow can customize their PFM software packages.  Minneapolis-basedFirstBank, Providence, R.I.-based Fleet and Royal Bank of Toronto allwill create a branded Managing Your Money product with differentfunctionality.     "This investment will enable Fleet to develop its own branded PC[personal computer] product, designed to meet the specific needs ofour customers while providing them convenience and privacy," saidMichael R. Zucchini, vice chairman and chief technology officer atFleet.     Fleet's version of Managing Your Money will provide Fleetcustomers with an on-line link to open accounts, check and transferbalances, apply for loans, track their investments and buy stocks andmutual funds.Avoiding Conflict     Meca critics question whether the five large institutions canagree on one software product.       "I just don't see why these banks, who compete against eachother, would want to join forces," said one Southeast banker.  "Theegos of the executives at these large institutions are bound to causeproblems."     However, allowing each bank to customize may allow Meca tosidestep any controversy.     "I don't see a lot of potential conflict," said Stu Bloom, apartner at the Hackensack, N.J.-based consultancy, Carmody & Bloom. "Banks are going to do what banks do -- offer basic financial productsto their customers.  There should be no great conflict in what will bedeveloped."     Royal Bank of Canada will use Meca to launch a PC computerbanking system.  Its customers will connect directly to the bank'shost computer to pay bills, receive account balances, transfer fundsand access account information.  Royal will roll out Managing YourMoney nationally in late 1996 to its 10 million customers at more than1,600 branches, according to Royal Bank officials.The Future    Industry analysts expect the strategical maneuvering of PFMsoftware providers to continue throughout 1996.    In fact, Intuit recently announced its plans to provide on-linebanking over the Internet.  This is a change from its recent strategyof signing up financial institutions.    Intuit said it is developing a direct connection to the Internetthat will allow consumers to pay bills, check account balances andtransfer funds over the Internet.  Banks working with Intuit will havethe choice of offering customers Internet banking or banking solelythrough Quicken.  PFM Landscape    The Intuit decision earlier this week proves that the PFMlandscape is changing on a daily basis.      PFM manufacturers will most likely continue to strike deals withfinancial institutions.      However, do not expect banks to support solely one PFM product. Industry watchers believe banks want to offer their customers the most  choice  and   will   offer any  alternatives on the marketplace.      "It wouldn't be surprising for a bank to take an open systemsapproach to these types of [PFM products]," said Bloom.  "In someways, it would be advantageous.  It won't surprise me [if some Mecainstitutions offer Quicken or Money] even though they have taken anequity position in Meca."

It also claims to be the only bank to fully exploit theopportunity to initiate true interstate banking.     "We have installed a common lockbox image platform at all of ourbanks which gives our customers the same consistent functionality,"said Julie Stephens, product manager at the $56 billion asset-bank.     A common platform allows First Interstate to offer same-dayautomated clearing house settlement (ACH) across its Western stateaffiliates or same-day cash concentration for customers who requireseparate accounts, officials say.     The bank's image-retail lockbox provides customers withstreamlined workflow, higher quality processing and improved customerservice, she said.       In addition, the system includes intelligentcharacter recognition (ICR), which allows matching payments andcoupons to be read by the system and processed without keying.  Thisimproves the speed and quality of processing.       Phase 2 of First Interstate's image-retail lockbox project willinclude the ability to provide transaction images to customers forreceivables posting.     The image system is expected to capture about 11 million itemsper month.     First Interstate Offers Common Platform       First Interstate also completed recently a multimillion-dollarproject to install common cash management systems across the bank's13-state domain.       A provision of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act allowsaffiliated banks to act as "agent" for one another, and act as anagent itself.     First Interstate offers common direct demand accounts (DDA),account reconciliation processing (ARP) and account analysiscapabilities.  Customers can use the products to make same-daydeposits to a single account from deposit acceptance points in 13Western states.  With fewer accounts to manage, customers candetermine cash positions faster and easier, bank officials say.     "Many companies with multi-state operations will no longer haveto concentrate or reconcile funds," said Jan Cloyde, the bank'sexecutive vice president and manager of cash management.  She claimedthat competitor banks are well behind First Interstate in developingmultiple interstate banking options.(Julie Stephens, First Interstate, 213/614-7652; Ken Preston, 213/614-3656.)

The gasps that were heard in court as the defendants inthe Maxwell trial were acquitted on all charges were soon followed bycries outside the court. Whether the shouts in court were of joy,shock, or surprise, the comments outside were of a predictable nature:critics slammed the use of juries in fraud trials and the record of theSerious Fraud Office in prosecuting complex fraud.Whenever a fraud case goes wrong - in other words, when defendants areacquitted or those convicted receive light sentences - the reaction isalways the same. We were not disappointed in the case of the Maxwelltrial.In contrast to the cries of 'abolish the jury' or 'scrap the SFO', oneof the most pertinent and sane comments came from George Staples,director of the SFO. Although presumably bitterly disappointed by theverdict of the jury, he said: 'It is our job to conduct a thoroughinvestigation and ensure that defendants are prosecuted fairly, andthat has happened. The jury has considered the verdict for many daysand has reached its verdict. The criminal justice system has functionedin the way that it was designed to do.'The truth - reinforced by the announcement of further trials - is thatat the moment the SFO is being forced to conduct political show trialsrather than trying to solve the serious problems of corporate fraud andillegal acts in the City and elsewhere.If there is trouble in prosecuting serious frauds, then creatinganother agency or removing the people in charge will not solve theproblem. The law is a mess. In its report of July 1993, the RoyalCommission on Criminal Justice said: 'Those giving evidence to us havesuggested that fraud trials would be simpler to determine if thesubstantive law of fraud were reformed. Apart from the common lawoffence of conspiracy to defraud, there is no specific offence of fraudin England and Wales, and fraudulent conduct has therefore to be boughtunder the ambit of various offences.'Pension law has been reformed as a result of the Maxwell trial - sonow, should the law on fraud.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FRAUD CASES UP 16% - VALUE BY 25%Fraud in central government has increased by 16% in the last year,according to the Treasury's own figures. The 1994-95 Fraud Report - ananalysis of reported fraud in government departments - the Treasuryrevealed that government departments reported a total of 408 cases ofdepartment staff fraud, an increase of 16% over 1993-94 and 35% over1992-93. The total sum involved was #2.12m compared with #1.69m in 1993-94 and #2.11m in 1992-93, although the report says that in a number ofcases the amount involved had not been identified or could not beassessed.The report was published in January 1996 just two months after the 1993-94 report (see The Fraud Report, November 1995) which was released onlyafter a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner under the Code ofPractice on open government. The Treasury refused to speculate on thegrowth of fraud in central government. It said: 'Whether the increasein the number of fraud cases reported reflects a real trend isimpossible to say. It may be that greater fraud awareness and betterfraud reporting procedures in departments leads to more cases beingreported. What is undeniable is that the risk of fraud is notdiminishing. Staff at all levels need to be alert to these risks.'Strangely out of the 58 central government bodies, including allgovernment departments, which submitted annual returns in 1994-95, 30of them - just over half - submitted a 'nil return' saying there hadbeen no cases of fraud.For further details turn to page 10.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996'CONCERTED ATTACK ON FRAUD IS REQUIRED,' CLAIMS AUDIT FACULTYMore concerted action by management, regulators, auditors and theGovernment is needed to fight fraud effectively, according to a bookletpublished by the Audit Faculty of the Institute of CharteredAccountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). Peter Williams reports on arecent initiative by accountants.In a new booklet, Taking Fraud Seriously, authors Tony Bingham ofCoopers & Lybrand, Ian Huntingdon of KPMG and Martyn Jones of ToucheRoss, wrote: 'Crime and crime prevention evolve together and there isno shortage of effective measures with which to counter the fraudster.The real challenge is not a technical but an attitudinal one, the willto make fraud prevention a priority.'The role of directors and managementA company can minimise the risk of fraud if directors and seniormanagers take a positive lead and set the tone from the top,communicating clearly that fraud, corruption and dishonesty is nottolerated. According to the booklet, directors and managers should seekto establish a clear anti-fraud culture by:- Leading from the top. Senior management must demonstrate commitmentto an anti-fraud culture and be seen to be subject to the sameprocedural guidelines and investigation as the rest of the work-force.- Implementing and communicating an anti-fraud policy, covering suchmatters as giving and receiving inducements, reporting channels,investigation of suspected fraud and dealing with perpetrators. Thereshould be a public pledge that allegations of fraud or other wrongdoing by employees or by a third party will be properly investigated;- Developing a fraud contingency plan, setting out what is done and bywhom in the event of the discovery of fraud.The booklet also calls for quoted companies to comment in their annualreport on their efforts to prevent fraud and, in particular, to discusstheir policies on the areas outlined above. This suggestion has beenopposed by some finance directors.Taking Fraud Seriously also discusses the role of non-executivedirectors suggesting that they should:- be alert to the risk of fraud in a business, particularly top levelmanagement fraud;- be satisfied that internal control measures are given the rightemphasis within the organisation;- be satisfied with the integrity of the organisation's public companyreporting;- establish open lines of communication with internal and externalauditors and be prepared to spend time discussing the auditor'sconcerns.The authors also call on directors to consider their wider publicduties when deciding whether to report alleged fraudsters to thepublic. At present, many directors feel it is in the best interests oftheir organisation not to report fraud to the police but to quietlydeal with the matter themselves, often leaving the fraudster to strikeagain.Reform of the lawAs well as calling for a change in attitude towards fraud, the authors - all of whom are auditors - suggest that legal changes are required.Alongside wider legal questions - such as an examination of the prosand cons of creating a legal responsibility for officers and employeesof public companies to report prima facie fraud to the police - thebooklet calls for enforcing and extending section 389A of the CompaniesAct 1985. This section gives auditors rights of access to the company'srecords and requires its officers to provide such explanations orinformation as the auditors need to perform their duties. It alsocontains the offence of misleading an auditor, which the report says isuseful but that it does not carry a stiff enough penalty to encourageprosecutors to use it.The report wants the maximum custodial sentence increased from twoyears to five, and for the offence to be extended to any employee andany organisation.The role of the regulatorsRegulators play a key part in the fight against corporate fraud.According to the report, they need to guard against two main dangers.First, increasing the length and complexity of their rule book imposesa burden on the majority of members with well-run business and, second,more complex legislation can damage the effectiveness of inspectionteams.Regulators could increase their effectiveness by:- reviewing their rule books to ensure emphasis on the prevention anddetection of management fraud rather than on minor offences- making greater effort to cooperate with overseas and internationalregulators- passing on important information promptly to auditors. The authorswant the law changed to impose a duty on regulators to tell auditorswhen a client is suspected of fraud. They say that auditors can oftenbe left in the dark about such suspicions. At the moment, auditors areunder a legal obligation to report their suspicions. Regulators haveopposed the opening up of a two-way street saying that, where possible,information is often already passed on.The Government's roleTaking Fraud Seriously calls on the Government to establish anindependent standing body - The Fraud Advisory Panel - withresponsibility for:- providing a forum for discussion and improved cooperation betweenGovernment, law enforcement, the private sector and other interestedparties;- increasing the overall awareness of the problem of fraud.The Panel's membership would be drawn from the legal and accountingprofessions, law enforcement, regulatory agencies, business andacademia.Secondly, the Government should designate a lead department for thecoordination of the its anti-fraud strategy. At the momentresponsibility for anti-fraud policy is scattered around variousWhitehall departments.Copies of Taking Fraud Seriously are available from Tracy Gray, TheAudit Faculty, The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &Wales, Chartered Accountants' Hall, PO Box 433, Moorgate Place, LondonEC2P 2BJ.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996FFIN WORKING FINE ON FRAUDMike Feltham, head of the London Stock Exchange surveillancedepartment, told the Taking Fraud Seriously conference (see opposite)that great efforts have been made to ensure that information isexchanged relating to any fraud or market abuse.He said that one of the ways the Stock Exchange passed on and receivedinformation was through membership of the Financial Fraud InformationNetwork (FFIN). Feltham said: 'FFIN was formed as a result of arecommendation in a study commissioned by HM Treasury, as part of aGovernment response to such cases as BCCI and Maxwell.'Supervisors, regulators, investigators, law enforcers and Governmentmeet on a regular basis to exchange information and pool knowledgeabout actual or suspected serious financial fraud.Feltham said: 'FFIN has around 20 members but its feeder contacts go alot wider. The primary objective is to provide a framework for poolingand disseminating information about financial fraud and other seriouscriminal activity which pass through, and make use of, the UK financialsystem.'FFIN has no operational responsibilities as these remain with theindividual members. He added: 'There are three stages in the fightagainst financial fraud: detection, investigation and enforcement.FFIN's role is to assist principally with detection but it also helpsthe transition of cases from the detection to the investigation stage.FFIN tries to put together the different pieces of a jigsaw spreadaround several players where the picture that emerges can be far moresignificant than the individual pieces taken in isolation.'Although each member has its own constitution and rules onconfidentiality there is normally a legitimate way in which to transmitinformation within the membership when the need arises. Feltham said:'To my mind, FFIN has already assisted the exchange by enabling it topass cases to the appropriate investigatory and prosecution agencies,which has resulted in action being taken which would not haveotherwise.'The London Stock Exchange and a number of other London regulators alsobelong to an international inter-market surveillance group, ISG, whichprovides a framework for the sharing of information and thecoordination of regulatory matters among market centres. Formed in1983, ISG now has 22 North American, European and Australasianorganisations with a common interest in fraud prevention. Feltham said:'Membership of ISG has assisted us in being able to track movements ofsecurity trading and has allowed us to produce a much more broaderpicture than was previously possible.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996FRAUD RISES ALONG WITH STANDARDSReported fraud has increased because expected standards of commercialbehaviour have risen, according to Ian Hay Davison, who was deputychairman and chief executive of Lloyd's from 1983-86. Davison said thattimes change: acts once condoned are now regarded as fraudulent.He said: 'That was the problem of the underwriters at Lloyd's: theyreally had no idea that the ways of their fathers are today regarded asnot only unacceptable but as criminal. When I started in the City, theprovision of undisclosed benefits in kind to directors, the use ofinsider information to deal before company news was made public, thedevelopment of schemes solely designed to avoid personal taxationrates, and what we would today regard as false or misleading accountingpractices, were rife. Year-by-year, case-by-case, statute-by-statute,standards have been raised and offences created.'But he added: 'Fraud is a serious problem. It has always been and thereis no point in raising standards if the new higher standards are notenforced. There can be no doubt that the enforcement of law in the areaof fraud has been and continues to be lamentable.'Davison also pointed to other reasons, such as more complex markets,greater opportunities through the abolition of exchange controls, agreater spread of wealth providing more smaller savers to be gulled,and especially the greater power of computers.He added: 'British white-collar crime has the quality that too oftenits perpetrators persistently refuse to concede that what they havedone is wrong. One attractive quality of the Chinese, as I found in myterm as chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Review Committee, was thatwhile culprits at Lloyd's if caught red-handed consistently failed toconcede the enormity of what they had done, the Chinese accepted thejustice of the prosecutor's actions.'Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE?The Government watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) (UK), hasexpressed concern over the need for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) (UK)to keep under review more effective arrangements to prevent and detectfraud. In this article Rachael Church looks at the lessons to belearned by the MoD and others.The MoD spends #23bn a year on the nation's behalf, including #9bn onprocurement, yet it reckons that it is relatively free from fraud andcorruption. It has identified only #22m possible fraud in 1993-94 - amere 0.1% of its total expenditure, and a much smaller figure than manyprivate-sector organisations.Three recent cases involving the corruption of former MoD officialsraises a number of issues of wider relevance, according to the PAC.Since November 1993, three individuals previously employed by theDepartment - Gordon Foxley, James Taylor and Bernard Trevelyan - havebeen convicted of receiving corrupt sums. The Foxley case is the mostsignificant of the three and concerns the receipt of corrupt paymentsfrom overseas contractors. The Department says that not all the corruptfunds in the Foxley case have yet been identified - although he wasconvicted of 12 offences totalling #1.36m. Much of the money is lockedaway in Swiss bank accounts. Despite civil action the PAC said: 'TheDepartment could not give us any grounds for hope that they wouldsucceed in gaining access to these accounts, but told us they wouldpursue every possible avenue.'Three overseas companies involved in the Foxley case have beenblacklisted, and the MoD is taking steps to recover the corruptpayments. It has demanded a public apology and a clear assurance thatthey will not involve themselves in corruption again, as well as moreonerous oversight arrangements if contracts are placed with them infuture.Rotating dutiesThe PAC says that the Foxley case illustrates the risks of fraud andcorruption where staff are in post for a long time and have influenceover contracts. The National Audit Office (NAO) identified cases wherestaff had been in post at the same location for over 12 years. The MoDsays that the Foxley case was exceptional in its longevity. It now hasa firm policy of moving staff every five years, but could not say thateveryone who had served in a post for five years would be moved. Inthese cases there was a balance between the benefit of long experienceand deep knowledge and the risk of someone knowing all the tricks ofthe trade and therefore increasing the risk of fraud.The MoD's vetting arrangements failed to identify Foxley's lavishlifestyle which included nine properties in England. The Departmentsaid Foxley had a good cover story that his wife was a medicalpractitioner 'who was known to have money in her background'. It is nowconsidering adopting vetting arrangements similar to those used fornational security purposes to identify individuals who present a fraudrisk.Gifts and hospitalityAs a result of the Foxley case, the Department's rules concerning theacceptance of gifts and hospitality have been strengthened, byproviding more specific guidance on their interpretation. It says thatlarge-scale, expensive and exclusive hospitality has now been largelyeliminated, and that hospitality books are now properly maintained andscrutinised. Rules have also been tightened where officials leave towork for defence contractors and the Department looks carefully atprecisely what individuals have been doing and who they have beendealing with - although it still considers this an area of potentialrisk. In the US there is a five-year blanket ban on such a switch, butthe MoD says that the UK would not be able to afford the loss of brainsthat might be transferred in to income-earning, export-earningactivities.The MoD has also set up a fraud unit, promulgated fraud indicators,runs fraud-awareness courses, and has a 'hotline', so that people canreport frauds anonymously.OTHER PROCUREMENT AREAS AT RISK..The scope for fraud is higher where control systems are lesscomprehensive or where changes in management arrangements have alteredthe circumstances in which the controls operate. In the MoD's caseareas identified by the NAO include:- computer systems- non-competitive contracts- local purchase units and- the control of assets held by contractors.As a result of NAO work, the MoD has drawn up an action plan to reducethe risk of fraud.Computer systems. The MoD increasingly relies on computer systems. Areview by the NAO of the payment systems at Liverpool had identified anumber of concerns which the MoD is addressing through risk assessment.Local purchase units. Around 400 local purchase units account for about#270m a year but the MoD acknowledges that it is harder to exercisecontrol over small local contracts than it is for large procurementcontracts. In some cases there was no separation of duties and theMoD's internal audit team visited fewer than 1% of them each year. Itplans to extend auditing in this area.Non-competitive contracting. In 'cost-plus' non-competitive contractsthe risk that costs may be overstated is obvious. The MoD says it hasreduced the level of non-competitive contracting and startedinitiatives such as 'No acceptable price, no contract' and the Equalityof Information Statement, which aims to reduce the risk of poor valuefor money, including fraud.Control of assets held by contractors. Government equipment and sparesare held by contractors to enable them to carry out repairs andmaintenance contracts. Controls in this area are often poor with oftenan absence of separation of duty, supervisory checks, stocktaking andexit-gate checks. The MoD's response is that less and less equipment isheld in this way so the risk should diminish over time.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996LOSING OUT IN THE NUMBERS GAME'Calling cards' allow calls to be made on the move.

The card's basic function is to allow a call to be placed, fromvirtually any telephone, and charged to the account holder for thatcard - ie a no-cash call. Billing may be to the user or, in a corporateenvironment, to a cost-centre manager responsible for the telecomsspending of a team of people. There are a number of flexible billingoptions available which vary by supplier.Calling cards offer a good means of cost control over telecoms spendingwhen users are away from home or office. Increasingly, such productsare being combined with payment cards as value-add features, AmericanExpress being a good example. This evolution is sure to continue,reducing the amount of plastic in the pocket and enhancing existingcard services. But increased usage means increased risk.No flights of fancyPicture this: you are on business in New York and about to catch aflight to Los Angeles from JFK International Airport, when a delay oftwo hours is announced because of bad weather. You decide to call theperson you are meeting to advise of your delay and find a suite ofpayphones nearby from which to call. From your pocket, you pull outyour calling card and lift the telephone handset. As you do so, you areaware of someone just behind and to the side of you, apparently waitingto use the phone. You dial the free access number which connects you tothe automated operator of the service you use. Following a prompt, youenter the card number, reading from the card in your hand. Followinganother prompt, you enter your secret PIN followed by the telephonenumber you are calling. As you enter these last digits, you notice thatthe person behind you moves off to use a telephone just a little downthe line. 'Hello Jim, it's Phil here - just calling to say I'll be alittle late ...' As you end your call and move back towards the coffeeshop, you see the person who was behind you with a group of others, allbusily scribbling away in a huddle.Three weeks later, back in London, your telecoms manager calls you andasks why your calling card bill is so large. 'Nonsense, I only used ita dozen or so times to call home and for business'. But on inspection,you find the normal #200 bill has risen to #10,000. Calls to Mexico,Columbia, Europe, the Far East and other destinations you know nothingof. Even more surprisingly, calls were made from other countries whileyou (and your card) were in the United States.Another victim of 'shoulder-surfing'The person behind you when you made that call at JFK was noting yourcard and PIN details. When he went to another payphone, he called hiscolleague in Amsterdam to test the card and pass on the numbers. Yourcard details were then put onto the Internet as part of a well-organised distribution network. What do they get out of it? A fewdollars per card number, free calls, and a few more dollars when theysell the numbers to others waiting around the payphones to make callsor obtain card numbers themselves.This is one of the less sophisticated methods of obtaining carddetails. High-powered binoculars, video equipment and sound-recordingdevices (useful when speaking your numbers to a human operator) haveall been used in similar environments.Similarly, there are risks when using calling cards from hotels orother businesses that use call-logging equipment. Card numbers may becaptured in soft or hard copy for reference by prying eyes. Callingcards might also be used for data transmission from portable PCequipment, in which case card details may be stored within. And what ofthat 'last number redial' button on the telephone you have just used?It is fortunate, however, that the UK has to date suffered relativelylittle from this type of fraud. The US remains the telecoms fraudcapital of the world, but trends in other countries are definitely onthe up. It makes sense, therefore, to take care when using a callingcard anywhere in the world, not just the US.Shopping around for securityMost telecoms providers are aware of the risks involved with calling-card products. As such, most have developed a degree of fraudprevention and detection within the product configuration, operationand call monitoring. Security features vary widely from operator tooperator and so it is worth exploring these with their agent during thesales process. It is also worth establishing who would be responsiblefor the bill should you be hit by fraud. On the whole, servicesuppliers in the UK are reasonably good at fraud detection and shouldbe able to contact you if fraud is suspected.The following checklist will help reduce the fraud risk. Take the timeto deliver these messages to appropriate personnel within yourorganisation; users, telecoms managers and those responsible for payingthe bills. It could help reduce the trauma, wasted time and possibleexpense of a fraud incident.PIN security- Once you have memorised the PIN, destroy the original PINnotification.- Avoid writing your PIN down. If you have to, note it so that it couldnot be identified as a PIN.- Never write the PIN on the calling card or anywhere that might beassociated with the card eg on any related literature.- Do not disclose your card number or PIN to anyone except the callingcard operator when you need to make a call. You will never be contactedand asked for your PIN (or password if one is used) by the servicesupplier.- If you think that someone might have noted your card and PIN numbers,contact the service supplier to change them immediately.- Avoid PINs (or passwords) that would be easy to guess - those runningsequentially (1234, 9876 etc) or with repeated digits (1111 etc). Alsoavoid obvious keypad sequences like 1397 (clockwise) or 2580 (down themiddle), and your year of birth.Card security- Never leave your calling card lying around. Treat it as you would acredit card.- If your card is lost or stolen, report it immediately to the servicesupplier - and always carry the supplier's emergency phone number.- To prevent others noting your card number, never use your card as aproof of identity.Usage precautions- Take appropriate precautions when using your card to avoid anyoneseeing the digits you dial (if using direct-dial via tone telephones)or overhearing the numbers you speak (if calling via the operator).Shielding the keypad from prying eyes will help significantly. Whenpassing your card details to the operator, make sure nobody iseavesdropping. It is perhaps worth cupping your hand over the telephonemouthpiece.- If using telephones that display the digits you enter, ensure thatthe numbers are not visible to others and that they are cleared afteruse. Numbers can be cleared by lifting the telephone handset after yourcalls are complete and entering a random digit. This will also helpavoid problems with the last number redial function available on manytelephones.- Some hotels or organisations use call-logging equipment to helpmanage or account for their telephone usage. These could record yourcalling card details which may then be visible to others. This onlyhappens if you direct-dial calls using a tone telephone connected tothe logger. This risk can be avoided by making calls via the callingcard operator or using a telephone not connected to the logger.- If using your card to make calls from a computer (eg datatransmissions), ensure that your computer is protected againstunauthorised access - your card details may be visible within thesystem. If possible, do not enter your PIN as a default setting - enterit manually for each call made.- Never loan your card unless you are prepared to pay for the callsmade (which may be a lot more than the ones you know of).Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996HOW FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS FACE GREATER LIABILITY EXPOSURERoger Parker, partner in the Commercial Litigation department of Citysolicitors Richards Butler, considers accountants' increasing liabilityexposure - and offers some remedies.The Fraud Report has referred in recent editions to surveys suggestingthat fraud is on the increase - or at least that detection rates are.The number of situations where forensic accountants are called in toassist companies results in greater liability exposure for theaccountant - albeit with greater fee income as well.This article summarises the basis of such liability exposure andhighlights certain practices which have led to a degree of concernabout risk-management techniques deployed by accountants. On the basisthat any litigation is symptomatic of a breakdown in communication thisshould interest companies as well as accountants.Common threadsA number of claims, across the professions, have common features:- Complexity. The more complex the case the more for the development ofproblems, be they caused by lack of appropriate communication,expertise, diligence or resource.- Late instruction. The forensic accountant will often be instructedafter a fraud has been committed. What is less understandable is ifthere is an instruction given unnecessarily late, as happens from timeto time. If there is belated instruction in pressurised circumstances aproper investigation is less likely to result.- Fiscal control. Proper financial control of any consultant isessential, but the thin line between budgetary control and imprudentmanagement should not be crossed.- Access to the client. For a company this tends to be less of aproblem because of the proximity of the in-house lawyer to client. Itcan be more of a problem where the client is further removed - forexample when the accountant is instructed by a solicitor. It is for theaccountant to ensure that he has all proper and necessary access to layclients and to those who may have direct access to materialinformation.- Trends. Increasingly, disgruntled clients are 'having a go' atprofessionals, sometimes because of their own deep pockets, sometimesbecause of their insurers. Also, it is increasingly common for thedissatisfied to seek to apportion responsibility. Somebody 'must' be toblame - a human reaction that many (particularly US) courts have over-indulged.Sorting out communicationOne of the fundamental principles of English and US contract law is therule that vague wording in a contract will generally be construedagainst the writer (contra proferentem). Not surprisingly therefore,professional liability cases in both jurisdictions have tended to giveclients the benefit of the doubt when liability is based onmisunderstanding. It is incumbent on the professional proactively toseek out areas where clients may not have sufficient understanding.This issue is the biggest single source of claims and is thereforeregularly of concern to professional firms. It is increasinglyimportant in complex fraud cases because:- Investigations can be labour intensive involving many hours. Hoursare money. The client will not necessarily be well-placed to assess thevolume of hours or the complexity of the task. That is why he or sheinstructs the accountant.- Explanation of the substance of the problem can be complex andresults may only come toward the end of an investigation. This meansthe patience of the client may be sorely tested as hours are spent andfees incurred with no result until completion. It can be harder infraud cases for clients to know whether their decision to invest isworthwhile. It may be even harder to explain to the client's commercialmanagement.Contracts as reference pointsClaims will sometimes be based on a retainer letter. The latter isunder-utilised. A perfectly adequate contract between client andprofessional on a major instruction can be contained within a couple ofpages. It should be the reference point for identifying responsibilityfor the purposes of both contract and negligence. Very few of the majorEnglish legal authorities revolve around the retainer letter becausenot enough attention has been given to defining the scope of servicesthat should be contained in it. More time has been spent in draftinglimitation clauses or costs schedules. There are important matters, butthere need not be an exclusion of the scope. This may seem a bit basic,but how often have you seen a professional spell out precisely what heor she is doing? What sources will the accountant be checking for signsof malpractice? When will the accountant cease to follow a line ofenquiry? What if that line would have produced the answer?The absence of at least a basic pointer to the scope of work isinconsistent with the practice adopted by a number of otherprofessionals. Part of the historical reason for this is linked to theabsence of fixed fee in certain investigatory work. A fixed fee tendsto lead to a fixed definition of what is to be done with theflexibility of additional services being provided upon request - for anadditional cost. An open-ended and potentially vague assignment is morelikely to lead to a vague brief. It is not suggested that vagueness canbe eliminated, but focus on the 'greyer' areas at least enables a moreaccurate assessment of where the parties' risk exposure is.Resisting negligenceIt is clear from recent leading authority in England that if theprofessional escapes liability in contract he or she may notnecessarily be so lucky in resisting a claim in negligence. To limitthe danger there should be, possibly to the advantage of both partiesto the arrangement, synonimity between contractual and tortuousobligations. This can be done simply, by a statement to the effect thatthe parties do not agree to there being any tortuous liability over andabove their contractual responsibilities as defined. What many will seeas unacceptable on policy grounds is the possibility of spending timeand money negotiating a retainer letter/contract only to find that someother, judicially imposed, criteria determines responsibility.ConclusionIt is easy with hindsight to apportion blame for conduct. It is not soeasy to think positively how to implement procedures to reduce the riskof dispute. Perhaps predictably, one answer is to do with training, inthe basics - communication skills, drafting and straight thinking ofwhat each party to the arrangement is expecting to achieve and how theyare going to achieve it.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996ADVANCE FEE AND PBI FRAUD - ALWAYS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUEAdvance fee and PBI fraud continues to be a dramatically successfulform of fraud, despite warnings issued in recent years by bodies suchas the Bank of England, the Law Society and the Federal Reserve. AndrewKeltie, a partner in Baker & McKenzie, London and a member of Baker &McKenzie's Civil Fraud Group, reports.With hindsight, advance fee and prime bank instrument (PBI) frauds seemso obviously dishonest that it is hard to understand how anyone couldbe deceived. But the combination of ostensibly authentic documentation,and the skillful use of psychology, has led to many sophisticatedbusiness people being defrauded of substantial sums. A recent exampleis the loss (and subsequent recovery) of more than #6m by the SalvationArmy in 1992. In May 1992 the Army had been persuaded to pay $10m to aBelgian bank for investment in 'prime bank instruments' which theSalvation Army was duped into believing could be bought as a discountand sold at a profit. In fact, PBIs do not exist and there is no marketin them, other than that conjured up by plausible fraudsters.Advance fee fraudThis involves tricking the victim into believing that participating ina transaction (the participation being dependent on payment of anadvance fee or 'commission') will give access to a low-interest orinterest-free loan, or the receipt of some other financial benefit. Theadvance fee is usually a small percentage of the finance apparentlybeing provided. It may be suggested that the source of the finance is'oil money', or that the funding is by means of a 'self-liquidatingloan'. Fraudsters will go to considerable lengths to compile a dossierof correspondence and legalistic documents, purportedly authenticatingthe availability of the funds and the credentials of the participants.This will often involve the use of headed notepaper obtained frombanks, accountants and firms of solicitors. The growth (and increasingacceptability) of fax documents means that genuine letterheads can beused to create bogus documents which are difficult to detect if sent byfax.Once the victim is persuaded of the genuine nature of the transaction,and the availability of low-cost or free finance, the next stage ispayment of the advance fee, often expressed to be the agent'scommission, the victim having been convinced that payment is the finalstage in obtaining the promised funds. In most cases as soon as it ispaid the fee will disappear along with the fraudster.Prime bank instrument fraudAdvance fee fraud is still committed but its more sophisticatedexponents have moved on to PBI fraud, which rests on the use of bogusfinancial instruments as being the source of the alleged loan orprofit.PBI fraud is based on the mythical existence of a secret market inwhich the world's largest ('prime') banks deal with each other, reapinghuge profits. The victim is enticed with a promise that he can share inthose profits, for a modest investment. PBIs are usually referred to as'prime bank guarantees', 'prime bank promissory notes (or paper)','master collateral commitments' or 'discounted standby letters ofcredit'.The story is that the 'prime' banks lend huge sums to each other allthe time, and that there is a market in PBIs which the victim will beable to tap into via a smaller bank at which the fraudster has acontact. Unsurprisingly, the smaller bank will often appear to beincorporated in Panama or Liechtenstein, and will rarely be found inany banker's almanac or directory.Although standby letters of credit do exist and are issued by banks,they are a form of collateral security or performance bond. They arenot negotiable and there is no market in them. Prime bank guarantees,prime bank notes and the like do not exist.A veneer of respectabilityBoth advance fee and PBI frauds are invariably dressed up with avariety of complicated legalistic (but incomprehensible) documentation,all of which the victim is solemnly asked to read carefully and sign.These usually include a confidentiality agreement and a 'certificate oforigin of funds', confirming that the victim's investment is of 'good,clean funds of non-criminal origin'.Another key feature is secrecy. It is frequently claimed that thesource of finance in advance fee fraud is the Middle East, because ofreligious restrictions on earning interest on loans; or that disclosureof the covert market in PBIs would lead to the market breaking down,because it would no longer be confined to the elite few. The realpurpose of such secrecy is, of course, to prevent or dissuade thevictim from carrying out any form of due diligence and to explain whythe victim cannot meet the lender. It can also make action to attemptto recover lost funds far more difficult.Other devices used to reassure a victim include:- returning a portion of the fee at the end of a week or month,representing it as a form of profit, the aim being to persuade thevictim that the investment is profitable, and to commit more funds- spurious references to organisations such as the World Bank, theUnited Nations, and the International Chamber of Commerce- the apparent involvement of professionals, particularly lawyers'client or trust accounts- supposed absolute security.It is often said that transactions are on a 'bank-to-bank' basis andthe investment is as secure as the bank itself. As in the SalvationArmy case, a common device is to persuade the investor to open anaccount at a foreign bank into which the profits to be earned from thetransaction will be paid. Before receiving any profit, however, theinvestor must pay sufficient funds into the account to show that he isin a position to participate in the investment - a so-called 'proof offunds' transaction. Although the account will purportedly be interest-bearing and under the control of the investor, fraudsters will ensurethat they have signing powers over the account to enable the funds tobe removed and normally routed quickly through several otherjurisdictions to make tracing and recovery more difficult.Providing powerful remediesThe English courts are able to provide powerful assistance to victims,such as orders which freeze asset and permit the search of premises,the seizure of incriminating evidence, and the disclosure ofinformation (and in many cases a combination of all of these elements).In addition, such frauds will invariably involve criminal offences andthe police in England and elsewhere now have considerable experience ininvestigating these frauds, although the international nature of mostof them can cause difficulties for the police in piecing togetherexactly what has happened.Awareness heightenedIncreasing awareness of advance fee and PBI frauds, particularly amongprofessionals responding to warnings from their professional orregulatory bodies, has helped to reduce some of the most blatantexamples. Another improvement has been the introduction of anti-moneylaundering legislation in many countries. However, it remains the casethat it is possible in some jurisdictions for corporations to beestablished and call themselves banks. And the ingenuity andimagination of sophisticated fraudsters has responded to the increasingchallenges posed to them by growing awareness and more rigorouslegislation. This type of fraud is still a real problem which continuesto claim victims.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996CURRENCY SCAM INVESTIGATORS WITH A YEN FOR KNOWLEDGEFarleigh Projects International, part of Group 4, specialises ininvestigating complex, organised fraud for clients which include largecorporates and Government organisations. Managing director John Davisand manager of investigations, Tony Ockmore - both former policemen -talk to Peter Williams about Farleigh's role in investigating thedollar-yen swap scam.International fraudsters have netted at least $250m and maybe as muchas $500m over the last four or five years in the dollar-yen scam. Thevictims of the fraud are rich individuals some of whom allegedlyobtained their millions in the first place through tax-evasion schemes.The fraudster persuaded wealthy individuals to give them this 'blackmoney' on the promise that it would produce fantastic results and wouldbe 'white money'. Farleigh knows of one individual who invested $25m inone tranche.The fraud is simple: investors are told that their dollars will be soldfor Japanese yen and then sold back again. The promised return on thisarbitrage was fantastic - from $4m to $8m over a four-week rollingperiod.The documentation produced by the fraudsters was of a very highstandard and the names of banks and brokers used for the transactionswere reputable and legitimate. But there was no dollar-yen swapprogramme - the money was simply stolen.Dubious provenance protected fraudsterThe fraudsters reckoned that many of the investors would not kick uptoo much of a fuss because of the dubious nature of the origins oftheir cash. Those that did protest were either given a first tranche ofa dividend or interest payment - stolen from other investors - or showna false statement of the profits to date. Others were dealt with moresimply - they were threatened.Farleigh Projects now believes that this scam has been closed down, butJohn Davis believes it has some important lessons for prosecutingauthorities, regulators and financial institutions. Farleigh becameinvolved when it was hired to trace funds and people by an Austrianbank which was being sued by some of those defrauded. One of itsmanagers was corrupted by the fraudsters and over a number of years hadprovided them with the banking and money transmission facilities theyneeded.This international scam started in the bank guarantee fraud in the late1980s and moved into the dollar-yen programme as a sort of naturalprogression in the early 1990s. The heat was put on the bank guaranteefraud and they had to find a new outlet. They saw this as the perfectfollow on and in many ways they were right. The fraudsters got awaywith so much for so long because different regulators and differentprosecuting authorities simply do not talk to or cooperate with eachother. Farleigh has managed to get authorities across Europe to talk toeach other, acting as a clearing house for information. It even had topersuade three state prosecutors in different parts of Germany to pooltheir knowledge.Farleigh also believes the fraud has shown up weaknesses in UKlegislation. Money which is invested on the currency market or on otherspot markets is not regulated by the Financial Services Act. TheSecurities and Investments Board is studying whether the FSA should beextended to cover these activities.Banks could do moreSome observers privately believe that criticism could also be levelledat banks which still seem to welcome accounts which receive vast sumsof money from peculiar sources without asking too many questions,although the banks would claim they have now tightened up considerablyfollowing the introduction of money laundering regulations.The other element that has made the fraud difficult to track down wasthe way in which it was organised. Although Farleigh believes it knowsthe prime mover in the fraud it was never masterminded in one place.Instead different pockets of copy-cat frauds sprang up all over theworld - three operated separately out of Germany through Austria intothe UK, and others were based in Australia, Spain, France, Sweden andSwitzerland. Farleigh proved that they were connected because they havetraced at least one money flow between the various differentoperations. Davis said: 'It is probably the most organised and biggestfraud that I have ever come across in my life. The way it split itselfup has caused the police and the prosecutors major problems.'Although not all of the alleged fraudsters involved are facing trial,one person has already been sentenced to seven years by a German court,two people are due to appear in court in the UK later this year, andseveral other people have been charged in Germany and Austria - one ofwhom committed suicide while in police custody.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996THE FRAUD REPORT STATISTICS PAGEThe analysis of fraud in Government departments places frauds intovarious categories - but in reality details are often complicated andmay cross boundaries, as this month's statistics show.As in the previous two years, the largest category of frauds reportedin 1994-95 is travel and subsistence. These 105 cases represented forover a quarter in volume but only 6% in value.The second largest category involves theft of assets such as officeequipment, protective clothing and building materials. The number ofcases represent 15% of the total, while the value of the assetsrepresent a quarter of the total monetary loss. One case accounted for#400,000. It involved the alleged theft of equipment due for sale ordisposal, by a staff member who is suspected of exploiting weaknessesin receipt and stock control procedures. Collusion with outsideaccomplices is suspected and investigations are continuing.Misappropriation of cash came to #832,500, 39% of the total value offrauds in the year. Two cases accounted for over half the loss in thiscategory. Enquiries are continuing in one case - value #298,000 - wherea new member of staff noticed irregularities in the accounts. Thesuspect was arrested following a suspected arson attack on the officecontaining the records in question. Cash books and other records wereallegedly found in the suspect's possession. A prosecution is pending.In one case the actual loss to the public funds is estimated at#41,000, whereas the gain to the perpetrators is believed to be between#600,000 and #700,000. Over a number of years an embassy officialallegedly exploited currency exchange rates by manipulating thedifference between the local official market exchange rate and theunofficial, parallel market rate, retaining the difference. The fraudwas carried out in collusion with a locally engaged accountant and theofficers are believed to have falsified embassy accounts by recordingonly the lower, official exchange rate. The official is also alleged tohave been responsible for rigging local building contracts. He was dueto be charged with theft, deception and corruption but committedsuicide while on police bail.The Treasury has warned departments to increase controls of access topersonal and sensitive data held on computer. It reports thatunauthorised staff access is on the increase.Overall, in 38% of the cases, perpetrators were prosecuted, or wereawaiting prosecution or had been dismissed without prosecution. In afurther 22% of cases, the perpetrators were subject to internaldisciplinary action ranging from a reduction in grade through to aformal reprimand. The lesser penalties were applied in cases such asmisuse of sick leave, official vehicle or telephones for personalcalls.WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FRAUDSTERS?The Government says that it takes all cases of fraud very seriously.Set out below is what actually happened to perpetrators of fraud in1994-95.Action                                                 No of casesProsecuted, resulting in custodial sentence                 41Prosecution, resulting in fine or probation                 18Prosecution pending                                         34Dismissed (without prosecution)                             63Downgraded                                                   6Loss of spine points and/or promotion bar for  specified period                                          24Formal reprimand                                            62Resignation, no further action                              28Disciplinary action pending                                 26Insufficient evidence to sustain disciplinary action        16Culprit not identified                                      42Cases still under investigation                             48Total                                                      408Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE FRAUD REPORT via NewsNetFebruary 1, 1996BY DEFINITION, A BIG PROBLEMThe rules concerning Government accounting requires departments to makean annual return to the Treasury of all cases of suspected or provenfraud - including attempted fraud - affecting their departmentsincluding their agencies, within the following categories:- Fraud perpetrated within the department by its own staff, includingthe theft of assets and cases of collusion outside the department.- Computer frauds, whether perpetrated by members of staff or membersof the public. A computer fraud is defined as one where IT equipmenthas been used to manipulate computer programs or data dishonestly (forexample to alter or substitute records; to destroy or suppress records;or to duplicate or create spurious records); or where the existence ofan IT system was a material factor in the perpetration of fraud (iewhere the fraud was unlikely to have occurred there had been no ITsystem.) Departments are also asked to report any cases involving thetheft or fraudulent use of computer time and resources.- Frauds by contractors arising in connection with contracts placed bydepartments for the supply of goods and services.- Any other frauds which reveal potentially significant systemweaknesses or exposures to loss of a nature which other departmentsmight face.Data is not collected on external frauds perpetrated upon departmentsby outside parties, such as tax or benefit frauds or those involvinggrants or subsidies. Nor does the report include frauds occurring innon-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).

It is revamping its existing productrange, expanding its distribution network and embarking on a majorrecruitment campaign that will result in the appointment of 20 businessdevelopment, client relationship and marketing executives to supplementits existing Luxembourg operation.At present Threadneedle's European activities are based primarilyaround the Global Assets Fund (GAF), a Luxembourg-domiciled Sicav with$500 million invested in 20 subfunds. This is distributed in Belgium,the Netherlands and the UK, although a small amount of business alsocomes from Germany.The European venture is the first significant business outcomefollowing BAT's decision to consolidate the fund management operationsof Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, its two life, pensions and investmentproducts subsidiaries, into a separate company in June 1994.Threadneedle currently has around #30 billion ($45 billion) of assetsunder management.The European thrust will initially be based around a revamped GAF,which was originally offered under the Eagle Star name. "We arerelaunching GAF in Belgium and the Netherlands during March 1996," saidAlan J Ainsworth, Threadneedle's managing director (retail). "Therelaunch will incorporate a number of significant changes. We shallalso be offering Belgian investors a new guaranteed equity Sicav."Threadneedle currently distributes GAF through two Belgian banks,Banque Commerciale Bruxelles and Bank Unie. It has recently signed athird - and as yet unnamed - bank distributor. In the Netherlands itrelies primarily on independent brokers for distribution, a distinctionwhich will be reflected in a new pricing structure for the relaunchedumbrella fund. IFAs, together with Eagle Star, have also been used inthe UK to market the fund, although Threadneedle hopes to focusincreasingly on direct media.The German market will be targeted later in 1996. "We have a major newproduct initiative for the German market," said Ainsworth. As in theNetherlands, Threadneedle currently relies on IFAs to distribute GAF.Other markets earmarked for development are Spain - where Threadneedlehopes to capitalise on its links with SAFEL, a Spanish retailinvestment group in which BAT owns part of the equity - and France.The new initiative is certainly well-timed. Global stockmarkets havebeen extremely buoyant during the first few weeks of 1996, and theomens for the rest of the year are propitious. The prospect of furtherdrops in interest rates and greater liquidity are expected to powermarkets upwards, and this should help boost demand for the product.In addition the relaunch is likely to benefit from the momentumachieved during 1995. "Last year we grew the Global Assets Fund byaround $100 million," said Ainsworth."We also added three newportfolios: a Latin American fund, a Japanese smaller companies fundand a global bond fund."Threadneedle has already made a number of key appointments to supportits European initiative. Robin Threadgold, previously at Fidelity, hasbeen made head of European Business. Tina Wilkinson joined the companyin January from Gartmore Indosuez in Paris to head European Marketing.Another major appointment is expected in the next few weeks.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

During January and February an estimated #12billion of household savings will be seeking a new home as the firstTax Exempt Special Savings Plans (TESSAs) mature. With interest ratesfalling and the UK stockmarket generating total returns of around 20percent in 1995, compared to around 6 percent on bank deposits, mutualfunds should be well placed to increase their share of the savingsmarket.So far there has been no shortage of new product announcements. Two ofthe largest players in the UK market - Perpetual and M&G - haveannounced their intention of launching two new low-cost investmenttrusts aimed firmly at the PEP market.M&G is launching M&G Equity Investment Trust, a split capitalinvestment trust offering a number of classes of share, in February. Aunique feature of this trust is that it will be completely load free,although at 1.25 percent the annual management fee is rather high andthis, on normal criteria, would pre-empt its sale to the non-PEPinvestor.On February 20, Perpetual will launch Perpetual Income and GrowthInvestment Trust plc. Managed by Neil Woodford, whose other funds haveenjoyed outstanding performance, the trust has a lower annualmanagement fee (0.75 percent per annum) than M&G but imposes a 0.5percent plus VAT charge for the PEP wrapper.Low costs are clearly seen as an important marketing tool by manycompanies. Fidelity has launched a range of four no-load funds,including an index tracker, clearly aimed at the PEP market.The Fidelity MoneyBuilder Index carries an annual management fee of 0.5percent, which briefly was second to only River & Mercantile in thelow-cost tracker fund stakes. One of its rivals, Legal & General,retaliated immediately by reducing the fees on its UK tracker toexactly the same level.Among other companies who have announced new product launches to cashin on the PEP season are Schroders, whose top performing UK GrowthInvestment Trust is issuing new shares, Hargreaves Landsdown (OptimumIncome & Growth Trust), Flemings and Jupiter Tyndall (Jupiter HighIncome Fund).Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

This will enable investors to track in asystematic way the performance of privatised companies on stock marketsaround the world.The index encapsulates around 175 different shares, and includes mostof the large privatisations initiated by way of initial public offersince 1980. Denominated in US dollars and weighted by marketcapitalisation, it will be added to as new privatisations occur.Calculated back to 1990, the index shows that over the medium termprivatisation shares have significantly out-performed marketsgenerally.Total privatisations in 1995 amounted to $73.2 billion, a recordaccording to Privatisation International, with at least 45 countriesengaged in active privatisation programmes. Total proceeds were about15 percent higher than in 1994 and were split equally between publicoffers and private sales to strategic investors.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Tony Shearer, thecompany's chief operating officer, resigned following "personalityclashes" with the managing director David Morgan. The failure toconsummate a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Dah Sing would appearto have sealed A J Oddie's fate. His post of business developmentofficer has been phased out, so precipitating his departure from thecompany.With events at Dunedin still fresh in the memory there is inevitablespeculation that these departures might be followed by others. There isalso mounting concern that these departures could be symptomatic ofmore wide-ranging problems at the company, which pioneered unit trustsin the UK and is the largest provider of general PEPs.Critics have pointed to the sharp fall-off in the company's investmentperformance. There is concern that M&G is increasingly being driven bymarketing as opposed to performance criteria.These claims are countered by assertions that recent market conditionshave not been conducive to the company's investment style, which isvalue-driven and focuses on small-to-medium-sized companies. Taken on amedium-term view M&G's is still above trend.Prudential Portfolio Managers (PPM) is searching for a new chiefexecutive following the departure of Hugh Jenkins, who retired on newyear's eve. Prudential, with more than #75 billion ($110 billion) ofassets under management, is one of the largest UK fund managers.Rodney Dennis, who currently manages PPM's UK and European operationsand chairs the company's asset allocation committee, will assumecontrol until a successor is found.It could be some time before a new appointment is made."We will takewhatever time is needed to ensure that the right candidate is selectedfor what is a vitally important job within the group," said aPrudential spokesman.Schroder's long-serving Ed Mercer, one of the pioneers of investment inJapan, is seeking pastures new at Atlantis Investment Managers.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightFUNDS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996WHO WILL BE NEXT IN THE UK FUND MANAGEMENT AUCTION?There was no shortage of M&A activity in UK fund management in 1995.Given the speculation and rumours surrounding the sector, the new yearcould generate substantial further activityTHE MOST intriguing - and longest running - saga in the UK fundmanagement industry concerns the future of Hill Samuel following themerger of its parent TSB Group with Lloyds Bank, which became effectiveon December 28.The long-term future of Hill Samuel, a UK-based merchant banking andasset management group, has been a subject of debate ever since it wasacquired by TSB shortly before the stockmarket crash of 1987.Encouraged by its new owners, Hill Samuel went on a commercialproperty-lending binge at the time the market broke. Bad debts were solarge that in 1992, TSB had to establish a special loans administrationunit to manage them. More significantly, Hill Samuel's debtscompromised the profitability of TSB Group during the early 1990s.Hill Samuel, however, has important and profitable fund managementinterests. Hill Samuel Asset Management and Financial Servicescurrently claims to manage #28 billion ($42 billion) from its Londonoffices and a further #10 billion in the US, where it has twosubsidiaries. It also trying to expand in the far east. Fund managementactivities contributed #21 million to group profits in 1994.These interests dwarf Lloyds's asset management activities. LloydsInvestment Managers, the bank's main asset management vehicle, only hasaround #12 billion of funds under management.Given the emphasis which Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman isallegedly placing on the sale of investment products within the bank,as well as improving earnings quality generally, both units should havea future within the enlarged group, although it is not beyond thebounds of possibility that the merchant banking interests will be soldoff. To all intents and purposes, Lloyds has exited from this sector ofthe banking market.Some commentators are not convinced, however. A former fund manager wasvery critical about Lloyds's stewardship of Lloyds Investment Managers."Lloyds Investment Managers was very profitable. It had to be to remainin the Lloyds Group," he told FI. "We were set a target ROE of 20percent which was only achieved by squeezing costs and investment. Ourperformance definitely suffered as a consequence."For the moment both investment groups will operate as separateentities, as will the other components of the TSB-Lloyds merger."Everything is in the melting pot. No decisions have yet been madeconcerning the future and structure of the group," said a Lloydsspokesman. A Hill Samuel spokesman was more cryptic. "We are constantlygetting enquiries about our future from the media. We just don't know."At the moment all options would appear to be open. The two fundmanagement groups could be combined to create a large integrated group.Alternatively, one of the units could be sold off. Given the length oftime taken to dispose of John Govett (see FI 14) and uncertainties overthe sale of Gartmore, the market for UK-based asset managers may nolonger be quite so buoyant.In the mean time, Hill Samuel Asset Management's chief executiveRichard Bernays has decided to leave the company. He is joining JupiterTyndall where he will replace Leonard Licht as vice chairman, followingthe latter's retirement. Jupiter Tyndall was acquired by Commerzbank in1995.Bernays will be replaced by Peter Axten. Axten, who is a former HillSamuel employee, is currently chief executive of LIM. For the moment,at least, it looks as if the merger option is being taken but, asusual, time will tell.Meanwhile there has been little progress made in resolving the futureof Gartmore, following Banque Indosuez's decision to sell its 75percent stake in the company. The bank released a statement in Januaryto confirm that the sale would still go ahead and that a number ofparties were still interested in acquiring the shares. There had beenspeculation that the sale could have been called off followingpersonnel changes at Indosuez.It is understood, however, that a number of potential purchasers, suchas BAT, NatWest and Prudential, are no longer interested in the companywhich is valued at around #370 million. Bankgesellschaft from Berlinand NationsBank from the US are apparently still interested.NationsBank already has what is essentially a call option on part ofGartmore's equity.Following the fall-out at Dunedin Fund Managers (see FI 12 and 13) Bankof Scotland, the company's majority shareholder, is rumoured to beready to put its stake onto the market. An announcement is expectedshortly. Before the management defections, Dunedin was thought to beworth around #100 million.As usual there is no shortage of potential purchasers. All the large UKfund managers are thought to be interested in the company. In practice,however, it may be difficult to bring the shares to market. DespiteStandard Life owning a significant proportion of the minority shares,as well as 34 percent of the Bank of Scotland, the investment trustsmanaged by Dunedin also retain significant holdings. This could yetconstitute an effective poisonous pill.One acquisition which has been completed was the purchase of CINManagement (CINMan) by Friends Provident, a UK mutual life company. Thepurchase will make Friends Provident the tenth-largest UK fund manager,with total funds under management of #32 billion."The acquisition will take Friends Provident quantum leaps forward toits long-term goal of becoming one of the small band of financialservices companies which will dominate the sector in the newmillennium," said its chief executive Michael Doerr.CINMan's main business focus is the management of the UK coalindustry's pension schemes. The sale of the company to a privateinstitution was almost a logical consequence of the UK government'sdecision to privatise the coal sector. CINMan currently has around #17billion under management.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Capital gains realised throughout 1996 on the saleof Sicav monetaires - or money market funds - will be exempted frominclusion in newly introduced tax allowances, provided the proceeds areinvested in residential property.Until the end of June capital gains will also be exempt from tax,provided that a minimum of Fr3,000 ($600) of the proceeds is spent onhousehold appliances and electrical goods. Penalty and tax regimes onother forms of long-term saving are also being changed to encouragegreater spending.These measures reflect the attempts being made by the government toreboot an ailing economy through boosting consumer spending. Withconfidence low about future prospects, consumers have been reluctant tospend. Whether the strategy works - much less results in an increase inexpenditure on French manufactured goods - remains to be seen.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

At present, German investment companies canonly offer custody services to purchasers of their funds. This cancause problems for investors who deal with several companies who mustopen - and pay fees on - several custody accounts. Some investors havecircumvented this by going to a Luxembourg-based bank, so helping toundermine German-based business. "The German investors who went toLuxembourg to get custody services would be able to think about comingback," said Manfred Laux, managing director of BVI. The change wouldalso open a new source of earnings for the fund companies.Greater opportunities for mutual funds to invest in liquid instruments,especially money market funds. The range of liquid assets in whichfunds can invest is still restricted to bank deposits, certificates ofdeposit and certain classes of short-term paper issued by public sectorinstitutions. The money-market fund sector, which has grown to aroundDM100 billion ($66 billion) in the 18 months since its introduction,offers an alternative with the same high degree of liquidity andyields.Equal rights for closed-end funds on depreciation, so that they canbenefit from the special depreciation rates available in easternGermany and real-estate markets. There would also be tax advantages forretail investors.Approval for open-ended real estate funds to purchase shares inproperty companies and thus invest more easily in non-Germanreal-estate markets. This would reflect a growing willingness on thepart of real estate companies to invest in the London and Netherlandsproperty markets, which offer relatively low currency risks and providebetter yields than the German market. This change would also allowGerman mutual funds to avoid higher taxes on foreign investment throughacquiring property holdings indirectly.Fixed-term equity funds, with guaranteed returns. One of the financeministry's objectives is to encourage share ownership by individuals inGermany. Fixed-term equity funds may encourage private investors toinvest in equities as part of a retirement savings plan. Banks havebegun to market equity funds for this purpose. Commerzbank, forexample, recently launched an advertising campaign which describedequity funds as the "fourth pillar" of an optimal retirement plan(after the state pension, company pension, and life assurance).Investment companies contend that the idea would be more attractive ifthere was a definite wind-up date and some form of guaranteed returns.Laux points out that fixed-term bond funds were an immediate successwhen they were introduced to the German market in 1985. "There appearsto be no pressing reason for the concept to be restricted to bondfunds," he said. "On the contrary, fixed equity funds would surely beappropriate vehicles in which to attract a large number of newinvestors because - given the right hedging instruments - the investorwill get at the very least his own investment back."Approval for funds to invest in OTC options. This is a prerequisite forfixed-term equity funds. "The indications are that OTC options will beallowed and thus we expect limited-term equity funds to come too," Lauxsaid.However, Laux is less optimistic about the prospects for a "generallicence" which would allow mutual funds to invest across the range ofderivatives. Under the current system, each type of derivativeinstrument has to be approved separately."The existing legislation is too inflexible and sometimesinappropriate, so that some of the more recent innovations are notcovered, thus frustrating the introduction of many interesting fundstructures," Laux said. "If new instruments have to be expresslysanctioned by law, then there is always the possibility of a long-timelag between their introduction and when they can by used by mutualfunds."But Laux has been told by the finance ministry that the "generallicence" will probably not be granted until the Fourth FinancialMarkets Promotion Act, which is due in about 1998. The same goes forthe BVI's final demand of approval for feeder funds. "I can't rule outthat feeder funds won't be passed until the Fourth Act, but they arenot our highest priority, he said. "I think the ministry wants to waitfor further discussion (of this) at European level. It doesn't want toanticipate European law."Nevertheless, Laux is not unhappy with the results achieved from hislobbying efforts. "We know that the Finance Ministry has problemsbecause of a lack of qualified personnel. You can't get everything doneat once."The BVI chief is in no doubt about Bonn's"strong political will to helpGermany become one of Europe's leading investment centres. The FinanceMinistry is going to great lengths to promote Germany as a financialmarketplace," he said.Though German investment companies are already creating new products inanticipation of the new legislation, delays are likely. The ThirdFinancial Promotion Act will also encapsulate EU directives onsecurities and bank capital adequacy, and they must be implemented bythe end of the year if Germany is to avoid sanction.Moreover, securities and capital adequacy take priority at the financeministry as well as with the regulators. So while the Third Act will bepassed in the autumn, the sections relating to mutual funds willprobably not reach the statute book until the spring of 1997.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The firm will launch five newinternational equity funds this quarter, which it will market to bothUS and European investors. It will also introduce a convertiblecurrency product for its three off-shore money market funds, which areprimarily marketed to institutions in Europe.The eleventh-largest US fund provider, with some $65 billion in totalassets in over 250 funds, Federated now has just under $400 million ininternational assets. In the last five years, international assets havegrown from 1 percent to 5 percent at Federated, but the firm hopes thatfigure will move to 20 percent by the end of the decade.Given the recent US boom in international investing, and the imperativeof diversification, Federated sees its new global push as a necessarystep toward its goal of controlling 5 percent of the $3 trillion to $4trillion US fund industry by the year 2000. At the end of November,Federated had $63.8 billion in assets, or 2.3 percent of the $2.78trillion US fund market, according to the Investment Company Institutein Washington.Federated now manages two international funds and a global utilityfund, but in December, Federated registered five equity funds with theUS Securities and Exchange Commission. It expects them to be approvedby February. The new funds include a European growth fund, anAsia-Pacific growth fund, a Latin America growth fund, an emergingmarkets fund and an international small company fund. The new productswill bring Federated's total global offerings to eight and itsinternational equity funds to six.Last April, Federated created a new unit, Federated Global ResearchCorp., in New York, under the direction of international fund pioneerHenry Frantzen. Frantzen, 52, who brings 25 years' experience ininternational fund investing to Federated, previously worked for BrownBrothers Harriman, Oppenheimer Management and Yamaichi CapitalManagement.Frantzen began his money management career in 1971 at the $30 billionCollege Retirement Equities Fund (CREF). He built CREF's internationaldepartment from scratch, increasing the fund's international assets to$6 billion between 1978 and 1987. During that period, he achievedannual returns of nearly 23 percent, beating the Lipper internationalfund average by almost 3 percentage points.At Federated Global, Frantzen received a mandate to recruit a "dreamteam" of international managers. The idea was to create an investmentmanagement capability that could launch and manage any and allinternational funds demanded by Federated clients.In September, the new unit began by replacing Fiduciary Trust asadviser for Federated's International Fund, which had $196 million inassets under management at the end of 1995. (Federated also manages anInternational Income Fund with $184 million and a Global Utility Fundwith $11 million in international assets.)In the seven months following Federated Global's launch last April,Frantzen hired 25 staff for his New York office, including 12 portfoliomanagers, several coming from CREF.To give his new team full international flexibility, Frantzen hasorganised Federated Global along lines of geographic specialisation:for Asia and Latin America, Federated Global hired Alexandre deBethman, 33, away from CREF; Mark Kopinski, 39, from Twentieth CenturyMutual Funds for Asia Pacific investing; Frank Semack, 43, from OmegaAdvisors for European equities; John Kowit, 50, from John HancockAdvisors for international fixed-income securities; Tracy Stouffer fromCREF for small-mid cap international equities; and Jolanta Wysocka fromParametric Portfolio Associates/PIMCO Advisors LP for emerging marketsecurities.Given the collapse of the peso in late 1994, early 1995 might haveseemed like an inappropriate time to launch Federated Global in NewYork. But nine months later, following an excellent year on the USstock market and two lacklustre years for international equities, USinvestors are looking overseas for investment opportunities, andFrantzen believes he is launching his new line of international equityproducts at just the right time."The general overlay for the entire investment world today is lowinflation, particularly in Latin America," Frantzen explained. "Thetrend is being driven by the entry into the world market of 900 millionIndians who have become capitalists and 1.2 billion Chinese. Theopening of Russia and its extraordinary natural resources is anotherfactor."Frantzen's enthusiasm is so global that he is hard-pressed to isolateparticularly promising regional investing opportunities for 1996. LatinAmerica looks very good, with inflation down from 428 percent in 1993to an estimated 33 percent in 1995 and a projected 19 percent in 1996.The regional as a whole is reaping the rewards of democratisation andthe continuing reduction of import barriers. Brazil's import tariffsfell from 70 percent in 1989 to 14 percent in 1995, for example."In Latin America, we believe the markets are presenting us exactlywith a buying opportunity," Frantzen declared. He expects LatinAmerica's two recessionary economies, Mexico and Argentina, to recoverby 1997. He also projects regional GDP growth at over 4 percent in1997, up from an estimated 1996 figure of 1.3 percent.In the Asia Pacific region, Frantzen foresees a major turnaround forJapan, which has suffered four consecutive years of falling earnings.But he projects these to increase by 75 percent in the fiscal yearending in March 1996, and another 50 percent in the following fiscalyear. One of the first investment decisions Frantzen made when he tookcontrol of the Federated International Equity Fund in September was toshift its weighting of Japanese stocks from 18 percent to 37 percent.Following several poor years, Frantzen believes that Asian stocks arenow relatively cheaply priced. Growth and savings rates remainextremely robust, and continuing deregulation "in almost every country"augurs very well for the region as a whole. But Frantzen stressedthat"we have a healthy scepticism of some of the numbers you see comingout of China, although it is certainly a big growth area". Frantzenexpects to place major investments in India, where Federated has notplaced money so far.Frantzen is also bullish on the European Union, where he thinks fallinginterest rates, relatively high unemployment and low inflation, willdrive growth in the coming phase. He appears less enthusiastic abouteastern Europe and the Russian Federation, at least in the short term,however.In the US, Federated will market its five new equity offerings throughits traditional client network of broker dealers and other financialintermediaries. The company has no direct marketing arm and reliessolely on its client network for sales. The firm will pursue a similarstrategy in Europe, where it will push its international equityproducts, and particularly its Latin American investment expertise, asEuropean institutions generally view Latin America as the strong suitof US international managers.While it sees equity investing, especially in the context ofdefined-contribution savings plans, as the biggest long-termopportunity in Europe, Federated will also stress its convertibledollar money market products.In 1987, Federated registered two dollar-denominated money funds in theCayman Islands, and then redomiciled them in Dublin, after itestablished an office there in 1990. It has now registered three moneymarket funds (with $300 million in assets) and two long-term bond funds($100 million), all dollar-denominated, in Dublin, which it sees as aless expensive and more flexible regulated operating environment thanLuxembourg. Federated has outsourced custody and administration to Bankof New York's Dublin operation, which has a funds servicing jointventure with Allied Irish Bank.This year, Federated hopes to launch a currency product, which willconvert its dollar-denominated money market funds into 22 differentcurrencies, with State Street Boston handling currency swaps for thefunds.US-managed money market products are particularly attractive to largeEuropean banks, big US custodian institutions and US multinationalcorporations in Europe, given the growing demands for money marketinstruments in Germany and the UK, and the lack of fully liquidcommercial paper markets in those countries. Federated now offersinstitutions in Germany, for example, an additional 1.25 points ofyield over prevailing interbank rates.Federated's convertible approach differs from that of FidelityInvestments, which recently launched three money market funds inEurope, denominated separately in dollars, pounds sterling anddeutschmarks. Federated believes that its approach offers far greaterflexibility in the 15 European Union markets, combined with advantagesof scale.As in the US, Federated will rely solely on financial intermediariesfor its retail products. The firm cited the example of Fidelity, whichattempted to market its funds directly in France in 1988, and thenrelaunched its funds marketing through a wholesale distributionstrategy last year.In France, Federated is targeting large domestic banks, which stillcontrol some 50 percent of retail funds distribution, as well asbrokers and insurance firms. In 1994, Federated began to advertise in arange of French and international financial publications, includingGlobal Investor, La Tribune des Fosses, and Le Figaro.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

State Street will replace Brown Brothers Harriman,which had been Magellan's custodian since the fund's inception in 1963.State Street had previously administered four small Fidelity funds withtotal assets of some $4 billion. The bank's custody clients alsoinclude Alliance Capital, Merrill Lynch, GT Capital and Invesco.The addition of the largest US equity fund could provide State Streetwith up to $10 million in additional fee revenue, where the bankcharges two basis points on assets under custody. The bank is alreadythe world's largest fund custodian with some $2.3 trillion in assetsunder custody at the end of 1995, up 32 percent from the previous year.(Assets under management in 1995 stood at $226 billion, up 41 percentfrom 1994.) State Street reported total 1995 fee revenue of $297million, or 73 percent of total revenues.In late December, State Street announced the formation of a new custodyunit, which will unite all of the bank's custody operations, includingline and support areas and State Street's corporate systems andtechnology group. The unit will be run by David Spina, whom StateStreet promoted to president and chief operating officer in December.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Analysts said the firm couldfetch up to $1 billion.In late 1992, Clayton Dubilier bought Van Kampen Merritt of Chicagofrom Xerox for $415 million, and later merged the asset manager withAmerican Capital Management & Research, which it bought in mid-1994from Travelers for $430 million. The combination of the two groups,which sell their funds only through broker-dealers, was intended tocomplement Van Kampen's bond-heavy product line with American Capital'sstock funds.But the combined assets of the two firms have lost market share,falling from 1.52 percent of the US funds market to 1.37 percent in thetwo years ending in the third quarter of 1995, according to FinancialResearch Corp. in Chicago. While Van Kampen's municipal bond specialityhas lost its appeal due to the global bond correction in 1993 and morerecent expectations of US tax reform, American Capital's equityofferings have failed to post the high returns that attractperformance-hungry US investors.Meanwhile, star manager Michael Price has also hired Goldman Sachs forthe purpose of selling his money management firm, Heine Securities ofShort Hills New Jersey, which owns the $13 billion Mutual Series fundgroup. Heine, whose accumulation of Chase Manhattan stock in early 1995pushed the bank to merge with Chemical Banking last year, wants to sellout so that he can"personally rattle the cages of stodgy companies",according to sources quoted in Business Week in early January.But Price's investment savvy is seen as Mutual Series's greateststrength, and some investment bankers believe his fund group couldfetch $400 million if he continues to manage its assets -as much asdouble the price Heine Securities might get if he leaves.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

StateStreet's cross-town 401(k) rival Fidelity Investments launched anin-house employee benefits unit early in 1995.Whereas defined-contribution pension plans allow corporate clients todispense with investment risk and all pension servicing duties, "totalbenefits outsourcing" allows them to dispense with health insuranceadministration and other employee services. Employees and retirees ofcorporations using such a service receive convenient and integratedservice through a single toll-free telephone number.Through its new venture with Watson Wyatt, State Street hopes toattract more corporate pension clients and fend off the competition ofinsurance firms who are leveraging their mutual fund and 401(k)operations with integrated health insurance services.Watson Wyatt has been in the benefits outsourcing business since 1991and now serves some 3 million employees from US firms such as Nynex,Rockwell International and Westinghouse. The alliance will also allowState Street to enter the benefits outsourcing business with a fullbenefits technology infrastructure in place.State Street is now the third-largest 401(k) provider in the US, aftermutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard Group (which together accountfor some 20 percent of the entire US defined-contribution pensionmarket). According to Cerulli Associates in Boston, State Streetmanaged $28.2 billion in 401(k) assets at the end of the third quarterof 1995, or 4.7 percent of the total market.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Investors who wish to follow GIT's portfoliopostings can access the firm's home page on the World Wide Web athttp://www.gitfunds.com.At present, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requiresfund companies to disclose their full portfolios only twice a year. Theagency also requires all funds to report daily changes in their netasset value, meaning that they must already calculate the value oftheir portfolios on a daily basis.But the SEC is now considering a proposal to require money market fundsto disclose their holdings quarterly, and has asked for industrycomment on whether more frequent portfolio disclosure would helpinvestors. The advantages of more frequent portfolio disclosure werehighlighted in early December, when managers of Fidelity's flagshipMagellan fund were caught publicly praising securities they were in theprocess of selling.The Investment Company Institute (ICI), a funds trade group inWashington, has opposed further disclosure on the grounds that it wouldharm shareholders by adding a needless expense to fund management andwould reveal trading strategies to competitors. The ICI believes dailydisclosure would be especially burdensome for large fund families andwould hurt firms that must make big trades over a number of days toavoid market turbulence.Some fund executives have argued that GIT's daily disclosure policy isrelatively easy for a small firm, and serves primarily as a marketingtool for attracting investor interest.But GIT executive vice-president Charles Tennes responded that dailydisclosure serves the interests of his firm's shareholders by allowingthem to scrutinise the company's statements and strategies more closelyby evaluating them against its managers' market moves. Tennes also saidcompetitors cannot take advantage of disclosures of trades made theprevious day.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Itis being marketed to Japanese institutions and individual investors byNomura Securities, which raised $400 million for the fund before theinitial offer period closed on December 20.Fidelity said that over the next several years, it plans to launch avariety of new Japanese investment trusts with different investmentobjectives.Fidelity's new investment trust will seek to achieve long-term capitalgrowth, using a bottom-up investment style. The fund's prospectusrequires that 65 percent of assets be invested in Japanese equities.Fidelity named Shigeki Makino, who has managed the US-based FidelityJapan Fund since 1994, as the manager of the new investment trust.Fidelity is positioning the new fund as a long-term investment vehicleand has given it an unusual structure: the fund will be closed for thefirst year, and will impose a 1 percent fee on redemptions in thesecond and third years.Fidelity is the second US firm to receive a Japanese investment trustlicence, following Morgan Stanley, which got its licence in October andplans to launch a Japanese investment trust shortly. In addition, fournon-US foreign firms - SBC Warburg, Jardine Fleming, Schroders andInvesco - have received licences and launched Japanese investmenttrusts.The new launches come at a time when Japanese investors are beginningto look to foreign firms for superior investment returns, given therelatively poor performance of domestically managed funds. But theJapanese market presents foreign fund providers with some distributionchallenges.Investment trusts are sold in Japan only on commission bybroker-dealers, a highly concentrated channel that forces foreign fundsto compete with the house products of distributors.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

For one smallnew investment partnership, however, falling markets have provided newopportunities. Noel Fung reportsVALUE PARTNERS may be just a small Hong Kong-based fund managementboutique. But it beat the rest of the pack by grabbing the award forbest performing Hong Kong equity manager last year.It managed to lose less money than its competitors in 1994, probablythe worst year experienced by the Hong Kong market since 1982.According to Micropal, its flagship "A" fund fell by 11.9 percentcompared with the 30 percent sustained by the "average" fund managerand the 31 percent fall experienced by the Hang Seng Index.Value Partners has a single mission - value investing in Asia andespecially in Hong Kong. The key to its performance to date has been tobe unconventional. "We typically invest in weird and unpopular stockswhich people despise," said Cheah Cheng Hye, Value Partners's managingdirector.It considers itself an investment company which uses a distinctbottom-up approach to identify undervalued companies rather than simplyfollowing overall market trends.Indeed Value Partners sees itself as something of an investmentpawnshop, soaking up stocks which sellers are desperate to dump. Sharesare sometimes disposed of almost discriminately by "top-down" and"momentum" players desperate to exit the market at almost any price.Value Partners will be only too happy to buy these stocks at bargainbasement prices and wait for the recovery, both in earnings and fromthe recovery of stock prices.Cheah Cheng Hye, a former financial journalist, has also been the Asiahead of research for Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank now ownedby Deutsche Bank. He quit the bank early in 1993 to establish a fundmanagement company with Yeh V-Nee, an executive director of Hsin ChongInternational, a Hong Kong-listed construction company. Value Partnerswas the result.The ownership of the company is split three ways between Cheah ChengHye, Yeh V-Nee and Holding Capital Group, a US-based associationcomprised of businessmen, professionals and corporations, with officesin New York and Florida.Currently Value Partners operates with just six staff, including Cheahand two analysts. "We rely exclusively on our own research to generatestock selections," said Cheah. It searches for "bombed out stocks",that is stocks where all the bad news has been fully discounted by themarket.Investors in the "A" fund are typically US and Switzerland-basedinvestment professionals. The minimum investment is $100,000. To datethe fund has $32 million under management.In addition to the "A" fund, Value Partners manages a number ofsegregated portfolios for institutional investors and high net worthindividuals mainly drawn from the US.The company's non-conformist style runs further than stockpicking,however. Its own capital is also invested in the"A" fund. If itsclients lose, it will lose twice over. Not only will its fees - whichare performance-related - suffer. It will also lose its own capital.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Jean Claude Broustra reportsTHOUGH 1995 was not the most auspicious year for French fund managers,this did not prevent Cortal, a bank, brokerage and investment housewhich distributes exclusively through direct media, from making furtherprogress.During the course of the year it increased funds under management byFr1.1 billion ($220 million) to Fr17.5 billion, as well as expandingits customer base. At the end of 1995 it was servicing 171,000customers, a 10 percent increase on the previous year. Of this total136,000 were "exclusive" to Cortal. The remainder were introduced byits business partners elsewhere within the Paribas and CompagnieBancaire groups, which it is part of.Cortal's vigorous expansion over the last 18 months is mainly due tothe speed at which it has espoused discount broking, still something ofa novelty within the French market. Its discount broking service, or"Centrale des Placements", which was introduced in mid-1994, enablesCortal customers to buy directly any shares or bonds listed on theParis stock exchange. They can also purchase Sicavs (open-end funds)managed by any French bank, insurance company or investment house.Overall, dealing costs and commissions are substantially lower thanthose offered by conventional brokers.The remarkable success of the Centrale des Placements shows a cleardemand for this type of facility. In just a year, the volume of fundsCortal manages through this service almost doubled and now accounts forFr2.6 billion in total. Of this Fr1.8 billion emanates from securities(shares and bonds), and Fr0.8 billion from Sicavs managed by otherasset management institutions.But the true extent of Centrale des Placements's popularity isillustrated by the fact that it currently accounts for almost 70percent of all new investments purchased through Cortal. 0f these thevast majority are for stocks and shares. These account for 50 percentof the 70 percent. The remainder come from external Sicavs.The main reason for the success of discount brokerage is its fee andcommission structure. Unlike other bank brokerage operations such asCredit Lyonnais (Fr63) and Societe Generale (Fr108), Centrale desPlacements doesn't impose a fixed minimum brokerage charge. Althoughthe minimum fee per order charged by Cortal (Fr46) is higher than thatof Societe Generale (Fr30) - though still lower than that of CreditLyonnais (Fr52.28) - commission rates (exclusive of tax) areconsiderably less at Cortal, especially where large transactions areinvolved.Societe Generale charges a standard 1.3 percent on all transactions,with Credit Lyonnais charging 1.22 percent for transactions belowFr10,000, and 1.01 percent for anything above this figure. Cortal'scustomers have to pay 1.15 percent on transactions up to Fr100,000,0.75 percent on the part between Fr100,000 and Fr500,000, and only 0.1percent on anything above this. This "sliding" fee scale was introducedquite recently to attract big clients.Custody fees are also lower at Cortal than at other brokerages. Theannual fixed commission per stock (including tax) is Fr38.18 at SocieteGenerale, Fr33.56 at Credit Lyonnais, but only Fr15 at Cortal. SocieteGenerale charges commission of just over 0.2 percent (including tax) onthe value of each portfolio held and Credit Lyonnais 0.19 percent.Cortal only charges 0.15 percent.In addition to the Centrale des Placements, Cortal offers its customersa range of other investment services. These include Sicavs, managed onits behalf by Credit du Nord, by Cardif, another Paribas subsidiary,and by Paribas itself.Cortal offers a range of fund money market, bond and equity Sicavswhich incorporate the entire maturity spectrum: short-term (investmentsof less than two years); medium-term (between three and five years);and long-term (more than five years).Short-term consists of: the Compte Optimal and the Compte a Terme.Medium-term consists of: Obligations Convertibles, France Rendement,Mone 40, Interets Trimestries, Eurocap, France 40, Parfrance andObjectif Monde. Long-term consists of: Cortal Pierre, CortalCapitalisation, Cortal Croissance Garantie and Contrat Majeur.Among the new services which Cortal has introduced to its customerssince is Service Optimal Placements. This keeps customers informed,through diagrams, graphs and pie charts, about the composition andperformance of their investment portfolios. The system used is known asthe "tableau de bord de l'epargne". It also provides customers withexpert personal advice, a regular assessment of the performance oftheir Sicavs, and advice about establishing a personalised savings andinvestment strategy of their own.Another service called Contrat Majeur Independant Retraite, which alsodates from 1994, is targeted at members of the liberal professions andother groups to build up a complementary tax-free retirement pensionwithin the framework of the Madelin law on social protection.A third, known as the Compte a Terme Cortal, which was launched in1995, offers guaranteed returns to investors. The return becomesprogressively higher in proportion to the size of the investment andthe length of time it is held for.At its inception the Compte a Terme entitled the holders to a taxallowance of Fr8,000. This has been withdrawn for 1996, but investorsstill benefit from a more favourable tax regime. Nonetheless, withinterest rates beginning to fall in France, this option is lessattractive than before.The most recent product launch was France Rendement, a Sicav thatinvests exclusively in French government securities. It replaced asimilar product called Rendement Trimestriel. A major differencebetween this and the new product is that Rendement Trimestriel providedonly one distribution option - a straightforward payment of dividends.The new product allows dividends to be reinvested or capitalised.Cortal also has operations in France and Luxembourg. Cortal BankLuxembourg is a subsidiary of the Cortal and Paribas Luxembourg banks.It was established two years ago and offers a wide range of investmentproducts. Its main service is the Compte Optimal International. Thisoffers deposit accounts in a variety of currencies, and personalisedportfolio management.Since 1992, Cortal has also had a 49 percent minority share in theCortal Bank Belgium. This also offers a wide range of investment andfinancial services at very low prices. The majority shareholder isParibas.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightFUNDS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996WHY VALUE BEATS GROWTHFund managers seeking consistent above-average returns should adopt avalue-focused investment strategy, according to research carried out byDavid Umstead of Boston International Advisors. Ian Orton reportsTHE RELATIVE merits of value and growth-orientated investment styleshave generated considerable debate among both academics andprofessionals. For the moment, at least, it would appear thatproponents of the value-orientated school would appear to hold theadvantage, especially in the US.Apart from the impressionistic evidence provided by well-known valueinvestors such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch, there is also asubstantial body of statistical evidence to confirm the view that avalue strategy will outperform a growth-orientated strategy over themedium to long term. The value-growth spread associated with the S&P500 index, for example, has averaged 320 basis points per year over thelast 20 years.According to David Umstead, managing director of Boston InternationalAdvisors, similar results can be obtained in non-US markets. He hasdeveloped a set of value and growth indices for 20 equity markets inEurope and the Pacific Rim and tracked their performance over theperiod 1974 to 1994. The system is known as the BIA Europe/PacificValue, Growth and Market Indexes.The results, which he presented at the recent Global InvestmentManagement '95 Conference, are emphatic. "A dollar invested in the BIAEurope/Pacific Value Index on December 31 1974 would have grown to$24.96 by December 31 1994 - an unhedged annualised rate of return of17.5 per year over the 20-year period. By contrast, a dollar investedin the BIA Europe/Pacific Growth Index grew to only $11.11, an averagereturn of 12.8 percent. The value index outperforms the growth index byan average of 470 basis points per year. Furthermore the spread isquite consistent."Examining the year-by-year performance of the two indices, Umsteadfound that the value index outperformed the growth index in 16 yearsout of 20 and produced lower volatility. The value index standarddeviation is 17.61 percent compared with 18.14 for the growth index.The largest positive value-growth spread is 17.22 percentage points in1988, and the largest negative is 7.13 points in 1980. The other yearswith negative spreads occurred in 1984, 1986 and 1991. There is noobvious pattern to the negative spread years. One occurred in a yearwith phenomenal returns (1986), two in average years (1980 and 1991)and one in a below-average year (1984).To provide greater insight, Umstead has divided the geographicalcomponents of his indices into three sub-groups: Europe; Japan; andPacific-ex-Japan. He found that the value-growth spread is quiteuncorrelated from region to region. Value-growth spreads are, howevermuch greater in Japan and the Pacific than in Europe.The end value of 3.77 for Japan meant that the value half of theJapanese market outperformed the growth half by nearly four to one. Thevalue half of the Japanese market delivered a return of 20.2 percent ayear over the last 20 years, compared with 12.5 percent achieved by thegrowth half.Umstead has identified five reasons why value beats growth. The firsttwo are consistent with rational behaviour and simply maintain thatinvestors may be concerned with attributes other than pre-tax risk andreturn."1. Value stocks have an inferior tax status. Because of this, taxableinvestors demand a higher return for value stocks.2. Value stocks have an inferior comfort-level. This also leads to theneed for value stocks to offer a higher return."The last three relate to various types of behavioural errors which stemfrom the fact that value stocks tend to be from companies with weakbalance sheets and income statements. "3. This leads to pessimisticextrapolations of future earnings and dividends which in turn leads topleasant earnings surprises.4. The weak financial statements also lead to the conclusion that thecompany is a bad company and therefore the stock is a bad investment.This in turn also leads to pleasant surprises.5. And finally this real financial record makes value stocks much moresusceptible to Monday morning quarterbacking, It is more difficult toexternalise blame if value stocks perform poorly."But how do active investors identify value stocks? Umstead uses anextremely straightforward approach when it comes to constructing hisindices. The key variables are the price-to-book ratio and marketcapitalisation. Companies are ranked in ascending price-to-book ratiountil their combined capitalisation amounts to half of total marketcapitalisation. These are value stocks. The remainder are growthstocks. The process is repeated annually and the indices arereconstructed accordingly.Within the BIA Europe/Pacific Indices, countries arecapitalisation-weighted, as are the stocks within countries.Rolling five-year performance of the BIA Europe/Pacific Value andEurope/Pacific Growth Indexes.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightFUNDS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INDIA BECKONSIndia is becoming increasingly popular as a destination for both directand portfolio investment. Dr Shanta Acharya reviews the government'sprogress in making the country more investor-friendlyTHE STRUCTURAL adjustment programme begun in July 1991 by thegovernment of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has been successful instimulating the scope of the private sector, as well as expanding tradeand attracting foreign investment in India.The economic liberalisation of India was initiated partly in responseto structural problems in the economy. The Indian government facedserious fiscal and external imbalances which had generated double-digitinflation at the beginning of the decade. Despite significantassistance from multilateral and bilateral agreements, foreign exchangereserves had fallen to $1 billion - or two weeks of imports - by June1991, pushing the country to the verge of defaulting on its externaldebt obligations.The reform programme precipitated by this crisis focused on the capitalintensity of India's historical growth process and was aimed atcurtailing its dependence on the unsustainable and unproductiveexpansion of the public sector. The country's relatively highinvestment rate had failed to show a matching, much less a sustainable,growth in output and employment.The aim of India's new economic reform agenda is to reverse thisvicious cycle by policies that will usher in a virtuous cycle of growththrough higher productivity and investment.Over the past four years, we have seen a commendable improvement inIndia's current and capital external accounts, accompanied bystructural reforms. To sustain the momentum of this process requires aconcerted effort to strengthen public finances, improve investment ininfrastructure, and encourage private investment to flow into crucialareas of the economy.It is also of crucial importance that the reform agenda filters down tostate government level. In the next stage of reform, fiscal prudence atthe centre needs to be complemented by individual states. In thisrespect the forthcoming general election will be crucial inconsolidating the success of the government's initiatives to date. Thegovernment's consensus-building approach in instituting economicreforms will ensure that the liberalisation process, though slow, isalso irreversible.Capital market reformsMr Narasimha Rao's Congress government started to liberalise the Indianeconomy with an agenda for reform that attempted to address thestructural inefficiencies that militated against investment. Thisfocused on trade policies, the financial sector, taxation and publicenterprises.This has resulted in a planned transformation of the Indian capitalmarket to enable it to assume an integral role in the allocation ofcapital within the nation's growth plans for the future. Thoughfrustratingly slow, change is discernible.Policy reforms covering the free pricing of new issues, the flotationof Euroissues, foreign institutional investment in Indian companies,the establishment of private sector mutual funds and the privatisationof state-owned companies are starting to have a discernible impact onthe capital market and the investment environment.The key issue of setting up a central depository to facilitate a smoothtransfer of the ownership of shares will have a dramatic impact ontrading when it is put in place. A high level of poor delivery,issuance of duplicate shares and problems relating to share transferand registration, particularly after a stock market scam in 1992,continues to plague the market. This limits confidence in the marketmechanism.Long-standing troubles in India regarding stockmarket infrastructurecontinue to thwart portfolio investment. This has made it difficult forforeign direct investment to flow into the country.It is inevitable that in this process of transformation of the economy,there have been more losers than winners. Nonetheless, it is expectedthat over the next five years, the newly elected government will bemore able to address the vital issue of infrastructural constraints tofacilitate the smooth flow of capital within the economy.Any investment decision, however, is ultimately linked to therisk-reward ratio that the individual investor determines for himselfor is prepared to tolerate over a stipulated period. This is partlyinfluenced by rational expectations within an economic framework thatenables the investor to identify the opportunity early enough to use itadvantageously. The need to distinguish between the performance of theeconomy and that of the stockmarket requires a high level ofdiscipline.While a long-term investment horizon is always desirable, it isespecially prudent to take into account the overall valuation of themarket when swimming in the rough seas of emerging markets. Overheatedmarkets are best avoided. Market fundamentals are often distorted byshort-term money flows. With the increasingly international nature ofcapital flows, it is vital to understand the various cycles in themovement of funds flowing into the real economy as distinct from thestock markets.Volatility can provide opportunities. In illiquid markets, activetrading may not prove to be such a winning strategy, however. For thosefund managers, asset allocation strategists and individuals interestedin investing in India, the critical task is understanding the economicopportunity and timing one's entry into the market accordingly.Poor stock market performanceWhile the fundamental resilience of the Indian economy is reflected ina series of economic data - from industrial output growth, exportperformance to corporate earnings - the stockmarket has been in thedoldrums due to a lack of liquidity.The Bombay Stock Exchange 30 Index declined about 30.7 percent indollar terms in 1995 but at the current level is offering investorsgood value. Valuations are reasonable at 12 times March 1996 earnings,with EPS growth of 20 percent estimated for the year to March 1997. Theimpending general election, which is expected to take place in April1996 will continue to restrain market sentiment but will also providegood buying opportunities for the long-term investor.The economy has responded positively to the structural adjustmentprogramme but macroeconomic stresses pose fresh challenges to policy.Real GDP growth recovered from 1 percent in 1991-92 to 4.3 percentbetween 1992 and 1994, and over the next two years is expected tomaintain the 6 percent achieved last year. Industrial production, afterremaining stagnant in 1991-92, recovered to grow by a modest 2.3percent in 1992-93 before surging by 8.5 percent in 1994-95. It isexpected to rise to around 9 percent to 10 percent over the next twoyears.Exports, having declined marginally in 1991-92, rose by 20 percent in1993-94 and by 18 percent in 1994-95, and are also expected to sustainthis pace over the next two years. Imports were severely hit byrecession and the structural adjustment plan in 1991-92. Both impactedadversely on industrial captilisation rates, leading to a contractionof 18.8 percent. They recovered quickly to grow by 11.9 percent in 1992-93 and by 6.5 percent in 1993-94, before surging by a further 21.3percent in 1994-95. Imports continue to show a strong rising trend,reflecting the recovery of demand in the economy and are expected torise by 25 percent in 1995-96.India's current account deficit also improved substantially to a mere0.1 percent of GDP in 1993-94 and 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994-95. Thedeficit is expected to rise to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1995-96 but thenrecover marginally in 1996-97.At $4.1 billion, foreign investment (of which portfolio investment was$3.13 billion) rose sharply, resulting in a rise in the foreignexchange reserves to $15 billion by March 1994 and $20 billion by March1995. The subsequent slow-down in foreign investment may have been ablessing in disguise for India's policymakers, as management of foreignexchange reserves was posing a serious challenge.External competitiveness was beginning to be compromised. The rupee hadbeen virtually pegged at 31.37 to the dollar until mid-September 1995when the authorities allowed it to rise to 33.7. The rupee ratecurrently stands at 34.5.The monetisation of reserves has produced a sharp expansion in themoney supply. This resulted in a growth rate of 22.2 percent betweenMarch 1993 and March 1993. Coupled with increases in administeredprices, the inflation rate rose from a low of 7 percent in mid-1993 to10 percent in March 1994. As a consequence the real exchange rateappreciated. With industrial recovery in place, non-oil imports startedpicking up at a faster rate, and the larger current account deficit putdownward pressure on the currency, leading to the devaluation of therupee.The current trade and current account deficits do not pose any realconcern as foreign exchange reserves remain high at $17.5 billion inDecember 1995 or approximately six months of imports. Money supply hasbeen running higher than planned for some time, however. It increasedby 17.5 percent during 1994-95 but the slow-down in foreign exchangeinflows helped in restraining subsequent growth. Money supply growth isexpected to amount to 16 percent for 1995-96.Inflationary pressures have abated in the short term. Inflation isunlikely to rise above the 10 percent level.While the government is vigilant and the Reserve Bank of India hasresponded by maintaining tighter liquidity conditions at present, theinflationary battle can only be won by streamlining the financialposition of the states and the public sector enterprises. Thepolitically sensitive reforms required to address restrictive labourlaws, formulating bankruptcy laws etc can only be dealt with after theelections.Increased spending in an election year has forced the government toissue ad hoc treasury bills to fund the budget deficit, however,despite an agreement concluded with the central bank in September 1994to end the government's automatic access to such a form of financing byMarch 1997.The planned phasing out would have significantly enhanced monetarycontrol and severed the link between the expansion of bank credit andthe budget deficit. This reversal of government policy implies that thefiscal adjustment process will take much longer than anticipated.Stabilisation policyIn July 1991 the prime objective of the government was to stabilise theeconomy. This was achieved primarily through cuts on subsidies,defence, capital expenditure and loans to states and publicenterprises. The government deficit was reduced from 8.4 percent of GDPin 1990-91 to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1992-93.Much of this progress was lost in 1993-94 as the fiscal deficitescalated to 7.7 percent of GDP against a target of 4.7 percent, as aresult of revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns. The gross fiscaldeficit stood at 6.6 percent of GDP in 1994-95 and is unlikely toimprove significantly over the next year.The worse-than-expected fiscal performance could undermine thecredibility of the economic programme. Interest payments claim abouthalf of the central government's revenues. The financial sectorreforms, as well as the declared intention of the government to reduceits borrowing from the central bank over the next three years, willincrease the rates of interest currently being paid on government debt,further aggravating the situation.While the reneging of its commitment to reduce its dependency on thecentral bank for cheap credit for deficit financing during thisfinancial year may help in the short term, it does not inspireconfidence in the government's ability to contain its fiscal imbalance.More importantly, it tends to crowd out private sector borrowing,investment and the subsequent growth of the real economy. In addition,a limited fiscal adjustment has passed the burden of economicstabilisation onto monetary policy.The government's ability to curb expenditure is seriously hampered bythe fact that interest payments, defence, wages and grants and loansaccount for almost 70 percent of non-plan government expenditure.Furthermore, these are mandated by the constitution.The government's expectation of economic recovery in its last budgetseems to be paying off; the fiscal deficit will be lower than lastyear's level. Lower excise duties and interest rates have resulted inrecovery in household consumption as is evident from a lower savingsratio and healthy sales in consumer durables. A rise in importssimilarly signals a recovery in private sector investment. If, however,equity-raising by companies continues to be thwarted by marketconditions, the tide of investment into the real economy may not gathersufficient momentum over the medium term.Taking into account the infrastructural constraints of the economy,however, this may not be such a problem in the short term. Besides,constant fundraising by companies via issuance of shares not only leadsto EPS dilution but investor fatigue as well.Boosting private investmentThe fiscal deficit continues to be the government's main challenge anda real threat to India's economic prospects. The 1996-97 budget will beManmohan Singh's sixth. While continuing with the structural adjustmentprocess, his last budget emphasised a shift towards stimulatinginvestment so that economic recovery would help consolidate thegovernment's fiscal position.To lower the user cost of capital, import tariffs on capital goods weresignificantly reduced, corporate taxes were lowered and the excise dutyregime was reformed. The removal of barriers to private sector entry inareas previously reserved for the public sector was also initiated,although the progress achieved has been limited.The irony is that what has withheld private investment is not so muchthe high cost of capital but high idle capacity in sectors whereprivate investment could have been used, such as manufacturing.Meanwhile in areas where there is mounting urgency to expand capacity(this is particularly the case in relation to infrastructure), a policyand institutional framework supportive of private investment has yet tofully evolve. While Indian firms have raised capital through GDRissuance and convertibles, not all the amounts raised have found theirway back into the real economy to stimulate output and employment.As these funds get invested slowly, the recovery of the economy to the6 percent to 7 percent GDP growth level is sustainable only as long aspolicy continues to attract and stimulate investment. There is littlescope for the Finance Minister to accelerate the pace of reform untilafter the election.While the budget in February will provide an excellent forum for theCongress to highlight its achievements since 1991, politicallysensitive policy decisions cannot be taken in an election year.Although India's saving rate is running at around 20 percent of GDP,the heavily regulated financial system has meant that savings have notnecessarily flown into the most productive sectors. The government hastaken steps to address this issue by reducing the extent to whichcommercial banks are forced to hold government debt, rationingsubsidised credit to priority sectors- so bringing it more in line with market rates - and relaxing controlsover banks' lending decisions.The inflationary impact of the fiscal deficit is the key issue for thegovernment. Thus any savings made by the central and state governments,together with nationalised industries, will not only help containfiscal imbalance but reverse the anti-investment bias of the fiscaladjustment programme. This has produced a declining trend in publicinvestment since 1991-92, the year in which the programme commenced.As a result, the generation of employment opportunities by the publicsector has not been feasible and, as mentioned earlier, the privatesector has not been investing as a result of excess capacity inindustry. Gross domestic capital formation declined from 24 percent ofGDP in 1991-92 to 20.4 percent of GDP in 1993-94.While the annual growth rate between 1981 and 1991 was 16.3 percent perannum, gross domestic capital formation grew at only 4 percent perannum between 1992 and 1994. The whole question of labour reform canonly be addressed seriously when the government is in a position togenerate greater investment and employment.Investing in IndiaA country's economic performance is usually judged over decades ratherthan the over latest business cycle. A nation's economic strength isgauged not only by its macroeconomic performance and the profitabilityof its corporations but by the overall prosperity of its people. Withpopulation growth at 2 percent and an annualised real growth innational income of around 4 percent since independence, growth inIndian per-capita income has lagged behind that of other East Asiancountries.In the Indian context, the investment case rests on the fact that pastperformance provides no true guide to future prospects. India is poisedto enter a phase of sustainable GDP growth of around 6 percent to 7percent a year. With population growth expected to decline further fromthe current 1.9 percent per annum, per capita income should risesubstantially over the next decade.With 20 percent of the world population and the sixth-largest economy,India cannot be ignored. Her democratic ideology, the availability ofexisting legal and accounting infrastructure along with the prevalenceof English as a common language provides for a level of investorcomfort not to be found in either China or Russia, for example.The Economy's Response                        1991-92  92-93  93-94  94-95  95-96  1996-97Real GDP Growth %        1.1      4.3    6.2    6.4    6.2    6.2Gross domestic capital formation as % of GDP  23.6     22     20.4   19     19     20Gross domestic savings as % of GDP            23.1     20     20     21     21.5   22Growth in industrial production %            0.0      2.3    6      8.5    9     10Budget deficit as % of GDP                     5.9      5.7    7.7    6.6    6      6Inflation               13.5      9.6    7.5   10      8      9Export growth %         -0.9      3.1   20     18     20     20Import growth %        -18.8     11.9    6.5   21.3   25     23CAD/GDP %               -0.4     -1.8   -0.1   -0.7   -1.5   -1.2Debt service ratio      25       28.6   25.3   27.1   27     26Foreign exchange reserves ($ billion)   5.6       6.4   15.07  20.81  17     18Sources: CMIE and the author's estimatesFunds investing in IndiaFund                    Fund Manager       Fund size  Fund currency                                           ($USm)Atlas Inde              Fin Atlas           40.00     FRF20/20 India Fund        20/20 Fund Mgt       6.14     GADBarings Peacock Fund Ltd                    Barings             46.60     USDBombay Fund             Barclays            35.47     USDChescor Indian ICL Smaller Cos            Chescor             19.25     USDClariden India          Clariden            13.56     USDColumbus India Fund     Columbus Asst Mgt    3.70     USDDresdner-Thornton India Thornton            12.42     USDFleming Indian Investment Trust       Fleming             41.94     USDGovett India            Govett & Co         27.61     USDGT Indian Smaller Cos A USD              GT                  20.90     USDGT Indian Smaller Cos B USD              GT                  20.90     USDHTR India Fund          Henderson Touche    14.00     USDIndia Focus Fund        Citibank            14.79     USDIndia Fund A            Unit Trust of India 51.73     GBPIndia Fund B            Unit Trust of India 80.47     GBPIndia Fund Inc.

The Treasury's report says BICs are an example of how "pass-through"insurance can create competitive inequities.    "In recent years, banks have begun to offer a product similar to GICs(guaranteed investment contracts), called bank investment contracts, orBICs, which explicitly take advantage of pass-through deposit insurance asa marketing tool," the report said.   The report acknowledges that banks can effectively manage the greaterdegree of interest rate risk from BICs through contract limitations andhedging strategies.    The problem remains, however, that BICs are fully insured by thegovernment.    "This provides banks with a new opportunity to attract large depositsby expanding the use of the government's guarantee," the Treasury said.    "Meanwhile, insurance companies offering GICs totally outside of thesafety net do not have this competitive advantage," it said.   The Treasury report also said banking organizations should be permittedto offer BICs to pension fund managers, but without extending to themfederal deposit insurance.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991U.K. REGULATOR MAY WIDEN MORTGAGE-BACKED MARKETBritain's building societies and mortgage lenders are confident thatthe Building Societies Commission will reverse its proposals for thecontinued exclusion of sterling mortgage-backed securities from the listof instruments that thrifts can hold as liquid assets.    A favorable decision will provide considerable new support for themortgage-backed securities market in Britain, giving greater placementdepth to the market and increasing overall market liquidity,securitization specialists say. The ban was originally proposed in aconsultation paper issued by the Commission, the industry regulator forthrifts, late last year. It proposed several amendments to the BuildingSocieties (Liquid Assets) Regulations of 1987, which sets the assets thatbuilding societies may hold as liquid, easily divested assets.    Mortgage-backeds were among the securities it ruled were not suitableto be classed as liquid holdings. It said the mortgage-backed market inBritain was not sufficiently developed to provide "an appropriate" mediumfor thrifts' liquidity management.    The Commission determined that assets must provide maximum capitalcertainty and must be fully marketable. It said this must be achieved bythe assets having daily quoted, freely available prices and should betraded on a recognized money market or stock exchange.    Mortgage-backed securities tend to be held by institutional investorsto maturity, resulting in relatively low levels of trading and, therefore,limited market liquidity, specialists say. When the mortgage market was inits early stages in the mid-1980s, it was easy to understand why theproduct should not be included as a liquid asset. But the market nowtotals 9.5 billion pounds ($18 billion) in outstanding issues and isconsidered well established, its promoters say. The Commission has askedits members to give their views on the liquidity issue and these responsesare now being studied. An official announcement is expected within threemonths.    The Council of Mortgage Lenders, keen to see the development ofmortgage-backed securities, has previously voiced concern over theCommission's ruling. Council members believe that mortgage bonds shouldfully qualify as liquid assets, as Class-1 securities which carry thehighest rating.    "Given the depth, quality, trading activity and number of marketmaking brokers in mortgage-backed securities, there seems no reason whythey should not be treated as first-class assets," a source at onemortgage lender said. When the Commission was reviewing last year whethermortgage-backeds should be reclassified as Class-1 assets, thrifts andother mortgage lenders were convinced the regulator would decide toinclude the securities. A substantial amount of lobbying has been takenplace on the issue, which should result in the Commission agreeing tooverturn the proposal, specialists say.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991SWISS BANK GROUP BACKS $500 MILLION MICHIGAN NOTESKaren PierogMichigan last week sold $500 million of general obligation notes thatfeatured an unconditional standby note purchase agreement provided by aconsortium of three Swiss banks.    The standby agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.and Credit Suisse obligates the banks to provide funds for the principaland interest payments on the notes in the event that money in the state'sset-aside fund for the issue are insufficient. The banks' participation inthe note issue is split into thirds.    Susan Kish, a vice president at UBS, said that unlike a normal standbypurchase agreement, the pact between the banks and Michigan isunconditional.    "In a normal standby purchase agreement, there are usually conditionsthat have to be satisfied before the facility can be drawn, such as noevent of default or bankruptcy," she explained. "In this agreement,neither of those is applicable."    Kish said the only conditions the state must meet are legal onesinvolving the state's obligation to repay the banks.    The notes were priced last week by a Prudential Securities Inc. groupto yield 4.60% to the Sept. 31, 1991 maturity. The were originally pricedto yield 4.65%, but strong investor demand for the notes enabled theunderwriters to trim the yield by five basis points.    State officials made the decision to place a credit enhancement on theissue about two weeks ago. The state had originally planned to sell thenote issue unenhanced last month but delayed the pricing because of a Feb.6 state appellate court decision that called into question $450 million ayear of the state's single-business tax revenues, according to NickKhouri, the state's deputy treasurer.    Khouri said when Gov. John Engler, on March 5, proposed a revenueneutral amendment to the tax that would counter the fiscal effects of thecourt ruling, the state decided to proceed with a credit-enhanced cashflow borrowing to speed up the process.    "We wanted to do the deal as quickly as possible at the highestrating," he explained, adding that arbitrage considerations, which wouldearn the state $25,000 a day, were also a factor in moving quickly on thedeal.    The state also had to contend with the fact that on January 23,Standard & Poor's Corp. placed $3.14 billion of state debt on CreditWatchwith negative implications, after the state Legislature and the Engleradministration reached an impasse over dealing with a current year budgetdeficit.    "We believe the use of this credit enhancement should negate thatimpact in the market," said Wayne Workman, a senior vice president atTucker Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., the financial adviser on the deal.    And the state - with a credit enhancement mechanism from the Swissbanks that resembles a hybrid between a direct-pay letter of credit and astandard standby purchase agreement - received the highest short-termratings of SP-1-plus from Standard & Poor's, MIG-1 from Moody's InvestorsService, and F-1-plus from Fitch Investors Service Inc.    "The whole gist of the deal is that it walks and talks like a letterof credit, but it's not," said Kevin Burke, a public finance director atPrudential Securities Inc., the senior manager on the deal.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991HOW MOODY'S ANALYZES BOND INSURANCE FIRMSThe following is excerpted from Moody's Investors Service's GlobalCredit Analysis, published by IFR Books in London. In this excerpt,Moody's describes some of its credit analysis methods for ratingindividual corporate guarantors.Organizational Structure    A corporate financial guarantor's overall structure is an importantconsideration in determining its ultimate ability and willingness to meetpolicyholder obligations. As a starting point, Moody's analysts review allof the company's operating units on a consolidated basis and examine anyintercompany reinsurance that may be in effect.    To understand the true economic risk profile of the operation, thecompany's reinsurance assumptions and cessions and the expense allocationsof individual companies are reviewed on a consolidated basis. Thisanalysis recognizes that most insurers have sufficient financialflexibility to move corporate resources to individual subsidiaries, givingthem the ability to support weak units. Despite company-specificrestrictions which may be in effect, the confidence/sensitive nature ofthe public debt market provides the insurer with a major incentive to makegood on claims of all its affiliated operating corporations.    The activities of non-operating insurance units are also reviewed. Forexample, the debt-to-equity ratios of holding companies or othersubsidiaries that have issued debt are examined, as are their debt servicecapabilities. Potential demands under expected and stress conditionsshould permit the company to meet its obligations and still allow adequatesubsidiary capital growth for business expansion. The key objective ofthis analysis is to determine the insurer's true economic costs; amountand type of affiliated reinsurance; and amount and holders of any debt.Management has sufficient discretion within the regulatory structure topermit the obligations or resources of affiliates to affect the insurer'sown ability to perform on policyholder obligations.    While asset quality has primacy over other financial factors, earningsare critical to a bond insurer's long-term creditworthiness because theywill dictate the company's ability to generate sufficient capitalinternally or to maintain access to external sources of capital to meetfuture needs.    Corporate bond insurers do not generally have a standard premiumstructure dictated by regulations. The starting point in analyzing thequality of earnings is an assessment of the company's statutory accountingcompared with existing practices elsewhere in the financial markets. Inthe U.S. markets, bond insurance premiums are typically priced in relationto their value in reducing the debt issuer's total debt service cost.Accordingly, while large up-front premiums are common in the municipalbond insurance market, the predominance of shorter-term and amortizingdebt service in the corporate markets has meant that more premiums arereceived annually. In essence, premiums represent a contractually agreedrate multiplied by the periodic balance of principal (or debt service)outstanding. It is not uncommon for corporate bond insurers to charge alarger first-year premium with subsequent renewals at lower rates.Capital Adequacy    This key factor is best measured by relating the insurer's losspotential to total capital (surplus plus contingency reserves). New YorkState has established standards for the maximum risk-to-capital ratio;risk is defined as aggregate policyholder limits or insured par. For mostbond insurers, this equals total debt service, or the entire amount ofdebt issued. These regulations differentiate various types of underlyinginsured obligations, with capital requirements varying between $300 ofrisk to $1 of capital (municipal), to $100 of risk to $1 of capital(corporate). Note, however, that from the credit analyst's point of view,this gross measurement of risk has several major shortcomings.    First, reported statutory risk for partial bond coverage versus 100%coverage need not be consistent with true loss potential. This riskmeasurement problem is similar to that experienced by first-loss lettersof credit or subordinated securities; although the dollar volume of theobligation is important, it does not necessarily reflect the likely losseson a pool of assets in the event of default.    Second, the loss potentials of transactions, even within a particularcategory defined by regulators, can vary dramatically. Third, neitherrepayment sources nor temporal, geographic or originator diversificationis captured by the statutory risk measurement.    Many other factors can vary significantly among companies and shouldbe considered within the unique context of a particular managementstrategy, including the size of the unearned premium reserve, compositionof revenue between renewal and up-front premiums, the term of existinginsured exposures, and the quality of investment assets. Because of theinteractive nature of portfolio losses, revenue generation and thehistorical position of a company, the impact of these factors frequentlycan be clarified through computer simulation. Simulations are viewed asonly one of many tools necessary to assess the risk profile of a companyeven when transaction quality estimates are available.    Moody's model for corporate bond insurers incorporates historicalstatutory balance sheet and income statements for an individual company,company specific insured portfolio characteristics related to sector, andthe quality and contractual elements of reinsurance. The model can alsoproject a variety of outcomes depending on assumptions on key variablessuch as premium rates, volume of business written, loss development andquality, seasoning, and sector characteristics unique to the company.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991FDIC INSURANCE STUDY OUTThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released a study on bank depositinsurance that includes sections on how the private sector mightparticipate in the program in the future, according to George E. French,chief of the financial markets section in the FDIC's research department.    "The private insurer would set the premium rate and the FDIC wouldbase its premium level on the private insurer's risk estimates," Frenchsaid. He added that the full premium might not be downstreamed to theprivate reinsurer.    The FDIC has met with the staff of Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., who hasproposed legislation to reform deposit insurance, French said.    The FDIC's report does not contain an extensive discussion of stateinsurance systems or moving to a purely private insurance system, Frenchstressed. Moreover, the technical aspects of how contracts should bewritten has not begun.    The Treasury report's suggestion for the FDIC to do a pilot project,which would include several banks and insurance companies, was favorablyreceived, French said. "We've already met with members of the municipalbond insurance industry and their ideas are very useful," he said.    Financial guaranty industry executives interested in receiving a copyof the report can contact French at 202-898-3929. Industry representativesinterested in participating in any pilot projects can contact FDICchairman L. William Seidman or W. Roger Watson, director of research.    "We're presented with an opportunity to become a part of history bycooperating with the U.S. government and helping form policies that willguide the financial services industry into the 21st century," a seniorexecutive of a financial guaranty company said. "I think the industry mayshake its head in disbelief, years from now, if we miss this opportunity."Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, STRESSED BY ENHANCE UNITGuaranty Risk Services Inc. acted as financial adviser on about $58million taxable and tax-exempt principal and interest last year that wasinsured by Asset Guaranty Reinsurance Co., according to Kenneth C.Sherman, GRS senior vice president in charge of originations.    While GRS acknowledges the dollar amount is not large compared to theamounts insured by the major monoline financial guarantors, the firm ispleased with the high quality of the deals it did. "Given the real estatemarkets, we could have done a ton of deals, but not with the same creditquality," said a GRS spokesman.    GRS, a subsidiary of Enhance Financial Services Group, was formed lastyear to originate and underwrite deals that are subsequently insured byAsset Guaranty. That insurance is rated triple-A by Duff & Phelps Inc.    "The differential between unenhanced and Asset Guaranty enhancedtransactions has been roughly 200 basis points," Sherman added.    To date, deals originated and underwritten by GRS have all been realestate related. GRS is interested in smaller, middle-market transactionsthat have a high credit quality.    "We do not originate deals that primary insurance companies wouldinsure," Sherman said.    Currently, GRS has about $60 million in deals in its underwritingpipeline and several should appear in the market during April. GRS'average deal size is between $3 million and $10 million.    Most of GRS' deals have been multifamily housing transactions thatrefund or restructure existing debt.    "GRS will not accept construction, lease-up or refurbishing risks,"Sherman stressed. Issues can be structured with these risks if an approvedthird party is willing to take the risk instead of GRS, he said.   GRS is finding its business growing at a fast pace because regionalinvestment banks around the nation are trying to find credit enhancersfollowing the pullback by banks and savings and loans in providing lettersof credit. Additionally, the government enhancement programs are moving ata "sluggish" pace, Sherman reported.    Not only are regional investment banks welcoming GRS, Sherman said,but the investment community is referring deals to it.    "Investors are doing their due diligence, and the depth and level ofGRS' underwriting has prompted some investors to send deals to us," heexplained.    GRS' underwriting department has several criteria that must be met.First, underwriters look at the cash flow and demand debt coverage ofgreater than 1.25 times. Additionally, the loan to value ratio must notexceed 75%. "These two criteria work together because a deal with a 90%loan to value is not going to have 1.25 times the coverage," he said.    Finally, GRS requires an equity contribution from the developer,typically at least 10%, Sherman said. This equity contribution makes itharder for a developer to walk away from any deal. GRS-approvedtransactions usually have a maturity of 10 to 12 years.    During 1990, GRS acted as financial advisor to Asset Guaranty, whichinsured the following transactions:    * $9.36 million multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds forMankato, Minnesota. The placement agent was Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.,and the underlying credit support was provided by the Highland Hills ofMankato Limited Partnership Project.    * $1.7-million industrial development revenue bonds for theDevelopment Authority of Cartersville, Georgia. The sole underwriter forthe transaction was Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. The bonds aresupported by the Nantucket Industries Inc. project and are subject to amandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2001.    * $8.9-million industrial development refunding revenue bonds for theIllinois Development Finance Authority. Donaldson, Lufkin & JenretteSecurities Corp. and Young Capital Corp. were co-underwriters. The $8.5million tax-exempt series-A refunding bonds and $400,000 series-B revenuebonds are supported by the Orleans-Institute Place Associates Project.    * $6.78 million of multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for theNorth Dakota Housing Finance Agency. The deal was managed by Dain BosworthInc.     * $6.8-million Series-1 commercial development revenue refundingbonds and $470,000 Series-2 taxable commercial development revenuerefunding bonds for the Port Authority of St. Paul, Minn. Dain Bosworthwas sole manager. Fort Road Medical/Irvine Park Towers Project providedthe underlying credit support.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991FSA-BACKED PROGRAM BOOSTS AUSSIE SECURITIZATION    An Australian special-purpose corporation that carries creditinsurance from Financial Security Assurance is planning to sell its secondand third offerings of asset-backed securities.    The corporation, known by its acronym, SAFE - for Secured AssetFunding Entity Ltd. - was set up last year by Bankers Trust Australia Ltd.to offer a quicker way for issuers to securitize both mortgage and nonmortgage assets through a standardized format.    Securities issued through SAFE are backed by FSA and the StateGovernment Insurance Commission of South Australia. FSA is the seniorguarantor of the pro-gram, and securities issued through it are triple-Arated. South Australia is rated double-A-plus.    So far, one issue has been done through SAFE - last November, a $100million (Australian) offering by Town & Country W.A. Building Society wasbacked by residential and commercial mortgages. That deal consisted offive-year fixed bullet bonds.    In the latest transactions, retailer David Jones is planning tosecuritize credit card receivables, and the St. George Building Society isoffering mortgage-backed bonds. FSA would not confirm that either deal isin the works.    The Jones securitization is a resurfacing of a financing plan thatFrance's Societe Generale was putting together last year. Originallyplanned to be launched internationally out of Hong Kong, the A$180 milliontransaction will be now be issued through SAFE in the Australian domesticmarket.    A dealer group of seven banks is participating in the transaction,with Societe Generale acting as arranger.    St. George is pressing ahead with a mortgage-backed transaction,totaling about A$200 million. When the SAFE concept was first announced,it was expected that St. George and Beneficial Finance would launch issuesearly in 1991. But Beneficial's plans are on hold, apparently due to loanloss problems among affiliates in the Australian banking system.    Sources say the new transactions will help popularize the concept ofsecuritization after some recent setbacks in Australia, including doubtsover a special vehicle devised by Schroders Australia Ltd., which wouldhave been Australia's first internationally rated vehicle for securitizedmortgages. The entity was named PUMA, for Pooled Unlisted Mortgage Assets.Schroders initially hoped to raise A$50 million through it by the end of1990. But the difficulties in the Australian bond market promptedSchroders last month to cancel its plans to enter the secondary mortgagemarket.Back to Headline List CopyrightGLOBAL GUARANTY via NewsNetMarch 25, 1991GLOBAL GUARANTY INSURED-UNINSURED SPREADS[TABLE](As of Thursday, March 21, 1991)                        5 year    10 year    20 year    30 year Revenue    Insured      5.75      6.35        7.15      7.20 Bonds      Single-A     5.99      6.55        7.35      7.40 G.O.

Indeed, the Boston-based mutual fund has kept pace withincreased cash inflows even as senior vice president Fred Cavanaugh hasscaled back high yield holdings as a percentage of the firm's StrategicIncome Fund.     "The technicals are in fantastic shape," said Cavanaugh,who manages the Strategic Income fund and oversees all of John Hancock'sjunk purchases. "There's a lot of interest [in high yield bonds] fromcross-over buyers from the high-quality corporate sector and we've seen atremendous amount of interest from retail investors."     Faced with looming credit concerns, however, Cavanaugh hasreduced the diversified portfolio's high yield allocation to roughly 40%from the "high to mid-40's" a year ago. Beyond some $200 million indomestic high yield securities, the Strategic Income fund also containsinternational debt, governments and preferred stock.     John Hancock holds nearly $1 billion in high yield bondsamong its Strategic Income, High Yield and High-Grade Bond funds, thelatter of which currently holds some 15%-20% in junk bonds. All told, thefirm manages pver $16 billion in assets for retail  and private investors.Bullish Near Term     Despite rising default rates and the reduction of exposurelevels, John Hancock's expectations for the coming year in the high yieldmarket aren't especially dire. Cavanaugh remains "constructive" on creditfundamentals for the first half of 1996 and is "more cautiously optimistic"regarding the latter portion of the year.     "We should see sufficient economic activity to support cashflows, even in the cyclicals" during the first portion of the year,Cavanaugh said.     This view has been bolstered by the recent price increasesposted by several steel and paper issuers. "A little bit of inflation canbe good" because it indicates healthy demand and bolsters short-termprofitability, Cavanaugh said.     Away from cyclical issues, Cavanaugh looked for each sectorof the telecommunications market including cable and paging to continueposting strong performances as their product offerings and user marketssteadily mature.     Despite this generally positive outlook, Cavanaugh hastaken several moderate steps to reduce credit risk by shortening high yieldmaturities and turning to higher coupons.Reining In Credit Risk     "Higher coupons tend to temper the pricing change needed toget a particular yield," Cavanaugh said. "But if you run into a distresssituation, [the security] will begin trading strictly on a price basis, soit offers little or no protection" in a default scenario.     Otherwise, the firm has gravitated toward the strongernames and more senior paper in the cyclical sectors. Hancock hasn't pushedcredit quality above the single-B level since cross-over buying hasinflated double-B pricing and driven down yields, Cavanaugh said.     Hancock has also rotated into overseas debt, which hasrisen from roughly 30% to 40% of the Strategic Income fund. Internationalpurchases have included some sovereign issues from Western Europe and highyield corporates such as the UK cable offerings.     "It's in a growth stage comparable to where we were eightor nine years ago, and there are some fairly well-heeled investorsinvolved," Cavanaugh said of the set of UK cable deals.     Meanwhile, Cavanaugh has avoided the retailing andrestaurant sectors of the domestic high yield market, where he predicted adifficult operating environment going forward.     "I would want to see the fourth quarter numbers,particularly for the retailers, before I'd change my view," Cavanaugh said."I'm not expecting robust results out of any of them, so it could be asector to avoid this year."Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH YIELD REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996PUERTO RICAN BANK TAPS MARKET VIA 144A OFFERINGAfter eyeing the market throughout 1995, FirstBank ofPuerto Rico became the second bank from the island to issue subordinateddebt last December.

Standard & Poor's lowered its marks for 126 domesticspeculative grade issues totaling $93.8 billion and upgraded 142 seriesworth $108.5 billion during 1995. Moody's Investor Service, meanwhile,downgraded 123 speculative grade securities equaling $25.3 billion whilegranting higher marks to 100 issues of $37.26 billion.     The figures compared favorably with those seen at the endof the last economic expansion and should bode well for delinquency ratesduring 1996, several analysts said.     "Further deterioration seems likely. However, the magnitudeof the losses should fall well short of the numbers seen in 1989 and 1990,"said Moody's senior economist John Lonski. During that period, downgradesmore than doubled upgrades in dollar terms, Lonski said.     S&P's 1995 results reversed the previous year's totals, inwhich downgrades outpaced upgrades in terms of both number and dollarvolumes. Although the number of Moody's downgrades exceeded upgrades in1995, the ratio of upgrades relative to downgrades improved on a dollarbasis and reached its highest level in 12 years. (See table, page 3.)     "If it weren't for the retailers and the manufacturers ofnon-durable consumer goods, we would have had many more upgrades thandowngrades" in 1995, Lonski said. Indeed, Moody's downgraded 70 such issuestotaling $23.6 billion while uprgrading 24 issues worth $16.4 billion lastyear.     Moreover, the dollar amount of fallen angels dropped to$9.83 billion from $12.9 billion even though the number of issues increasedto 12 from a record-low nine in 1994, according to Moody's. The ratingagency promoted 24 issues totaling $10.8 billion from speculative toinvestment grade, compared to 17 issues representing $10.8 billion in 1994.     These high yield numbers coincided with an overallimprovement of corporate credit quality during 1995, according to S&P.Overall, the rating agency upgraded $210 billion in industrial debt anddowngraded $118 billion. Upgrades were concentrated in automotive,chemical, health care and high tech industries while media andentertainment, consumer products and retailers bore the brunt of the ratingreductions.Gradual Credit Decline?     Despite these encouraging numbers, both agencies registereda higher number of speculative grade downgrades for the third straightyear. Moreover, the dollar amount of S&P high yield downgrades climbed forthe fourth time since 1991.     While these trends have more recently coincided with higherdefault rates, most observers linked the increased downgrade activity tothe issuance of smaller parcels of riskier debt.     "You have had a significant increase in single-B debt, sothat would contribute to the higher numbers," said Diane Vazza, director offixed-income research at S&P. Vazza added that the abundance of first-timeissuers over the past several years also contributed to the accelerateddowngrade activity.Back to Headline List CopyrightHIGH YIELD REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996MARKET SURVIVES TOUGH WEEK;  GROWING CALENDAR NEXT OBSTACLEThe high yield market survived yet another week largelyunscathed despite the fact that the long bond jumped from 6.04% to 6.15%and the Dow skidded by over 100 points by Thursday's close.     Replete with fresh insurance allocations and new inflowsfrom mutual fund buyers, the high yield sector welcomed its first issuanceof the year and once again weathered downturns in other capital markets andthe continuing budget standoff.     "Most people have a lot of money to put to work right now,so they're buying yield first and credit second," one high yield tradersaid. Indeed, several dealers reportedly lightened their positions inanticipation of rougher market conditions later month.     Following light trading earlier in the week due to theblizzard conditions along the entire East Coast, secondary volumes reachedmoderate levels by mid-week. Aggregate high yield prices lost roughly aquarter point on Wednesday as the 30-year bond widened to yield 6.19%before tightening on Thursday following a slight comeback by both the stockand Treasury markets to finish essentially unchanged for the week.     Typical January favorites casinos and steel continued tolead the gainers, although several market players questioned the lattertrend given recent declines in auto sales. "People bulled up [on steel]with the price increases, but the demand for autos will determine whetherthat sticks or not," one trader said.Issuance Resumes     The continued strength of the high yield sector relative toother markets could be short-lived with upwards of $5 billion in issuanceexpected during the coming weeks.     Merrill Lynch priced the first deal of the year, launching$125 million for Young Broadcasting with co-manager JP Morgan. Originallysized at $100 million, the offering bore a 9% variable-price coupon andcomes due in January 2006.     Further issuance failed to materialize, although deal flowwas expected to begin in earnest this week with 21 road shows totaling over$5.2 billion reportedly underway or scheduled before the end of the month.     "That's a lot of issuance for this market to get through,so I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction," one high yield tradersaid. "The second half of this month should be a lot tougher than thefirst."     Heavy deal flow could stretch into February and even March,several market players said, as issuers rush to lock in the cheaper fundingafforded by low rates.     Moreover, the rumored closing of the SEC due to the budgetimpasse could spur issuers to crowd the market during the next six weeks,several traders added.Deals, Deals, Deals     Salomon Brothers will burst from the blocks with a fullslate including $100 million from APS, $450 million from MFSCommunications, an $800 million multi-tranche offering from Sprint Cellularand a $175 million transaction from Miami-based Telemundo, several sourcessaid.     Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette should also post a big Januarywith a jumbo $1.1 billion, six-tranche offering from El Paso Electric Co.The Texas utility will issue five series of BB-/Ba3 first mortgage bondsand a sixth level of preferred stock to finance its reorganizationfollowing bankruptcy, sources said. DLJ will also reportedly lead $120million in nine-year senior subordinates from Doane Products with a five-year non-call period.     Merrill Lynch was expected to return with a $150 millionoffering from Rogers  Communications that was originally slated for lastweek but pushed back to Friday or early this week by the blizzard.     Otherwise, the underwriter also reportedly held the books forthree Rule 144A offerings: a $115 million deal from steel producer BarTechnology, a $200 million offering for Hollinger Publishing and $75million from BE Aerospace.     Hotel issuers expected before the end of the month includedPrime Hospitality with $120 million through Smith Barney, a $127 milliondeal from Courtyard Marriott via Lehman Brothers and a $165 millionoffering from Coast Hotel & Casino lead by Bear Stearns.     Smith Barney also held the reins on a $100 million offeringfrom financial company First Nationwide, sources said.     The issuance calendar will apparently be rounded out with a$100 million offering from Chancellors via Bankers Trust, a $120 milliondeal from Dynacare through Citicorp, $150 million from InterCel throughMorgan Stanley and $650 million in Riverwood International debt led byChemical Securities.

Theprocess will begin in 1996 and over time, it is intended that the newstructure will comprise all of the national practices around the world.The aim is for the consulting group to be a unified global entity withits own profit centre, owned by all of the group's consulting partners.However, the accounting practices will continue to organise theirprofit centres along national lines.Late last year, DTTI announced that the UK and US consulting practiceswere to join forces as the first stage in the creation of the newconsulting group (IAB 175). Last September, D&T's US member formallyannounced the establishment of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, andthe UK firm will make a similar announcement in London on February 1.A spokesman for DTTI said that "delicate ongoing" negotiations aretaking place with other European members but it could be two years ormore before those firms sign up to the global entity. Othergeographical regions are having similar talks, he said, although all ofthe areas are at "different stages" of negotiation.Both Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group and Deloitte & Touche willcontinue to operate under the international administrative umbrella ofDTTI.Serge Audouin, DTTI's head of management consultancy for Europe, said:"Initially, this is a management integration; the financial split willcome later. This is driven by the need to globalise our practice inline with the way clients are operating." The move depends on theapproval of the partnerships in some countries, including the US.Meanwhile, Touche Ross, DTTI's UK member, is considering following thelead of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young by converting to a limitedliability partnership (LLP) with its legal base in Jersey (IAB 177),sources within the firm said.But, since the necessary changes to Jersey law have yet to be enacted,the firm is unwilling to make any public announcement. The sources saidTouche is hoping the prospect of seeing accounting firms set upoffshore will prompt the UK Government into changing UK law to allowLLPs, preventing the need for a move to Jersey.Touche is also set to change its name. The firm will be known asDeloitte & Touche. Until now, the Deloitte name in the UK has belongedto Coopers & Lybrand after the worldwide merger of Deloitte Haskins &Sells and Touche Ross fell through in the UK in 1990, and the DH&Spractice was snapped up by C&L.Originally, the Deloitte name was not to be available to Touche untilthe end of 1996, but C&L agreed to an earlier date.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Members, however, were given thego-ahead to use the chartered title.The ACCA spent the Christmas holiday chewing it over and duly announcedthat it is changing its name to the Association of Chartered CertifiedAccountants, or ACCA for short.Following the Privy Council's decision, the ACCA hierarchy decided thatit would be best for members to be known as Chartered CertifiedAccountants, hence the new corporate name.

It will also consider the wider issue of combattingcorporate fraud.The government first proposed giving statutory immunity to auditors whoreport suspected fraud in 1994. The immunity, which would be similar tothat currently enjoyed by auditors of banks and securities houses,would enable auditors to report their suspicions to the authoritieswithout fear of being sued by their clients.Originally, the law was to have applied to both listed and non-listedcompanies. But, in a progress report issued last autumn, the governmentsaid it would narrow the scope of the legislation because of the"highly complicated issues" involved.According to Louis Wong, HKSA executive director and registrar, thegovernment has now decided that the law should apply to quotedcompanies only.Wong stressed that the new law will not put auditors under anyobligation to report fraud. "It only applies in the event that theyreport it," he said.But accountants are still worried that the immunity will createproblems for their relations with clients."We are concerned that an expectation might be created to seek outfraud and that it might unfavourably affect the trust between theclient and the auditor," outgoing HKSA president Nicholas Etches toldthe AGM.A survey conducted by KPMG last year shows that fraud is a growingproblem in Hong Kong. The firm found that 80 percent of respondingcompanies thought the incidence of fraud would increase, compared with70 percent a year earlier. Some 77 percent said fraud is a"seriousproblem", up from 62 percent in 1994.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The firm, ISIK Yeminli Mali Musavirlik, whichwas previously unaffiliated, provides BKR with Turkish representationfor the first time.ISIK, which joined the BKR network towards the end of last year, postedfiscal 1995 revenues of TL16 billion ($270,000), an increase of justover 52 percent on 1994.The six-partner firm operates out of one office in Istanbul and employs12 professionals and three support staff. Fifty-five percent of feeincome comprises audit and accountancy work, with tax contributing 30percent and other work the remaining 15 percent.BKR targeted Turkey because of the steady growth in its economy as wellas its growing links with the European Union. "Turkey has developedclose links with the European Union and may one day be a full member,"said Charles Tucker, BKR's London-based secretary.There was a growing demand among BKR's European members, particularlyin Germany, for representation in Turkey.BKR's search for a suitable firm took 12 months, according to Tucker,who said ISIK was selected from a short list of two. The firm waschosen because of its size and profile, and the fact that ithas"definite expansion plans" outside Istanbul played a key role in thefinal decision. It is also longer established than the other firmswhich were under consideration.Many of ISIK's clients are in the textiles, shipping and consumerproducts industries. Work for multi-national clients currently accountsfor about 25 percent of its revenues. No list of clients is available.In IAB's annual world survey last month, BKR ranked 20th with revenuesof $341 million, an increase of 10.7 percent on 1994.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The group has all butformalised arrangements with Levitt Kirson, the CKL (now known as AGNInternational) member firm, and Josman & Seidel, one of three HLBaffiliates there.The two firms, which will give Nexia coverage in Johannesburg, Durbanand Cape Town, are forming an association of independent firms with athird member likely to be added in Port Elizabeth later this year.The combined fee income of the firm will add about R13 million ($3.6million) to Nexia's global revenues. Levitt Kirson's Johannesburgoperation, which has eight partners and around 45 staff, had 1995revenues of roughly R6 million, according to managing partner LennieFurman, while the firm's Durban office, which has two partners andaround 12 staff, had revenues of between R1.5 million and R1.8 million.The two are separate profit centres.Josman & Seidel, meanwhile, has revenues of roughly R5.5 million. Thefirm has eight partners and a total staff of around 50.Each of the firms will use the Nexia name in conjunction with their own- the first time that Nexia has allowed its affiliates to use its name.Previously, the Amsterdam-based group prohibited the use of its titleso as to shield the network from any possible litigation.Nigel Hodges, Nexia's executive director, said the change of heartfollowed legal advice. "We have taken legal advice both from the US andthe UK and the lawyers said there would be very little extra exposureby having a link name used by members," he explained. "We just have tomake it clear that we are an international firm of separate independentaccountants."Nexia's board of directors will meet in South Africa on March 10 and 11to rubberstamp the use of the Nexia name, and to formally approve bothfirms' applications.Initially, the local firms will operate independently of each other.According to Furman, the firms will have a common staff trainingpolicy, undertake joint marketing campaigns and tender jointly forcertain work.Furman cited dissatisfaction with CKL as its reason for quitting. "Wewere unhappy with the CKL situation," he said. AGN, into which CKL hasmerged, has "still got a long way to go to reach the size of Nexia", headded.Nick Blake, AGN's chief executive, said he was "disappointed" at thenews of Levitt Kirson's departure although it was not "totallyunexpected". He has arranged a meeting on January 18 with anunaffiliated firm in Cape Town in the hope that it may fill the gap.Sonny Josman, Josman & Seidel's managing partner, said the local firmsmay eventually merge."I would think we will make a decision on thatwithin the next three years," he said. According to Josman, thefederation may expand into Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe if suitablefirms can be found.HLB's chief executive, Peter Frost, said incompatibilities betweenJosman & Seidel and its Johannesburg member, Freedman Scher, resultedin the split of its federation.In addition to losing Josman & Seidel, Alleson & Company, HLB's Durbanaffiliate, has also given notice to quit. Frost said replacements inCape Town and Durban have already been lined up, although he declinedto name them. He was planning to meet with at least one of theprospective firms on January 15 in Johannesburg.Nexia has never had a presence in South Africa, although one of itspredecessors, Spicer & Oppenheim, was represented by Fischer HoffmanStride until 1990 when the local firm switched to Pannell Kerr Forster.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Ernst & Young chairman Philip Laskawy said: "Frivolouslawsuits in the past have drained resources from economic activitiessuch as research and development and new investment that fuel businessgrowth. Those with legitimate securities claims still have recoursethrough our legal system. By eliminating meritless lawsuits, the newbill will make the American economy more productive and efficient."A statement from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountantssaid: "The passage of this legislation is testament to the widely-heldbelief that the tide of frivolous securities litigation in this countrymust be stopped and sanity restored to a legal system clearly out ofbalance."This bill is a fair balance between the rights of truly- defraudedinvestors and those start-up companies and outside professionals whohave become victims of a small group of entrepreneurial lawyers abusingthe legal system."The bill had been awaiting the signature of the US President when IABwent to press with the final issue of last year (IAB 177), andproponents of the reforms were confident that Clinton would sign itinto law.However, he chose to veto the legislation under enormous pressure fromconsumer groups and trial lawyers.In the end, the veto was too late as both houses of Congress were ableto override his decision. The House of Representatives had backed thebill by 309 votes to 100 - 29 votes more than needed for the override.The Senate vote, 68 votes to 30 in favour, eventually proved sufficientto override the president's decision having originally fallen justshort of the total required.The new law is designed to eliminate routine filing of class actionlawsuits against public companies with no more evidence than a sharpdrop in stock price. It will also prevent the targeting of defendantswith"deep pockets", without regard to their culpability.The legislation provides a new safe harbour provision forforward-looking statements to encourage companies to provideprospective information without fear of litigation so long as thosestatements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied bymeaningful cautionary statements identifying factors that could causeactual results to differ materially from those projected.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

In February oflast year, KPMG's UK affiliate dropped the Peat Marwick name from itslogo (IAB 157)."Our new name will provide us with a single strong identity worldwideand help us to assist our clients to compete even more effectively inboth the Irish market and overseas," said managing partner JeromeKennedy.The SKC partnership was founded in 1972, although the firm's roots canbe traced back to 1876 when Stokes Brothers was formed. It became theIrish member of Peat Marwick International in 1980, and became theIrish representative of KPMG in 1987 following the global merger withKMG.SKC operates as one partnership in Ireland, unlike most of its Big Sixrivals which have separate entities north and south. The firm operatesout of four offices, employs over 800 people, and had fiscal 1995revenues of IR#36.2 million ($58 million), a drop of just over 1percent on the previous year.KPMG's move means that Craig Gardner Price Waterhouse is the only oneof the Big Six in Ireland to retain the local firm's name as part ofits identity.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

David Porter reportsIT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, andonly now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients towestern fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with thelocal Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to dobusiness. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keepingcontrol of that growth and turning it into profits is a differentmatter.Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, withfiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking evencurrently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according tomanaging partner Duleep Aluwihare."We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some ofour more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage tocontinue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run outof investment opportunities."Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one ofthe few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although itplans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice orCracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In orderto set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going tomaintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve inthis marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticketitems," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basicwork, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clientsinclude Poland's Finance Ministry.Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrandand Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived inPoland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess whenthe firm should start making a profit.Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking to IAB last July beforereturning to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We'renot just here for a financial return on investment, we're here to makesure that Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking atopening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of themarket, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firmhas acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bankand of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successesinclude the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, whichraised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing groupOkocim.PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgetedto start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After fiveyears in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-nationalcompany investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growthis running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where thefirm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clientsinclude Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatisedBank Gdanski.Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some timeare KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche."We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner BillDrysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where weare largely self-sufficient."Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at BarentsGroup, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of newclients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firmrecently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run itsGerman practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have afully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said."Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics groupSiemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polishclients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurancecompanies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices inCracow and Poznan during the last year.At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits getsshort shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm hasalways been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financialsupport from outside, other than very small amounts. All the otherfirms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they haveX amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of itsrivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw andSzczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is aheadache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line."Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It'sdifficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated intoa corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standardsright way."E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as muchbusiness as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when ithired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T."These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speakonly with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Oftenyou'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,all the rest will follow."The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in thePolish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is thesmallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strongposition in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firmtook action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz ashead of the Polish business (IAB 151). Leslaw Paga was head of thePolish Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is surethat Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitelyenhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said."There've been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its positionin Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industriesand service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong positionin financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say wewere latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"he explained.Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bankand of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's64-percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in thebanking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk andCracow during 1995.Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four othermid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co-ordinatingpartner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "thesort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging withanother firm.He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name theprospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to anothernetwork. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we arelooking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with aheavy UK or English language capability," he said.Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switchedinternational affiliations from CKL International to Alliott PeirsonInternational during 1995 (IAB 171). Baltic Accountants continues toalso represent RSM International and GMN International.The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issuefor many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firmslike to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to localclients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing inPolish equity partners than others.Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firmholding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and USaffiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has beengiven the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, whileKPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managedfirm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly owned by Deloitte ToucheTohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent fromthe start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the localpractices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agreethat fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gapbetween what western firms are charging and what local clients arewilling to pay is narrowing.One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment mustpay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet themarket half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper localfirms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it firstarrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in"strategic situations".Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of awestern-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came intoeffect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accountingprocedures more into line with International Accounting Standards andto move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on taxcompliance.Another area where western accountants are making more encouragingnoises is in relations between the international firms and the localChamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when thechamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted tothe chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners thatPoland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shuttingnew blood out of the profession.Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences beingmended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciaksaid. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of coursethere will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bitfrightening to them."While the situation regarding audit training and exams remainsunacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamberwill rethink its approach.Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous inadmitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems tohave gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably bereviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said."And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all partof the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make surethe chamber is a strong and active body."Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and thatthe growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feelsthat this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We allexperience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."Poland: Key Economic indicators                                  1994   1995*   1996*GDP real (% change)                5.1      6.0     5.0Industrial output (% change)      11.9     12.0    11.0Inflation (% change)                32       29      22Unemployment rate (%)             16.0     14.6    14.0Average monthly wages (ZL/month)   460      620     780Trade balance ($/M)               -836   -1,000  -1,500Current account ($/M)             -944   -1,400  -1,900Exchange rate (ZL/$)              2.27     2.50    2.85* ForecastSource: CreditanstaltLEADING ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING FIRMS IN POLAND - FEE INCOME                                      Most    Previous                                      recent  year's                                      fee     fee      Growth Effec-                       International  income  income   rate   tiveFirm                   affiliation    (US$/m) (US$/m)  (%)    dateArthur Andersen(1)     AA & Co, SC    20.0(2) 15.0(2)   n/a   Jul 95KPMG                   KPMG           12.0     7.8     53.8   Sep 95Coopers & Lybrand      C&L            11.0     7.7     42.9   Dec 95Ernst & Young          E&Y            10.0(2)  6.5(3)   n/a   Jun 95Deloitte & Touche      Deloitte Touche                       Tohmatsu                       International   9.9(4)  6.5(4)  52.3   Dec 95Misters Audytor        Summit          1.1     n/a      n/a   Jun 95TG Consultants         TGI             1.0(3)  n/a      n/a   Dec 95Sadren                 Pannell Kerr                       Forster         0.8     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Moore Stephens - RIR Revision        Moore Stephens  0.7(3)  n/a      n/a   Dec 95BDO Binder             BDO             0.6     0.4     50.0   Dec 95Baltic Accountants and Consultants       API, GMN, RSM   0.5     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Potworowski Kinast     Grant Thornton  0.5     0.5      0.0   Dec 95BRA Salustro Reydel    RSM             0.4     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Interexpert Poland     IA              0.4     n/a      n/a   Dec 94Tax-Audytor            Pannell Kerr                       Forster         0.3     n/a      n/a   Jun 95Arnold Hill            HLB             0.2     0.2      0.0   Apr 95Staniszewski & Richter Moores Rowland  0.2     0.2      0.0   Sep 95PNA Audit-Union        IGAF            0.0(2)  n/a      n/a   Dec 94(1) Figures do not include Andersen Consulting(2) Estimated by firm(3) Estimated by IAB(4) Figures exclude IDOMn/a = not availableNOTE: Other firms were contacted but did not respond.

All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING BULLETIN via NewsNetJanuary 10, 1996CAPTURING THE '90S SPIRITSpencer Lanthier, KPMG Canada's chairman and chief executive since1993, talks to Gundi Jeffrey about the firm's increasing emphasis onconsulting services, as well as the shift to a new corporate culturethat better reflects the spirit of the 1990sAFTER SEVERAL years of flat and even declining revenues, KPMG in Canadais poised to regain healthier growth. Much of this is due to a widerange of new service initiatives - mostly consulting-based - aimed atmeeting the needs of an increasingly- sophisticated and demandingmarketplace.Spencer Lanthier, 55, has been with the firm since 1960, becoming apartner in 1972, managing partner of the Toronto office in 1984 andvice-chairman of the Greater Toronto region and deputy chairman of thepartnership board in 1989. He has also served on various committees ofthe Quebec and Ontario institutes and, in 1993, was a member of theCanadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' corporate governance taskforce. He took on his present role with KPMG in 1993.IAB: Your revenues in the year to February 1995 were stagnant, butKPMG's worldwide results were up by more than 13 percent in fiscal1995. What do you expect your fiscal 1996 results to be like?Lanthier: We expect our fiscal 1996 top-line to be up about 5 percent.This is after four years of flat or negative growth, which has beenconsistent throughout our business in Canada.The reasons for this low growth relate to some major shifts in themarket for our services. Regulatory changes to audit requirementscontinue to hit all the big firms. Two years ago, for example, theCanada Business Corporations Act removed the requirement forprivately-owned companies to have audits. And more recently, theOntario Government eliminated the audit requirement for companies withrevenues of less than C$100 million ($73.66 million).Another issue is the high degree of corporate consolidation that hastaken place in Canada. For example, in 1994, one of our major clients,Rogers Communications, took over the publishing company Maclean Hunter.I can assure you that the fees for the combined company are a lot lessthan what they were separately.So all in all, the market for large-corporation audit services hasshrunk substantially and continues to decline. In that context, we'requite pleased with the growth of 5 percent in Canada this year.A lot of the growth internationally is coming from emerging marketssuch as eastern Europe and the Far East. But, in some of the moremature economies, the growth hasn't been that significant.IAB: The international firm has started reporting total billings toclients rather than net revenues. Will Canada follow suit?Lanthier: Internationally, our firm - and other firms also - is nowreporting our total billings per client. We've moved in that directionbecause we believe it more closely reflects the way we do business.For many years, the majority of our billings were based on the time wespent on the job. But now, we have more alliances and co-venturearrangements. Often, we act as prime contractor in projects thatinvolve various sub-contractors. In the past, we would have treated oursub-contractors' billings as expense reimbursement and deducted themfrom total billings to report our net fee income. We've concluded thatit makes more sense to reflect our total sub-contractors billings asrevenues. In summary, like most other major businesses, KPMG's revenuessimply reflect our total worldwide invoices to clients.In Canada, however, we'll continue to report on a net fee income basisfor the time being. The reason for this is that the Canadian firms haveagreed for many years on a set of precise guidelines for reportingincome to ensure compatibility.IAB: KPMG Canada has launched quite a few initiatives and service areasover the past year. Can you tell me about them and what you are hopingto achieve with them?Lanthier: The first is KPMG Investigation and Security Inc. This newgroup, headed by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissionerand past Interpol president Norman Inkster, offers a full range ofimpartial investigative services to businesses in Canada and around theglobe (IAB 176). KPMG ISI assists companies in cases where traditionalpolicing agencies are no longer able to help.It's really an extension of the forensic accounting division. We'recontinuing to offer traditional forensic accounting services, but we'realso expanding into the corporate security field. We did this becausewe knew that most [Canadian] police forces have been forced by cutbacksto place white collar crime very low on their list of priorities.Not only do we investigate white collar crime, but we also look at thewhole security arrangements companies have in place, not just thetraditional internal controls. For example, are they protecting theirexecutives adequately? Are their facilities secure? In the wake of lastyear's Oklahoma bombing, we received several inquiries from clientsinterested in reviewing their security.Also, as Canadian companies expand offshore, there is a need for themto review the viability and integrity of potential joint venturepartners. We can help in this area.We've been delighted with the results of this division already andwe've hired, at last count, six more former police officers.Another success story is our ISO 9000 practice, launched in early 1995in six centres across the country. KPMG Quality Registrar is one ofonly 12 accredited ISO 9000 registrars in Canada. And so far, we arethe only Big Six firm that has obtained this accreditation.We have two major services. First we certify that clients haveprocesses that comply with ISO standards. Then there is an annualcompliance report, that ensures they continue to be in compliance.This work is really a natural extension of our audit services and we'vebeen very successful with it in Canada. In the first full year, ourfees were about C$2 million.Next, very recently, we established a strategic alliance with MDManagement, the financial services subsidiary of the Canadian MedicalAssociation. This will allow KPMG to provide physicians and theirfamilies with accounting, tax and business advice. We were the onlynational accounting firm to participate in this alliance.KPMG's benchmarking initiative was launched in 1995, with the firm'sfirst national benchmark study of the corporate finance function. Thisstudy examines the role of the finance department in large companies -those with revenues of more than C$150 million - and middle-marketcompanies, with revenues of C$15 million to C$150 million, in themanufacturing, retail and distribution sectors.By focusing on performance measures such as cost, productivity andquality in finance, the study aims to help our clients better gaugetheir relative performance and identify opportunities for improvement.KPMG's new Centre for Risk Assessment and Control Design wasestablished to help organisations develop and implement cost-effectivecontrol and risk management systems, and to exchange best practices,particularly in the area of control and risk assessment.In February 1995, we rolled out our forest management practice, and ithas grown steadily. Three provinces, Ontario, British Columbia andAlberta, have in recent years passed new forestry legislation requiringcompanies to comply with cutting standards, reforestation, and so on.We help them ensure that they have the processes in place to complywith the regulation and help them with their reporting to theregulatory authorities. It's not a huge practice yet, but one wherethere is a real client need that we're trying to meet.We also have a rapidly-growing SAP and Baan implementation practice.SAP has really taken off in the industrialised world and has become thedominant software standard and dominant software platform for financialmanagement systems. We, together with others, are registered suppliersand implementers of SAP. Baan is something similar.I believe our Aboriginal services practice has also been a big success.More than 20 offices provide a range of financial and managementconsulting services to Aboriginal communities across Canada. Withcontinuing progress in land claim settlements, Aboriginal people arebecoming a major economic force in Canada, so the growth potential forthis service area is significant.IAB: I understand that KPMG has developed something called"ProjectGlobe", which has identified 14 service areas for growth. What doesthat mean for the Canadian firm?Lanthier: Project Globe is a framework that gives our consultingpractices around the world a common set of priorities. We adopted it ayear or so ago and it involves our focusing on three broad areas ofservice.The first is enabling technologies, which include services such asinformation technology strategy and systems implementation. Theperformance improvement area includes human resources and qualitymanagement services, among others. Strategic financial managementincludes capital transactions, treasury management and similarfinancial consulting services.IAB: Now to an old favourite that won't go away: professionalliability. What is KPMG doing in terms of risk management strategy todampen the threat of legal action?Lanthier: The number of lawsuits against accounting firms in Canada hasdropped over the past five years. Whether that's a result of improvedrisk management or a result of a better economy is hard to say. Most ofthe big lawsuits that we've seen in Canada happened as a result of thereal estate melt-down of five or six years ago. They had nothing to dowith audit failure. Since the real estate markets have stabilised,there haven't been any other major lawsuits coming forward.We have three simple rules for risk management: be careful about who wework for; be careful about what we do for them and be careful aboutwhom we assign to do the work. I think we all pay closer attention tothose rules than we did a few years ago. IAB: What do you see as KPMGCanada's biggest challenge in the next few years?Lanthier: I am focusing on two major areas. We have to grow our topline. You have to grow to be successful in our country. We're obviouslythe largest firm, with the largest market share, which makes it moredifficult to grow.That brings up the question of our core services. The audit is adeclining market. So is tax compliance.More and more taxpayers are buying tax preparation software for C$100or so, rather than coming to us. In the future, they could bedownloading tax software from the Internet for free.However, the total market for consulting services is expanding rapidly.That's why we've put a big emphasis on developing new,consulting-oriented services at a fairly rapid rate.Our second challenge is human resources - our people. Twenty-five yearsago, firms like ours were the employer of choice for a lot of thepeople going through business schools and other faculties. Butrecently, we've become a less attractive option. Some of our humanresource policies, cultures and practices simply aren't up to date. Werecognise that.To that end, in June, we brought on board a human resources changemanagement person at a very senior level. John Ellsworth brings yearsof global HR experience, having worked in general management consultingand with major corporations.John joined KPMG as a senior partner and a member of our managementcommittee. He is working closely with me and other people in the firmto help us change our culture. We want to ensure that we can attractthe best people, that we reward based on competence and not just onseniority. In the past, we have operated as a rather militaristichierarchy. We are determined to break down some of the barriers thathave existed, to move people forward, allow them to progress when theyare ready.It will take a long time for us to change and upgrade and get away fromthe sweatshop mentality that has dominated the accounting profession inthe past. You don't change a culture that's been ingrained for 75 yearsover six months or a year, but we're determined to make progress.These are my two priorities - to change our culture over the next fewyears and to grow our top line. The two go hand in hand. If you havethe best people, you'll grow.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The compilation of reports from Fed districtsconfirmed the prevailing view of an economy lurching along in low gearwith consumer spending anemic and the housing sector faltering.  Thecredit crunch, said the Fed report, is still with us.  The data in theeight-times-a-year report was collected before September 9 and sooffered a relatively recent snapshot of the US economy.  If it was notan inspiring view of the economy, it was by the same token notalarming either, and was consistent with the consensus view ofaffairs.  As recent data have suggested, the Fed likewise foundmanufacturing to be the strongest sector.  "Industrial production hasprovided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part exportdemand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation," the report said."As yet, there is little sign of a sizeable rebound in consumerspending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery,"it added.  Bank lending is still soft in most areas, often because ofreduced demand for loans, said the report, which is issued in advanceof meetings of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.Although mortgage interest rates are sharply lower, home sales haveslowed in San Francisco, Chicago and elsewhere, and commercialconstruction has virtually halted in many of the reporting Feddistricts.Elsewhere, a small rise in August housing starts gainsaid expectationson the part of Wall Street economists of a slight decline.Construction starts on single-family homes and apartments rose 0.6% toan annual rate of 1.07 million when the consensus among economists hadbeen for a 1.06 million rate.  That was the fifth straight rise forthe homebuilding industry, feared to be falling back into a slump.Nevertheless, the 0.6% rise was less vigorous than July's revised 2.4%gain, itself toned down from an earlier estimated 3.7% rise.Construction in the first eight months of this year was off 21% fromthe 1990 period.Political events were also driving the markets on Wednesday.  Therewas a report from Tass, the Soviet news agency, that Boris Yeltsin,leader of the ascendant democratic forces in the ex-Soviet Union, hadsuffered a slight heart attack.  That gave additional tone to the USdollar but did not have any noticeable impact on the Treasuriesmarket.  Markets also were watching a faceoff between President Bushand Saddam Hussein of Iraq.  Bush said US Air Force units would go toSaudi Arabia to provide better protection for the kingdom and, ifnecessary, to force Iraqi compliance with a UN resolution calling forinspection of weapons stocks.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991US CREDIT MARKETSThe Treasury market, which has become accustomed to having things goits way, did not like look of the housing starts data and sold off toa small extent but bounced right back.  That was typical of thesession, during which US government securities prices were mildlybuffeted by a series of factors but showed resilience.  The marketalso turned down a bit when the December Treasury bond futurescontract ran into some tough resistance at 99 and fell back to 9818/32.  Prices also declined on news that US Air Force units will besent to Saudi Arabia.  The Beige Book, however, was almost completelyignored.  The benchmark 30-year bond finished the day about 1/8 pointlower in price to yield 7.92% after 7.91% at the close on Tuesday.The 10-year note moved up slightly to yield 7.59% compared with 7.60%.Bills were virtually unchanged.The worst that could be said for the market right now is that it isindecisive.  However, sentiment is still positive in the absence ofany data seriously challenging the thesis that the economy is notmaking any headway and that inflation thus poses no danger.  As wesaid yesterday, the market is unlikely to be perturbed by mildlypositive data.  But the durable goods figure coming out September 25has it a bit worried.  The last one, for July, rose 10.7%, and asimilar surprise could test the mettle of fixed-income investors.  Itwould not surprise us if the market took some profits ahead of thatfigure, particularly if the trade and employment figures on Thursdaysuggest economic quickening.  Money supply, out late Thursday, willalso be closely watched.  Nonetheless, the bias is towards furtherprice rises and yield declines.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETSEveryone in the market keeps avowing bearish sentiment, but thedollar's behavior on Wednesday suggests otherwise.  Short-covering onYeltsin's heart trouble and the Bush-Saddam confrontation hadsomething to do with it.  But from our point of view the news breaksjust amplified the stirring of the dollar.  With many participants outfor the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday the market was thin and volatile,making it hard to draw firm conclusions.  But the dollar looks morebiddish.  In Europe it was supported at DM1.6650 and capped atDM1.6775, but in New York the news gave it enough punch to reachDM1.6940 before falling back to close at DM1.6850 after DM1.6750Tuesday.  Players will probably sell it again, but may be gettingtired of working the downside.The reasoning behind bearish sentiment all this week has been that theFed is going to ease again, which as we have noted before should notbe taken as a foregone conclusion.  Even if that turns out to be true,is the market likely to spend its time between now and Thanksgivinglooking for that ease?  More likely it will focus on something else,and that could be US economic numbers.  The indicators out onWednesday were not great news, but they were not bad news either, andsomewhere along the line here the data may swing market sentiment.For now, though, the numbers are indecisive, and so the market islikely to work in a range for a while, eventually testing DM1.70 butprobably not cracking it decisively.  Therefore we would modify ouradvice to suggest that if the dollar explores the bottom of its rangeagain, it looks like a good buy, but should not be held too far intothe DM1.6850 area -- unless the market shifts resistance up to DM1.70sooner than expected.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991BUY/SELL LEVELS FOR VARIOUS CURRENCIESBUY --           SELL --         BUY --           SELL --DM1.6950/US$     DM1.6750/US$    US$1.72/STG      US$1.74/STGY135.50/US$      Y133.50/US$     FF5.77/US$       FF5.71/US$SF1.48/US$       SF1.46/US$      CAN$1.1375/US$   CAN$1.1325/US$Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991NEW YORK FX CLOSINGSDM1.6847/52      FF5.7395/25     DFL1.8990/00     ESC144.65/75Y134.32/37       CAN$1.1369/74   DKR6.5090/10     MEX$3058/59SF1.4715/25      LIT1261/63      ASCH11.86/88     A$0.7999/04STG1.7290/00     BFR34.71/73     PTA105.61/68     HK$7.7568/78Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL MARKET ALERT via NewsNetSeptember 19, 1991TREASURY SECURITIES AND FED FUNDS30-YEARS 102.07-11 (7.92%)       10-YEARS 101.25-29 (7.59%)2-YEARS 100.11-12 (6.17%)3-MONTHS 5.18-16 (5.32%)         6-MONTHS 5.23-21 (5.44%)FED FUNDS 4 1/2%Back to Headline List WT02-B39-12IA074-000493-B041-297http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi89.html 205.156.212.5 19970122011020 text/html 59046HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:08:20 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:07 GMTContent-length: 58859Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi89.html Sample Issue Copyright INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNet January 19, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES TURKISH BOT PROJECTS EMERGE DESPITE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES (1523 words) RUSSIAN GOLD FINANCING SET TO TRIGGER MORE PROJECTS?

Other countries have since left Turkey far behind.ECAs take on riskExport credit agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks have taken onsubstantial risk for the $1.4bn hydroelectric power and dam project atBirecik on the Euphrates River and the $865m water supply and treatmentplant at Izmit, some 80 miles east of Istanbul.A new readiness among commercial lenders to take on Turkish risk wasborne out by the oversubscription of unsecured commercial loans, pricedat 225 basis points (bp).A dozen more BOT projects are awaiting approval, mostly in the powersector, where the government has forecast growth in demand forelectricity of almost 250 per cent over the next 15 years.  Prior toher resignation, prime minister Tansu Ciller said that BOT projectsworth $16bn were needed in Turkey over the next decade.These include the 1,200 MW Ilisu Dam on the Tigris River, expected tocost some $2.5bn, for which tenders are expected soon.``It should certainly be quicker to do deals in future as there is nowa reference point for the Turkish market'', says Mr Howard Lack, thedirector at London-based Chase Investment Bank, the arranger forsyndicated lending at both Birecik and Izmit.``Before Birecik, the Treasury had no previous experience of a complexstructure that involved some 40 documents, but they will understand theissues and the risks that are being asked in the future'', Mr Lacksays.Banks' analysisAnalysts are examining the conflicting signals coming from Turkey toweigh the extent of their participation in future operations.``We are mindful of the election result, and like most banks, areadopting a wait-and-see approach'', Mr Alan Paton, head of trade andexport finance of Societe Generale's London branch tells ITF.``These are early days -- it is far from clear how things will go'', MrPaton adds.  SocGen took a strong hand in syndicated lending finalisedlate in 1995 for Birecik and Izmit.Adding complexity to western views of an increasingly important marketwhere the political situation may lay unresolved until February wasTurkey's entry into the EU customs union on 1 January 1996.``The EC vote was a positive factor, but we are continuing to monitorthe progress of the Turkish economy following the elections'',Mr Dennis Kennedy, NCM Credit Insurance's underwriter for the MiddleEast, North Africa and Turkey tells ITF.A series of recent economic and financial crises that came to a head in1994 has drawn comparisons with Mexico from some quarters.NCM said that Turkey represented ``a market with enduring economicproblems'' in a country summary issued in September.The ratings agency, Standard & Poors, revised down its country outlookfrom ``positive'' to ``stable'' in October.Recent estimates suggest the budget deficit for the first quarter of1996 will be greater than for the whole of 1995.The market fell under close scrutiny in 1994, when massive capitalflight led to plummeting sovereign debt ratings, an inflation level of126 per cent and currency devaluation of over 50 per cent.Reserves upHowever, the economy began to grow in the first quarter of 1995 andforeign reserves had risen to $16.3bn by September, compared to $3bn inApril 1994.  Inflation is also seen as less of a danger.As the macroeconomic situation improves, Turkish borrowers arereturning to the international market to borrow on longer maturitiesand narrower margins, which are creeping back to pre-1994 crisislevels.Turkiye Garanti Bankasi secured a benchmark two-year $150m facility inOctober at 65bp over Libor, marking the first loan over one year for aTurkish bank in 1995.ECA supportECAs took 64 per cent of the risk in the ground-breaking 672MW Birecikscheme, providing 151/2-year cover that includes a 51/2-year constructionperiod.Germany's Hermes insured DM585m (#256m) to support the principaldeveloper, Philipp Holzmann.Also involved were Belgian, Austrian and French ECAs, which guaranteedaround DM803m in bank loans to the sponsor Birecik Company, whichprovided DM327m in equity towards the 15-year concession.Eight-year commercial lending worth DM462m made up the senior debtpackage.Co-arrangers were Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, BayerischeLandesbank, Girokredit, Generale Bank and Societe Generale.Forty-four banks participated in the two tranches, which wereoversubscribed by 30 per cent.  Margins were 100bp over Libor for theECA loan and 225bp for the commercial deal.Given that aspects of the legal situation attaching to BOT schemes inTurkey remain unresolved -- all concession-type contracts fall under thejurisdiction of an administrative court -- lenders have extractedgovernment guarantees insuring them against force majeure or default byBirecik Company.The Birecik Company has protected itself against default on tariffpayments by the offtaker, the state-owned Turkiye Elektrik UretimIletim (TEAS), by obtaining government guarantees.``Future deals will need less support, with more risk being borne bythe commercial parties and banks'', says Mr Lack.Water projectThe UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has taken theleading ECA role in Turkey's second BOT scheme: a 15-year concession toimprove the supply of drinking and industrial water to the Turkish cityof Izmit.ECGD is providing a 100 per cent guarantee for $236m in commerciallending, which secured about $803m in bank debt.France's Coface has extended insurance for a $180m tranche, withJapan's EID/MITI supporting a further $40m in loans over seven years.The combination reflects ECGD's growing collaboration with its Frenchand Japanese counterparts (ITF 252/11).Untied lending worth $180m has been agreed by the Export-Import Bank ofJapan (Jexim).Banks have provided $167m on an unsecured basis, split into a $116mseven-year facility and a $51m five-year standby facility.  These wereoversubscribed by 15 per cent.Co-arrangers were National Westminster Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bankand  SocGen -- the latter lending over $83m.Repayments to the project company, Izmit Su, are to be made in dollars.Project security resides in offtake agreements and guarantees providedby the Municipality of Izmit backed by the Turkish Treasury.The sponsor -- which has injected some $139m in equity and comprises thelocal companies Guris and Gama and the Municipality of Izmit, alongsidethe UK's Thames Water and Japan's Mitsui & Co and Sumitomo Corporation-- will commence its operating period in December 1998.Breathing spaceMost ECAs have taken a watching brief in the immediate post-electionperiod.ECGD had planned a cover review in 1995, but this was postponed becauseof the December polling.The UK agency has ``one or two reasonable-sized deals in thepipeline'', according to a spokesman, ``but, as always, these may takeawhile to come to fruition.  Following Izmit, almost all the coveravailable in the market has been committed''.``The two deals both went well, but took quite a lot of the availableappetite out of the marketplace'', SocGen's Mr Paton observes.  ``Therewould be an appetite for the right project, but ECAs form a veryimportant leverage aspect for commercial banks''.Private marketsTurkey remains a popular market for forfaiters.The London-based Standard Bank will look at 360-day paper, principallyfor commodity-based short-term deals.  Standard is doing business up tothree years for capital goods transactions.``Margins have moved slightly upwards due to the uncertainty after theelection, but have otherwise been quite stable since the marketrecovered in 1995'', says a spokesman.Standard will look at paper from a range of banks, including two of thepublic sector institutions, TC Ziraat Bankasi and Turkiye Halk Bankasi.Bankers and insurers are generally agreed that Turkey's private sectorbanks may offer more scope for trade finance.NCM highlighted the local private sector as a much better risk forexporters in its September report, pointing out that the majority offoreign exchange reserves are held privately.``Public sector companies, currently comprising about half the legaleconomy, are in the main loss-making and debt-ridden'', said thereport.NCM's trading terms extend to a maximum 180 days, with open accountbusiness acceptable where buyers, mainly private, can show a goodrecent track record or a visible hard currency trading surplus.Analysts have noted that this is more commonplace as economicliberalisation has freed companies from political interference.Most businesses require the security of a letter of credit or bank-endorsed bills of exchange.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996RUSSIAN GOLD FINANCING SET TO TRIGGER MORE PROJECTS?The completion and disbursement of a ground-breaking $100m gold minefinancing has triggered hopes among western financiers that moreRussian projects will move ahead as the government gradually eases theregulatory environment.The move complements activity by western financiers in Russia'shydrocarbons sector, where protracted manoeuverings have eventually ledto the provision of US export credit guarantees for projects under theoil and gas framework agreement (OGFA) (ITF 247/6).The arranger of the limited recourse gold deal, Deutsche MorganGrenfell (DMG), took two years to structure and negotiate thetransaction with the Russian authorities and the lenders.The deal ``sets a precedent for international debt financing for suchprojects in Russia'', says a DMG director closely involved with theproject, Mr Andrew Seton.Funds for the project in the far eastern Magadan region were releasedin mid-December, following the signature of loan agreements in Junebetween the Omolon Gold Mining Company and the European Bank forReconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the US' Overseas PrivateInvestment Corporation (Opic) (ITF 240/3).Opic contributed guarantees worth $52.5m and will also extend $60m ininvestment insurance.Omolon, a joint venture between the Denver-based Cyprus Amax MineralsCompany and Russian (mainly mining) concerns, is the first jointventure to receive a licence to mine gold in Russia.The company will use the loan proceeds to develop the Kubaka lode golddeposit, located some 200 miles off the Arctic Circle.Repayments from the sale of the mine's output will be channelledthrough a licensed offshore account.Security for the lenders is based on a series of long-term contractsthat have replaced Russian government payment risk with contractualrisk.In return for mixed hard currency and rouble payments, the Russiangovernment will be allocated first claim on the mine's output,anticipated at an annual 300,000 ounces of gold and 200,000 ounces ofsilver.If payments do not ensue, the Russian Foreign Trade Bank, in its roleas agent for the government and the joint venture, will export themetals to western buyers.``People were not prepared to lend or invest on the basis where thegovernment held a monopoly over gold production and exports'', anotherbanker specialising in CIS minerals tells ITF.  ``Lenders are happywith this deal -- and the structure is likely to be replicated for othergold projects''.DMG's activities in Russia and the former Soviet Union have raisednearly $4bn in project finance to date.Further EBRD activity in Russia includes support for short-term tradefinance under its Trade Facilitation Programme (ITF 248/2).Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES FUND PAKISTAN IPPA new independent power project (IPP) is going ahead in Pakistan'sPunjab state backed by the Export-Import Bank of Japan (Jexim) and theWorld Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC).As its contribution to 12-year Japanese buyer credits worth Y18.2bn(#115m) for the 365MW Lal Pir II scheme in Muzzafargagh, Jexim is toprovide Y10.9bn as a direct loan on its own account.  Around Y4bn ofthis is dollar-denominated.The remaining Y7.3bn is being co-financed with a syndicate of 15commercial banks, nine of which are from Japan.  Arranging thefacility, which is priced at 240 basis points (bp) over Libor, is thescheme's financial advisor, Bank of Tokyo, with Sanwa Bank, DeutscheBank, Dresdner Bank and ING Bank.The political risk in this tranche will be insured by EID/MITI.The deal was reportedly well over-subscribed, principally reflecting anappetite from banks that missed Lal Pir I (ITF 234/3).The proceeds will be deployed by the sponsor, AES Pak Gen Company(AESPG), to finance the purchase of equipment from Mitsubishi HeavyIndustries, to be supplied through the trading house NichimenCorporation.Jexim's security in the project pivots on the government of Pakistan'sguarantees for currency conversion and transfers; the purchase ofgenerated electricity over 30 years by the Pakistan Water & PowerDevelopment Authority (WAPDA) and the supply of fuel by Pakistan StateOil Company.IFC roleThe IFC has agreed an A-loan/B-loan structure worth $70m for the $349moil-fired scheme, which is to be implemented on a build-own-operate(BOO) basis.A $20m A-loan has been extended over 15 years.The $50m B-facility has a 12-year tenor and a margin of 275bp.  IFC hasalso taken a portion of the $95m equity injected by AESPG, which wascreated by the US' AES Corporation in June 1995.The participation of the World Bank's investment arm follows an A-loan/B-loan facility agreed for a $138m project in Karachi last July(ITF 242/5).Jexim and the IFC have worked together in Pakistan's power sector onLal Pir I and the country's first limited recourse power financing, theground-breaking Hub River scheme (ITF 222/1).The Lal Pir II project will help to alleviate power shortages inPakistan estimated at around 2000MW.

The question of the Chernobyl nuclear powerplant is also high on governments' agendas.Jexim observed that the G7 and EU nations had agreed in mid-1994 toprovide $4bn or more ``over the next two years'' and remained ``unitedin their recognition that the Ukraine's economic stability is importantto world peace, in view of its nuclear capabilities''.The Y18bn untied loan element of the package -- intended as co-financingwith the World Bank -- is part of the $200m in balance of paymentssupport, drawn from Jexim's funds for the development initiative,committed last March by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese primeminister.Other governments to commit export credits include the US, Germany,Italy, Canada and France.The IMF has approved an SDR1.5bn standby package; the World Bank hasalready committed loans worth around $720m; and the EU an Ecu225m loanfor balance of payments support.During a visit to Kiev last summer, Mr James Wolfensohn, the World Bankpresident, said the bank could provide over $1bn in the next threeyears.But these loans could be in jeopardy if a rebellious parliament has itsway over issues such as privatisation and farm reform -- and Mr Kuchma'sreform programme is blocked.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996UKRAINE SECURES FINANCE FOR AGRICULTUREKiev has secured the first financing from the EBRD/NCM co-operationagreement on projects in eastern Europe.The Dutch insurer and the European Bank for Reconstruction &Development are backing a $20.7m agricultural project in the Myronavkaregion, which includes Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.NCM's participation involves insuring Dutch exports of machinery andfarm vehicles.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996ECAS MOBILISE SUPPORT FOR EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI OIL REFINERYExport credit agencies (ECAs) are preparing to mobilise cover for anEgyptian/Israeli joint venture scheme, the Middle East Oil Refinery(MIDOR).Sponsors have yet to choose between Banque National de Paris (BNP) andNational Westminster Bank to head supplier credit arrangements, but afinancial close is expected by construction start, at the end ofMarch 1996.Export credit cover from Israel worth between $100-$150m has beensecured.Further ECA-backed loans for the scheme will total an anticipated$600m.  The eventual choice of agencies will depend on the sources ofconstruction equipment, but agencies from France, Germany, Japan,Belgium and the UK have expressed interest.A construction contract has been signed with a European consortiumcomprising Italy's Technipetrol and France's Technip, following a hardfought tender.Spain's Tecnicas Reunidas has been awarded a large subcontracting deal,which involves the provision of supplier credit guarantees worth $100mby Compania Espanola de Seguros de Credito a la Exportacion (CESCE).Regional banks, including the National Bank of Egypt, Misr Bank andIsraeli General Bank are to provide working capital worth about $370m.The European Investment Bank has also committed around $300m.Some $240-$250m of equity is to be injected into the project.

Thisrose to $25.6bn, up from $19.9bn in the first half of 1994.Particular note was made of banks' claims up to 360 days, which rose asa percentage of total claims.  A growing volume of trade finance andbanks' reluctance to expose themselves longer term were among reasonsfor this.The favoured target region for commercial lenders was Asia, wherelending jumped by $33.7bn, compared to $15.6bn in 1994.The report noted a ``greater selectivity'' in lending to Latin America,which fell by $4.2bn, although it seemed ``too early to say'' whetherthe Mexican crisis had impacted on this trend.A greater global dependence on short-term capital flows has ledcommercial banks to assess their portfolios on a more frequent basis.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996GRIFFIN LAUNCHES EXPORT INVOICE DISCOUNTING SERVICEGriffin Factors has opted to follow its main competitors and launch anexport invoice discounting service to cater for larger exportcompanies.Exporters with their solid in-house credit control unit will now beoffered finance, without the obligation to accept a traditional ``fullfactoring'' arrangement.An offshoot of Midland Bank, Griffin was one of the first factors tooffer domestic clients an invoice discounting service (under whichfinance is provided against invoices without direct involvement by thefinance house in the process of collection, unless a payment fallsseriously overdue).But it stood back from the industry-wide move into invoice discountingof exports, continuing to trust to traditional full factoring -- underwhich it retains responsibility for collecting all payments.And this approach seemed to be justified, because in most recent years,it managed to remain in second place in the league table ofinternational business handled by the UK's factors -- last year thevolume of exports it factored was up by 25 per cent at more than #90m.Griffin management was also concerned about the practical difficultiesof getting involved in collection of overdue invoice-discountedpayments.  A particular worry was a German law that allowed buyers torefuse to allow their debts to be assigned.Market pressuresBut market pressures on Griffin to follow competitors, such asInternational Factors, into the invoice discounting of exportsincreased.  There was strong demand for the service from clients andindustry figures showed that the spectacular growth in invoicediscounting was far outstripping the more measured expansion oftraditional factoring.There was, particularly, an increased number of larger exporters -- whowere not prepared to involve a factor in their routine paymentcollection -- seeking trade-based finance.Last year, Griffin dipped a toe quietly into the water.  It alsoequipped itself to cope with a change, recruiting specialist languagestaff who could chase up foreign payments.And, with fortunate timing, the law in Germany was clarified to allowforeign export suppliers to promise repayment to their financiers.There was clearly a risk that Griffin could lose clients who wanteddiscounted finance, if it continued to stand aside from this trend. But it still remains committed to further development of thetraditional factoring operation.  Recently, it set up an EDI servicethat will allow clients to send in invoices electronically, without theneed for paper back-up.  Restricted for now to domestic business, thiswill eventually be available to exporters.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996WOLFENSOHN RINGS ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES AT WORLD BANKMr James Wolfensohn, World Bank president, has restructured topmanagement posts at the bank in a drive to improve efficiency and tobuild incentives and accountability into the organisation's culture.In the first significant management initiative at the bank since heassumed control last June, Mr Wolfensohn has increased his team ofmanaging directors from three to five and created a new ExecutiveCommittee.The changes became operational on 1 January 1996.In a memo circulated among more than 6,000 World Bank personnel inDecember, the president explained the initiative as part of hisoverriding aim ``to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the Bank'swork and its objectives'' by providing ``a framework for liberating theenergies and skills of the rest of the organisation''.The managing directors, who will become directly involved in specificday-to-day management tasks, have been allocated the following roles:* Mr Gautam Kaji will be joined by Mr Caio Koch-Weser, former vice-president for the Middle East and Africa, for a joint controlling rolein charge of the bank's operations, policies and programmes.Moving into the Middle East and Africa seat is Mr Kemal Dervis, who hasworked before on the Middle East.Mr Koch-Weser, a Brazilian, was a very familiar face across the region,including at various stages of the Middle East peace process.Mr Spiros Voyadzis, another Middle East expert, has been named theWorld Bank's special representative to the EU and manager of the bank'snew Brussels office.* Mr Sven Sandstrom assumes charge of Human and Information Resourcesand Management, in addition to Corporate Planning and Budgeting.Mr Wolfensohn has identified personnel and training as the bank'sgreatest problem areas.  According to the memo, Mr Sandstrom has beengiven a two-year brief to turn around the bank's traditional ``armlockof bureaucracy'' -- where task managers are reportedly separated fromupper levels by five management layers -- and to create a ``resultsculture''.* Ms Jessica Einhorn has been promoted to manage activities in financeand resource mobilisation, supervising vice presidency functionspreviously covered by the treasurer, the Controller, Financial Policyand Risk Management and Cofinancing and Financial Advisory Services.She will also assume the chairmanship of the bank's Finance Committee.* Mr Richard Frank is to chair the Private Sector Development Group,with responsibility for working with senior managers of the Bank Groupand to evolve the bank's overall private sector strategy, which ismaking greater use of commercial markets through instruments, such asits revamped guarantees (ITF 248/10).Mr Frank has previously been responsible for working on the Bank'sfuture policy direction.The moves will ``provide clear lines of authority for the main areas ofour business and to strengthen the Group's ability to address majorstrategic issues'', said Mr Wolfensohn.Committee launchThe five managing directors will form part of a new 10-strong ExecutiveCommittee, which is to hold meetings on a weekly basis.The Committee includes Mr Mark Malloch Brown, promoted from director tovice-president of External Relations, and chief economist Mr MichaelBruno, also elevated to vice presidential status.Mr Malloch Brown has long links with non-governmental organisations andthe media.  His arrival in 1994 gave the bank a fresh approach topublic relations.Mr Bruno is a widely respected former governor of the Central Bank ofIsrael.Where matters are related to the larger World Bank Group, the committeewill be enlarged to accommodate the executive vice president of theInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), Mr Jannik Lindbaek, and theexecutive vice president of the Multilateral Investment Guaranteeagency (MIGA), Mr Akira Iida.This fits a pattern profiled at the October 1995 World Bank/IMF annualmeeting in Washington, where exploratory strategies were announced forgreater co-ordination within the Group.Further changes in 1996 will involve the uptake by 50 top executives ofmanagement courses and the secondment of executive staff into industryand private sector banks.Mr Johannes Linn, whose experience at the bank includes several senioreconomics posts, became the World Bank's vice-president for Europe andCentral Asia on 1 January, following the retirement of Mr WilfredThalwitz.Mr Timothy Thahane, the World Bank vice-president who narrowly missedout becoming president of the African Development Bank, occupies a newvice-presidency for United Nations affairs.  This office is intended tobetter co-ordinate the World Bank's relations with the UN system.He is replaced as vice-president and World Bank group secretary by MrShengman Zhang, executive director for China since November 1994.Mr Wolfensohn stressed in the memo that the goal of the bank continuesto be the promotion of sustainable development ``in the broadestsense'', in particular the alleviation of poverty and assistingcountries in transition.  ``I have made it clear that I expect themanagement to work with me at top pressure'', he concluded.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996WORLD BANK AGREES NEW LENDING FOR EASTERN EUROPEThe World Bank has agreed new lending for eastern Europe, including a$160m loan to boost Poland's power sector.

Choice is offered between a group wide strategy orterms and conditions that more closely reflect individual subsidiaries'needs at three different levels:* rates for premium and service;* indemnification levels;* the ``excess'' threshold below which losses are for the account ofthe policy holder.For UK-based multinationals wishing to develop a gradual group widecredit insurance strategy, the scheme can be initiated through just oneor two subsidiaries and extended at a later date.Euro Trader is the latest in a series of product developments fromcredit insurers battling for UK market share (ITF 251/4).It also marks a further stage in a trend increasingly discernible inthe single European market whereby intra-EU deals are helping to fuelthe expansion of short-term political risk cover capacity amonginsurers (ITF 252/13).Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996EAST EUROPEAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING ON HOLDThe European Union assistance programme to the CIS countries iscurrently on hold, following opposition led by Spain to the way thecontracts are awarded.The TACIS programme, with funds of about Ecu500m, provides technicalassistance and know-how for economic and reform programmes proposed bythe governments of the 12 former Soviet countries and Mongolia.Spain has blocked the programme for 1996 because it wants reform of theway the contracts are tendered and different criteria used in theirallocation.  Privately, officials say Spain is opposed to the programmebecause their companies only win about 2 per cent of the contracts.Last March, officials proposed new guidelines for the TACIS programmeto start this year, which would permit TACIS funds to be invested insmall and medium-sized enterprises and in infrastructure projects.These funds are intended to be strategic investments that wouldcatalyse much larger funds from the World Bank, European Bank forReconstruction and Development and other institutional investors.Similar investments have been made successfully in Central Europe.New formulaThis new formula, extending the traditional mandate of the TACISprogramme, has already been approved by Parliament, but was blocked inthe Council of Ministers.  Officials plan to put it before the Councilagain, but say that an ``educated guess'' would anticipate it beingrejected again.The most likely outcome, say officials, is that the Council willeventually approve a continuation of the former programme, restrictingfunds to technical assistance and know-how transfer for one more year.The new programme is likely to be postponed until 1997.Meanwhile, officials are continuing to work on the programmes approvedusing the 1995 budget.  Assuming the Council finally approves the TACISfunds before the summer, officials are confident that all the fundscould be committed before the end of 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996DG BANK SETS UP FORFAITING OPERATION IN LONDONDeutschegenossenschafts (DG Bank), the central business and investmentunit for Germany's popular and co-operative banks, has set up a tradefinance unit to market trade paper to the London forfaiting community.Acting as the provider of corporate and international services foralmost 3,000 local institutions, DG Bank should be well placed to feeda stream of export deals to forfait traders and investors in thesecondary market.The new operation is being headed by Janine Barber, recruited fromStandard Bank London's forfaiting team.Ms Barber's specialist knowledge of eastern Europe will be particularlyuseful for DG Bank:  many of the small and medium-sized German firmsthat form the core client base of the Volksbanks (popular) andRaiffeisen (co-operative) banks are selling to the former communistcountries that lie across Germany's eastern border.  Indeed, during itsfirst weeks, DG's London trade finance operation has handled deals forexports to Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia.The fact that DG felt the need to set up a forfaiting presence inLondon -- to supplement the forfaiting service already offered by itshead office in Frankfurt and enhance its ability to take on risks thatit would not want to keep for its own portfolio -- bears witness to thecentral role that the UK's capital continues to play in the market fortrade paper.London hubAlthough the biggest users of the technique are probably Italian ratherthan UK exporters, London remains the hub of the secondary trading thathas gradually expanded forfaiters' ability to do business over recentyears.  Indeed, the range of country risks that can now be sold on themarket is probably wider than at any previous time.Confidence seems to have ridden out the shock of Mexico's late 1994financial crisis;  large volumes of Latin American risk are stilltraded.And there are even signs of a renewed willingness to support deals withBulgaria -- whose credibility was shattered several years ago by itsreadiness to take on new loans when it was on the verge of default.During 1995, specialists, such as Hungarian International Bank (HIB)and London Forfaiting Company (LFC), began to do Bulgarian short-termdeals;  and in recent weeks LFC has actually quoted three year terms,albeit for a transaction of only DM1m.What remains to be seen is how the market will evolve following theannouncement that HIB is to close.  The bank has been one of theleading forces in the market, with a strong reputation in pioneeringthe acceptance of deals with the more difficult ex-communist countries,such as Croatia, or the Baltic states.HIB will have a successor institution:  the Hungarian national savingsbank OTP is to set up a trade finance company in London -- based in thesame premises and using many of the same staff.  Capitalised at about#1m and hoping to chalk up #50m or so of deals in the first year, thisshould be able to build on the legacy of east European expertise.All the clearers continue to offer forfaiting services, but at Barclaysand Lloyds these are integrated into the main trade finance operations,alongside conventional export credit:  the aim is to put forward themost competitive technique for each particular deal, whether it beforfaiting or supplier credit (or something else).  Forfaiting is oftencombined with export credit, particularly as a means of dealing withthe 15 per cent uninsured ``front end'' component of Export CreditsGuarantee Department deals.Midland Bank Aval forms an integral part of the HSBC group and was oneof the first to spot the potential for combining forfaiting and exportcredit in the same operation -- but it does maintain a large team offorfaiting specialists in London and the Far East and generates a bigflow of deals from its own exporting customers in the UK, Italy andelsewhere.  It uses the technique to finance a lot of trade between FarEastern countries.West Merchant Bank is another leading export credit house which offersforfaiting as an alternative or complementary financing option.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996CHINA SECURES ECGD SUPPORT FOR POWER FACILITY, AIRPORT CONTRACTThe UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has agreed a majornew power-related facility for China, the boom market which absorbedthe largest volume of ECGD guarantees for any single country in theagency's 1994/95 financial year.ECGD has also backed the commercial portion of a UK mixed creditpackage for the new airport at Nanjing, and is gearing up to mobiliseadditional cover for a $2bn-plus power complex in Shandong.ECGD announced on 20 December that it will provide a 15-year repaymentguarantee for a #351.5m commercial loan in support of a contract won byGEC-Alsthom to design and supply equipment for the Ling Ao powerstation, better known as Daya Bay II, in Guangdong province.GEC-Alsthom was a leading supplier for China's first nuclear powerstation at Daya Bay (ITF 249/3).  At Ling Ao it is responsible this time for the turnkey design, supplyand supervision of commissioning of two 900 MW turbine generator unitsand plant, scheduled for completion by 2003.The commercial lending syndicate is led by West Merchant Bank (WMB),acting as arranger, principal lender and agent bank.The borrower is State Development Bank of China (SDB), the specialisedinfrastructure financing institution established in early 1994.

ECGD and Eximbank had set amid-January deadline for a preferential rate of 5.95 per cent alreadyrolled over previously.  All parties were understood to be anxious toavoid the proposed new rate of 7 per cent.The sponsor, China Power Company -- a joint venture involving a 49 percent foreign stake from China Light & Power and Electricite de France --anticipates raising some $800m through international syndication to addto equity that may total as much as $600m.The project encompasses four plants.  The international funding will bechannelled to the 1,300 MW Liaocheng and 700 MW Heze complexes.Equipment is to be supplied by the US' Westinghouse ElectricCorporation and the UK's Babcock Energy.Remaining funding is likely to be tapped domestically.ITF COMMENT:  Rapid growth in the huge Chinese market means the countrywill remain the most active trade finance market in 1996, especially asBeijing is expected to relax its credit squeeze, imposed since mid-1993.The economy remains mined with problems associated with everything froma sometimes opaque legislative framework and a commitment to obtainingrock-bottom pricing to political risk factors, which include thesuccession to Mr Deng Xioping and the People's Liberation Army's recentthreatening gestures towards Taiwan.But the macroeconomic numbers and market's potential still dazzle -- andECAs continue to take a positive view in the ``national interest'' togive companies a chance in the market that everyone wants to crack.China's foreign trade grew by 18 per cent in 1995 to $280bn, producinga trade surplus of over $20bn.  This compared to $5.35bn in 1994,according to preliminary statistics released by Beijing on 5 January.Foreign exchange reserves were estimated at $70bn at end-1995.  Foreigninvestment grew by 11 per cent last year, reaching $37bn.The pattern of ECGD's business is replicated by other ECAs.  The UKagency's concentration on the fiercely contested Chinese market wasreflected in its 1994/95 annual report, which showed exposure totalling#1.54bn (ITF 251/7).China accounted for over 40 per cent of ECGD's commitments to the so-called Amber Zone of priority markets in 1994/95.Exposure is building, but there is more support to come.

But it will be a market whose pitfalls canupset even the most careful investors for years to come.One not so happy New Year message came from State Economic & TradeCommission official Mr Xu Ming, who complained that domestic firms werebeing pushed out of joint ventures when profits increase and localpartners cannot match the new investments in equity made by theirforeign partners.This apparently widespread trend is giving foreign partners majorityholdings -- and, Chinese officials complain, monopolies in some domesticindustrial sectors.``It is almost unanimous -- when returns become high, foreign partieswill scramble to nudge their Chinese partners out of holding statuswith their overwhelming funding power'', Mr Xu said. Local firms should``stand up against the aggression of foreign partners'', he said.The language of international capitalism, which investors and creditorsso like to hear, will continue to suffer problems of translation inChina.Back to Headline List CopyrightINTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCE via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996BANKS LINE UP CHINESE PROJECT FINANCINGSInternational and locally-based banks are lining up a raft of newChinese projects.Standard Chartered Capital Markets is lead arranger for the non-recourse financing of a gas-fired power plant in Zhabei, Shanghai.The sponsors, GE Capital Corporation and the Shanghai MunicipalElectric Power Company, are looking to raise around $120m over 10years.China International Capital Corporation is seeking to raise around$750m for an oil project in the north-east.

In unveiling the nationwide listing of 30,123 properties, RTC ExecutiveDirector David C. Cooke said his agency will soon begin making assetinformation available more often than the required semiannual reports.However, he did not specify whether that meant quarterly or monthlyupdates.   Demand for detailed listings of RTC's holdings seems to be overwhelming,based on the 22,000 written inquiries received by the agency in recentmonths and the heavy order volume for the inventory report last week.   As a result, entrepreneurs in the technology, publishing and marketingindustries are circling - hoping to help the bailout agency disseminatefresh data on new properties assumed by RTC, as well as results of recentsales.   "The inventory will also be made available through a variety ofcomputer-compatible media," Cooke said.   In fact, a consortium of reputable technology companies, not yet willingto publicize its effort, is working to create a system which would allowsubscribers to use a personal computer to "dial in" to a central databaseand conduct sophisticated analysis of RTC assets.   In addition, the bailout agency has been approached by publishingventures that are eager to repackage the property listings to fit specificneeds of various investors.   Rather than select one or two companies to deliver the information, RTCwill probably make the raw data on properties available to all potentialpublishers and let users determine which of the competing services bestmeets their needs.   American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp., a unit of Dallas-base AMRCorp., has seized one of the first inventory-related assignments. RTC hiredthe firm to process orders for the three-volume property listing, which ispriced at $50.   Later this month, AA Direct Marketing Corp. will begin operating a 900-number telephone line, which will allow investors to order specializedproperty listings for a nominal fee that will be charged on their regularmonthly telephone bill.   For example, a caller reaching RTC's new asset information center couldrequest a listing of all single-family homes in the Phoenix area, and theorder would be processed and mailed within 24 hours. The phone number hasnot yet been announced.   Would-be investors and others needing to closely scrutinize each assetsay they hope the agency eventually expands its data collection effort toinclude more than just basic information on each property.   The new report on commercial properties, for instance, provides only anaddress, square footage, a one-line description, the property's age, acontact name and - in some cases - a list price.   Congress' requirement that the inventory be rushed into print beforeDec. 31 made it impossible for RTC to include information on all of itsholdings. Instead, the report listed only properties with clear titles thatwere held by the 283 thrifts under RTC control on Sept. 30. It does notinclude assets held by S&L subsidiaries, or assets of institutions placedin the conservatorship program during the fourth quarter.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Workout Firms Eye Louisiana Portfolios   RTC's Baton Rouge field office is looking for private-sector help inmanaging and disposing of nonperforming loans and real estate left overfrom the resolutions of six Louisiana conservatorships.   "We would like to have the bid packages out this month," said JayHambric, who runs the Baton Rouge operation, one of four consolidated fieldoffices in RTC's east region. The assignments, which could be awardedsometime in February, will be one of the first disposition contracts handedout since RTC opened its doors five months ago.   Roughly $300 million in assets will be put out for bid after the agencypackages them by type, size and quality. Categories will include realestate, real estate loans, student loans, second mortgages and other typesof consumer credits. There is also expected to be more than one qualitycategory, including delinquent unsecured loans.   Packages will likely be awarded to firms with experience and expertisein managing assets in those particular categories. RTC officials inWashington are deciding on the fee structure for the assignment.   RTC also retained commercial loans from the six resolutions, but Hambricsaid his office would concentrate on disposing of the consumer debt firstsince there was so much more of it.   He said his office would contract separately with a firm to conduct duediligence reviews of the assets before they are packaged.   By the time bids are invited, RTC expects that most interested partieswill have completed the agency's newly issued registration forms. Bids willbe accepted from only those firms whose registration statements meet RTC'scriteria. RTC still hasn't decided how it will publicize the request forproposals.   The targeted assets were on the books of the following six Louisianathrifts, whose deposits were transferred to healthy institutions on theresolution date shown in parentheses:   * Acadia S&LA FSA of Crowley (Oct. 6). Assets: $108 million.   * River City FSB of Baton Rouge (Oct. 6). Assets: $73 million.   * Enterprise FS&LA of Marrero (Sept. 8). Assets: $64 million.   * Elmwood FS&LA of Harahan (Sept. 8). Assets $58 million.   * Evangeline FS&LA of Lafayette (Aug. 18). Assets: $37 million.   * First Savings of Louisiana FSA of La Place (Sept. 15). Assets: $25million.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Final Blueprint Still Lacks Specifics   RTC's policymakers last week unveiled a strategic plan that acknowledgeskey concerns of real estate and asset management professionals, but in someways fails to spell out precisely how the agency will address thosematters.   Industry and government observers agreed that the three-member OversightBoard placed the greatest emphasis on disposal of marketable assets asquickly as possible.   But the Board, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, was farfrom specific in addressing the need for incentive-based compensation forcontractors. It said contractors could be paid "as a percentage of proceedsnet of expenses, with the percentage increasing as proceeds increaserelative to the estimated market value of assets."   While that description acknowledges the industry's rejection of fixedfees, it failed to state exactly whether RTC would be willing to pay basefees - to cover a management firm's costs - in addition to performance-based fees.   The industry's desire to perform the asset management, or generalcontractor, role in liquidations was mentioned - but not directly addressed- in the strategic plan.   On Capitol Hill, the document drew early applause. Rep. Bruce Vento, aMinnesota Democrat who heads a House task force monitoring the thriftbailout, said he was pleased with the Board's decision to quickly disposeof the assets. "Procrastinating is much more of a risk because you have topay to manage [the assets]. The stuff doesn't get better with age," Ventosaid in a wire service article.   Anticipating accusations of dumping, the Board justified its pledge tomove swiftly, saying that "holding properties off the market for anextended period of time may increase the ultimate costs of assetdisposition because of the expenses associated with managing and financingthe property." It also noted the risks of deterioration if properties areheld in RTC's portfolio for long periods.   "It is, therefore, important to begin returning assets to the privatesector as soon as feasible," the strategic plan states.   Oversight Board President Daniel P. Kearney attempted to silence chargesof dumping real estate on depressed markets by explaining that it wouldtake several years for RTC to complete the "arduous" legal process oftaking clear title to its properties and readying them for the market.   Christopher Kallivokas, president of Real Estate Recovery Inc., an assetmanagement firm based in Sterling, Va., agreed that fears of propertydumping were unfounded. Kallivokas argues that the RTC for the most partwon't be delivering new properties to the market. "Virtually every propertyin the RTC's inventory has been available [to buyers] for some time undertheir former ownership, whether it was a former S&L or FSLIC," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Two S&Ls Added to Program   RTC closed the year by taking over two small thrifts: the $70.9 million-asset Columbia FSA, Webster, Tex., and the $27.5 million-asset Silver SAFA, Silver City, N.M.   During 1989 the agency resolved 37 institutions, as shown in thebreakdown below. Another 11 were advertised for sale in November, and thosetransactions should be completed shortly.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990Crafting the Rescue Process   The Oversight Board's strategic plan instructs RTC to take specificsteps to assure that it resolves failed thrift institutions quickly andinexpensively without threatening local financial and real estate markets.Those instructions include:   * Limit any new lending or investments by conservatorships to low-riskassets.   * By Jan. 15, develop a prioritization schedule for institutions to bemarketed and resolved.   * By Jan. 15, develop plans for soliciting bids from all interestedqualified buyers, including procedures for encouraging the participation ofwomen and minorities in the bidding process.   * By Jan. 15, develop procedures for making available to all potentialbidders full information on each institution under RTC control and fornotifying rejected bidders within 30 days.   * By March 30, establish a national sales program to coordinate thedisposition of any financial assets held in conservatorship.   * By March 30, report to the Oversight Board on the feasibility ofhedging RTC's overall interest rate exposure.   * By Aug. 31, report to the Oversight Board and Congress on the reviewof case resolutions entered into by FSLIC between Jan. 1, 1988, and Aug. 9,1989.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990RTC Fills Key Housing Post   RTC has named Stephen S. Allen, a veteran of the non-profit housingcommunity, to serve as director of the agency's low-income housing program.   Allen takes the helm of RTC's most politically sensitive area after 13years with the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., where he was an associatedirector in charge of neighborhood preservation projects. In that position,he directed the group's development efforts in designing modelpublic/private partnerships for affordable housing.   At his new post, Allen will direct and coordinate the sale of RTC'sresidential properties to eligible buyers nationwide. An RTC statement saidhe and his staff plan to work closely with state housing finance agencies,various national non-profit housing organizations and governmentalassociations to identify eligible buyers.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990RTC Writes a Best Seller   If only demand was this strong for RTC's real estate...   The company handling inquiries and orders for the agency's newlypublished property listings was flooded with more than 15,000 toll-freecalls in its first two days on the job.   Those placing orders by phone last week were told by harried operatorsthat they probably would not receive their books for about a month - quitea long time considering that RTC's Oversight Board just instructed theliquidation agency to "avoid deferring the marketing of properties."   Some calling the 800-number that leads to the Dallas headquarters ofAmerican Airlines Direct Marketing Corp. received the following recordedmessage: "Due to the overwhelming response to the Resolution Trust Corp.program, all of our agents are busy. Please call back later." Others weresimply asked to hold for the next available agent.   "It's very hectic" said one weary operator, who couldn't offer anestimate for the number of orders placed by the 15,000 callers during thefirst two days.   Copies of the inventory report may be ordered by calling (800) 431-0600.    The reports are priced at $10 each for the commercial and land volumes,and $15 each for the single-family and multi-family residential reports.The complete set is available for $50. Check, credit card or C.O.D. ordersare accepted.   The same toll-free number may also be used to inquire about locating thereports at one of 1,400 depository libraries throughout the country.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT LIQUIDATION ALERT via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1990GRAPEVINE   RTC's Dallas staff underwent a growth spurt last week when nearly 50employees of the defunct Federal Asset Disposition Association joined thebailout agency's regional office. The new recruits are filling assetmanagement, contracting and support positions at various levels. Amongthose assuming key RTC posts will be former FADA contracting staffer JanieThomas, who will serve as senior contracting specialist in Dallas. Manystaffers from FADA's Atlanta office have joined RTC in that city, too.   Asset managers are hoping RTC will sharpen its definition of "competingproperties" in the agency's conflict-of-interest rules. As currentlyworded, the provision could preclude a contractor from managing West Coastapartment buildings if that firm owned "competing" apartment buildings onthe East Coast. The industry's recommended solution: RTC's conflict rulesshould concern themselves only with similar properties in the sameimmediate, geographic market.   Staffers at the RTC Oversight Board are zeroing in on appointees tochair the national advisory board and each of six regional advisory panels.The seven, who will comprise the national board, will help select theremaining regional advisers. After sifting through scores of nominatingletters, the staff will soon eliminate the runners up and ask the OversightBoard to okay their selections. The seven are expected to be named withinthe next month or so.   It looks like RTC's consolidated office network in the western regionmay not be operational until spring, despite what was originally a Januarytarget. The Denver-based operation, which was initially dealt a larger sumof thrift assets than any other region, has been slow in establishing itsthree field offices slated for Denver, Phoenix and somewhere in OrangeCounty, Calif. By contrast, the east region has already opened its fourfield offices, and begun staffing. The Baton Rouge, La. office, forinstance, already employs 55.   Staffers in the Baton Rouge field office are trying to remove themystique from RTC's registration process for aspiring contractors. Agencyofficials will spend the next two Monday's conducting educational seminarsfor firms in Louisiana and Mississippi.   New England's real estate lenders took another pounding in the thirdquarter. Veribanc Inc., a financial statistics firm in Wakefield, Mass.,said real estate-related loans and real estate repossessed by New Englandbanks increased for the thirteenth consecutive quarter. At southwest banks,however, the situation seems to have stabilized and - by some measures -improved.

Bergen Brunswig fell $5.125, or 15.6%, to close at$27.625, and Ivax dropped $3.75, or 21%, to close at $12.50, a 52-week low.The deal followed Ivax's disclosure earlier this year that earnings would belower than anticipated and that the company would therefore violate its bankcovenants."It's a terrible deal and Bergen is nuts," said one arbitrageur."If the deal breaks, we think Ivax goes down considerably and Bergen Brunswigwon't move much," the arb added, giving the deal even odds of collapse."There's a lot of shareholder anger out there," he said.Another arb said Bergen Brunswig is sure to annoy a lot of its suppliers andwill have to choose between their products and Ivax's. "Bergen Brunswig isbuying a company that does a lot of business with people they compete with," hesaid.If Bergen Brunswig shareholders vote against a deal with Ivax, it won't be thefirst time Ivax got left at the altar. Shareholders of Halfslund Nycomed ofNorway rejected a stock swap with Ivax late last year.But because insiders at both Ivax and Bergen Brunswig hold large amounts ofshares, any anti-deal sentiment doesn't much matter, a third arb said."If I'm a Bergen shareholder, I'd be very upset about the transaction," the arbsaid. "But I don't think it's a deal killer."The arb explained the Ivax drop as simple mathematics, offering that the .42shares of Bergen Brunswig shares Ivax shareholders would receive for each oftheirs valued the stock at 11.6025, less than its trading level at the time."Maybe that's all Ivax could get," he said.Not everyone was negative on the transaction. Analyst Kevin Silverman of EverenSecurities had good things to say about it. He suggested Ivax would give BergenBrunswig additional profits that would otherwise go to its suppliers."They're buying products from existing manufacturers and earning 15%,"Silverman said. "The manufacturers are making 40%.Combined with Bergen Brunswig's $2 billion in generic drug sales, the additionof generic drugs manufactured at Ivax could add another $600 million to the topline, he said."It makes perfect sense to me."Silverman said Bergen Brunswig stock dropped because the deal brings dilutionof 30 cents per share and 30 cents times 15 equals $4.50.   "That's about whatthe stock dropped on the first day," he said.Another reason for the stock drops, Silverman said, is that such a deal hasnever been done before. "People don't particularly like change and that's whatthey're getting here."Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Olympic Continues Search for GoldBut Followers of its Situation Suggest Only Fools Would BiteOlympic Financial Ltd. continues to insist publicly that its search for a buyeris moving ahead, but the search for a new CEO, the resignation of a boardmember and the adoption of a poison pill have left observers wondering whetherOlympic will sell.Minneapolis-based Olympic, the nation's largest independent provider ofautomobile financing, is moving full speed ahead with its search for a new CEO.Jeffrey Mack resigned as CEO on Aug. 26, the same day Olympic announced it wasentertaining an offer from an interested party.Bob Ollech, an analyst with Principal Financial Securities, said he justreceived a call from the headhunter employed by Olympic looking for leads forits search. "According to her, they were in the early stages, still lookingaround," Ollech said.Mack was said to have balked at the idea of selling the company, according toOllech, but the board that he chose proved to be more powerful than him anddecided to move ahead with the plan despite his objections. Ollech added thatthe search for a new CEO makes any sale even less likely."It certainly makes you think it's less likely to happen, only from a commonsense standpoint," Ollech said. "If they were to offer the CEO position tosomeone, and in the same breath try to sell the company, they'd have a hardtime selling that job. On the other hand, they need a strong CEO to runday-to-day operations in the event that they can't sell it anymore."Jennifer Wykert, investor relations consultant for Olympic, described Olympic'sdecision to step up its search as a "prudent action" to avoid having to startfrom ground zero if a suitor with the right price fails to materialize.The resignation of board member Rick Zona, which came around Oct. 22, after theinitial buyer declined to make an offer, raised even more eyebrows andconcerns, according to one analyst who asked not to be named.Ollech speculated that there could have been a number of circumstances thatcould have led to Zona's untimely departure. As the first theory goes, FirstBank Systems Inc. may have been looking seriously at buying Olympic, and Zona,who is vice chairman of finance at the regional bank holding company, resignedto avoid any possible conflict of interest. The second possibility was thatZona had a "falling out" with the board about selling.Third, Ollech continued, because Zona was on Olympic's audit committee, perhapsthere was something afoot in terms of the company's financial condition, orcredit quality. Another possibility is that he resigned for personal reasons.In any case, the tumultuous activity has not helped Olympic's already volatilestock, which hit a high of $26.625 in September. At presstime, Olympic's stockwas $15.75, which was a modest recovery from a recent $13.50 low.Last month, Olympic announced that a first round of buyers had decided againstmaking definitive offers for the company. But it said a second group of suitorsthat had been waiting in the wings were stepping in with their proposals,including an outright sale, an equity infusion and a strategic alliance.Then, on Nov. 4, Olympic adopted a poison pill to thwart any attempt at ahostile takeover.Pat McGurn, director of corporate programs with InstitutionalShareholder Services, said this move is not unusual. "Diana Corp. went througha well-publicized shopping of itself and, in the end, decided not to do it atall, and then adopted a poison pill," McGurn said.One arbitrageur saw it more as a move of desperation. "Their stock tanked.They're afraid somebody could come in and buy them on the cheap," the arb said."They may well be talking to people, but if they couldn't find a good buyerwhen their stock was in the low $20s, how can they expect it when the stock isat $15."Meanwhile, an analyst who asked not to be named raised questions aboutOlympic's ability to find a buyer. He said, "Olympic has a $2.20 per share[earnings] estimate for '97. If someone really believed that $2.20 estimate,why would they not be able to get someone? That's 12 or 13 times earnings."A number of other analysts agreed that a sale does not seem to be in Olympic'simmediate future.Robert Evans, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Co., said Olympic is stilltalking to three or four parties regarding the sale of the company, but, "Idon't know if it's at the same pace and sense of urgency as it was. In myopinion, the company is probably not going to be acquired at least in the nextfew weeks."In its latest move, Olympic hedged its position by saying it had reevaluatedits price objective, leaving the door open to a slightly lower bid.Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Nice-Guy Strategy Improves Zell's OddsThe Gravedancer Drops His Lawsuit and Goes After the VotesSam Zell is still zealously pursuing Chateau Properties, Inc., but now he'susing sugar instead of vinegar to catch his fly.By dropping a lawsuit and his hostile tender offer via his Manufactured HomeCommunities, Inc. (MHC), and tailoring his $387.3 million bid to management'sneeds, he's revealing whose favor he's courting: the holders of operatingpartnership (OP) units.Sources debated whether the tactic would work. At presstime, Chateau announcedits rejection of MHC's bid, but that surely will not stop Zell in his tracks,sources said."If anything, the likelihood of his succeeding has increased to say 75%/25%,"an analyst said.MHC currently is under agreement to merge with ROC Communities in a $TK milliondeal. Chateau would have to reject Zell's offer or pony up a reported $10million to $12 million break-up fee for its merger with ROC."[Chateau Chairman John Boll] may just be posturing to get the decks clean" bybetting shareholders won't approve the ROC merger. Then he would be free topursue the Zell offer.Indeed, the outcome of ROC's and Chateau's proxy votes this week will play alarge role in whether the Chicago investor ultimately will attain his goal.On one side were those who saw Zell losing out if he couldn't accomplish thetask of convincing shareholders to vote down the merger. On the other side werethose who believed shareholders would indeed disapprove the merger, leavingClinton Township, Mich.-based Chateau vulnerable to his advances.The Chateau/ROC merger was universally panned by analysts. "This is a uniquesituation where one plus one equals less than two," said one who declined to benamed. "I can't imagine two-thirds of ROC holders approving the deal," headded, giving a higher probability to an eventual Zell win.The latest MHC strategy consisted of a choice of $26 cash or a convertiblepreferred security "designed to address the needs of Chateau OP Unit holders,"according to a press release.

This was Zell's effort toreach closure, a desire to merge sooner rather than later," said Louis Taylor,an analyst with Prudential Securities.Sources did agree that the new bid was superior and had a better chance ofsuccess, but one said he'd hold off judgment until Englewood, Colo.-based ROCholds its vote.The dialogue surrounding the triangle-formerly a square when Sun Communitiesweighed in with a bid for Chateau-has been decidedly one-sided, saidChristopher Hartung, an analyst with Montgomery Securities."MHC is the only one we've heard from," he said. "They've got a great marketingmachine. Because Chateau and ROC have been limited as to what they can say, wehaven't heard the whole story," Hartung added.Additionally, the MHC line has been that its bid offered a generous multiple inan undervalued industry.

And while Fitzgeralds CFO FernandoBensuaski said the company "intends" to make the payment, he could make noassurances.He added that the company is in the process of trying to secure financing frominstitutional investors, whom he would not identify. And while Bensuaski flatlydenied a bankruptcy is impending, sources didn't buy it.The culprit, sources said, is the usual one: a combination of too much debt ona company in an out-of-favor, and highly competitive industry.One distressed source saw one of three scenarios likely: the bondholders willgain equity in a new company, the casinos will be sold off piecemeal, or acombination of the two will occur.Fitzgeralds' bonds-$123 million in 13% senior secured notes due 2002-are thinlytraded and last sold for 72 in mid September. The issue was a year old onSaturday.Management owns about 80% of the common stock. The company also has issued $20million in preferred stock and $25 million in mixed tranches including $18million in notes secured on the company's Reno property with interest at primeplus one.The 13%s are owned by "less than half a dozen" holders, with Putnam Investmentspossessing the bulk, a source said. Putnam's analyst Herb Wagner declined tocomment.The concentration of notes in few hands could mean a quick end to Fitzgeralds'suffering. "Maybe they [the holders] could force a restructuring that'sbeneficial to them," said Kevin Pilot, the president of Phoenix Capital. Andwhile Bensuaski insisted no talks about bankruptcy have taken place, the marketwas saying a restructuring was in the offing."As long as they can make payroll, it makes sense for them to make some kind ofdeal," with the bondholders, said Andrew Susser, an analyst with Moody'sInvestors Service, which downgraded the 13%s from B3 to Caa Nov. 7."The question is, can they compete long term?" Susser said. "That's a call thenoteholders have to make."A gaming analyst who requested anonymity said, "Long term, it's a toughcompany. There is a future in this company."Fitzgeralds has made some significant capital expenditures recently, includinghotel rooms in its Tunica, Miss., satellite and new restaurants in its LasVegas and Tunica locations. Sources said the investment could pay off.But in the meantime, the company's "high leverage, low liquidity, weak cashflows, heavy amortization schedule, and competitive pressures in each if itskey markets," remain a problem, according to Moody's.Bensuaski said Fitzgeralds' plans include seeking capital with the help ofSouthcoast Capital Corp., an investment bank it hired in August. It could notbe determined why Oppenheimer & Co. was no longer representing Fitzgerald.The company hasn't released its third quarter numbers yet, but "we don't expectgreat results," said the gaming analyst. He added he expected earnings would beflat compared with last year.Fitzgeralds' troubles hang against a backdrop of an industry saturated withplayers. The entire gaming sector is hurting, sources said, especially inTunica, where the company just completed construction on a 507 room hotel,Fitzgeralds Tunica. Competition in the area is fierce, Susser said, and theaddition of Harrah's Mardi Gras and Grand Casinos earlier this year haveincreased the number of gaming positions by 40%.The Reno, Nev. outpost, Silver Legacy, saw steep room-rate discounting andlower margins due in part to the absence of a major bowling tournament.

Then, the first $20 million thatthe company collects in receivables would go to McKesson, and the next $10million in receivables will be split 50%/50% by McKesson and the estate,according to the source who was present at an auction hearing on Nov. 8. Theremainder would go to the estate, and would pay off professional fees.The former deal saw McKesson paying $80 million in cash, which would be held inescrow for about six months, sources said.The source said vendors complained about the new arrangement and that the moneywould be difficult to collect. Robert Peiser, the company's vice chairman andCEO, theorized that with the outstanding receivables amounting to $90 million,and McKesson skimming off the first $25 million, the receivables could reach$70 million to $75 million."I think that's insane," the source said. "It's complex, it's not that easy torecover."The unsecured trade claims dipped back to the 10 to 12 range from the 15 to 20they were at the week before on the news of the reconfigured deal.

"Some middle ground between the twotraditional approaches often makes sense."Matters that are too complex for per se condemnation sometimes get shoe hornedinto that category, while some  anticompetitive practices without anydemonstrable virtue escape condemnation because of insufficient evidence tosatisfy the requirements of a full-blown market analysis," he said.Rather than restrict itself to the per se and rule of reason  polaralternatives, the DOJ, Klein said, uses a three-step approach when consideringwhether horizontal mergers would directly limit price or production competitionThe first step, he said, is to decide whether the deal would be a per seviolation, such as an agreement to fix prices, curtail output or dividemarkets. Once the DOJ concludes a horizontal deal is not per se illegal, hecontinued, the agency then asks the parties involved whether there's a"procompetitive justification" for the agreement."We expect a response that doesn't merely speculate about the existence ofefficiencies, but rather comes forward with real world factual and experteconomic evidence to support the claim," he said.If the DOJ finds significant procompetitive benefits to a deal, Klein said, theagency then looks at whether likely anti-competitive effects would outweighthem. "The key point I want to stress," he said, "is that only if there arereal procompetitive benefits should there be any need to show actualanticompetitive effects."Using such analyses, Klein said, should open the door to at least someadditional consideration of procompetitive justifications for horizontalmergers. On the other hand, he added, the approach also ensures that faciallyanticompetitive, but potentially justifiable, agreements are not automaticallygiven green lights simply because they can't be condemned as per se illegal."By requiring proof of procompetitive benefits, we're lessening the burden ofproving a violation compared to what we'd have to show under a full-blown ruleof reason analysis," he said *Richard Rubin.Back to Headline List CopyrightMERGERS & RESTRUCTURING via NewsNetNovember 18, 1996Arbs Miffed at AIM's AbstentionArbs were seething that one Wallace Computer Services, Inc. shareholderabstained from a Nov. 6 vote on whether shareholders have a voice in takeovers.AIM Strategic Income Fund, a closed-end management investment company,abstained, after initially signaling it was in favor of the proposed bylawchange that would require Wallace's board to hold a shareholder vote within 90days after it received a qualified bid in order to keep up a defensive postureagainst the offer.

Dallas-based Redman was Champion's seventhacquisition in two-and-a-half years, she said."It was a tremendous acquisition," said Troy Ussery, an analyst at RauscherPierce Refsnes. "It brought Champion to the position of being one of thelargduct line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said.

The remaining 30% of the industry is split among another 100companies.Making a Geographic  FitIn addition to the growth factor, the other major motivation behind theacquisition was geographic: a natural merger of two similar, regional companiesthat, together, would serve almost the entire country."Their product line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said. "Weare similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing inhousing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different pricepoints so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,explained Jeoff Stern, Champion's advisor and a managing director at DonaldsonLufkin & Jenrette, Champion was a much smaller company, Redman was private, andthe two CEOs shared a strong mutual respect.But it wasn't until June 5 of this year that Alexander, on Redman's behalf,approached Young at an industry conference about a possible deal. It would bethe only company Redman would talk to."I approached no one else" but Champion, said Alexander. "It was Sturgess'view-and he had spoken with members of his board-that the commonality of focusin terms of business strategy, and yet the differences in the physicallocations of facilities, made this a combination that was a win-win for bothsides, which doesn't happen often today."Young met with Sturgess and the financial advisors of both companies almost amonth later to pursue the stock transaction. After that, things moved ratherquickly.A rumor of illness at the top of Redman may have contributed to the speed withwhich the deal was done, according to one source who asked not to beideh. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,and its quality and depth of management," U diligence, the group met again todiscuss a range of exchange ratios, the midpoint of which was 1.24 Championshares per Redman share. The ratio and the deal were soon settled upon.A pooling transaction was important to the deal, Dout said. "By merging the twocompanies together, it makes us stronger financially and operationally. Thisway both shareholders win. We always go for a win-win proposition."Although analysts uniformly agreed that Champion paid a higher multiple ofoperating profit for Redman than previous acquisitions-6.4 times EBITDAcompared to an average 3.9 times-they also agreed that Champion got its money'sworth. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,and its quality and depth of management," Ussery said."The big question is: 'What's next?,'" said Ussery. "Champion will clearlybenefit in the upcoming year from the Redman acquisition, but we have severalother major competitors who will run out of steam in 1997 without anacquisition. This is the tip of the iceberg."Ussery added that when using the same evaluation as the Redman acquisition,Belmont Homes, the nation's eleventh largest manufactured home builder, wouldbe around $16 a share; so at its current price of $10.50, it's bound to beraising eyebrows-with Champion or other industry players."With Redman, the immediate need for more acquisitions isn't as great forChampion, but Walt [Young] has never been one to pass up a bargain," Usserysaid Alena Joy Berenblatt.Back to Headline List WT02-B39-15IA074-000493-B041-356http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi72.html 205.156.212.5 19970122011103 text/html 21693HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:09:09 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:14 GMTContent-length: 21506Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi72.html Sample Issue Copyright MORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNet January 15, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES FANNIE LIMIT MOVE TO $207,000 IMMINENT (763 words) SEC ISSUES DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING RULE (812 words) IRS FINALIZES DEBT FORGIVENESS REGULATION (390 words) NOTEBOOK (734 words) FANNIE JOINS RURAL HOUSING SERVICE'S AMERICAN INDIAN PILOT PROGRAM (262 words) CopyrightMORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FANNIE LIMIT MOVE TO $207,000 IMMINENTFannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conformingloan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industrysources close to the agency.        Fannie has received numerous requests from its customers to raiseits conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect Jan. 1,sources said. And the agency, which had maintained that would fullyconsider the views of its customers before rendering a decision, may makeits announcement as soon as Jan. 15.        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last twoweeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and thepotential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fullydiscuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders.        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgagecompanies that have traditionally directed most of their business to FannieMae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to takeadvantage of the agency's higher limit.        However, those occurrences may not have qualified as a trend.Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie raisedits limits, and a Freddie spokesperson couldn't confirm whether the companyhad actually seen an increase in commitments, offering that it had noupdated data to support that conclusion.        But in talks with its customers over the last month, Jeffers saidFannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the change in themarketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew that to be a realpossibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to Freddie, "though it'stoo early to see it happening--I wouldn't be surprised."        Freddie Mac decided to raise its limits in December to match a riseis the Federal Housing Finance Board's home price index. Both Fannie andFreddie's loan limits are statutorily tied to the index, but Fannie optednot to raise its limits, thus making the conforming loan limits differentfor each agency for the first time ever.        The debate over raising the limits revolves around the FHFB index,an economic indicator that has declined each of the last two years. Despitedeclines in 1993 and 1994, neither government-sponsored enterprise loweredits loan limit, decisions that garnered criticism from Congress and HUDSecretary Henry Cisneros. But declines in home price index are consideredanomalies, so when the index rose for the first time in three years inNovember, Freddie lifted its limit to match the increase; Fannie kept itslimit at $203,150. Freddie's critics immediately charged that agency hadraised the limit without considering the previous year's decreases.        Freddie's decision also  sparked the ire of some in the thriftindustry who contended that the agency is encroaching on the lower crust ofthe jumbo loan market niche it has carved out. Freddie Mac argues, however,that that is not the case, noting that only 1% of all its 1994 loanpurchases were for the loan limit maximum.        Lawmakers chided Freddie for its decision and praised Fannie formaintaining its limit. Privately, House Banking Committee sourcesacknowledged that the market was likely to force Fannie to raise its limit.        Freddie's decision also affected the Federal HousingAdministration. Although Freddie's loan limits are tied to FHFB's index,FHA's limits are tied to Freddie Mac's conforming loan limit. So whenFreddie upped its limits, it inadvertently raised FHA's. HUD ponderedwhether it had the statutory authority to avoid raising the limits, butafter a week of review it concluded that it too had to make an increase.Minus the statutory authority to force Freddie or FHA to maintain itslimits, one House Banking Committee staffer expected the issue to be takenup by Congress early in 1996.        The differing loan limits has caused problems for lenders, thebiggest of which are the costs associated with having to split theirportfolios between Fannie and Freddie, said Vicki Vidal, director ofgovernment agency relations for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Anythingabove the Fannie limit must be segregated from Freddie pools and that takesmanpower and diligence," she said. "In some cases a (computerized) systemcan tell you, but some for some lenders the actual physical shipping andhandling has to be done."        Some Fannie-exclusive lenders also faced the additional costs ofswitching to Freddie Mac's system. One mortgage industry lobbyist said thatwith mortgage origination margins thin anyway, some lenders weren't lookfondly upon switching, primarily because of the costs associated and thetime it would take to retrain their staffs.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996SEC ISSUES DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING RULEThe Securities and Exchange Commission said its proposedregulations on derivatives disclosure are aimed at closing three kinds ofproblems it found during an extensive review of company reports, but theinitial reaction of some thrift lenders is that the rule may be redundant.        The SEC proposed amending its regulations to clarify and expand itsexisting requirements for financial statement footnote disclosures aboutregistrants' accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.Specifically, the proposed rule changes would affect SEC Regulations S-X,S-K and various forms including Form 20-F. The proposed amendments werepublished in the Jan. 8 Federal Register; comments are due to the SEC byMay 7.        "This rule appears to be much farther reaching than one wouldinitially conclude," said Marti Sworobuk, accounting manager for America'sCommunity Bankers. ACB's accounting committee hasn't reviewed the proposedregulation yet, but Sworobuk offered that "it doesn't appear to be so muchas a derivative disclosure as it is a document intended to requirefinancial institutions to disclose how they manage interest rate risk," shesaid.        Under the proposed rule, she said, SEC-regulated institutions wouldbe required to disclose of whatever they are doing to manage risk, such ashedging risk by using loan portfolios or by matching the terms of theirfunding sources. "It doesn't just involve derivative instruments," shesaid.        Sworobuk said ACB may be interested in how much additional burdenthe rule would put on thrifts--if any. "The SEC should recognize that somefinancial institutions are already submitting the same kind of informationto banking regulators," she said, speaking of the ConsolidatedMaturity/Rate Schedule, or CMR, that thrifts are already required to submitto the Office of Thrift Supervision. Other banking regulators are expectedto implement similar disclosures later this year, Sworobuk added, possiblyas soon as June.        "These disclosures provided to the agencies under FIDICIA 305 wouldmeet the requirements initiated by the SEC," she said.        The SEC amendments would only affect publicly traded institutions,but it is also likely to have an effect on the business strategies ofacquisition-minded commercial banks, mortgage banks and thrifts. Mergeractivity among banks has been strong over the last year, and SEC-regulatedlenders may have to more closely consider the derivative accountingpractices of any institution they've targeted for acquisition.        "The proposed amendments were developed after extensive review bythe SEC staff of disclosures made by approximately 500 registrants andconsideration of the findings of studies published by various public andprivate sector organizations," said SEC Chief Accountant Michael H. Sutton."The commission is hopeful that the proposed disclosures are responsive toconcerns of investors and will head to more useful disclosures aboutderivatives and other related instruments."        The SEC wants to improve what it considers inadequate disclosuresabout companies' accounting policies. Its proposal would require "enhanceddescriptions in the footnotes to the financial statements of accountingpolicies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodityinstruments," the agency said.        The agency is also looking to improve companies' disclosures ofmarket risk, which the SEC said applies to financial instruments other thanderivatives. Here the agency said it wants to see both quantitative andqualitative disclosures. For quantitative disclosures, the agency isproposing three alternatives from which firms would be free to choose.These are:         Tables showing expected cash flows and related contract termscategorized by expected maturity dates.         Sensitivity analysis showing the possible loss in earnings, fairvalues or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from certainhypothetical changes in rates or prices.         Value at risk disclosures showing the  potential loss in earnings,fair values or cash flows of market risk over a selected period of timefrom events with selected probabilities of occurrence.        The qualitative disclosures about market risk would cover how acompany manages its exposures with "a description of the objectives,general strategies and instruments, if any, used to manage thoseexposures." The third kind of problem the SEC wants to correct occurs when firms donot provide information about derivatives tied to other activities that aredisclosed.        "For example, when the information is required to be disclosed inthe footnotes to the financial statements about interest rates andrepricing characteristics of debt obligations, registrants should include,when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives," the SEC said.        "Similarly, summary information and disclosures in Management'sDiscussion and Analysis ("MD&A") about the cost of debt obligations shouldinclude, when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives."        In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,the SEC said it would look at ways provide a safe harbor where appropriatein the derivatives disclosures. These particular proposals would generallynot apply to mutual funds or small business issuers, although some of thedisclosures could be required under separate regulations.        The SEC said it will take comment on the proposals until May andexpects to revisit the rules after five years.Back to Headline List CopyrightMORTGAGE MARKETPLACE via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996IRS FINALIZES DEBT FORGIVENESS REGULATIONThe Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of dischargeof indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than theproposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for commentin 1993.        America's Community Bankers reacted to the new rule by saying it"substantially mitigated" the compliance burden on the lending industryimposed by the temporary rule. For example, said James O'Connor, tax lawyerfor the ACB, the "indebtedness" on which reporting is required to limitedto stated principal and does not include interest and penalties.        Rick Steinegar, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association's taxsubcommittee and director of taxes for GE Capital Mortgage Corp. said therules "are an improvement over the proposed rule." For example, it givesentities covered by the regulation until Dec. 26 to gear up to comply.Moreover, it gives specific instances where disclosure is triggered, unlikethe proposed rule, which provided a less-specific "facts and circumstances"criteria that would have made it more difficult for institutions todetermine if compliance was required.        Steinegar also noted that the final rule will only apply to"applicable financial entities," such as direct or indirect units of bankor thrift holding companies and government-sponsored enterprises. That doesnot cover independent mortgage bankers, he said.        Independent mortgage bankers would be required to comply only whenthey acted as a servicer for a government-sponsored enterprise, such asGNMA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the VA.        "It is much more specific and easy to comply with," he said.        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, requirefinancial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C informationreturns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders becausethey say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven inexcess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.        But lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigatingthe need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRSfor several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need toforgive debt.        The final rules are effective for discharges of indebtednessoccurring after Dec. 21, 1996.

Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17,but the final rule, which appears in the Dec. 21 Federal Register, makesthe change official; it also completes one of many streamlining proceduresHUD has initiated over the last several months.        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECMthat lenders have not issued a conditional commitment is eligible fordirect endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insuredbefore Sept. 15, 1995 must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUDoffice for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance.        If HUD deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, itwill give the lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DEprogram. oFreddie Revises RulesFor Balloons and Resets        Freddie Mac seller/servicers will need to contact reset and balloonmortgage borrowers about 50 days earlier than they're used to, according torevisions that Freddie Mac has made to its seller/servicer guide.Under the revised guidelines, which were announced in Bulletin 95-13,lenders must now notify borrowers between 100 and 110 days before theloan's maturity date, if not required sooner by law. Under Freddie'sprevious guidelines, lenders were required to contact borrowers at least 60days before the balloon maturity date. Additionally, Freddie said it hasadded information that servicers must include in the notification, and hasalso provided more guidance to lenders in working with borrowers who do notmeet reset conditions and can't pay off their balloon/reset mortgages.Freddie said the new requirement would take effect June 1. oHUD Reaches AccordsWith Nine FHA Lenders        Nine FHA-approved lenders reached settlement agreements with HUDfor a variety of irregular actions involving Federal Housing Administrationprograms, the department announced Dec. 12.        The department's Mortgagee Review Board, which investigated thelenders based on suggestions from HUD field offices, cited The Money Store,Sacramento, Calif., for violations of HUD-FHA Title I property improvementloan requirements. Specifically, the board said TMS failed to properlyservice Title I loans, did not submit timely FHA insurance claims andfailed to report timely the sale of Title I notes and transfers ofinsurance reserves. As a settlement agreement, TMS agreed to pay HUD$35,000, cancel insurance on several loans and submit to future reviews bythe department.        Among the other eight lenders HUD reached settlements with inDecember was the New England National Mortgage Corporation, Andover, Mass.,which was cited for permitting non-exclusive employees to originate FHAloans, and First American Mortgage Co., Sulphur Springs, Texas, which wascited for permitting borrowers to hand-carry verifications of employmentand failing to perform face-to-face interviews. New England National agreedto pay an undisclosed civil money penalty and First American agreed toindemnify HUD for claim losses. Both also agreed to implement correctiveactions.        Other settlement agreements included: Western Fidelity MortgageCo., Salt Lake City; Pacific Inland Mortgage Corp., Anaheim Hills, Calif.;Interbank Funding Group, San Diego; Mortgage America Nationwide, GrandTerrace, Calif.; Unifed Mortgage Corp., San Diego; and Z and Z FundingGroup, San Diego. As part of the settlement, the lenders do not admit toany fault or liability. oFed Offers VideoOn Home Buying Process        The Federal Reserve Board is offering an educational video forconsumers it hopes will enlighten prospective home buyers on the nuances ofobtaining a mortgage.

Starting in January, Fannie will begintaking part in the Rural Housing Service's Rural Housing Native Americanpilot, but will limit its initial participation to 10 tribes.        The eligible tribes include: Gila River, Arizona; Navajo Nation,Arizona; San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico; Pala Band of All Mission, California;Salish-Kootenai, Montana; Chippewa-Cree, Montana; Seminole Nation, Florida;Cheyenne River Sioux, South Dakota; Lac Courte Oreilles, Wisconsin; andOmaha, Nebraska.        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they havea good working relationship with RHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added later in thepilot.        RHS has also determined that these tribes have a judicial systemthat supports mortgage lending and are receptive to using debt refinancingfor new and existing homes. They are likely to approve the required legaldocuments without extensive changes, and have at least 10 tribal memberswho have sufficient income and credit histories to qualify for a mortgage,Fannie said.        In a related issue, Fannie (Announcement 95-21) has clarified thatit does not place a limitation on the number of Section 184 Indian HousingAuthority mortgages it will buy. In Announcement 95-06, the company saidthose loans would be considered as being secured investment properties.This prompted questions, the agency said, about whether a borrowerfinancing a number of properties is eligible.Back to Headline List WT02-B39-16IA074-000493-B041-390http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi81.html 205.156.212.5 19970122011123 text/html 50591HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:09:24 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:12 GMTContent-length: 50404Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi81.html Sample Issue Copyright NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY REPORTER via NewsNet July 29, 1993 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES ALABAMA FILINGS (116 words) ARIZONA FILINGS (397 words) CALIFORNIA FILINGS (186 words) DELAWARE FILINGS (202 words) FLORIDA FILINGS (289 words) GEORGIA FILINGS (213 words) ILLINOIS FILINGS (161 words) LOUISIANA FILINGS (42 words) MARYLAND FILINGS (187 words) MASSACHUSETTS FILINGS (189 words) MICHIGAN FILINGS (152 words) MINNESOTA FILINGS (39 words) MISSOURI FILINGS (44 words) MONTANA FILINGS (33 words) NEW JERSEY FILINGS (77 words) NEW YORK FILINGS (407 words) NORTH CAROLINA FILINGS (41 words) NORTH DAKOTA FILINGS (43 words) OHIO FILINGS (68 words) OREGON FILINGS (61 words) PENNSYLVANIA FILINGS (303 words) PUERTO RICO FILINGS (65 words) SOUTH CAROLINA FILINGS (85 words) SOUTH DAKOTA FILINGS (36 words) TENNESSEE FILINGS (30 words) TEXAS FILINGS (192 words) VIRGINIA FILINGS (171 words) CopyrightNATIONAL BANKRUPTCY REPORTER via NewsNetJuly 29, 1993ALABAMA FILINGSALABAMA                    KEENUM, INC.7/7/93                     Manufacture of poultry vaccines, Anniston, ALND AL                      ASSETS: Undetermined at current dateNo. 93-4156                LIABILITIES: Undetermined at current date                           PRINCIPAL: Robert Keenum                           CONTACT: Harry P.

"If they can get $90 million, I think they'd takeit."The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ boughtthe company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't goingto look good."One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I thinkthe merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin MortgageCorp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestationrepo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Low-Mod Mortgage is Freddie's LargestFar Rockaway, NY-The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has purchased itslargest mortgage loan ever, a $44.43 million multifamily mortgage secured byWavecrest Gardens, a 1,657-unit complex here.Larson Financial Resources, a Program Plus lender based in Somerset, NJ, wasthe originator of this mortgage, which was made to Goldfarb Properties, theowner of the complex.The mortgage is a 20-year fixed-rate loan with a gross spread of 175 basispoints over Treasuries, with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and a debt servicecoverage ratio of 1.38.Freddie Mac's previous largest loan purchase was for $30 million in theChicago area.  Its average loan size for multifamily is $5 million.  Ittraditionally has made loans on smaller properties.Wavecrest Gardens is affordable to households with income of $34,000 or less,which is 80% of the local median income.  The complex has no subsidizedapartments.Thus this loan helps Freddie Mac meet its affordable housing mandates asestablished by Congress for both low and moderate income families and forcentral cities.  Far Rockaway is part of New York City.Leland Brendsel, chairman and chief executive of Freddie Mac, said thistransaction "shows our strong commitment to multifamily lending."The company has found that contributing to the deterioration of multifamilyhousing are situations where owners are under economic distress.It is important to create an economic situation where the owner can maintainthe building, Mr.  Brendsel said.Freddie Mac is looking to work with high quality lenders like Larson and highquality owners like Goldfarb that are committed to maintain the propertiesthey own, he addedThomas J.  Watt, senior vice president, multifamily housing, added that thedeal is "tangible evidence of Freddie Mac's ongoing commitment to New YorkCity."He likened Wavecrest Gardens to a community, with medical offices in a numberof buildings, an adjacent shopping center and even housing the local office ofRep.  Floyd Flake, D., NY.Rep.  Flake, whose tenancy mirrors the nearly 10 years that Goldfarb hascontrolled Wavecrest Gardens, said the owner's "commitment far exceeds whatthey've put in in dollars."Since acquiring the complex, Goldfarb has done massive renovations to 70% ofthe apartments.  The new loan will allow the owners to continue renovationsand make other improvements."Freddie Mac's financing of such a sizable, multifamily apartment complexdemonstrates its commitment to the stability of New York City's rental housingmarket and to urban communities that have a vested interest in affordablehousing," Mr.  Flake said.As of the end of November, Freddie Mac had purchased $180 million ofmultifamily mortgages in the New York City area.Mr.  Brendsel said the company expects to purchase $2 billion in multifamilyloans during 1995.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996FASB Report Details Derivatives DisclosuresNorwalk, CT-Federal Accounting Standards Board disclosure of derivativesholdings by several businesses - including several mortgage industry players -are available in a recent 100-page report by the agency for $11 a copy.Among the institutions studied are:  Astoria Federal Savings, Bank of America,Chase Manhattan and Chemical banks, Citicorp, Crestar Financial, FirstChicago, Hibernia Savings Bank, Huntington Bancshares, J.P.

Analysts believethese buybacks will take place in 1997."With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably abovethe statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand ourcommitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive JamesJohnson said.Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion."The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae amore diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have morethan one funding source," he added.FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,also gave its stamp of approval."Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company'scompliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that iswithdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirementsfor core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Maccurrently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stocksplit.Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in thefour-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individualinvestors."Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target priceon Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases."With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock shouldperform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996FNMA, NBA Teams Join Up for RehabsBoston-The Federal National Mortgage Association has formed partnerships with10 National Basketball Association teams to rehabilitate housing in thesurrounding neighborhoods of the various teams.Rehabilitation has begun on the second of five properties in Boston where FNMAteamed up with the Boston Celtics and the city government to providerenovation funds.The rehabilitation will be financed with a grant of $125,000 from the FannieMae Foundation, an undisclosed sum from the Boston Celtics and $100,000 fromthe city of Boston.The project is managed by Nuestra Comunidad, a nonprofit organization thatprovides housing for low- and moderate-income families.Employees of Fannie Mae and the Celtics will work together on the rehab.Fannie Mae recently formed its partnership with the Atlanta Hawks.  It willinvolve Hawks players and staff and Fannie Mae employees in consumer educationefforts to promote homeownership.The Hawks Home Team along with Fannie Mae staff will participate in therehabilitation of two homes for low-income families in Atlanta's Martin LutherKing Jr.  historic district.The project is managed by the Historic District Development Corp.  and fundedwith a $75,000 grant from the Foundation.As part of the Hawks partnership, Fannie Mae will become a broadcast sponsorof the Hawks' games, airing advertisements that offer viewers free informationon becoming a homeowner.Fannie Mae's partnership with the Houston Rockets will sponsor theconstruction of two homes in Houston's Fifth Ward neighborhood.The construction will be managed by the Fifth Ward Community RedevelopmentCorp., a local nonprofit.The Foundation provided a grant of $75,000.Fannie Mae also became a broadcast sponsor for the Rockets' games.In addition to the Celtics, Hawks, and Rockets, Fannie Mae has formedpartnerships with NBA teams in Seattle; Oakland, CA; Cleveland; San Antonio;Milwaukee; Charlotte, NC:  Portland, OR; and Washington, DC.By the end of the 1994-95 season, Fannie Mae's Home Team partnerships with NBAteams have built or rehabilitated 29 homes in inner-city communities and theFoundation has made more than $900,000 in grants to local nonprofitorganization to support the effort.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996GSE Stocks Seen Staying High in '96New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal NationalMortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been tradingnear or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for bothstocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The questionis whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies tonumerous factors."Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could bebecause a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end ofthe year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble whilethe financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both representconservative financials - a good place to be.Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are verygood, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondarymarket.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been verypositive, and this attracts investors."Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that thestocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doingreasonably well in recent weeks.But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlookfor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Asset Disposition RoundupWashington-The Federal National Mortgage Association is consolidating all ofits property management and disposition functions to the Southwestern RegionalOffice in Dallas.The change will allow the secondary mortgage market company to dispose ofacquired properties "more quickly and efficiently," said Robert Engelstad,senior vice president for mortgage and lender standards.It also will enable the agency to offer lenders a full range of services "thatwere previously available only in areas where we had large concentrations ofproperties," Mr.  Engelstad said in a recent lender-letter.However, Fannie Mae has elected to keep the post-foreclosure underwriting andservicing review functions performed by each regional office in those offices."To assure a more consistent application of our underwriting and servicingpolicies, we feel it is more appropriate to assign the responsibility ...  tothe servicer's leader regional office, particularly since that office is theone that is already performing post-purchase underwriting reviews andmonitoring a servicer's delinquent loan servicing performance," the letterexplained.The Dallas office will assume responsibility for managing and disposing ofproperties acquired in the Midwestern region on or after Feb.  1.Effective dates for further consolidation have not yet been set, but FannieMae has targeted the Southeastern region for the first quarter of 1996, theNortheastern region for the third quarter, and the Western region for early in1997.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Smith Barney & Others Named in EA SuitWashington-The government is suing Smith Barney Inc.  and an affiliate fornegligence in the sale of WESTSAV Mortgage Corp., Phoenix, a $2.2 billionservicer that was sold by the Resolution Trust Corp.  in 1991.Several other defendants were named in the case, including the winning bidderfor WESTSAV, Robert W.  Stallings, who renamed the company Express AmericaMortgage Corp., and transformed it into an aggressive wholesaler with $6.5billion in servicing.In September 1994, Mr.  Stallings sold Express America's servicing toNationsBanc, Charlotte, NC.  Express America no longer is in the mortgagebusiness.The RTC charges that Mr.  Stallings and Robert H.  Brown, senior vicepresident of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, engaged in "bidmanipulation" that allowed Mr.  Stallings to buy WESTSAV at a significantdiscount.Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, the broker of record on the sale, was an affiliate ofSmith Barney, a relationship that was not known to the RTC, the lawsuit says.Smith Barney served as the government's adviser on most of its mortgagebanking sales.The government charges that the defendants' conduct, "resulted in the RTCreceiving many millions of dollars less for WESTSAV than it would havereceived in an arms-length bidding process."The agency believes it could have made at least $15 million more on the dealif Smith Barney and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes had acted properly.The RTC sold WESTSAV through a stock deal to First Western Partners Inc., Mr.Stallings' company, in May 1991.  The net purchase price was about $26million, according to the lawsuit.Before buying WESTSAV, Mr.  Stallings worked for two S&Ls that later failed.He served as chief executive of WESTSAV's parent Western Savings and Loan,Dallas, before resigning in February 1990 to bid on WESTSAV.In October 1990 four firms made final bids for WESTSAV:  First Financial Groupwhich bid $27.3 million (net to the RTC); First Western $31.8 million (net);Maximilian $40 million (net); and Standard Federal/AMSI, $29 million (net).The lawsuit did not specify their locations.The RTC says First Western had no real financing lined up to buy WESTSAV butthe deal got pushed through by Mr.  Brown who was a long-time friend of Mr.Stallings.One Rauscher official, Tom Lykos, questioned First Western's financing but wastold by Mr.  Brown "not to worry about it," the lawsuit says.The agency says Mr.  Brown gave "inside information" to Mr.  Stallings on thepending sale.The RTC also charges that Rauscher evaluated the bids incorrectly whichbenefited First Western and Stallings."While RPR (Rauscher) reduced the First Western bid by the amount of WESTSAV'sliabilities, RPR also reduced the competing bids by the WESTSAV liabilitieswhich was wrong because the competing bids were submitted on a net basis," theRTC charges.The RTC investigated the case for at least two years.  The law firm bringingthe case on behalf of the government is Morris & Hecker, the same firm thatwon large settlements in the government's case against Charles Keating andprofessional defendants including several prominent law and accounting firms.Mr.  Stallings could not be reached for comment.  Smith Barney also could notbe reached for comment.Rauscher and Mr.  Brown released a statement saying the lawsuit is "withoutmerit."The statement adds that, "based on our own investigation into the matter wehave no reason to believe that any RPR employee did anything illegal orunethical in the course of the WESTSAV transaction."Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Editorial:  Credit Where It's DueThe fact that a governor of the Federal Reserve Board got turned down for acredit card is almost laughable.  And the fact that it was Lawrence B.Lindsey, the central banker most involved with consumer credit, who has beenwarning of the dangers inherent in bankers and other lenders turning theirdecision-making responsibilities over to automated systems, makes it even moreironic.According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Mr.  Lindsey applied for aToys 'R' Us card through Bank of New York, Delaware, which uses a strictcredit-scoring system.  The Federal Reserve official had refinanced amortgage; extended a line of credit and had several "routine reviews" of hiscredit files over the past year.So in spite of the fact that Mr.  Lindsey has a perfect payment record andadequate income for the credit card account he wanted to open, the number oflenders just looking at his background disqualified him under BofNY's creditscoring.And it seems, at the Delaware-based credit-card operation, while a human beingreviews all approvals, no one looks at the rejections based solely on score.Of course as soon as the bank learned that it had rejected an application froma VIP, it offered to issue a card with the full amount of credit Mr.  Lindseyhad been seeking.The point is that no consumer who pays all of his bills on time should bedenied appropriate credit based on some arbitrary, non-thinking system.We know of mortgage lenders where senior management reviews every rejectedloan application.  At these companies the question is can the application berescued and a means found of providing a mortgage.Unfortunately the trend is in the other direction, toward arbitrary systems.We don't think there's anything inherently wrong with credit scoring.  Butwhere it is allowed to make final judgments without any human, subjectiveoversight it can get out of hand, as the incident with Fed Governor Lindseydemonstrates.Wisconsin had variable-rate mortgages before almost any other state.  Thestate's former Sen.  William Proxmire, who was to become chairman of theSenate Banking Committee, as a young man saw a family member foreclosedbecause of the over-rapid increase in payments on a VRM.That incident probably delayed the implementation of adjustable-rate lendingby Federal financial institutions by eight to 10 years.New technology must be programmed to serve people.  If we become subservientto the technology we will have lost a lot more than we possibly can gain fromthe workload it assumes.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Land Investor Turns from Selling to Developing PropertiesWashington-When Eastern Realty won the bidding for a $99 million landportfolio from the Resolution Trust Corp.  in late 1993, the exit strategycalled for selling off most the portfolio over time.But times have changed and "now we find ourselves developing the largerproperties," ER president Jay Rollins said.Eastern Realty, McLean, VA, and its capital partner are developing fourresidential tracks it acquired in the land offering known as MACO III, namedafter RTC's Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Office.MACO III is an equity partnership and Eastern Realty is the general partner incharge of managing, developing and liquidating the assets for RTC.At a development site near Frederick, MD, Eastern Realty has delivered 12finished lots to production builders and it is under contract to deliveranother 65 lots.  When completed, the MACO III land asset will have 300 homesites.Prior to starting ER, Mr.  Rollins was director of finance for NVR, a largehomebuilder based in McLean.  And his long-term goal is to expand ER's landbusiness with builders."Our business focus in the future will be equity joint ventures withresidential builders and developers," Mr.  Rollins said in an interview.But right now, Eastern is concentrating on managing and working $400 millionin land and commercial assets it has acquired over the past 30 months with itscapital partners.The partnerships have purchased raw and finished land, including residentialand commercial land, from New Jersey to Tennessee.When Eastern Realty opened its doors in early 1993, land assets were plentifuland capital was scarce.  "Return expectations on pure equity capital were inthe 40% range," Mr.  Rollins.But the market for land has shifted dramatically, he said, after capital beganchasing the available product."Return expectations still are in the low 20's but it is very common toleverage those returns with a debt component," he said.With these changing market conditions, Mr.  Rollins has changed his approach.In its most recent deal, Eastern Realty and a capital partner acquired a $31million pool of hotel, office and land assets from First Fidelity Bancorp.,Newark, NJ."We expanded our reach beyond land assets and purchased subperforming hotelloans and a commercial office condominium project," Mr.  Rollins said.He also pointed out that banks are starting to sell smaller pools of assets."We think the large portfolio sales are winding down," he said.  "We arelooking to buy single asset notes, primarily land, and smaller pools ofassets," Mr.  Rollins said.As part of its operations, Eastern Realty also services land and constructionloans for banks and other investors.  The company currently services $40million in land and construction loans.

Parrish, national president of CFMA, said, "this is terrific news."Lenders' confidence in the construction industry - evidenced by theirgranting easier access to credit and larger credit lines - should mean highervolume and revenue in 1996."The survey polled 5,000 companies with annual revenues greater than $1million.  But despite their easier access to credit, respondents were not asoptimistic about future contract revenue as they were last year.  Fifty-fivepercent in 1995 anticipated an increase in next year's contract revenues, downfrom 64% last year.CFMA is the only nonprofit organization dedicated to serving the financialprofession within the construction industry.

Paul Sarbanes, D., MD, said.  "It desires to be retained."Sales of the tax credits to corporations and individuals raises equity tofinance the construction of affordable housing.At the press conference, the Enterprise Foundation, Columbia, MD, and theLocal Initiatives Support Corp.  here announced that they plan to raise $4.5billion in equity from selling tax credits and develop more than 100,000affordable housing units over the next seven years if the credit is preserved."To sunset the most effective tool ever found to attract private capital tothe housing needs of working families is contrary not only to good policy, butto common sense," said LISC president Paul Grogan.While cutting the LIHTC program is a budget game, the program has its criticsbecause the sales of the tax credits involve syndication fees and it isestimated investors expect a 15% return on their investments along with thetax advantages.Syndicating limited partnerships to individuals is technically complex andexpensive and the U.S.  General Accounting Office estimated several years agothat syndication costs consume 27% of the equity raised.In addition, the Internal Revenue Service and state housing agencies aresupposed to monitor compliance with the LIHTC requirements, but IRS is not setup to administer a housing program.The LIHTC program has become threatened many times before and it is an easytarget for congressional budget cutters.However, advocates of affordable housing are aware that Congress is reducingthe Federal government's role in providing low-income housing and LIHTCprogram is one of the last and most popular housing programs left."Subjecting, the credit to a year-by-year review creates a disincentive forinvestors and developers, and could ultimately destroy what has become one ofthe most effective programs for producing low-income housing in America," saidEnterprise Foundation chairman and chief executive Barton Harvey, IL.Even critics agreed that year-by-year extensions of the tax credit is theworse way to administer the program.It increases the risks to developers and drives up the risk premium investorsdemand when they purchase the credits, a budget analyst said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Letter to the EditorTo the Editor:I was misunderstood and sequentially misquoted in a front page article in theNov.  20th issue of National Mortgage News.

I clearly said some of those things, but there were threeseparate ideas in separate contexts.By linking two ideas, the flight from wholesale and a lesson, with a third,loan quality, in a single paragraph, the reporter mistakenly attributed to mesomething Jim Johnson said.  I don't think brokers originate inferior qualityproduct.  To the contrary.  Let me explain.When the reporter called recently and asked what I knew about PNC, I said twothings:  1) there was a change in management and 2) the company closed itstable funded broker operation.  A contact at the company had days earlierconfirmed these developments upon my inquiry.I told the reporter that PNC is the forty-second "name" to exit wholesale thepast 18 months.  (Wholesale Access keeps the scorecard via The WholesaleDirectory, so we know.)We talked about Jim Johnson's remarks in San Diego.  I raised the subject,having read an article about the conference in September's Origination News.I said I thought Johnson probably had it wrong.What I believed was that brokers don't determine quality - wholesalers do,they underwrite.  What I heard was that the data Fannie Mae have probably onlyshows the recent economic misfortune of the country's two largest markets,California and New York/New Jersey.Property values, home prices and activity are soft in these areas right now.Unfortunately, both are markets where brokers are the pre-eminent originators.They get well over 50% of total originations in these markets.  So, guesswhat, a downturn occurs and a correlation between brokers and higherdelinquency surfaces.  Hardly a surprise.Frankly, I believe that Johnson linked the two developments together beforeMBA audiences in order to justify adopting tiered pricing based on type oforiginator.NAMB needs to deal head-on with the TPO issue Fannie Mae's chairman raises.Otherwise, it will miss an important opportunity to set the record straight.This was the lesson - not broker quality, or the disappearance of a myriad ofnames from wholesaler ranks.Tom LaMalfa President TSL Consulting Co., Shaker Heights, OHBack to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996EDS:  AU Removes Bar to Direct GSE LendingArlington, VA-Nothing currently prevents the secondary market agencies fromlending direct to the consumer, says Larry Walker of EDS.Speaking at a conference here, he said, that is why "the term 'rip our faceoff' comes to mind," when the industry assesses the significance of theagencies' recent automation efforts, including automated underwriting.Despite the fact that the agencies say their charters don't allow them to lenddirect to the consumer, Mr.  Walker said, neither agency's charter expresslyprohibits consumer lending."Their charter doesn't provide for them to act as technology vendor either,"he added, echoing a point which others have made to National Mortgage News."Fannie and Freddie between them account for more than half of the technologydollars spent so far this year in the U.S.," Mr.  Walker said in a follow-upinterview, referring to the Federal National Mortgage Association and theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.He had given an address entitled, "The effect of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac'stechnology on the marketplace," at an electronic mortgage lending conferencerun by AIC.In a subsequent discussion, Mr.  Walker said, "of course Congress couldprevent it, but - while the agency charters don't provide for direct lending -there is nothing there to stop it."As to why the agency charters are widely perceived as direct lendingobstacles, it is possible that many may not have looked at the actualdocuments, he said.The Mortgage Bankers Association shares his interpretation of the agencycharters, Mr.  Walker said.Despite painting an ominous scenario, Mr.  Walker said of the agencies, "atthis point we probably should believe them."But, since, he continued, "the agencies have all the keys" he counseledlenders to position themselves so as to be less dependent on the agencies.Besides the specter of the government-sponsored agencies replacing lenders,Mr.  Walker - who directs the real estate and mortgage industry group EDS, aPlano, TX, technology vendor - said in his address, "there is a fear the GSEswill replace software vendors."He was particularly critical of Fannie Mae which he said "has gone further"than Freddie Mac.Fannie Mae had less financial need to get into technology sales and hasoffered technologies which extend beyond its legitimate need for upholdingcredit quality (something for which automated underwriting is used), he said.Additionally, Fannie's network is less open to censorship than Freddie's, hesaid.He also questioned recent advertising campaigns in consumer publications byFannie Mae."If they're not going direct to the consumer, why are they running ads inLadies Home Journal?," he asked the audience.Also regarding motivation to enter the technology arena, he said Freddie Macwas somewhat forced to change its function.  That's because the agency wasformed to serve thrifts but the thrift crisis eliminated much of its customerbase."So, the only ones we could give credence to would be Freddie Mac," Mr.Walker continued.Noting that Fannie Mae goes beyond offering automated underwriting, to DesktopOriginator, an origination system for brokers, and to Desktop Trader, he said,"Fannie Mae seems to be going down the path of software writer again."He was referring to Fannie's purchase, in the 1980s, of Servantis SystemsInc., a Norcross, GA, firm which it subsequently sold.Servantis, which lately goes under the name of SSI, provides origination andservicing software.  (Fannie used to market the origination product asMORTRACKS, Mr.  Walker noted.)Last August, a Fannie Mae representative publicly said "we're a technologyvendor.".Regarding the agency networks, Mr.  Walker contrasted Fannie's silence withFreddie's announcement that it does not monitor traffic through its network.Unlike Fannie's Mornet, Freddie's Goldworks is run by a third party (AdvantisInc.  of Schaumburg, IL).Although both agencies have likened their electronic network to a mall, inwhich they are but one store, Mr.  Walker argues the analogy doesn't hold wellfor Fannie."The difference is that Fannie owns the mall - and the security system -whereas Freddie rents," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996HUD Sale Features NonperformingWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development's next sale willfeature $700 million in nonperforming single-family loans, with 40% of thehouses in California, Colorado and Texas.The bid date on the 16,700 loans is scheduled for March 20 and HUD is tryingto make its second single-family sale more attractive to regional lenders andsmall investors.HUD wants to lower the minimum bid requirement from the current $5 million andcreate pools in terms of performance/delinquency status and by location.But the final structure of the sale has not been determined yet and bidpackages are not expected to be ready until early February.The Federal Housing Administration-assigned loans in the sale have alreadygone through a 36-month forbearance period and the entire pool has a weightedaverage coupon of 10% with remaining maturities of 15-20 years.Hamilton Securities Group here is advising HUD on the March sale; it alsoworked on the October sale in which four winning bidders divided $524 millionin FHA one-to-four-family loans.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Home Building Slows for Three QuartersWashington-The home building industry slowed down nationwide during the firstthree quarters of 1995, with the number of single-family building permitsissued dropping in 24 of the top 25 most active major markets - and in 47 ofthe top 50 - according to the National Association of Home Builders.Jim Irvine, president of the NAHB, said, "builders across the country areexperiencing a somewhat slower year.  Housing starts in 1995 have beenleveling off since a strong 1994.  Builders should see some slight improvementin 1996, if interest rates remain in the current 7.5% range and the overalleconomy shows some growth."Atlanta was the only market among the top 25 in the nation to increase itssingle-family permits through the first nine months of 1995.  In Atlanta, themost active market, there were 26,886 single-family housing permits issued, a5.8% increase over 1994.Only two other markets in the top 50 showed increases in single-family housingstarts through three quarters.

Rounding out thetop five, the third most active was Chicago, down 8.8%, fourth was Washington,DC, down 16.7%, and fifth was Las Vegas, down 5.9%.However, the NAHB said that the nationwide decline in the number ofsingle-family housing permits issued was somewhat offset by an increase inpermits for multifamily units, as multifamily construction continued itsincrease from its depression of 1993.Overall, of the top 50 most active markets for issuing single-family permits,27 declined more than 10% through the first nine months of 1995, with fivedeclining more than 20%.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Equity Roundup:  GSE Stocks Haven't Seen Their Best Days YetNew York-Smith Barney asks the question, "are Fannie and Freddie's best daysbehind them?"  Its answer, "No.  In fact, we think that there is no credibleevidence that the profitability of the two housing-relatedgovernment-sponsored enterprises has passed a peak."Smith Barney said some investors have expressed concern that the recent run-upin the stock price of the Federal National Mortgage Association and theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  might have left their shares susceptible toa free-fall.But fear that the two GSEs have become too big and are due for a downfall isnothing new.  According to Smith Barney, since 1991, doubters have been sayingthat the two companies are so big, and so dominant, that their profitabilityhas peaked.The most commonly stated reason for their contention, Smith Barney said, isthat almost 60% of all mortgages have been securitized - one of Fannie andFreddie's two basic businesses.  Doubters fear that if more than half of themarket has already been securitized, there simply cannot be much more room togrow.But Smith Barney is upbeat regarding the GSEs, saying, "we see a business thatshould be trending upward on a structural basis - leaving cyclicality and ratemovements aside - in coming years."Smith Barney cites the following:  a trend toward global funding which willbroaden the market for GSE debt and reduce funding costs, a new lendingcriteria to serve the vastly underserved affordable housing market,technological initiatives which should widen the housing market by increasingspeed and reducing origination costs, and increased expense control which willbe helped by technology.Smith Barney, however, did caution, "neither we nor our model have been ableto detect GSEs' business in a structural decline.

Trafton, Glendale Federal's chairman and chief executive officer,said the government's seeking of "an appeal to the United States Supreme Courtof a very strong U.S.  Court of Federal Claims decision in favor of GlendaleFederal that was affirmed overwhelmingly in a 9-2 ruling by the U.S.  Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit could represent another lost opportunity."He warned that "the amount of the bank's damages grows each day that thelitigation continues, and with a final judicial resolution of the liabilityissue, we may be compelled to accept nothing less than unconditional cashpayment for damages."Glendale Federal had offered to commit $1.5 billion, an amount it says it candocument having lost as a result of the government's breach of a supervisorygoodwill agreement involving Glendale's bailing out a failing Florida thrift.As a result of the government reneging, Glendale says it was forced into amassive and costly recapitalization."Now that the government has filed its appeal to the Supreme Court, we mustlimit the time for acceptance of our settlement proposal," said Mr.  Trafton."Damage to the bank continues to grow as the government extends thelitigation, and a final judicial resolution of the government's liabilitywould cast the entire issue of settlement into question."The Supreme Court may decline to consider the government's appeal, in whichcase the liability judgment against the government in the Court of FederalClaims would stand without possibility of further appeal.Glendale Federal Bank is one of the largest savings institutions in the UnitedStates, with 148 bank offices and 22 loan offices in California.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996REIT '96 Outlook:  Steady PerformersSan Francisco-In 1995, the yields on top stocks left even the leading realestate investment trust issues in the dust.But in 1996, say a variety of observers, fund managers increasingly will tuckaway 1995 profits in REITs, which, though not spectacular, can be counted onto perform reliably.Paul Puryear of Raymond James & Associates in St.  Petersburg says his firmremains bullish on REITs for 1996 because "REITs are developing a track recordof delivering on earnings."Predicting that the stock market as a whole will slow down, Mr.  Puryear toldNMN that low interest rates, low inflation and a probable slowdown in theeconomy will make REIT earnings look more attractive in 1996."Twelve to 18% total returns look good in that environment," he said,predicting that more utilities will invest in REITs.REITs allow real estate investment without the management headaches.  Becausethe underlying fundamentals for real estate are very strong right now, mutualfund managers will look to these investment vehicles for the "hedge factor,"A.G.  Edwards analyst Arthur Havener said.A low-interest environment offers REITs cheaper capital, noted Mr.  Havener,predicting the availability of 10-year financing in the 6%-7% range.  He saidleading REITs will want to amass cash in the bank "in anticipation of theacquisition market picking up again."This year, Mr.  Havener said, a number of real estate sellers are sitting onthe sidelines awaiting the outcome of the capital gains issue.  With orwithout capital gains tax relief, many will sell, and REITs will share in theharvest.The highly fragmented and undermanaged self-storage industry will offer anumber of acquisition targets that could roll up into "one big REIT," saidNAREIT's Virginia Wade.Chicago-based Real Estate Research Corp.  says pension funds in particularwill look more favorably on REITs in the coming year.  RERC surveys show that55% of pension funds intend to increase their REIT investments in 1996."REITs have matured in the last several years," says RERC researcher RobertBergson.  He said they have increased their attractiveness to traditionallyconservative institutional investors, despite the funds having been burned byREIT investments in the eighties.Cindy McHugh of Equity Residential Properties Trust concurs that REITinvestments by pension fund will increase in 1996, but said the increase willbe "very, very slow.  Their due diligence process is very extensive."And REITs are increasingly using the Internet.  NAREIT - very much involved inmaking the public more aware of REITs - has a web site, and Kranzco RealtyTrust, a shopping center REIT and pioneer in using the World Wide Web, toldNMN its Web experience has been very positive."We've gotten a lot of feedback from analysts, investors, brokers andtenants," said Michael Kranzdorf, the company's director of information.  Hesaid he expects more REITs to tout themselves on the Web because it has provenmore effective than any other medium in drawing direct inquiries frominvestors."In 1996, for the first time in several years South West Property Trustexpects the supply of new apartments in its markets as a whole to modestlyexceed demand," said a September SWP report.That potential softness in rental markets for cities like Dallas has drawnconsiderable attention, but Mr.  Puryear said people in the apartment REITindustry "are watching apartment start data very closely" in those markets and"there is a definite constraint on supply."Despite talk of an overabundance of apartment REITs, he expects the leadingresidential REITs to remain strong performers.Some apartment REIT stocks that "stagnated all year" are now "setting newhighs every day," said Mr.  Havener.  "Bay Apartments has taken off; it's nowin the $23 and change area."As REIT managers maneuver to enhance unencumbered revenues to achieve growth,1996 will continue to be a year of the balancing act.  REITs are notstructured to amass war chests.  The attractive feature of them for investors,as Ms McHugh points out, is the dividend.  Major investor Ken Heeber, who hasbeen exiting REITs this year, has been quoted as grumbling that they areshowing FFO growth of 10% to 15%, with dividends lagging at 5%.Grumbles like that can hurt.  To increase or not to increase dividend yieldsmay be a big question for REITs in 1996.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Duff & Phelps Likes Selloff of PruHomeChicago-The sale of Prudential Home Mortgage Co., Clayton, MO, should resultin reduced consolidated financial leverage for its parent company PrudentialInsurance Co.  of America, Newark, NJ, according to a report from Duff &Phelps Credit Rating Co.  here.On the other hand, by selling the mortgage operation, Prudential loses thebenefits of "good, long-term returns" and would have to replace those tomaintain its historical corporate-wide earnings potential."It is anticipated that business opportunities to expand existing businesseswith less interest rate sensitivity and lower earnings volatility wouldeventually be sought as the strategic direction of The Prudential under itsnew chairman, Art Ryan, becomes more focused on the company's core insurance,health care and investment management businesses," DCR said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Mellon Bank Is Set to Buy Source OneFarmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing SourceOne Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises HoldingsInc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjustedbook value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million atthe end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say ithas signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for SourceOne, the spokesperson said.Mellon said it had no comment.A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, withexcess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organizationgrowing its servicing, added the spokesperson.During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject tosevere run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make upearnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, butfailed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had alsoserved as adviser in that attempt.Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of thethird quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter lastyear, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund Americanspokesperson said.The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with aportfolio of $45.67 billion.On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemicalmerger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry'sseventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears aboutrun-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule thatequalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgageservicing rights."Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry."But that is not a major consideration here."In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with itsmost significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for$165 million cash.In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicingportfolio.Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3billion servicer.Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for LomasMortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.

Dodge Division ofMcGraw-Hill.Each of the construction industry's three main sectors - nonresidentialbuilding, housing and nonbuilding construction - showed modest declines fromrelatively healthy levels.Robert A.  Murray, vice president for economic affairs for F.W.  Dodge, said,"following the generally strong level of contracting during 1995's thirdquarter, the loss of momentum in October did not come as much of a surprise."It's consistent with various signs of a slower pace for the economy, and itcontinues a pattern which has been present throughout this constructionrecovery of strengthening activity followed by a pause."F.W.  Dodge reported that during October, nonresidential building decreased 7%to $104.8 billion from September, a lackluster amount by recent 1995 standardsbut still a 4% increase over 1994's average rate.The most pronounced downturn was felt in the institutional building categorieswhere slower contracting for schools, hospitals and detention facilities ledto a 14% decline from September.  Mr.  Murray said that while institutionalbuilding has been a steady source of expansion during the past 18 months, theOctober decline is suggestive of a slowdown in growth in the near future.Other nonresidential building, such as office construction and industrialplants, also fell from recent levels.Residential construction, at $125.6 billion, fell 1% in October.  F.W.  Dodgesaid that four of the nation's five major regions reported moderatereductions, while the South Central region boasted a 5% increase.Nonbuilding construction dropped 3% in October to $59.4 billion, entirely dueto a sharply reduced amount of utility construction, which on a month-to-monthbasis can be volatile.Overall in 1995, total construction was up 1% over the first 10 months of1994.o The Manufactured Housing Institute, Arlington, VA, announced that duringOctober manufactured home shipments topped 30,000 homes for the fourth time in1995.

The big money-center banks,many of which owned large shares in the mortgage firms, have agreed to writeoff a big chunk of the $64 billion in losses that are expected from theliquidation of seven of the eight mortgage firms.According to Thomson BankWatch, the stumbling point for some time has been theallocation of the substantial losses among the creditor group, and whether thegovernment would provide direct assistance.There are two aspects to the plan.  The allocation of approximately '6.3trillion in "first round losses" from jusen problem loans.  Second, is theestablishment of the Jusen Resolution Corp.  (JRC) to liquidate, over a10-year period, approximately '3.3 trillion in problem assets backed by someform of collateral and '3.5 trillion in performing assets.Regarding the allocation of the first round losses, founding banks of thejusen will write off 100% of loans, or '3.5 trillion.  Other bank lenders willwrite off from 40% to 60% of their loans, to total '1.7 trillion.The agricultural credit sector will write off an amount equal to less than 10%of their exposure, or '530 billion (this is the interest earned on loans madeto the jusen since initial restructuring plans started in 1993).Finally, the government will provide '685 billion in the 1996 general budgetinto seven special accounts (one for each of the housing loan companies) inthe deposit insurance authority.  These funds will also be used to cover firstround write-offs of unrecovered loans.The JRC will acquire the remaining '6.7 trillion in loans, of which about halfare nonperforming, but backed by some collateral.These assets will be purchased by the JRC at face value, with funding in theform of low-interest loans from the founding banks, the agricultural creditsector and other lenders.The JRC will be capitalized at '100 billion by founding banks and the depositinsurance corporation (the latter using funds provided by the Bank of Japan).The JRC will maintain the loans in seven separate accounts - one from each ofthe original housing loan companies.Founding banks, together with the government, are expected to share ultimatelosses on these assets, in a yet undefined ratio.The JRC, with an expected life of 10 years, will be staffed by housing loancompany employees as well as law enforcement officers, prosecutors and taxofficials.The proposal has split the ruling coalition in Japan's legislature, the Diet.While most observers expect the Diet to approve the proposed bailout as it isspelled out in the government's budget, that approval is not assured.There is a huge volume of bad loans piled up by the country's eight mortgagecompanies.  For the most part, these unrecoverable debts were put on the booksin the 1980s when the companies took on huge property deals, most of whichwent bad as the Japanese economy tanked early in this decade.Finance companies and agricultural cooperatives also were substantialinvestors.The banks and other investors in the jusen had about $130 billion invested inthem as of last March.  The seven troubled companies reported bad assetsbetween 40% and 70% of total assets.The government had encouraged formation of the jusen.  Loans from banks andothers accounted for an increasing portion of the housing market and the jusentook their surplus loan funds into highly speculative real estate deals, inmuch the same fashion as did many of the "high-flier" thrifts which ignoredhousing to take advantage of expanded powers at both the state and Federallevel.Most economists believe that on the whole, bad loans at these institutionsaccount for more than half the total.The forgiveness of loans by the big banks will be accompanied by some newlending by agricultural cooperatives and assistance from other financialinstitutions.In addition to the $64 billion already recognized as unrecoverable, someestimates are that the mortgage companies have $12 billion additional in loansthat will have to be written off.  But this is just the beginning of theprocess of cleaning up Japan's bad-debt problem.The Japanese financial system is believed to have more than $400 billion inbad debts, and the country's banks have been retreating from aggressiveforeign investment to a more insular approach.As a result, Japanese banks have been taking big losses on real estateinvestments in the U.S.  In many cases, the percentage of loss for Japaneseinvestors has equaled that of the RTC when it was selling properties acquiredby failed savings and loans.In Japan, the farm cooperatives will fare better than any of the other groupsinvolved in the government-sponsored solution.  They will be asked to makegrants and low interest loans to the new agency totaling about $5.3 billion.In exchange their $5.5 billion in claims for loans to the mortgage companieswill be repaid.Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama made no bones about the fact that it is thesocial and political importance of agriculture that shaped the decision tofavor the cooperatives in structuring the workout plan.  But the decision waspolitical with the Agricultural Ministry winning out over the Finance Ministryon the issue.This is in sharp contrast to the policy followed by the U.S.  Government,which beginning in the early 1980s followed a policy favoring the commercialbanks in each phase of the savings and loan and real estate workout, but neverhas enunciated the reasoning behind its actions.Nonbank financial institutions in Japan, which have about $17 billion on loanto the mortgage companies, can kiss that amount good-bye and are being askedto provide both capital and loans to the rescue agency.Observers suggested that the $6.8 billion in public money may be only thebeginning for the Japanese taxpayer, particularly if the economy worsensand/or real estate prices decline further.But it seems to us that the Japanese have made a pretty good start on theirproblem in contrast to a dozen years ago, when politics in this countryproduced a policy of inaction.The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had asked for $15 billion to be charged tothe thrift industry as a means of tackling the problems that were emerging inTexas, California, Arizona and Ohio, among others.The S&L industry balked, both at the size of the payment and at the idea ofthe FHLBB having that much money with which to close down institutions.Looking back, the $15 billion would not have solved the problem, but itprobably would have saved $50 billion or more of the eventual cost.Institutions that could have been shut continued to operate - and to bleed -until 1987, or even later.The industry's cost went well beyond $15 billion and if the SavingsAssociation Insurance Fund legislation is any guide, the price will go upstill further.By short-circuiting the politics and reaching down for public money in theinitial phases of its workout, the Japanese Finance Ministry likely isreducing the long-term cost to that nation's citizens.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996GlenFed Selling $2B in CMOsGlendale, CA-Glendale Federal Bank recently put $1.8 billion in fixed-ratecollateralized mortgage obligations up for sale in a move that will meantaking a $30 million after-tax loss for the quarter ending Dec.  31.About half of Glenfed's CMO portfolio had been sold by mid-December and thebank reported that it expected to complete the sale by early 1996.  Glenfedthen plans to replace the fixed-rate securities with adjustable rate assets.The CMOs are all short-term securities that were categorized as having anaverage life of two to four years when the bank purchased them about two yearsago, according to retail bank operations staff.  Most are first trancheinvestments but a few are second tranche, issued from at least 20 differentsources and backed by a diverse, nationwide base of loans.Bank president Stephen J.  Trafton said the bank took advantage of a one-timewindow of opportunity covering a 90-day period between mid-November and Dec.31, 1995 to reclassify the assets.  The move was allowed under Federalaccounting standard 115."These sales will improve our capital ratios, thus freeing up capital forpossible use in pursuing additional merger and acquisition and otherreinvestment strategies," he said.The reclassification is designed to make Glenfed's portfolio more "flexible,"Mr.  Trafton said.  A bank analyst has recently named Glenfed a takeovercandidate, but a bank spokesman said Mr.  Trafton's comment about mergers andacquisitions "has nothing to do with fattening ourselves for somebody else."In addition to putting the CMOs on the market, the bank simultaneouslyrecategorized $1 billion of its adjustable rate pass-through securitiesportfolio as "available for sale," but has no immediate plans to sell them,officials reported.The bank has been selling off loans and loan products since last year, when itmade plans to achieve a goal ratio of 70% deposits to 30% borrowings for itsconversion.  The bank's ratio of deposits to borrowings was 60% to 40% as ofits last earnings report on Sept.  30.In preparing for conversion, the bank also is bracing itself for an upcoming$47 million loss that will hit when the Federal budget reconciliation billpasses.  The loss is a one-time assessment Glenfed is being charged torecapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund when it converts.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Fleet Selling Mortgages To Fund NatWest BuyBoston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will putbillions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market asit sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own tofund the move.Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages andsecurities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes toretire debt."We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms ofcertain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chiefexecutive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he waspleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction andfinancing largely internally."Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combinedFleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of NewYork's president and chief executive.Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bankplans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice presidentEugene McQuade."In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doingboth at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostlyinvestment securities and residential mortgages," he said."Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yieldingassets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial andindustrial loans and consumer loans."Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment aboutthe composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be sellingto finance the acquisition.But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions ofdollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans atthat time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman saidthat Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired ShawmutNational Bank.Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backedsecurities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified asheld-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBSrepresented about 40% of their total securities holdings.Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be savedwhen Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plusbranches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in LongIsland, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cutswill be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half thepositions are expected to be lost through "attrition."After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closingslated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eightyears to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million inpayments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annualpayments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorphas agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  TheBritish company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loansand repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a fewhave expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next fewyears.In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also couldpotentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's InvestorsService, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to"positive" from "stable.""While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from abetter earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhancedrevenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening itsmarket in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and NewJersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging withShawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe theacquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company'scredit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuildcapital."The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reservecoverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisitionreduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheetclearly has a higher risk profile."Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996The Haves and Have-Notsby William J.  McDonough President, Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkMr.  McDonough recently spoke about the business community's stake inimproving inner-city areas.  His remarks were delivered at the wintermanagement conference of America's Community Bankers and have been excerptedas our Open Forum.In the long-run, I am convinced, economic development can be sustained only ifthe growing economic pie is shared by all parts of society - rich and poor,urban and rural, skilled and less skilled - and by all racial groups.  Unlessall parts of society share in and therefore have a stake in economic growth,we cannot have the social and political cohesion that is essential to sustaingrowth.I will not dwell on what government can and should do.  Those debates aregoing on in Washington, and elsewhere, and we are well aware of the issues.Broadly, I think there is widespread agreement that efforts by Federal, stateand local governments to reduce regulations can lead to lower costs, making iteasier to do business and create jobs.Moreover, it is also clear that government is a key player in improving ourpublic education system.  But government action alone is not sufficient.Government efforts require the essential underlying support of the privatesector.  Private sector participants need to redouble their efforts to bringjob growth and prosperity to all levels of our society.  This is a task thegovernment simply cannot shoulder alone.Private sector involvement is important not only for philanthropic reasons butalso for reasons of raw self-interest.  A recent report of the Committee forEconomic Development summarizes in a concise and persuasive way why each of us- particularly those who are business leaders - have a stake in the innercities.First, inner-city blight undermines the fiscal and operational health of majorcities because distressed neighborhoods contribute little to a city's tax baseyet impose heavy demands on public services.Second, cities possess significant national economic assets in the form ofproductivity-enhancing infrastructure and unique cultural institutions, aswell as anchors to the economic growth of their suburbs.  Inner-city distressweakens the value of those assets.Third, employers must rely for their future workforce on groups heavilyrepresented in inner cities.  The inadequacy of educational preparation in theinner cities can diminish the quality of this nation's human capital, a key toeconomic growth and prosperity.Fourth, the costs of inner-city problems fall on taxpayers wherever theyreside.Finally, there is an inconsistency between the isolation of our distressedurban neighborhoods and our national ideals of equality of opportunity for allpersons.I commend the CED report to you and its recommendations for greaterbusiness-sector involvement with community groups in rebuilding areas whereeconomic blight is most concentrated.  I share many of the views expressed inthe CED report and believe the time is short to act upon them.I know that you as community bankers play a particularly important role inproviding financing for local communities.  I also know that many of you arecurrently involved, as we are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in awide range of educational and community development initiatives.For example, I am well aware that banks have accomplished a great deal inactivities encouraged by the Community Reinvestment Act.  I am also well awarethat many in this audience generously support development efforts throughphilanthropic and civic organizations.In fact, I sometimes think that too little attention is given to the manysuccesses that have emerged from partnerships between business and communitygroups around the nation.  There are several key elements in those successfulefforts that provide lessons for the types of involvement that the privatesector might undertake.First, by their support and active involvement, mainstream corporations canprovide well-organized community groups with the ability to leverage thenecessary resources to initiate comprehensive community-building strategiesthat will be sustainable over the long-term.For example, the members of the South Bronx community development corporationin collaboration with such partners as the New York City Partnership and theLocal Initiatives Support Corp., and with the support of financialinstitutions and the active participation of community residents, havetransformed their part of the South Bronx from rubble-strewn lots to a vibrantcommunity.Second, the private sector can provide part of the financing required forcommunity development, and I believe that banks can and should play a greaterrole in this area.  Communities need access to capital to improve theirinfrastructure, create housing, and attract the businesses that create jobs.While financial institutions are a critical part of a comprehensive strategyand a source of capital to communities, it is important to look to otherinstitutional players as well.Third, the private sector can provide critical technical assistance.  Myinstitution, as most of you know, cannot provide capital to local communities.Nevertheless, volunteers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York haveprovided technical assistance to community-based organizations by sharingexpertise in financial analysis, computer system design, and strategicplanning.As another example, our Bank prepared a guide for small business ownersintended to facilitate communication between entrepreneurs and bankers, aswell as identify other sources of finance and assistance.  Over 140,000 ofthose pamphlets have been distributed nationwide through our offices in thelast year.Fourth, the private sector can play a key role in training our future workforce as well as retraining the adult population in the skills needed intoday's high wage industries.At my Bank, we have a team that recruits staffers to serve as mentors forlocal high school students and to speak in classrooms - thereby attempting tobridge the gap between the workplace and school.  One group has had so muchsuccess helping elementary school pupils improve their academic performancethat the students' parents have asked for a tutoring program, too.Finally, private industry can work in partnership with established localcommunity groups.  These grass-roots are the people who know theirneighborhoods and know what is most likely to work or not work.  What thesegroups do not need is others telling them what to do; what they do need is thewillingness of businesses and individuals to work in partnership with them.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996WAMU is WA Mortgage LeaderNew York-Washington Mutual Federal Savings Bank led in both single-familyfixed-rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans in the state of Washington inthe third quarter, according to figures released by TRW REDI Property Data.For the three months, the bank originated 3,464 fixed-rate residential loansfor a total of $302.1 million, a 10% market share.

The auctioneer sold $29.4 million in performing condo loans for94.9 cents on the dollar.  Some $12.9 million in nonperforming condominiumloans sold for 52.6 cents on the dollar.The auction featured only $5.4 million in FHA/VA loans and the performers soldfor 99.8 cents on the dollar and nonperformers sold for 72.2 cents on thedollar.In terms of commercial mortgages, RTC sold $39.9 million in office loans andrecovered 65 cents on the dollar and $59.3 million in multifamily loans andrecovered 70.1 cents on the dollar.Developed land credits made up $103.4 million of the loans auctioned off thatstarted Dec.  13 and RTC recovered $67.3 million or 65 cents on the dollar.The three-day auction in Kansas City started Dec.  13 and it attracted 233bidders.

Be proud of it," former RTC chiefWilliam Seidman told an auditorium full of RTC employees last month, many ofwhom now are being laid off.Led by then FDIC chairman Seidman, a cadre of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.executives built an asset management and sales organization that grew to 9,000employees despite relying extensively on the private sector.  During its sixyears, RTC issued 158,000 contracts to private firms worth $5 billion."We had a tough time getting the operation going," Mr.  Seidman admitted.  RTChad a convoluted command structure and Treasury Department officials kept theagency bound up in a confusing approval process.RTC was criticized for holding assets and was criticized at the same time forselling assets."For every Congressmen that told us to sell a property now there were thosewho said hang on to it," Mr.  Seidman said.The collapse of much of the S&L industry coincided with mounting bank failuresand a real estate market that was depressed and caught in a credit crunch.To get its sales efforts going, RTC had to restart the markets and find newways to sell failed S&Ls.This took innovation on the part of RTC executives, including president DavidCooke, thrift resolution chief William Roelle and asset sales chief LamarKelley, who were willing to experiment and learn from mistakes.RTC began by breaking up S&Ls franchises and selling the branches separatelyfrom the assets.The agency adopted a wholesale strategy for selling assets that included largepublic outcry auctions of real estate and loans, securitizations of performingand nonperforming loans and structured transactions that allowed RTC to sellreal estate or loans in $100 million multiples.RTC entered a fledgling commercial mortgage-backed securities market in 1991and issued $16.5 billion in CMBS over the next four years.  RTC alsosecuritized $23.7 billion in one-to-four-family mortgages.What was considered risky and controversial in these areas a few years ago nowis considered standard practice.RTC just concluded its eighth and last national loan auction where it sold$577 million (book value) in performing and nonperforming and nonperformingloans for $404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.And RTC just issued its last CMBS, a $325 million offering, with barely anymention or notice in the press.But many of RTC's early initiatives were not as successful.In a public relations flop, RTC had to cancel its first $300 million realestate auction because the auctioneer failed to put up $2 million formarketing expenses.RTC also tried blind sales, because it had problems finding and identifyingassets for bulk sales, and creative financing schemes, like cash-flowmortgages, so it could sell empty office buildings and hotels.These experimental transactions evolved into bulk sales, called structuredtransactions that commercial banks and insurance companies later adopted toget rid of the problem real estate assets in their portfoliosBut RTC's first structured transaction, a $180 million offering ofnonperforming commercial mortgages, raised a stink in the press because thewinning bidder Maxxam chairman Charles Hurwitz formerly owned a thrift thatfailed.Last week FDIC sued Mr.  Hurwitz for $250 million in damages, alleging hecontributed to the failure of United Savings Bank of Texas, Houston.In most instances, the buyers who stepped up to the plate first, walked awaywith the best deals.For example, G.E.  Capital Corp., Stamford, entered into an agreement with RTCto buy $1 billion in nonperforming commercial mortgages and share 25% of theprofits with RTC.The RTC Inspector General estimates that GE will make an 70% gross profitmargin on its investment.RTC learned from these transactions, however.  More buyers came to the tableand RTC got better prices once the risk takers like GE showed the way.But political fights over RTC funding and a parade of scandals and snafus tookits toll on RTC executives.  As a scapegoat, David Cooke was forced out in apolitical deal to get additional funding for RTC.The refusal of Congress to confirm President Clinton's nominee to run RTC putthrift resolution chief Roelle in a position of getting tarred in theWhitewater scandal.As the remaining executive, Mr.  Roelle briefed acting RTC chief and Treasuryunder secretary Roger Altman about RTC's investigations into PresidentClinton's ties with a failed Arkansas thrift, Madison Guaranty.Revelations that Treasury officials passed this information to the White Houseforced Mr.  Altman to resign from Treasury.Mr.  Roelle was forced to take a less visible position at RTC and he returnedto FDIC.Mr.  Kelley, who guided RTC's asset sale program, was able to leave RTCwithout a cloud.  But like, Mr.  Roelle, he left quietly and with littlethanks.One of RTC's most persistent Congressional critics has been Rep.  Bruce Vento,D., MN.  He continues to give RTC bad marks for failing to develop aninformation system to keep track of assets and contracts.And as the chairman of an RTC oversight task force for the House BankingCommittee, he was instrumental in getting RTC to adopt many managementreforms.Nevertheless, Rep Vento hopes the expertise RTC developed with its "on the jobtraining" will be transferred to the FDIC and he believes a Federal assetdisposition agency should be created to protect the taxpayer's dollars andassets."The Federal Housing Administration is an example of why the Federalgovernment ought to have this expertise," he said.FHA is in the process of selling off billions of dollars of nonperformingsingle-family and multifamily loans and it has adopted many of RTC's salespractices."They have obviously moved the assets," Rep.  Vento said.  But he cast doubton RTC's claim that it recovered 87 cents on all the assets it sold."How they come up with these figures with such a high return is sort ofquestionable," he said.The RTC figure does not take into the account the fact that the thrifts hadalready written down the loans before RTC took over the institutions."While there will always be critics pointing to places where RTC tripped orstumbled, anyone who looks at the whole picture will be impressed, Mr.  Cookeclaimed at the RTC pep rally."You successfully balanced the conflicting demands to sell assets quickly andat the best price.  At the same time, we opened up housing opportunities forlower-income families and provided new opportunities for minority contractorsand small investors," he said."Congratulations for a job well done," Mr.  Cooke said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Lenders Expect FHA Loans to Be CoveredWashington-As the partial Federal government shutdown enters its third week,lenders continue to make Federal Housing Administration loans with theunderstanding that the Department of Housing and Urban Development willprocess and insure the loans once it reopens.FHA's handling of the first shutdown gave a lot of lenders comfort, accordingto Mortgage Bankers Association staff vice president Brian Chappelle."But it is getting a little more nerve-racking as this shutdown goes on weekafter week," he said.However, the Veterans Affairs mortgage program becomes a bigger problemstarting Jan.  1 because Congress failed to extend lenders' authority tonegotiate interest rates.  As a result, VA officials set the interest rate at7% late last week.So lenders will have to make VA loans at 7%, which is a bit low and the buyercannot pay the points.  "It is going to raise a myriad of processingproblems," Mr.  Chappelle said.Meanwhile, the Government National Mortgage Association continues to guaranteesecurities for issuers that purchased commitments prior to the Dec.  16shutdown.After the first shutdown around Thanksgiving, "a number of issuers came in thedoor to purchase commitment authority so they would not be caught during theshutdown period," according to the GNMA president Kevin Chavers.But a couple of issuers didn't make it through the door.  "There is nothing wecan do for them.  There is no commitment authority to be purchased," Mr.Chavers said.Meanwhile, FHA is not processing endorsements, according to Sarah Rosenspecial assistant to the FHA commissioner.  "So lenders are taking some riskif they close a loan," she said.However, lenders can still obtain loan case numbers through CHUMs lenderaccess system and get credit checks electronically, she said.Although HUD has no funding, the Senate did confirm the nominations of Mr.Chavers to be Ginnie Mae president, John Knubel to be HUD's' chief financialofficer, Dwight Robinson to be deputy secretary for housing and urbandevelopment and Hal DeCell 3d to be assistant secretary in charge ofCongressional and public affairs.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996BRE Properties Approves Stock Option PlanNew York-BRE Properties Inc., San Francisco, has approved a plan in whichindependent directors of the company would relinquish cash compensation inexchange for stock options in BRE.Targeted minimum levels of personal investment in BRE stock also would beestablished for outside directors.Under the stock option plan, which is subject to shareholder approval, outsidedirectors of the company would waive annual retainers and board meeting feesin exchange for annual options to purchase 12,500 shares of the company'scommon stock at its then current market price.An additional 2,500 annual options could be earned for achievement of certainperformance objectives in the prior year.

Morgan & Co., New York.Investor Robert Bass created the Brazos Fund and its limited partners includepublic and private pension funds, endowments, family trusts, commercial banksand insurance companies.The fund started its acquisition train in March with $140 million in capitaland Brazos has completed 13 acquisitions ranging from a $25 millionacquisition from Home Savings of America, Los Angeles, to a $1 billionportfolio acquisition from a Canadian thrift called North American Trust Co.Brazos had a Canadian pension fund as a capital partner in the North AmericanTrust transaction, according to Brazos Partners president Rob Gidel.  JohnGrayken is the managing director of the fund.Brazos also has a strategic alliance with BlackRock Asset Investors, New York,which invests in commercial mortgage-backed securities.Brazos is currently in the process of restructuring its portfolio to see whichassets can be sold as whole loans or in securitizations.  Mr.  Gidel expectsthat the sales strategy will be set early this year.  "Our business is not toaccumulate assets under management," he said.If they are securitized, Brazos intends to retain and service the "B" piecesthrough its asset management affiliate, Brazos Advisors L.L.C., which is inthe process of being rated as a special servicer.Brazos Advisors services all of the Brazos Fund assets, including all theassets from the North American Trust deal and its share of the Kemper deal.Those deals exemplify Brazos' preference for negotiated deals and why it staysaway from competitively bid transactions such as the multifamily sales by theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development."When you get into those controlled auctions it's just not going to meet outpricing objectives," Mr.  Gidel said.  "The pricing is too rich for us."However, Brazos participated in the last Resolution Trust Corp.  loan auctionin Kansas City and actually "picked up an asset," he said."We do try to understand what is going on at these controlled auctions and seewhat the pricing is.  You never know, you may end up buying something afterthe auction from the people that win it," he said.Brazos also looked at the recent Sanwa Bank portfolio that the Japanese banksold to Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, W.  Palm Beach, FL.  The SouthernCalifornia portfolio included $160 million in performing and nonperformingmortgages.Mr.  Gidel expects the Japanese banks will be selling more assets this year."We have done three deals with Japanese banks.  We obviously think that'sgoing to be an opportunity for us in the future," he said.Through the alliances with co-investors and leveraging its capital, the Brazosfund still has $100 million to invest."We see some exciting opportunities up in Canada.  The dynamics up there lookvery similar to what we saw in the states a couple of years back," Mr.  Gidelsaid.But he expects to see fewer sales by U.S.  banks and insurance companies thisyear."However, there are interesting opportunities among operating companies thatare looking to divest themselves of real estate," Mr.  Gidel said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Bank of America To Offer Fixed-Rate Prepayment PenaltiesSan Francisco-Bank of America plans to offer up to one-eighth or one-fourth ofa percentage discount on interest rates for fixed-rate home loans that carryprepayment penalties, said Claus Lund, senior vice president of mortgage assetmanagement.A "handful" of such loans have already been made on an experimental basis,spurred by the success of Bank of America's adjustable rate prepaymentpenalties and prepayment penalties in the commercial mortgage-backedsecurities market at large, Mr.  Lund said."The MBS market will accept those loan types because they will be protectingthe investor and we believe the market will start paying up for that type ofasset," he said.  "I think a lot of investors in servicing will realize thatthis has potential."The Federal National Mortgage Association and Morgan Stanley & Co.  have showninterest in the new loan, which will penalize borrowers 2% of up to 80% oftheir outstanding loan amount if they prepay within the first three years, Mr.Lund said.So far, the collateralized mortgage obligation market is showing more of aninterest in the fixed-rate prepayment penalty loans than the mortgagepass-through market, he said.The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has been less receptive to theprepayment penalized loans, Mr.  Lund said.Previously, banks have been adverse to affixing prepayment penalties tofixed-rate mortgages because they look unfriendly to borrowers, he said.  ButMr.  Lund said he believes the discount offered for the penalties will befavorable to borrowers as well as investors."This is not something where we're going out and providing the borrower withwhat is an unpleasant asset," he said.  "This is something where the borrowercan take advantage of a better rate if they know they are going to be in theirhouse for some time."Bank of America may not be the only large lender considering making such loansat a time when low rates and refinancings have led to "purchased assetsdisappearing quicker than a snowman in July," Mr.  Lund said.  But he believesthe bank is "one of the pioneers in the field."The move marks an increased re-emphasis on securitization concerns at thebank.  Securitization and secondary market business have been comparativelylight over the past few years, but added that the bank is a long-time playerin the field, having issued the first private MBS in the mid-'70s.Thus far in the 1990s, Bank of America has securitized $2 billion to $4billion of its loans each year, he said.  This year it has done about $2.5billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitizations and about a half billionin private issues, Mr.  Lund said.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996BF Enterprises Reports Income LossSan Francisco-BF Enterprises Inc.  reported that for the three months endedSept.  30, net income was $80,000, or 2 cents per share on revenues of$1,429,000.For the same period in 1994, net income was $339,000, or 9 cents per share, onrevenues of $870,000.The company said that the reduction in income in 1995 was due primarily to alower level of lot sales to builders at the company's Meadow Pointe projectnear Tampa, FL, and a substantial decline in the rent being received during1995 from the company's commercial building in Tempe, AZ.As a result of the amendment of the original lease and the execution of a new10-year net lease of the Tempe property, annual rental revenue from thatproperty is expected to decrease to approximately $350,000 in 1995 from$505,000 in 1994, but will increase to approximately $1,450,000 in 1996.Real estate revenue for the 1995 third quarter and nine month periods included$804,000 from the sale of a commercial property in Edina, MN, for which thecompany reported a loss of $29,000.BF Enterprises is a San Francisco-based real estate holding and developmentcompany.Back to Headline List CopyrightNATIONAL MORTGAGE NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY 2, 1996Equity RoundupNew YorkAMRESCO Inc., Dallas, has priced the public offering of four million shares ofthe company's common stock.

Among CCUL's concerns are retaining specialized examiners,increased operating fees, sustaining relations with NCUA includingprotecting state authority from federal encroachment and assurance that thenew regulator will promote the league's legislative agenda.        The State of California Department of Corporations, Business andTransportation Agency promulgated a proposal to transfer regulatory andsupervisory duties for credit unions, presently within the DoC, to theDepartment of State Banking.        John Annaloro, the league's senior vice president of public andgovernment relations, told California's DoC in a Dec. 9 letter that theleague's concerns "at a minimum, would have to be resolved to our completesatisfaction before credit unions could consider supporting anyconsolidation effort."        CCUL is fighting a battle that 44 other states tussled with andlost--but not necessarily to their detriment. "Consolidation isn'tnecessarily awful. The key is the supervision has to be credit unionspecific," Doug Duerr, president and CEO of the National Association ofState Credit Union Supervisors, told NCUA Watch. He said the change can bepositive because it provides additional resources, i.e. investment productexpertise and greater access to legal counsel.        The states that still have stand-alone credit union departments areAlabama, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas and Puerto Rico.        CCUL said the Department of Corporations is against the changeover,but the move has the backing of powerful state legislators, including thechairs of both the Assembly and Senate banking committees.        While no specific legislation to advance this action in Californiaexists now, Robert Arnould, director of legislative affairs for CCUL, saidhe will meet with California Gov. Pete Wilson's office to uncover hisintentions.        Arnould said "the proposal is part of a broader package tostreamline and bring efficiency to state government." He said thegovernor's office is very anxious to hear CCUL's concerns and it's notreally interested in moving forward unless the credit union industry hassupport. "I don't think they want a big fight with the industry. They areaware of our lobbying abilities."        CCUL also conducted a survey among state-licensed credit unionsregarding their satisfaction with the DoC and their willingness to considerconsolidation. The study found most state credit unions would rather beregulated by the DoC than NCUA. It also concluded most larger credit unionsopposed a merger while medium and smaller CUs supported it.        CCUL said the merger would be detrimental to credit unions if thenew regulatory authority didn't learn the distinctions of nonprofit goalsvs. the competitive goals of for-profit banking.        Other critical subjects CCUL broached were federal depositinsurance and generally accepted accounting principles. The league arguedcredit unions are different from other financial institutions in theserespects and warrant specialized examiners.        California credit unions have made a substantial investment intraining and computers for the DoC credit union staff. Through the use ofoperating and deposit insurance funds many millions of dollars have beenspent educating California's examiners and other officials. Therefore, theleague said, this investment would be lost if new training devices wereneeded.        CCUL also said CUs should have separate regulatory and supervisorypolicies because the league and credit unions have invested substantialresources in adopting laws and regulations that govern operations.        The league also wants assurance that consolidation results inreduced operating and examination fees for credit unions because they payfor the operation of the DoC. The league also argued state credit unionspay substantially more in operating and examination fees than their federalcounterparts.        A consolidated regulator would have to sustain a positiverelationship with NCUA, the league said. Common examination platforms,shared computer technology and other cooperative arrangements minimizeregulatory burdens for all parties, it argued. But the regulator would alsohave to protect state authority from federal encroachment, CCUL said.        In addition, CCUL's legislative agenda to recodify the credit unionlaw and seek franchise and sales tax relief would have to be maintained aswell.        Duerr said the tax issues in California and the potential change inthe regulatory environment make the climate for state-chartered creditunions in that state inhospitable. He said it's also important to note thata gray area exists as each state's regulatory framework varies somewhat.        In July 1995, a proposal was passed and signed into law by Gov.Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin that created a new department consisting ofseveral divisions, mirroring what is already law in 44 states. According tothe Wisconsin League, as a result of legislative compromise, credit unionswill be one of the divisions attached to this new department foradministrative purposes, while retaining its autonomy as a separate entitycalled the Department of Credit Unions.        The change is positive for Wisconsin credit unions because theywill gain administrative and legal assistance they lacked as a separateentity.        Gary Gores, president of the Ohio League, said his league grappledwith a consolidation bill last year. He said a bill was approved at year-end 1995 that included a compromise with the governor's office. The leaguewas able to get the Ohio government to agree to have a person on staff thatwould head up credit unions.        Gores said the league wanted to make sure credit unions wouldn't beunduly influenced by banking and thrift regulators. "In the long run itwon't hurt us. But in the short run it will be an adjustment," he said.--Melanie WaddellBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE NCUA WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996DODGING THE LOAN ASSASSINAppeals Court Rules CU Student Loans NondismissibleMembers who owe student loans to federal credit unions can't usebankruptcy as a way to avoid paying off the debt, a federal appeals courthas ruled.        The 1st U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in December is significantbecause for the first time, a court said that federal credit unions are"government units" for purposes of having educational loansnondischargeable.        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcyproceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofitorganization.        The ruling stemmed from a case brought by T.I. Federal Credit Unionin Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case wentbefore the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definitionof both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for theseloans.        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylawsprovided that shareholders get a dividend." Koban won this point inbankruptcy court.        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its caseto U.S. district court and it eventually ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.        The district court defined a CU as a nonprofit because, under U.S.bankruptcy law Section 523(a)(8), it's a "democratically controlled,cooperative, nonprofit society organized for the purpose of encouragingthrift and self-reliance among its members'."        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the"government unit" status, so the case was appealed to the 1st Circuit Courtof Appeals. The 1st Circuit said federal credit unions are, in fact,government units, so it didn't see the need to address whether it was alsoa nonprofit.        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning ofthis section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpaymentsare nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifyingas a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor'sloans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters ofeither provision," the 1st Circuit said.        Koban, reached by NCUA Watch, asked rhetorically whether thisruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank is a"government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the lawshould simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period. Thisruling is counter intuitive."        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn'taddress the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress isthe only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, notthe courts.        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.        According to the brief of the case, T.I. FCU advanced loans as partof its special educational loan program. This program differs from standardloan programs in that it allows for lower interest rates, gives borrowerslonger repayment periods and allows loans to be aggregated in maximumamounts greater than those permitted under personal loan programs. Theprogram also enables borrowers to simultaneously borrow additional fundsand refinance outstanding balances on previous loans.        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times forassistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into asingle promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes$32,618. His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but hislawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely.        Student loan data supplied by the Credit Union National Associationshow that for year-end 1994, the latest date available, roughly one-thirdof CUs offer just Guaranteed Student Loans (FFEL), one-third offer justnon-guaranteed student loans and a third offer both.        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage ofcredit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a CU that lends FFELs, and37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends other typesof student loans. --Ken ReedBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE NCUA WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LENDERS TO FIGHT RISE IN 1099 PENALTIESRepresentatives of the nation's lending industries are joiningtogether to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for what they believeis a plan to raise the penalties for failing to file, or filinginaccurately, so-called "information returns," the infamous 1099s.        These forms are used by lenders to report payments of dividends,interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely paid, forexample, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit, U.S.government securities or similar instruments.        The Clinton administration proposal is part of the budget stalematethat closed the federal government for several weeks, among otherdevelopments.        The administration submitted a proposal to the Republicanleadership in Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to the Republican calls fordeep cuts in the federal budget that calls for increases in miscellaneousfees and closing of certain loopholes.        The proposal, aimed more at stirring indigination from thoseaffected than a plan with even a small chance of winning congressionalsupport, included several other provisions that the administration knewwould be opposed by powerful corporate interests. For example, it calls forrequiring federal banking regulators to impose examination fees on state-chartered banks.        The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments forservices that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC.        However, according to a letter to Secretary of the Treasury RobertRubin dated Jan. 2, the lenders said that an explanation provided by theJoint Committee on Taxation Dec. 15 indicated the provision had a muchbroader scope.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE NCUA WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NOV.

American Indemnity Co.

Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit unionservices.        A source within the industry told NCUA Watch that ISG is attemptingto expand into insurance because it's not making any money from supervisorycommittee audits.

Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers toraise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effectJan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider theviews of its customers before rendering a decision, may make itsannouncement as soon as Jan. 15.        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last twoweeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and thepotential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fullydiscuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said thosedetails would be made available shortly.        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgagecompanies that have traditionally directed most of their business to FannieMae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to takeadvantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not returnrequests for comments.        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddieraised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the lastmonth, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over thechange in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knewthat to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting toFreddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't besurprised."Back to Headline List WT02-B39-19IA074-000493-B042-121http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi120.html 205.156.212.5 19970122011308 text/html 135283HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:10:55 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:25 GMTContent-length: 135095Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi120.html Sample Issue Copyright ORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNet JANUARY, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES Direct Access Gives Boost to B Paper (259 words) FHA loan limits rise to match Freddie Mac's (612 words) NY mortgage brokers refund $400,000 (308 words) HUD Reexamines Broker Fee Disclosures (686 words) Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan (568 words) Fannie, Freddie Stocks: Outlook is Attractive (288 words) Fairbank has new nonconforming loan (120 words) Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit (308 words) DLJ gets out of repos (335 words) Offices for EquiCredit (149 words) Colonial mortgage has a new joint venture (214 words) Wholesaler changes guidlines (209 words) Editorial: A Pivotal Year (613 words) Lockbox technology now is automated (604 words) Lenders 'not getting results' from CLOs so far (308 words) HFS buying Century 21 regions (393 words) Home Equity Provides Boost for California Lender (247 words) Greatland Corp. has county mortgage book (109 words) Congressmen ask a rollback on limit (504 words) Fleet will sell mortgages (852 words) First Mortgage Announces Expansion (276 words) New Jersey Bank Targets Home Improvement Loans to Low-Mod (303 words) Continental finances commercial properties (279 words) Parkway offers no income verification program (107 words) Wholesalers see 1996 in an optimistic light (600 words) Wholesalers feel impact of stricter variance rule (350 words) RESPA Guidance on Joint Ventures Coming Soon (481 words) Third of CA homes were sold at loss (270 words) Norwest Mortgage value aids rating (171 words) NLC opens office for nonconforming (170 words) NJMIC expands in states of Florida, Ohio and New Jersey (492 words) June Fourth Corp. starts wholesale (201 words) Countrywide boosted '95 wholesale volume (600 words) Celtic flavor to US mortgage deal (862 words) NY broker wants to educate borrowers (792 words) CA home sales up 4th month (627 words) Washington state is on the cutting edge for mortgages (1338 words) The benefits of making 100% loan-to-value mortgages (1047 words) HUD Sells Title One Loans (222 words) Mellon buying big wholesaler (594 words) California brokers expecting a banner year (934 words) B and C loans pose 'unique challenges' (414 words) WA gets assisted living units (677 words) Joint venture starting up for Edina, AmerUs (451 words) First Alliance Opens Salt Lake Branch (118 words) CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Direct Access Gives Boost to B PaperSan Jose, CA-Innovative Mortgage Solutions, a conduit based here, said 22% ofits total November production came from its new Direct Access product.Direct Access is a credit score-based first and second lien product.The new product has received a better than expected reception.  IMS hadestimated that Direct Access would account for 15% of production.Steven Skolnik, chief executive of IMS, said despite the increase over theoriginal projection, the quick success was not a surprise."The B-paper industry will increasingly embrace Direct Access because itsimplifies a traditionally cumbersome lending process."Our numbers are a direct reflection of the industry's demand for this type ofproduct," Mr.  Skolnik said.Direct Access allows lenders to determine the loan pricing at the point oforigination and allows for simplified credit documentation.Eligible mortgage bankers and financial institutions have delegatedunderwriting authority.IMS is currently updating Direct Access to offer more benefits, such as animprovement in the debt ratio requirements and removing the need for incomedocumentation."Lenders using Direct Access already have the opportunity to make theirB-paper origination efforts more efficient and profitable."With our intended improvements, this product will make it that much simplerfor any lender to enter the high-margin, B-paper arena," Mr.  Skolnik said.These improvements will be incorporated into Direct Access during the firstquarter of this year.IMS was established by First Franklin, a mortgage banker here; both aresubsidiaries of DLJ Merchant Banking, LP, New York.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996FHA loan limits rise to match Freddie Mac'sWashington-The Federal Housing Administration's loan limits will rise by 1.9%on Jan.  1 to $155,250 in high cost areas and $78,660 elsewhere.The changes were prompted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s decisionlate last month to boost the ceiling on loans it buys or securitizes by 1.9%to $207,000, also effective Jan.  1.The rival Federal National Mortgage Association chose to maintain its limit at$203,150, however.  And neither company seems ready to change its mind, atleast not for the time being.Fannie Mae is "not reconsidering," said spokesman David Jeffers.  "We made ourdecision, and are very comfortable with it."So is Freddie Mac, according to chairman Leland Brendsel."The decision to raise our limit was an easy decision to make," he said,"because it is consistent with the purpose for which Congress chartered us;that is, to increase the availability, affordability and reliability ofmortgage credit."However, both agencies left the door ajar to the possibility that they couldchange their minds sometime in the future, though they said they have notreceived any pressure from either Congress or the Administration to do so.Noting that there has been "lots of discussion in the press" about potentialoperational problems and market stability issues resulting from two differentconforming loan limits, Mr.  Jeffers said Fannie Mae "will certainly listencarefully to our customers as they describe those issues to us in moredetail."But the vice president for corporate relations said whether or not his companywould reconsider is "way too speculative a question at this stage.""We still need to hear from our customers," he said.Mr.  Brendsel would not say unequivocally that he wouldn't change his mind,either.  But he said there "is no downside" to the higher loan limit, "only anupside for the nation and consumers.""Nearly everyone realizes that when the secondary market as represented byFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae is allowed to serve an additional group ofborrowers, they benefit from lower rates and better mortgages," he added.The Freddie Mac chairman also called on Fannie Mae to rethink its decision,remarking that "the market is not well served by having these two companiesoperate with different loan limits."Mortgage Bankers Association president Paul Reid invited Fannie Mae to followits rival, too, saying it would be "a lot easier on lenders who seek to be asassembly-line oriented as possible" if they could place all their loans "inone large bucket."Mr.  Reid predicted that Fannie Mae will "give up some market share" if itkeeps the lower loan limit, as lenders who previously did business only withthe larger, older company "will have to start" doing business with FreddieMac.Meanwhile, Federal Housing Commissioner Nicolas Retsinas indicated last weekthat he had no choice but to raise the FHA limits, saying that the floor andceiling on government-insured mortgages are "by law ...  tied to the limitsestablished under the Freddie Mac Charter Act."The new FHA floor, which is the basic nationwide limit and covers some 2,100counties, will be as follows:* $78,660 for loans on single-family homes * $100,600 for those on two-unitdwellings * $121,600 for three-unit buildings * $151,150 for four-unitstructures.In high cost areas, the FHA ceiling, which is set at 95% of an area's medianhouse price and is applicable in 122 counties, will be:* $155,250 for mortgages on single-family homes * $198,550 for those ontwo-unit buildings * $240,000 on three-unit dwellings * $298,350 on four-unitstructures.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996NY mortgage brokers refund $400,000New York-New York State regulators have forced two mortgage brokers to make$400,000 in refunds to 234 customers as a result of an alleged illegalreferral fee arrangement between the two brokers and home improvementcontractors.Equity Stars Inc., Elmsford, NY, will make $250,000 in refunds (of which$100,000 has already been returned), while PGM Enterprise Inc., Merrick, NY,refunded $150,000.According to state superintendent of banks, Neil D.  Levin, a home improvementcontractor would aggressively solicit homeowners for work and promise toobtain financing for them.The contractor then contacted one of the mortgage brokers in question that thehomeowner needed a loan.  In return, the contractor received a referral fee.There were as many as 10 contractors involved in the scheme, but most of theproblems came from two firms, a Banking Department spokesperson said.The investigation into this matter is on-going.Allegedly the mortgage broker contacted the customer but did not identifythemselves as a mortgage broker and did not make known the broker fee orsupply the proper disclosures.Consumer complaints to the Banking Department charged the brokers involvedpaid the contractor out of the loan proceeds before the work had beencompleted to the homeowner's satisfaction.There were four complaints made to the Banking Department about PGM, with oneinvolving this matter.  Equity Stars had four complaints, all stemming fromthis incident.Besides the state law violations, the referral fee payments are a violation ofFederal law, specifically the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Mr.Levin pointed out.Neither company has surrendered its mortgage broker registration.Both firms were given two-year probationary periods and are required to post asurety bond or have a pledged asset account of $25,000 for the duration.Furthermore, both must perform community service.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996HUD Reexamines Broker Fee DisclosuresWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started anegotiated rulemaking process to get various interests in the housing industryand consumer groups to agree on what mortgage broker fees should be disclosedunder the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.Currently, mortgage brokers have to disclose points and fees they receive fromconsumers and yield spread premiums or backend fees they receive from lenders.Brokers claim the disclosure of backend fees on the HUD1 settlement formplaces them at a competitive disadvantage with other mortgage lenders whoaren't required to disclose commissions or other fees paid by their employers.To avoid this disclosure, many mortgage brokers have secured warehouse linesof credit to fund loans themselves, according to Robert Lotstein, a partner inthe Washington, D.C., law firm of Buckman & Lotstein."This makes the mortgage broker a lender," he added, even though the brokermay sell the loan to the same lender who would have table funded it.  But atable funded transaction triggers the RESPA disclosure."HUD sees two issues," according to Sarah Rosen, who oversees RESPA issues forHUD and who also is the Federal government's representative at the negotiatedrulemaking table."First, does RESPA require disclosure of indirect fees and does it helpconsumers to shop and compare products," she said.  And second, where does thesecondary market start, particularly when lenders have effectively sold a loanbefore closing.  Secondary market transactions are exempt from RESPA."Brokers are looking for an even playing field," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "Itwould help the industry, if this negotiated rulemaking works, for HUD to tellus what is a secondary market transaction.  To learn what needs to bedisclosed and what does not need to be disclosed."Mr.  Lotstein attended the first negotiated rulemaking meetings on Dec.  13and 14.  Additional two-day meetings are scheduled for January, March andApril.The 18 representatives are also charged with reaching a consensus on the issueof lenders paying volume discounts to brokers.HUD has not addressed this issue before and it has not decided whether volumediscounts are an incentive or a referral fee.  RESPA was enacted 21 years agoto prohibit payment of referral fees to parties who do not contribute anythingof value to the mortgage transaction."This is a big issue," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "Lenders are saying why can't wecompensate brokers if we get a volume of business from them and take advantageof economies of scale....  Why can't we pass on some of the savings in theform of a discount."But consumer representatives say this is just another way to get around theRESPA prohibition on kickbacks and referral fees.The Federal Reserve Board also sent a staffer to attend HUD's negotiatedrulemaking meeting because several bills now pending in Congress may transferRESPA rulemaking authority to the Fed.In addition, the Fed has been wrestling with mortgage broker fees under itsresponsibility to issue rules on high cost mortgages under the Truth inLending Act.The Fed recently reversed its interpretation and now proposes to excludebackend fees paid to mortgage brokers in the calculation of the high costmortgage test.Later this winter, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to issue a final rulethat requires consumer fees paid to a broker to be included in the financecharge.  This change was mandated by the Rodash bill passed by Congress inSeptember."A new statutory provision categorizes all broker fees paid by the consumer tothe broker (or to the creditor for delivery to the broker) as finance charges,and will go into effect when the Board issues a final rule in 1996," the Fedsaid recently.The statement was made in connection with a study on finance charges the Fedis conducting for Congress as a result of the Rodash bill.The Fed is seeking public comments on finance charges and how accurately theyreflect the cost of mortgage credit.  The comment period ends Feb.  9.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback PlanWashington-In a surprise move, the Federal National Mortgage Association hasannounced a four-for-one stock split and a stock buyback plan that sent thecompany's stock up."It is a nice bundle of goodies to put under the Christmas tree for investorsat the end of the year," said Thomas O'Donnell, senior analyst at Smith BarneyInc."And unlike most goodies, it is not going to be in the trash heap in January.It is going to be something that is going to carry through 1996 and 1997," Mr.O'Donnell said.The surprise move accomplishes several objectives for the agency.First, Fannie Mae will diversify its capital base by issuing $1 billion inpreferred stock and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, somewhere inthe range of 7.5-to-8 million shares.Second, Fannie Mae will contribute three million shares ($375 million) to theFannie Mae Foundation to fund its charitable and affordable housing activitiesthrough the end of this decade.FNMA has been contributing $40 million a year to the foundation but thiscontribution will allow the foundation to increase its spending on affordablehousing to $50-$70 million a year.Fannie Mae will take a one-time $350 million charge in the fourth quarter, butanalysts believe it will help the agency meet its Federally mandatedaffordable housing goals while reducing its affordable housing expenses goingforward.Third, FNMA's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 6% of theshares outstanding for additional capital restructuring.  Analysts believethese buybacks will take place in 1997."With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably abovethe statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand ourcommitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive JamesJohnson said.Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion."The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae amore diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have morethan one funding source," he added.FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,also gave its stamp of approval."Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company'scompliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that iswithdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirementsfor core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Maccurrently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stocksplit.Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in thefour-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individualinvestors."Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target priceon Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases."With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock shouldperform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Fannie, Freddie Stocks:  Outlook is AttractiveNew York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal NationalMortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been tradingnear or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for bothstocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The questionis whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies tonumerous factors."Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could bebecause a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end ofthe year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble whilethe financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both representconservative financials - a good place to be.Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are verygood, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondarymarket.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been verypositive, and this attracts investors."Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that thestocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doingreasonably well in recent weeks.But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlookfor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Fairbank has new nonconforming loanWaterbury, CT-Fairbank Mortgage here has created a new non-conforming jumbomortgage loan program for its bank and mortgage broker correspondents.These loans can be used for purchases or refinancings and for owner ornon-owner occupied properties.Craig Cooper, executive vice president, said, "traditionally jumbo loans wereonly for those with perfect credit who could verify their income."This new product enables banks and mortgage brokers to offer jumbo loans toan expanded group of qualified customers including borrowers who have somecredit or income issues which could prevent them from obtaining conventionalfinancing."Fairbank Mortgage does business in Connecticut, Massachusetts and RhodeIsland, and operates in New York under the name Colony Mortgage.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage UnitWashington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, FirstFranklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around itsmortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold thecompany to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now."A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not geta good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," asenior mortgage official said.One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - whichcontrols First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,"but likely won't."They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the brokersaid, requesting anonymity.  "If they can get $90 million, I think they'd takeit."The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ boughtthe company at the top of the market," he said.

"They may have taken a few hitson their lines which caused this to happen," the warehouse executive said,requesting anonymity.One DLJ customer who is not happy with the news is Monument Mortgage Corp.,Walnut Creek, CA."We hear they're getting out," said Monument executive vice president JimUmphryes.  "They have told us they will not be increasing our lines.  We havea long-term commitment with them that we believe will be honored."However, Mr.  Umphryes said he has been told "getting an increase or a newline is out of the question."Monument used DLJ's gestation repo products but also had warehouse lines withthe company.Many large warehousers - mostly banks and large thrifts - compete directlywith Wall Street firms to fund the mortgage pipeline of home lenders.During the past three years, warehousers have lost business to gestation repofirms but have been fighting back with new products and pricing.Besides DLJ, Wall Street firms that dominate the gestation repo businessinclude Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Nomura Securities, and PaineWebber.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Offices for EquiCreditJacksonville, FL-EquiCredit Corp.  here has established two regional trainingcenters to instruct its employees in sales and customer service as well asbranch operations.The centers are in Atlanta and Saddle Brook, NJ, and also will offercontinuing education on all new products and services.John Hayt, EquiCredit's president and chief executive, said, "this newtraining initiative with the establishment of regional training centers is dueto the rapid growth and strong earnings EquiCredit has continued toexperience."With over 110 branches across the country, the regional training centers willprovide cohesive training and continuing education for every member of theEquiCredit team without anyone having to travel long distances."Susan Coleman will head the southern training center while Bobbie Ann Tursiwill lead the northern center.EquiCredit is in the process of establishing a third center for the WestCoast.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Colonial mortgage has a new joint ventureSan Diego-Southwest Colonial Mortgage here has formed a joint venture withWestern Pacific Housing, El Segundo, CA, to provide funding for the latter'snew home sales.The controlled business arrangement will operate under the name PacificColonial.This is the fifth such arrangement Southwest Colonial has entered into.The others are Koll Colonial Mortgage, Orange County, CA; Pioneer WestMortgage, Las Vegas; North Star Mortgage, Sacramento, CA; and LibertyMortgage, San Diego.Steven R.

Ifthe proponents of a disciplined fiscal policy are correct (and we think theyare) this should mean a long period of lower interest rates and generalprosperity.But there will be dislocations.  If a crackdown on entitlements is to succeed,there must be action to slow the rapid increase in Social Security payments,as well as other Federal payouts.With a huge segment of the population (the Baby Boomers) headed into its 50s,the demands on Social Security as we hit the second decade of the newmillennium will be beyond anything that could have been imagined in the earlyyears of the pension program.If our society is to stay solvent and our working-age population is to havethe same standard of living (or higher) that we enjoy, we have to assure thepreponderance of the society's wealth is not poured into retirement plans,while making certain that out senior citizens are given the "golden years"they will have earned.But these "global" issues are on the periphery of this paper's interests.  Wefocus, in order to keep your interest, on third-party mortgage lending.And, in our view, 1996 will be the defining year for the industry.With an increasing number of mortgage bankers getting out of wholesale atleast temporarily, the supply/demand balance could change the next timeoriginations move up strongly.  The broker, who has been king in the last fewbusiness upturns, may find that he needs his wholesale lender's good gracesmore than ever before.Mortgage investors have begun to differentiate between loans originated atretail and those generated by brokers.The largest of those investors, the Federal National Mortgage Association, haswarned that the quality of third-party lending must improve.In issuing that strong caution, Fannie Mae chairman James Johnson did notthreaten two-tier pricing.  Nor did he forecast a time in which the secondarymarket giant might close the window on broker-originated mortgages.But both of those solutions are distinct possibilities.  And make no mistake,Fannie Mae and its competitor the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  make therules in the mortgage market.If they decide they no longer can afford the default rate on third-partyproduct, there will be no outlets for these loans at prices that would allowbrokers to continue functioning.Should this happen, the broker community could find itself back in the role ofa hard-money lender seeking private sources for financing of its financiallystrained clientele.This obviously would be an extreme result.  But to prevent things from movingin that direction, brokers must commit themselves to insuring the quality ofthe loans they bring to the system.The industry must weed out not only those originators willing to falsifyapplications, but also those that take advantage of market conditions to earnfees by initiating transactions which roll over borrowers quarterly or evenmore often, without any inquiry from the customer.The industry now has an important function:  to lead the mortgage borrowerthrough the maze of competing products and competing lenders to the right loanfor each customer.It would be a major loss to the home-buying public if a few bad apples areable to ruin the business for everyone.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Lockbox technology now is automatedSouthBend, IN-Data-Link Systems here has automated the final step inprocessing mortgage payments.That step - closing out a mortgage account - is the only one which mortgagelenders have not traditionally outsourced, explained Sadu Thinakal, vicepresident of the Fiserv subsidiary.Lenders typically outsource mortgage payment processing to lockbox operations,to which homeowners send their monthly checks directly.The lockboxes, which usually are owned by big banks, handle all routinepayments.That excludes the final payment, which is somewhat complicated."There are many extra steps involved in processing the final payment," Mr.Thinakal said."Lenders thought the lockbox couldn't handle the final check because of theextra steps involved:  balancing the account, sending letters to the countyoffice, the tax collector etc.," he continued.Consequently, nobody had approached the lockbox operators to see if there wasa way for them to handle non-standard payments.  (Any so-called exceptionpayment, meaning it does not meet lockbox expectations, also gets routed backto the lender.)Data-Link, which is believed to be the nation's second-largest provider ofservicing software, recently did.It created a system to automate all the functions associated with paying off amortgage, so that the lockbox need only be set up for what to expect.Once the lockbox posts the account, the system handles tasks such as triggeredrelease of escrow funds and issues a triggered request to the documentcustodian to release the file.Ultimately, the system deletes the loan file from the servicing system andsaves a record on microfiche.Data-Link's so-called payoff-through-lockbox feature should allow lenders tomaintain just a skeleton staff in payoff, Mr.  Thinakal said.  By contrast, alarge lender, with at least $20 billion in servicing, would probably havebetween five and eight full-time staff manually handling payoffs today, hesaid.Besides labor savings, lenders will benefit from increased float and reducedinterest payments on mortgage-backed securities, Mr.  Thinakal said.By eliminating the typical delay involved when the lockbox facility (to whichhomeowners send their mortgage payments directly) has to send the final checkon to the mortgage company, the company should be able to deposit its money aday or two sooner, he said.Quicker processing should also ensure that the company meets the deadlinesimposed on mortgage servicers by mortgage-backed securities investors.Unless the servicer tells the investor on time what mortgages backing an MBShave paid off, the servicer is obliged to make the standard interest payments,(as if the mortgages were still current)."And they never recoup those payments," Mr.  Thinakal said.The new service is "essentially free," he said.Data-Link customers pay a $25 "transmission charge" for communicating to thelockbox operator what to expect when the mortgage is being paid off.Prior to this advance, Data-Link says, the closest anyone had come inautomating the payoff area was having a voice response unit tell customers howmuch they owed to close out their mortgage loan.Data-Link is also in the process of automating the procedure of establishingwhether a mortgaged property requires flood insurance and, if so, placing it.The firm works through a third-party vendor of flood certification services.Now servicers can manually update their systems when flood zone statuschanges, but this will be done automatically by "early 1996," Mr.  Thinakalsaid.Recent emphasis on flood insurance follows the coming into effect late thisyear of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, plus relatedrequirements from the secondary market agencies.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Lenders 'not getting results' from CLOs so farArlington, VA-Lenders are not getting results from their involvement incomputerized loan origination systems, speakers told a conference here.Robert Meceda, chairman of the electronic mortgage lending conference run byAIC, said it is a fallacy that real estate agents steer consumers to lendersparticipating on a CLO."Thirty-five percent of homebuyers are coming to the transaction with thelender identified in advance," said Mr.  Meceda, who is managing director ofthe Stratmor Mortgage Finance Group Inc.After his presentation, the head of the Alexandria, VA, investment andmortgage bank said he was citing research done by the National Association ofRealtors.Mr.  Meceda added that "230 of the 250 largest Realtors surveyed have acaptive mortgage bank, by way of a controlled business arrangement."Even apart from CBAs, he said afterward, "real estate agents typically viewthemselves as entrepreneurs, regardless of who employs them."In an attempt to avoid any problems associated with the mortgage rebounding onthem, they often avoid recommending any lender, CBA or otherwise, he said.Another speaker, Larry Walker, director of the real estate and mortgageindustry group with EDS, echoed Mr.  Meceda."CLOs are not producing the business - that has been shown by severalstudies," he said.He listed involvement with CLOs as evidence of the "sheep mentality" whichbegets the mortgage industry."One of the biggest problems with CLOs is that Realtors aren't interested,"the representative from the Plano, TX, technology giant added.Additionally, some say that Realtors' lack of technical knowledge often meansthat a CLO is a waste unless lenders employ some sort of facilitator to assistcustomers.Still others say that lenders themselves resist the CLO concept because itleads toward mortgages being viewed as a commodity, making price the onlydifference.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996HFS buying Century 21 regionsParsippany, NJ-HFS Inc.  here has agreed to purchase the six regions ofCentury 21 real estate franchise master licensees that it does not already ownfor a total of $140 million in HFS common stock.The regions involved in the sale are:  the Southwest, central California,south Florida, the Mid-Atlantic states and eastern Pennsylvania.There are more than 1,000 offices involved that generated more than $440million of real estate commissions over the last 12 months.Robert W.

A higher loan-limit"makes more low-cost mortgage credit available to more families."Republicans Rick Lazio, NY, chairman of House subcommittee on housing andcommunity opportunity, and Richard Baker, LA, who chairs the subcommittee oncapital markets and government sponsored enterprises, don't see it that way.In a letter to Freddie Mac Chairman Leland Brendsel, Reps.  Lazio and Bakersaid the decision to boost the limit flies in the face of Congressionalintent.And they threatened to ask the "appropriate authorization committees toexplore" the issue "if Freddie Mac in unclear" that Congress wants "theconforming ceiling (to) follow as closely as possible the long-term pattern inhome prices."Noting that Freddie Mac "declined" to adjust its conventional mortgagepurchase limit when the index to which it is tied showed lower housing pricesin 1994 and again in 1995, they said "a ceiling which reflects only increases ...  cannot be reconciled with this Congressional intent."If annual price decreases are not taken in the year they occur, Reps.  Lazioand Baker said, "they should at least be recaptured before any subsequentincreases may raise the limit," Reps.  Lazio and Baker said."Since this year's increase does not offset the prior years' decreases, yourceilings should remain at their earlier levels.  This is the only logicalconclusion, and the only result consistent with the intent of the statute."That's the position taken by the rival Federal National Mortgage Association,which was commended by the two congressmen for deciding to maintain its loanlimit at $203,150 for the coming year.However, Freddie Mac argued that higher loan limits are necessary to bringlower rates and better terms to homebuyers in high-cost areas.  But Reps.Lazio and Baker disagreed.Noting that prices actually have "declined dramatically" in "many high-costareas," they said the present Freddie Mac ceiling already encompasses asignificantly larger percentage of the market "in the very areas you claimneed the increases."And in a letter to Fannie Mae Chairman James Johnson, they said the privatesector has developed a viable market for the 10% of all mortgages that areabove the two agencies' purchase limits.Reps.  Lazio and Baker also told Mr.  Brendsel that at a time when theallocation of government assistance "is undergoing intense Congressionalscrutiny," now is not the time to expand Federal subsidies.The expansion of Federal credit guarantees can only help families with incomesover $100,000, they said.And because the Federal Housing Administration's loan base limit and ceilingare tied to Freddie Mac's limit, they said, it also would "consume resourcesthat could maximize homeownership opportunities for low-income families."Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Fleet will sell mortgagesBoston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will putbillions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market asit sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own tofund the move.Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages andsecurities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes toretire debt."We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms ofcertain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chiefexecutive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he waspleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction andfinancing largely internally."Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combinedFleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of NewYork's president and chief executive.Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bankplans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice presidentEugene McQuade."In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doingboth at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostlyinvestment securities and residential mortgages," he said."Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yieldingassets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial andindustrial loans and consumer loans."Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment aboutthe composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be sellingto finance the acquisition.But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions ofdollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans atthat time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman saidthat Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired ShawmutNational Bank.Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backedsecurities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified asheld-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBSrepresented about 40% of their total securities holdings.Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be savedwhen Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plusbranches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in LongIsland, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cutswill be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half thepositions are expected to be lost through "attrition."After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closingslated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eightyears to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million inpayments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annualpayments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorphas agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  TheBritish company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loansand repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a fewhave expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next fewyears.In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also couldpotentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's InvestorsService, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to"positive" from "stable.""While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from abetter earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhancedrevenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening itsmarket in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and NewJersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging withShawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe theacquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company'scredit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuildcapital."The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reservecoverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisitionreduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheetclearly has a higher risk profile."Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996First Mortgage Announces ExpansionDiamond Bar, CA-First Mortgage Corp., predicting that it will achieve neworiginations of $100 million per month in 1996, announced plans for expansionand a new operating structure.Bruce G.

Those that aren't areweeded out right away, he said.Mr.  Horwitz reviews the application of every mortgage broker, and the vastmajority have good credit and are of good character."I am 100% supportive of mortgage brokers," he declared.Oceanmark is a wholesaler in both the "B&C" (over 10 years experience) andconforming marketplaces.A number of wholesalers have entered the "B&C" area recently.The big question, Mr.  Horwitz said, is how many of them will be able tosurvive.To do so, these lenders will need to provide a consistent level of service totheir customers and make loans that will perform.Those companies that don't have the experience "may drop the ball," Mr.Horwitz said.Oceanmark is continually expanding its presence in the wholesale market,recently opening up an office in Reston, VA, to serve Maryland, Delaware, theDistrict of Columbia and Virginia.It has also expanded its Atlanta office and now has representatives all overthe eastern seaboard.Rates will have an effect on the wholesale market in 1996, said Joe Harvey,executive vice president of Countrywide Funding Corp., Pasadena, CA.Currently the industry is in a refinance market, and that will help themortgage broker.But, he added, brokers have learned their lesson from the last refi boom andhave spent the last year and a half developing relationships with Realtors andbuilders.Mortgage brokers will not forsake these relationships for refinancings, Mr.Harvey said.If rates stay where they are or move up or down slightly, 1996 will be a goodyear for the mortgage broker, he said.Mr.  Lyons predicted there will be consolidation among mortgage brokers withthe stronger ones surviving and the weaker ones falling away.Laura Kenda, marketing manager for Delta Funding Corp., a "B&C" wholesalerbased in Woodbury, NY, predicted that wholesale will continue to be strong in1996, but legal issues will have an impact on the industry.The stronger mortgage brokers will survive, but some of the larger ones willthink about becoming lenders with their own warehouse lines, because oflitigation and laws that favor lenders over brokers, she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Wholesalers feel impact of stricter variance ruleNew York-Small originators and wholesalers are the segment of the mortgageindustry most likely to be affected by new, stricter guidelines for the amountof variance allowed by Wall Street in the cash value of loans pooled fordelivery.The stricter guidelines, set late in 1995 after months of study by a PublicSecurities Association task force, decreased the variance recommended to 1%from 2%.Wholesalers that deal with a large number of smaller correspondents will facea difficult task in trying to enforce the stricter guidelines down the foodchain, said a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association.The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  also opposed the stricter variance onthe grounds that smaller originators may be hurt by it.Despite this, PSA officials have said they had to go forward with the changein guidelines because demands of technology and standardization have made astricter variance necessary."A number of things have led to (the new guidelines)," said George Miller, thePSA's vice president and assistant general counsel."Primarily there have been a tremendous amount of technological advances inpoolings and settlement advances in recent years, in particular, verysophisticated TBA and optimization systems."Mr.  Miller said he believes the technology has become accepted enough toaccommodate the majority of those involved in trading in TBA securitizationsby government-sponsored agencies.He said that the automation was "at one time the province of dealers and verylarge mortgage originators but now is available and used by just about allparticipants in the market."Mr.  Miller added that mortgage bankers are not bound by the bond tradergroup's guidelines and counterparties are free to negotiate deals outside thesuggested variance.  But MBA officials said the industry's standard practicesmake such exceptions rare."Dealers trading MBS from the interdealer trading screens cannot specify alower variance," said MBA vice president Warren Lasko, in a letter to the PSA."In our discussions, dealers have expressed a reluctance to carve out aspecial variance rule for original issue transactions."Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996RESPA Guidance on Joint Ventures Coming SoonWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development is developingguidelines to distinguish bona fide joint ventures between real estate brokersand mortgage bankers from shams.HUD is concerned that the structure of these joint ventures may not qualify ascontrolled business arrangements under the Real Estate Settlement ProceduresAct, and the fees paid to Realtors may be illegal."The issue is whether you have a bona fide controlled business arrangement orwhether you have a business arrangement that is designed as a sham intendingto disguise referrals," according to Sarah Rosen, special assistant to HUDassistant secretary Nicolas Retsinas.RESPA permits the payment of referral fees to affiliates in a CBA so long asdisclosures are provided to consumers and profits are distributed based on areturn on equity.In a presentation to a Mortgage Bankers Association compliance conference, Ms.Rosen characterized a sham CBA as one where a real estate brokerage firm and amortgage banking company set up a joint venture to take mortgage applicationsfrom customers in a Realtor's office.Each party invests $50 in the joint venture, which includes one employee whois the former loan officer of the mortgage company.  The employee's desk inthe Realtor's office is rented by the mortgage company.  And the venturecontracts all back-office work with the mortgage company except for taking theinitial mortgage application."Essentially, this is an entity that is not performing any work, yetcollecting significant fees with an extraordinary return in capital," Ms.Rosen said.  "That scheme seems to be on its face designed to avoid theprohibition on referral fees."The guidelines will not set capital standards or work rules for jointventures, but should provide some clarity to the industry, she said.Phillip Schulman, a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Kirkpatrick &Lockhart, said the industry is looking for this kind of guidance and he hopesHUD addresses such issues in joint ventures as the paying of rent and the useof part-time employees.But to show that a joint venture has a real business purpose, Mr.  Schulmanadvises clients not to sell 100% of the mortgages to the joint venturemortgage company.  "A real mortgage broker sells to the highest bidder," hesaid.Meanwhile, HUD continues to struggle with the issue of whether employers canpay fees to employees who refer business to affiliates.And the agency has convened a working group of private sector experts toreexamine HUD's approach to computer loan origination systems.As HUD's point person on RESPA issue, Ms.  Rosen did not indicate that theagency is even close to finalizing the RESPA proposal it issued in June forpublic comment.However, HUD intends to issue guidance on joint ventures "relatively soonbecause we think it is important," she said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Third of CA homes were sold at lossLa Jolla, CA-Surveys of public records by DataQuick Information Systems showthat 31.6% of all California homes sold during the first 10 months of 1995were sold for less than their original purchase price.That percentage of loss sales continues to decline from a 42.7% peak inSeptember 1993.Because of low prices, "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during thepast few years" said DataQuick CEO Donald L.  Cohn.  As a result, a higherpercentage of homes on the market "were put there because the owner was underthe gun to sell."  Many of these "have-to-sell" situations resulted in salesat a loss, he said.The median loss was $21,800 on a house sold for $199,000, originally purchasedfor $221,000.  The hardest hit areas were those, like Orange County, whichexperienced the fastest appreciation in prices during the late 80s.In 1994, 51% of Orange County resales were at a loss, down to 45.5% throughNovember 1995.Meanwhile a Chapman University study predicts existing Orange County homeswill begin to appreciate 1.4% in value next year, after a 1.3% decline for1995 and falling prices every year since 1990.Despite rising prices, says Jim Doti, Chapman's president and chief economist,higher incomes and lower interest rates will combine to boost Orange Countyaffordability - possibly beyond the national average next year.That increase in affordability and employment in the county should createconditions favorable for housing starts, which presumably explains thedecision of the homebuilder Lennar, based in Miami, to begin setting up shopin Orange County.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Norwest Mortgage value aids ratingChicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significantoff-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as areason for comfort in its capitalization levels.This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" ratingto a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the countryduring the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-monthperiod, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenuefor Norwest Corp."The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reportedprofitability over the past year."Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at highlevels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through theseasonally slow winter months," DCR said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996NLC opens office for nonconformingChicago-National Lending Center, a non-conforming wholesale mortgage lenderbased in Deerfield Beach, FL, has opened a loan production office here.David Brigman, senior vice president and chief operating officer, said,"Illinois is a very productive state with good stability and demographics."There is a tremendous amount of equity in homes in Illinois and a good marketfor lenders."William Ringrose is managing this Midwest expansion for National LendingCenter.

Warner, an attorney, started FidelityNational three years ago "with the intention to house everyone," said Mr.Boxman.He said one of the greatest obstacles to homeownership in addition to nothaving a downpayment is not knowing the homebuying process.Mr.  Boxman said "35% of people who do not purchase a home do so not becauseof lack of a downpayment but because they don't know the how to start theprocess."To address these obstacles to homeownership, an in keeping with its aim tohouse everyone and as the company discovered, to meet the unmet needs of lowand moderate income and minority borrowers, Fidelity National has instituted acouple of themes that underly its origination process.For this year, 1996, Fidelity National will have as it theme 'Knowing How toGet Started'.  As part of that theme $20 from each loan originated will go toHabitat for Humanity.Its first theme was House New York, where in 1995 $10 from each loan wasdonated to Habitat for Humanity.  The House New York program allowed for threepercent downpayment on a single family house and five percent downpayment on atwo family house.  Mr.  Boxman said a check for $1,000 was donated to theorganization, created by former President Jimmy Carter, which builds housingthrough donations such as this and sweat equity for low and moderate incomeindividuals across the nation.Mr.  Boxman said "structuring the loan is key."  He said brokers need to beeducated on how to structure loans, particularly affordable loans.  "Here inNew York people do not have savings.They seem not to have the downpayment, butmost borrowers have jobs and incomes but somewhere they had a credit glitchthat was never fixed.," he said."Sure you need to spend a little more time with them and sometimes you need toconvince them they can buy the house," he said, but "we need to get them intoconventional mortgage programs where they can make the payments" and are notcharged excessive interest just to get a loan.One example of structuring a deal would be to use the Federal NationalMortgage Association's Community Homebuyer program or any 97% program whichallows for a seller's concession of three percent which in effect allows youto raise the purchase price three percent, have the sellers concession.  Thisallows 100% financing for the borrower who must only pay closing costs.Educating borrowers takes the form of weekly seminars which are attended byapproximately five to seven people and hosted by Mr.  Boxman's partner Mr.Warner.Mr.  Boxman said Fidelity National uses materials from private mortgageinsurance companies particularly United Guaranty Residential Insurance Corp.,and the Federal National Mortgage Corp.'s homebuyer education materials "whichare very simple to digest."  Mr.  Boxman added that Fiedlity national in itsuse expands on the materials.Additionally, Fidelity National's 10 loan officers meet with clients ofclients of realtors on an individual basis to education them on the homebuyingprocess.Mr.  Boxman said the mortgage brokerage makes between 50 to 60 loans per monthand approximately 800 loans per year.  Approximately 75% to 80% of loansoriginated are mortgage loans made to low and moderate income and/or minorityborrowers.  The other 20% or so are conventional loans.Fidelity National is completely computerized and everything is explained tothe borrower from application, verification, credit report and appraisal.The company began using laptops from its inception.  Mr.  Boxman saidtechnology is the future of the business.  This year, perhaps later thismonth, the mortgage brokerage operation will have a page on the world wideweb, expanding its reach onto the internet.The mortgage broker has a number of relationships with mortgage bankersincluding Prudential, Loan America and Countrywide to whom it sells its loans.On average its sell 20 to 25 loans to each.The mortgage brokerage operation, which makes loans in the five boroughs butfocuses on Staten Island and Brooklyn primarily, found when it entered thecommunity that low income and minority borrowers were a neglected clientele.One way it reaches out to such clientele is by working with NeighborhoodHousing Services, a community organization which refers potential borrowers."NHS may have clients interested in purchasing a house.  We interview them andset them on a course or plan to get them into homeownership.  if they followthat plan in maybe eight months they can purchase a house," said Mr.  Boxman.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996CA home sales up 4th monthLa Jolla, CA- Home sales in southern California increased for the fourth monthin a row in November when looked at on a year-to-year basis, according to areport from DataQuick Information Systems here.However, on an overall basis, for the first 11 months of 1995, home sales inthe region were down over 9% when compared with the same period in 1994.Between January and November 1995 170,703 houses were sold in the six countyarea, versus 188,137 the year before.In November itself, there were 15,983 houses sold, up 2.1% from November1994's 15,655 houses sold.This is down 2.1% from the 16,320 houses sold in October 1995, but DataQuicksaid a decline between October and November is normal, and in fact, this wasthe best November for home sales so far in the 1990s."The sales surge is coming in the entry-level part of the market."Because of low prices and low interest rates, a lot of people who couldn'tafford to buy a home before can afford to now."We're watching the numbers carefully, the increase in buying activity shouldspread into other home categories in 1996," said Donald L.  Cohn, chiefexecutive of DataQuick.Entry-level sales account for the bulk of the transactions taking place today,unlike five years ago, when sales were distributed across all categories, fromentry-level to prestige homes.This can be seen in the median sales price, which for November was $161,000,down from $164,000 in November 1994.For the first 11 months of 1995, the median home price was $160,000, down 4.8%from the $168,000 median home price for the same period in 1994.The six southern California counties studied are:  Los Angeles, Orange, SanDiego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura.A second DataQuick study found that statewide in California, fewer homes arebeing sold at a loss to the previous owner.Between January and October 1995, 31.6% of sellers said they received less fortheir property than the amount the purchased it for, a decline from 34.7% forthe same time frame in 1994.The amount of sales made a loss began to climb in California starting in early1991, and peaked at 42.7% in September 1993.In October 1995, it was 31.2%.Mr.  Cohn said "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the past fewyears because of declining prices."So a higher percentage of the homes that were put on the market, were putthere because the owner was under the gun to sell for one reason or another."Many of these 'have-to-sell' situations resulted in a loss."We may find it shocking that three in ten sellers lose money, but we need toremember that it still means most people are making money."Hardest hit were the areas where prices appreciated the greatest during theboom period in the 1980s.For example, 45.5% of home sales in Orange County in the first 10 months of1995 were done at a loss; this is still an improvement over the 50.9% thatwere done at a loss in 1994.Ventura County, which had 52.8% of home sales in 1994 at a loss to seller, sawthat percentage drop to 40.9%.Another area were sellers were impacted was San Diego, where 41.4% of homessold in the first 10 months of last year were for a loss, down from 42.2% in1994.On the other hand, Madera County had the best results; just under 10% of homeswere sold at a loss between January and October of 1995, up from 9.5% for thesame months in 1994.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Washington state is on the cutting edge for mortgagesSeattle-About 80 wholesale lenders are currently doing business in Washingtonstate, says John Porter, president elect of the Washington Mortgage BrokersAssociation and an owner of Mortgage Master Service Corp.  in Kent.Mr.  Porter, who is both a mortgage broker and banker and a correspondent withmore than one wholesale lender, says the state is "one of the most popularplaces in the country with wholesalers right now, because of the stableeconomy - which is more diversified and less dependent on Boeing - and homeprices, which are still appreciating at a rate of 3% to 6%."Fleet is coming back into the Northwest market, he says, as is Home Savings ofAmerica (now in the process of locating a regional branch office in Bellevueand expected to begin production in the first quarter 1996).He expects Chase "will be coming in big," once it finalizes the merger dealwith Chemical Bank.  These wholesalers will be looking for players -correspondents with experience who can close in their own name, he said.Mr.  Porter, who funds in his own name, said most wholesalers expect acorrespondent to put up $500,000 cash to be a player.But he also sees the industry shifting to accommodate the small, independentplayers who are handling 60% to 70% of the nation's mortgage originations."Small, independent mortgage brokers can move fast and make it at 1.5 points,"he said, while the big lenders, who need a 1.75 loan fee to break even, willincreasingly move toward providing back-up services for the independents.Evergreen Money Source, Bellevue, is reaping the benefits of that strategy.Gary Winslow, president and marketing director, correspondent lending divisionfor Evergreen, says his company "has increased business by 100% since he cameaboard in July, primarily by providing good service to correspondent brokers.""Our goal is to turn around and fund a correspondent's submission within 24hours and we rarely do it in less than 48 hours," he said.Prior to this year, the company mainly handled retail nonconforming loans, butits growing correspondent lending division is in an expansion mode."We're looking for quality mortgage brokers with experience, who have been inbusiness a long time.  We want to deal with the most professional mortgagebroker we can find.  We're not so heavy on net worth and financial strength aswe are on professionalism and experience.  We like them to be members of thestate mortgage brokers or bankers associations," he said.A past president of the Washington Association of Mortgage Bankers, Mr.Winslow says the most active mortgage lending areas in Washington and Oregonare Puget Sound and the Vancouver-Portland market."The Puget Sound area has rebounded nicely from last year.  It's not therefinancing boom of '92-'93, but it's very active and it could be the start ofa flood," he said.Rick Merlino, who heads the nonconforming wholesale division of EvergreenMoney Source, said the company primarily handles A and B paper in Washingtonand Oregon and just started in Idaho's Coeur d'Alene and Boise markets.The company does "a fair amount of stated income product," for nonresidentaliens who have no documentation, often Russian or Saudi citizens, he said."We've built our business in the niches," some 40% of it based on creditissues like a lack of documentation, higher LTVs, or no paper trail of a downpayment, he said.The company also funds manufactured housing loans.  While it's not yet big, itis growing, Mr.  Merlino says.The company's average loan size is around $135,000 and Puget Sound is itsstrongest market.Evergreen's nonconforming loan division is accepting new mortgage brokers andbankers.What the company looks for in a mortgage broker or banker, says Mr.  Merlino,is "a quality shop with professional people concerned with getting goodservice at a good price, with no prepayment penalties."We strive hard to be professional and to give the professional broker theservice they need.  We understand relationships.  We know they are hard foughtand hard won."We want the broker to know we'll protect their relationships, that they candepend on us to do what we say we'll do," Mr.  Merlino said.Kendall Frazier, wholesale account executive with Metropolitan Federal Savingsand Loan, said the company's "Make Sense" portfolio loan program is popularwith brokers.The program is designed for conforming loans that deviate from the normalguidelines of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae but are not bad credit risks.  She isalso seeing a lot more refinancings because of the current low interest rates.Strong mortgage origination centers in the state, she said, are King, Pierceand Snohomish Counties.Joe Ebner, vice president of mortgage production at Washington Mutual, says,"production has been marvelous for Washington Mutual, which has been thenumber one mortgage lender in Washington for 28 years and just took over asfirst in Oregon."Mr.  Ebner said the company holds a 10% market share of thePortland-Tri-County area, over 13% of the market share in King County, 14% ofSpokane County, and 13% of Pierce County.  The company's average loan size is$115,000 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Utah.Its most popular loan is the 30-year at 15-year fixed, he says, and "thepurchase market is extremely strong in both Washington and Oregon."The company funds both conforming and nonconforming loans.  On thenonconforming side, the issues are usually less than perfect credit or anunusual property.  The average loan size ranges from $200,000 to $300,000 andis limited to $400,000.The company has been a leader in manufactured home loans since 1969, he said,and is now extending 25- and 30-year loans with land valued in hundreds ofthousands of dollars.Washington Mutual is doing a number of speculative construction loans forhomebuilders and investors in the City of Seattle, he said.  "The market isstrong, not overly heated up but very stable, very strong," with loans of$500,000 moving well, he said.Continental Savings Bank has never been in the wholesale business except as amaster servicer of loans across the state for the Washington State HousingFinance Commission's (WSHFC) bond program.  But according to Rick Bennion,vice president in charge of Residential Mortgages for Continental SavingsBank, the company now has "an embryonic wholesale division."The start-up wholesale division is the result of Continental's leadership inhelping to develop, promote and originate the FHA 203k in the state.When Mellon took over U.S.  Bancorp, it agreed to originate the 203k loanproduct but it did not want to handle the contractor part of the loan deal.Yet, the 203k was one of the loan products offered in a special city housingprogram partnered by the City of Seattle, WSHFC and U.S.  Bank, designed toincrease city residency of police and fire personnel.The program offered lower mortgage rates, lower down payment requirements andlower loan and escrow fees.  It was immediately popular and quickly expandedto include all city employees.Continental, which was already a strong pipeline for the 203k, had it'scontractor inspection system in place, and knew all the players involved withthe city program, agreed to buy the product."We have never been in the wholesale business," Mr.  Bennion said.  "But whenthe Mellon opportunity came along, we saw this as a great opportunity to putour toe in the water, to invest in the infrastructure and to grow it.  Wemight consider doing it with other institutions."As the master servicer for the WSHFC's bond loan program, Continental workswith some 250 mortgage bankers and thrifts across the state.  It's own 203kprogram has nearly 200 homes under construction and over 200 more loans inprocess in Snohomish, Kitsap, King, Pierce and Spokane Counties and Vancouver,Washington as well as Portland.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996The benefits of making 100% loan-to-value mortgagesby Marianne Arbulu Vice President, National Lending Center Inc.National Lending Center, Deerfield Beach, FL, is a mortgage wholesaler doingbusiness in Florida, Georgia, Illinois and North and South Carolina.  Itoperates, according to its own promotional literature, "within the confines ofeven the most forbidding credit history."  Ms.  Arbulu has written an articleabout when 100% financing is appropriate, which is presented as our Viewpoint.A while back, I read an article in a national publication about the risks of100% financing.  While the article pointed out some very valid issues, I wasconcerned that it didn't address any of the benefits, nor did it point outways to mitigate the risks.With the advent of high LTV loans in the marketplace, we all need tounderstand which borrower benefits from this product and how to reduce oreliminate risk.Full 100% financing offers several benefits to borrowers that brokers canmarket to full advantage.  The program provides an opportunity for newhomeownership to clients who haven't had the ability to accumulate a downpayment.On a refinance or second mortgage, clients can improve their cash flow byconsolidating debts, or minimize the interest they are paying on consumer debtversus a second mortgage.  They may even gain tax advantages in this scenarioor find themselves able to use equity which was previously unavailable tothem.Risk-wise, this product is truly the last stop for the consumer.  In mostscenarios, tapping out equity renders most customers non-lendable for years tocome.  So it is crucial to understand the type of customer for whom this loanworks to full advantage.  Primarily, borrowers who fit the 100% profile haveAA credit and have never had a problem paying their bills.Let's take the case of the couple who is looking for either a full refinanceor a stand-alone second mortgage, utilizing 100% of the equity.  The idealborrowers, in this case, are people who, while they have revolving andconsumer debt in addition to their mortgage, don't need that revolving debt tosurvive on a month-to-month basis.They haven't used the consumer debt to supplement their income; therefore,they have available credit and make payments in a timely manner.  So why wouldthis couple tap out their equity?Primarily, the loan would give them the opportunity to further improve theircash flow and reduce their overall monthly expenses.  It would bring downtheir interest expense and may give them some tax benefits through interestexpense deductions by using the equity in their home as security.This customer, who prior to debt consolidation had a 45% debt ratio, now has a35% debt ratio post-consolidation.  Even with all the equity tapped out, ifthey come across unexpected monthly expenses, this couple can handle it.Now let's look at the borrower for whom this loan is not appropriate.  We havea husband and wife, salaried individuals who simply don't make enough money tomeet their monthly needs.  They have children, school expenses, car repairs,and have historically used credit to supplement their income.They are heavily indebted with both revolving and unsecured debt.  They paytheir bills on time and their credit looks spotless, but they have probablyused one set of credit cards to pay existing credit card bills.  Today theyare sitting in a difficult cash flow position with 50% or more debt ratio.If we consolidate these customers, tap out all the equity in their property,squeak them into an acceptable debt ratio, they could be headed for trouble.Now, if they need car repairs, tuition, anything we don't routinely think ofas household operating expenses, they must incur more consumer debt.They have taken themselves totally out of any lendable position.  They are nowback to using debt to supplement their income, and with the loss of theirequity, they have no remedy.  For obvious reasons, the 100% product does notbenefit these clients; in fact, it disablesThe 100% purchase, when marketed to the appropriate customer, is a goldenopportunity for brokers.  Again, the ideal borrowers are a young couple, bothworking, paying a rent similar to what a new housing payment would be, usingcredit moderately with debt ratios that are reasonable without having toconsolidate.  Their only difficulty has been in saving toward a down payment.For this kind of client, with their careers ahead of them and expectedincreases in income, the 100% loan is a prime opportunity.  It gives them theability to buy property today, at today's prices, get available tax benefits,and effect no major change in household operating expenses.The key to a successful 100% purchase loan is the term.  Most 100% loans arereally a combination 80% first mortgage and 20% second.  The 80% first is astandard 30-year amortization with a 180-month balloon.The second mortgage, however, is structured to be fully amortizing over theshortest term possible, ideally, somewhere between five and seven years.Assuming a 0-3% appreciation, the property alone will not improve the equityposition.  The only way to improve the equity position is to pay down the loanin the quickest period of time.A short-term second is almost like forced savings.  The borrowers apply atremendous amount of principal every month back to the property so that at theend of a loan with a five-year term, they could be back to a 20% equityposition.  It's as if they saved the down payment after they got the house.If these customers comfortably meet a 40% debt ratio, have moderate incomegrowth and experience moderate appreciation, they will be in good shape withina three-to-five-year period and in a position to refinance into a conformingloan, further reducing their monthly expenses.To summarize, the 100% loan is not for everyone.  It's not for the personwho's strapped.  It's not for the person who doesn't expect moderate incomeincreases over the next three to five years, and it's not for people whohaven't been able to manage their debt.  However, the broker who targets theright customer stands to do a considerable amount of business with thisproduct.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996HUD Sells Title One LoansWashington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently sold 2,707defaulted Title One loans to Sagres Co.  Inc.  in a Nov.  7 auction.  Sagresis located in La Jolla, CA.In what has been described as an effort to sell "the worst of the worst," HUDoffered a package of defaulted, unsecured Title One loans made for homeimprovement and manufactured housing purposes.  In most cases the loansdefaulted more than five years ago and have already been through extensivecollection efforts.As a result, HUD got what was expected from the sale:  very little.The winning bid was 0.66% of the total outstanding debt.  HUD sold about $25million in outstanding debt.  Since HUD was ready to write the loans off, thelow price they fetched was not much of a disappointment."The lesson is that you don't sell the worst of the worst alone," a personfamiliar with the sale said.But HUD still has about 40,000 Title One loans with a total outstanding debtof over $300 million, many of which make more promising candidates for sale.HUD is currently evaluating that portfolio, which is managed by debtmanagement centers in Albany, Chicago and Seattle, to try to determine if itmakes sense to sell the loans to the private sector.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Mellon buying big wholesalerFarmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing SourceOne Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises HoldingsInc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjustedbook value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million atthe end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say ithas signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for SourceOne, the spokesperson said.Mellon said it had no comment.A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, withexcess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organizationgrowing its servicing, added the spokesperson.During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject tosevere run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make upearnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, butfailed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had alsoserved as adviser in that attempt.Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of thethird quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter lastyear, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund Americanspokesperson said.The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with aportfolio of $45.67 billion.On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemicalmerger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry'sseventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears aboutrun-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule thatequalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgageservicing rights."Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry."But that is not a major consideration here."In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with itsmost significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for$165 million cash.In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicingportfolio.Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3billion servicer.Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for LomasMortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.

TheSouthern California real estate market is bouncing off its bottom, and thestate again outpaces the nation in job growth.  UCLA economists say Californiawill generate about 820,000 new jobs through 1998.James Chapman, president of First Security Loan Corp., one of the largestmortgage brokerages in the nation, told ON, "California is going into the yearwith a tax surplus, more businesses moving in than out, and interest ratesseeking historic lows.  We're looking forward to a great year."Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of California,said the California recovery is being led by foreign trade, hi-tech industriesand the entertainment business, with gains in income and spending outpacinginflation.The only real weak spot Mr.  Levy sees has been construction activity, andsome major builders like Lennar and Catellus are positioning themselves for abuilding recovery in the very counties, like Orange, that have most been inthe doldrums.  Mr.  Levy expects Orange County employment figures released inJanuary and February to show dramatic improvement.Has Orange County -- notorious for its county bankruptcy following a $1.2billion loss in the derivatives market and its plummeting real estate prices-- bottomed out?  Clement Ziroli, Chairman and CEO of First Mortgage Co., saysso.  "We think that because we have a very substantial book of loans there,"Mr.  Ziroli told ON.  "We've definitely seen a stabilizing of homes inforeclosure."TRW REDI analyst Nima Nattagh is not so sure:  "What we see is the decliningtrend continuing."  But Mr.  Nattagh, who sees no connection between OrangeCounty's bankruptcy and its falling home prices, does note that "for the firsttime since 1990 we have seen foreclosures decline there."Ian Wong of Mortgage Information Corp.  in San Francisco cited statisticsshowing Southern California delinquency rates declining, though remainingworse than those for the nation as a whole.A Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  report says mortgage insurance losses"attributable to California reached 39% of all mortgage insurance losses in1994," but have since stabilized.  "DCR believes that housing prices are at ornear lows in Southern California."Mr.  Ziroli said the good news is that contracting prices have boosted homeaffordability in many parts of California, with interest rates down far enoughto make mortgage payments compete favorably with rents.Mr.  Ziroli agrees with Stan Ross, managing partner of real estate consultantsE&Y Kenneth Leventhal, that California's primary home buyer in 1996 will be afirst timer -- probably a member of an ethnic minority and/or a recentimmigrant.Were it not for foreign immigration, California's population would bedeclining, largely because of out-migration to other Western states.Given that profile of a typical California borrower, Ms.  Ferguson said theGSEs' pushing FICO credit scoring "is the most serious issues facing ourindustry today.  FICO scoring is not going to put a great deal of borrowersinto homes.  The likelihood that they are going to meet the Congressionalmandate is not very great."Ms.  Ferguson, a partner in Heritage Valley Mortgage, says her company is veryactive in working with low-to-moderate lending and first-time buyers,utilizing "numerous county MCC programs in tandem with both conventional andFHA/VA loans" to get those borrowers into homes.  She agrees that modificationof Fannie and Freddie underwriting guidelines for "vanilla" product will haveto be made in order to meet Congressional lending mandates.Ms.  Ferguson said improvements in the real estate move-up market forhigh-priced areas are being slowed by lagging state allocations for MCC bondprograms, a situation that CAMB will target for lobbying.Though California real estate prices have fallen, they still remain higherthan in most parts of the country.  California Association of Realtorspresident Rick Snyder says thousands of moderate-income Californians willbenefit from the recent HUD and FHA raises in loan limits for high coststates."Refis will be substantial but not the engine that drives the train," Mr.Chapman said, joining Ms.  Ferguson and North American Mortgage presidentTerry Hodel in predicting a healthy mix of purchase loans and refis forCalifornia in 1996.Mr.  Chapman disagrees with Mr.  Ross' prediction that technology and theInternet will make a big impact on real estate lending in1996.  "Those thingsare here to stay," said Mr.  Chapman, "but it's not as pervasive as somepeople think.  A lot of loan officers are still resistant to computers.Nothing of real substance has happened on the Internet that affects themortgage industry because there hasn't been a need for it.  It may be as longas another two to three years before that happens."He said mortgage lending is too technical and intricate to be mastered by thesoftware available on the Internet.Controlled business arrangements, on the other hand, have arrived to stay, Mr.Chapman said.  First Security has loan representatives in the offices of FrankHoward Allen & Co., a leading Northern California Realtor."CBAs are part of the mixture that will make us successful," he said.  "We'reprobably going to do a capture rate of 25 to 35%."Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996B and C loans pose 'unique challenges'Houston-EquiVantage president John Smith said he felt pressed but confidentabout the ways his B&C business manages risk during the busy month ofDecember.In fact, the unique challenges of B&C lending are exactly what Mr.  Smith saidhe likes about the work."I find (nonconforming lending) attractive because its not as cookie-cutter asconventional lending," he said.Mr.  Smith is president of both EquiVantage and servicer Transworld MortgageCorp., a legally separate business that EquiVantage was originally a divisionof.  Transworld recently completed its second securitization, totaling $75million and consisting of three classes of fixed-rate HEL certificates backed"predominately by first-liens due to current interest rate environment."Its first, similarly structured $65 million securitization was completedearlier in 1995, he said.The issues have traded "at a slight discount, 99 30/32 - effectively at parwhen priced off the yield table," and were bought by "various institutionalinvestors," Mr.  Smith said.EquiVantage has a $15 million net worth and combined the two companies haveassets totaling $65 million that Mr.  Smith is charged with overseeing.Standard & Poor's has recently reported that it is concerned with the creditquality of HEL and B&C paper, and many players in the market are dropping outafter failing to rise to the challenges of the business.  But with insurancefrom Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.  and underwriting from CS First Boston,EquiVantage's recent issue has received AAA ratings from both S&P and Moody'sInvestors Service.Mr.  Smith added that he is confident that his experience, combined withstrong staffing, marketing and capitalization that keeps the market frombecoming too crowded, will sustain the company as a player."We will be in the business long-term," he predicted.  "It's highly capitalintense, so there are substantial barriers to competitors entering themarketplace.  You need $25 million to $50 million just to get involved."Mr.  Smith's background in the nonconforming business includes five yearsworking with "programs for acquiring and securitizing" at United FinancialCompanies and previous work as a savings and loan officer."We worked with B&C loans then, only we didn't call them that," he said.  "Wecalled them loans with delinquencies."The secret to making such credits profitable comes from "evaluating yourborrowers' willingness and ability to pay over time, value of property, andpricing - charging a higher interest rate, although our rates go as low as8.5%," he said.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996WA gets assisted living unitsSeattle-Proceeds from an $8.3 million tax-exempt bond will finance theconstruction of five assisted living facilities in Washington state to bepurchased by LTC Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust company thatprovides financing to the health care industry.The projects are being developed by Assisted Living Concepts, a for-profitcompany that serves low- and moderate-income elderly in Washington, Oregon,Texas and New Jersey.  The company will lease the completed facilities fromLTC Properties and manage and operate each of the projects.The Washington State Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC) publicly sold thebonds backed with a letter of credit by U.S.  Bank of Washington.  The bondswere issued through the Commission's Housing for the Elderly Program, whichprovides tax-exempt financing to develop the full range of living options forthe elderly.The projects are in Grandview, Walla Walla, Kennewick, Vancouver and Camas.Total cost of the project is estimated at $11.18 million, with $8.8 millioncoming from the bond proceeds."Washington state has one of the fastest growing populations of seniorcitizens in the nation," said Busse Nutley, WSHFC chair.  "Because our stateexpects to more than double the number of elderly residents between now andthe year 2020, facilities such as this are vital."Each of the five projects now under construction has 36 assisted living units,with the exception of Lexington House in Vancouver, which will offer 44assisted living units.  Occupancy for the projects is expected from December1995 through March 1996."The tax-exempt financing allows Assisted Living Concepts to lower the cost ofliving for the elderly," said Steve Gordon, chief administrative officer, ALC."Assisted living is more economical and less invasive than a nursing home andit enables seniors to maintain their independence and privacy in a homelikesetting."Fifteen percent (28) of the total new units will be dedicated to residents ator below 50% of the median income of the county in which the project islocated.  Five percent (nine) of the total units will be dedicated toresidents at or below 35% of the median income.An assisted living community bridges the gap for seniors between activeretirement communities and nursing homes.  An assisted living facilityprovides elderly senior citizens with more independence than a traditionalnursing facility, while still providing necessary nursing care and supportservices.A $5.815 million tax-exempt bond issue for a 120-unit apartment building forthe elderly was also issued by the WSHFC.  Proceeds of the bonds will be usedto construct Pacific Crest Apartments in Everett.  The project is alsoeligible to receive some $3.7 million in Federal low-income housing taxcredits allocated to the Commission."Good health starts with good living facilities," said Thomas Gray, executivedirector of Bethany of the Northwest, one of the developers of the project."With adequate housing, elderly people can sustain themselves for a longerperiod of time," he said.The tax-exempt financing and low-income housing tax credits, he added, enablesBethany to offer both housing and personal services to lower-income elderlyresidents who want to live independently as long as possible.The bonds were sold publicly, backed with a loan guarantee from Bethany.Seafirst Bank provided a 30-year letter of credit.  The City of Everett andSnohomish County helped Bethany fulfill its part of the financing agreement.The bonds were issued through the WSHFC's housing for the elderly program.Total cost of the project is estimated at $8.8 million, with nearly $6 millioncoming from the bond proceeds.  The balance will be financed primarily throughlow-income housing tax-credits.The project includes 108 one-bedroom and 12 two-bedroom independent livingapartments for seniors.  The seven-story apartment building will offerresidents panoramic views of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges and isconveniently located within walking distance of a senior center, publiclibrary, post office and other services.All units will be affordable to elderly (aged 55 or older) residents at orbelow 60% of the Snohomish County median income.Back to Headline List CopyrightORIGINATION NEWS via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Joint venture starting up for Edina, AmerUsEdina, MN-An investor group which includes the management of Edina Realty herehas purchased the company as well as Equity Title Services and First EdinaMortgage from First Bank Systems Inc., Minneapolis.First Edina Mortgage immediately entered into a joint venture with AmerUsMortgage, Des Moines, IA.Bradley D.  Childs, president of First Edina, and executive vice president ofthe new holding company Edina Financial Services, said the mortgage companybrings relationships with Realtors, its sales team and staff to the jointventure.He explained that the mortgage operation is a restructuring of a goingconcern, rather than a start-up operation.These joint ventures are happening more and more frequently between Realtorsand mortgage lenders, added Fred Moore, president of The AmerUs Group, AmerUsMortgage's parent company.In structuring this venture, the parties were careful to make sure it is incompliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, both men said.AmerUs has similar ventures with Iowa Realty and Carol Jones Realty, both ofwhich it owns, and is a partner with Mel Foster Realty.These ventures give AmerUs a substantial amount of volume, but Mr.  Moore didnot specify what percentage.AmerUs will provide the joint venture with table funding capability, workingcapital and technology.First Edina will rent space at market rates at Edina Realty offices.Mr.  Childs said the company will be a "focused Realtor service organization."Technology was one of the keys to this joint venture.AmerUs was the first mortgage originator to use the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp.'s Loan Prospector system and the first to have it interface with theGallagher front-end origination management system.Ron Peltier, chief executive and president of Edina Realty, said, "we talkedto a number of mortgage joint venture partners and AmerUs was the obviouswinner due to their commitment to state-of-the-art loan processing andcommitment to quick response to homebuyers."Edina Financial Services is actively looking for other services and productsto provide to homeowners.AmerUs decides what will happen with the servicing rights created by the jointventure, Mr.  Childs said, and it will retain some but sell most in bulk, Mr.Moore added.  It has approximately $1 billion in servicing.Edina Realty was sold to Metropolitan Financial Corp., Fargo, ND, in 1988.MFC subsequently was acquired by FBS.The acquisition group is made up of Mr.  Peltier; Mr.  Childs, the presidentof Institutional Capital Services Inc.  here; David E.

This year's budget bill provesthe point once again.  As we went to press, the budget bill (HR 2491) had beenvetoed by President Clinton.  There are talks going on between Congress andthe White House aimed at reaching a compromise budget bill acceptable by allsides.Without a crystal ball, it is impossible to predict what will happen-ifanything.  However, to alert you to the possibilities, here is a summary ofthe major proposed tax changes that were contained in the vetoed budget bill.Family tax relief.  The budget bill contains a nonrefundable tax credit of$500 that would be allowed to a taxpayer for each qualifying child under 18.The credit (subject to a phaseout) would be effective Oct.  1, 1995.  Therewould also be a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $5,000 in qualified adoptionexpenses.  An above-the-line deduction would also be provided for interest onqualified education loans and expenses for the custodial care of certainelderly family members.To combat the marriage penalty for couples filing joint returns, the ratio ofthe standard deduction for joint returns relative to single returns would beincreased annually from 1.68 in 1996 to 2.00 in 2005.Retirement provisions.  The budget bill also provides that an individual wouldno longer be considered an active participant in an employer-sponsoredretirement plan merely because his or her spouse is an active participant.The $2,000 IRA contribution limit would be indexed for inflation (for taxableyears beginning after 1996) and the phaseout income limits would be increased.Also, the budget bill would create an "American Dream IRA" with no incomephaseouts for contributions.  Withdrawals would not be includable in grossincome if the withdrawal is made after at least five years and the withdrawalis for a special purpose (i.e., first-time homebuyer (up to $10,000); highereducation; catastrophic medical expenses and distributions to unemployedindividuals), or made after the individual reaches age 59 1/2 or becomesdisabled.A new simplified retirement plan would be available for small businesses-thesavings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE) retirement plan.  SIMPLEplans would mean an end to new simplified employee pension plans after Dec.31, 1995.  There are also provisions aimed at tax simplification of thepension rules.Capital gains.  Practitioners will recognize the individual's capital gainschange-a return to a capital gains deduction.  Under the budget bill,individuals would be allowed a deduction of 50% of net capital gain.  Themaximum 28% rate would no longer apply.  For a taxpayer with a marginal rateof 39.6, the effective rate would be 19.8%.  Special rules would apply forcollectibles.  The budget bill provides that two dollars of long-term losswould offset only one dollar of ordinary income.  The changes would generallyapply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994; however, the capital lossrules would apply to losses arising in taxable years beginning after Dec.  31,1995.Indexing of capital gains is coming under the budget bill as it would allowtaxpayers, other than a C corporation, to index the basis of certain assetsfor determining gain on the disposition of any property for the holding periodwhich begins after Dec.  31, 2000.  There is a provision that would allowother assets to be treated as being required on Jan.  1, 2001 (with gainrecognized).  Another provision helping individuals is a modification andliberalization of the existing 50% exclusion for the sale of certain smallbusiness stock (would be subject to maximum rate rather than an exclusion).A particularly helpful provision would allow individuals to deduct the loss onthe sale or exchange of a principal residence after Dec.  31, 1994.  Also,gain could be rolled over more than once within a two-year period and a safeharbor is added in the case of rollovers in the case of divorce or separationfor purposes of Section 1034.  The budget bill would also liberalize theSection 121 exclusion rules.Corporations.  The budget bill would add an alternative rate of 28% on the netcapital gain of a corporation if that rate is less than the corporation'sregular tax rate.  It also would add a special alternative rate of 21% on thegain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock.  Bothchanges would generally apply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994.Alternative minimum tax.  The depreciation adjustment for purposes ofcomputing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations wouldbe repealed effective for property placed in service after Dec.  31, 1995.Also, corporations will be able to use the AMT credit to offset a portion ofthe corporation's minimum tax in excess of its regular tax in limitedcircumstances.Cost recovery.  The maximum amount that may be expensed would increase from$17,500 to 19,000 for taxable years beginning in 1996 and $1,000 annuallythrough 2002 (to $25,000 for taxable years beginning in 2002 and thereafter).The budget bill would clarify that a lessor can adjust the basis of certainimprovements upon termination of the lease.Partnerships.  A simplified flow-through method for computing the taxes ofpartners of electing large partnerships would be available.  The budget billalso provides that the taxable year of a partnership would close for a partnerwhose entire interest in a partnership terminates, whether by death,liquidation or otherwise.S corporations.  Generally effective for taxable years beginning after Dec.31, 1995, a number of changes would be made that directly benefit thosechoosing S corporations as way of doing business.  Among the many changeswould be an increase in the maximum number of shareholders to 75.Health-related provisions.  The budget bill would make significant changes tothe tax treatment of long-term care expenses and insurance.  Also, to helpalleviate the high costs of medical expenses, the budget bill also wouldintroduce a tax-advantaged Medical Savings Account.  And the deduction forhealth insurance expenses for the self-employed would increase gradually to50% for taxable years beginning in 2002.Estate and gift taxes.  The budget bill would increase the estate and gift taxunified credit by an exemption equivalent amount of $25,000 annually from 1996through 2001 to a maximum equivalent of $750,000.  It also would index forinflation after the year 2000, the unified credit, annual gift tax exclusion,the $750,000 reduction limit on special use valuation property, the $1 milliongeneration-skipping transfer tax exemption and the $1 million ceiling on thevalue of a closely held business eligible for the special 4% interest rateunder Section 6166.  There also would be a new estate tax exclusion forqualified family owned business interests for estates of decedents dying afterDec.  31, 1995.  There are a number of other estate and gift taxes changes.Extension of expiring provisions.  As with most major tax legislation, thereare a number of tax provisions that are given added or limited life or areeven reinstated.  They include:  (1) a work opportunity tax credit (similar tothe prior law targeted job credit), (2) an income exclusion foremployer-provided education assistance, (3) a research and experimentationcredit, (4) the special rule for contributions of qualified appreciated stockto private foundations, and (5) the sunsetting of the low-income housingcredit.Tax-exempt organizations.  The budget bill would add for intermediatesanctions that the IRS may invoke against certain tax-exempt organizations.Miscellaneous provisions.  There are a number of miscellaneous provisionsaimed at tax reform.  Some of the provisions would:* Generally repeal the Section 936 credit for taxable years beginning afterDec.  31, 1995.* Clarify the exclusion for damages received on account of personal injury orsickness.* Provide that there will be no rollover (Section 1034) or exclusion of gain(Section 121) for depreciation deductions attributable to principalresidences.* Generally deny Section 1034 rollover treatment to non-U.S.  citizens fornon-U.S.  principal residences.* Substantially modify the rules for foreign trust tax compliance andtreatment as well as the income estate and gift tax treatment of individualsthat lose U.S.  citizenship.The budget bill, effective for contracts completed in taxable years endingafter the date of enactment, also would modify the look-back method forlong-term contracts.  It also would extend the luxury excise tax onautomobiles through Dec 31, 2002, correct the inflation adjustment anddecrease the rate of tax by 1% per year beginning after 1996.  The budget billalso would increase the tax return preparer penalties, add a new set oftaxpayer bill of rights provisions and reform the earned income credit.Jury Still OutThe only certainties are death and taxes.  But will there be a new tax law?If there is one, what will it contain?  The answers to both questions mustwait for the smoke to clear from the budget battle that still rages on in thenation's capital as we go to press.HOWARD W.  WOLOSKY, J.D., LL.M., is executive editor of The PracticalAccountant.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE PRACTICAL ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Practitioner's UpdateCan Your Work Papers Come Back and Haunt You?Work papers, traditionally the dry stuff of an accountant's audit work, havebecome a target for clients out to grab any evidence they can to back amalpractice claim against their accountant.Accounting firms, therefore, are closely reviewing work papers and oftenmaking changes to more clearly show they followed the proper procedures in theaudit.  In most cases, work papers are altered routinely and without incident.Accounting firms usually follow their own internal policies for recording,signing and dating any changes.  There are no official guidelines onmaintaining work papers."There are no auditing standards that prescribe a methodology and maintenanceof work papers, only the fact that they need to exist," said Edmund (Randy)Noonan, chairman of the AICPA's Auditing Standards Board and a partner withKPMG Peat Marwick.Slipping from firm policyBut when firms slip away from their own policies, they can find themselves ina bind trying to explain why papers were altered in a way that might appear tomitigate a charge of malpractice.  That's what happened to Coopers & Lybrandin a recent case brought by Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  of Japan, which isaccusing C&L of altering the work papers for the 1989 audit of ValueRent-A-Car Inc., which Mitsubishi acquired in 1990.As reported in the lead story of the Nov.  2 Wall Street Journal, Mitsubishisaid it learned after the acquisition that Value had a $10 million negativenet worth, which was $4 million further into red ink than indicated in the1989 financial statement audited by C&L.  It contended that C&L erased wordsand figures and inserted new information in its work papers in an attempt toprotect itself from charges of negligence.  Mitsubishi said the changes, whichwere not dated or signed, included a note saying that C&L had receivedassurances from Value that certain liabilities didn't exist, such asdistributed customer coupons Mitsubishi now claims are worth $4 million.Mitsubishi, which obtained C&L's final work papers as part of the discoveryprocess in its lawsuit against the accounting firm, had the unusualopportunity to compare them with the original work papers, which had beenphotocopied by the accounting firm it hired to replace C&L shortly after ithad acquired Value.  But C&L insists that the changes to the audit work paperswere "totally immaterial" to a bad investment decision by Mitsubishi, whichC&L claims ignored the numbers in the financial statements that showed a 1989loss of $14 million as well as a negative worth of $6 million.  "Changes tothe work papers were made to reflect decisions made later in the auditprocess, which was reflected in the financial statements," said Patrick J.McDonnell, vice chairman of C&L's business assurances practice.Still, the fact that C&L's auditors made the changes without following firmpolicy fuels the skepticism over its intentions.  Indeed, McDonnell admittedthat any deviation from work paper policy was rare.  "Our policy is to leave atrail," he said.  "Erasing is not something we normally would do, and it'srare when work papers are not dated or signed."PrecautionsTo help prevent future incidents, C&L is rolling out a new Notes-basedpaperless audit system.  Called "CLASS," for C&L Automated Support System, itenables auditors to prepare all work papers in a Windows-based computernotebook.  The system, which is expected to be in use for all C&L clients bythe end of next year, is designed to make it easier for auditors to follow thefirm's policy for preparing and changing work papers.  The dating of changes,for example, will be done automatically.Such precautions, whether automatic or otherwise, will likely become morecommon in all firms.  The controls firms use in preparing or altering workpapers should be made with the assumption that the work papers might later beexamined for proof of malpractice.-Paul DemeryIllinois Restricts Punitive Damages AwardPlaintiffs seeking financial recourse from accountants under Illinois law willhave a tougher time proving their case.  Under a new state law that restrictspunitive damages awarded against accountants, plaintiffs are saddled with astiff requirement to prove that their accountant acted far outside of standardethical procedures.Tougher standards"Perhaps the most important part of the new law is the standard set to justifyan award of punitive damages," Tom Wetzler, director of Government Relationsfor the Illinois CPA Society, said in a recent Society newsletter.  "Thestatute requires a plaintiff to prove the CPA acted with evil motive orreckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm,and with a conscious indifference to the rights and safety of others."Wetzler added that by requiring plaintiffs to prove the justification forpunitive damages with clear and convincing evidence, the law, which becameeffective last year, demands a greater degree of proof than the ordinarypreponderance of evidence required in most civil lawsuits.Other elements of the new law limit punitive damages to three times the valueof economic economic damages and allow punitive damages to be awarded only incases where compensatory damages are awarded.Proportionate liabilityIllinois also passed and made effective last year a law that abolished theprinciple of joint and several liability and replaced it with proportionateliability, under which accountants cannot be held liable for wrongful actscommitted by other partners of their firm.  -P.D.Expect More State Tax AuditsBusinesses may have a growing need to call on their accountants:  to minimizethe onslaught of efforts to collect state taxes.Rather than impose politically unpopular tax increases to balance theirbudgets, state revenue departments are increasing their numbers of auditors,according to a survey of states by the Atlanta-based State Taxation Institute.The survey found that individual state auditors assess on average more than $1million each year.Targeting out-of-state businesses"Companies doing business in multiple states are particularly vulnerablebecause auditors specializing in out-of-state companies post higherassessments than their counterparts based in the home office," the Institutesaid.  It noted that businesses based out-of-state are likely audit targetsbecause they have less political clout, are less familiar with rules on how tocomply with state tax laws and because many businesses don't realize theyshould file returns under a state's nexus law.The Institute also noted that some states have unusually large staffs ofauditors, such as mostly rural Alabama, whose 342-auditor department is thenation's sixth largest.  Other states are extremely aggressive in out-of-stateoperations.  The Institute said Florida, for example, keeps more auditors inAtlanta (43) than the total number of auditors employed by Rhode Island (40).-P.D.CPA Exam to Become Non-Disclosed Because of ComputerizationAs of May of this year, question booklets and answers to the Uniform CPA Examwill no longer be available after the exam is given.  The change, breaking atradition followed since the exam's inception in 1917, is one of the firstmajor steps toward a planned computerization of the exam by 2000.The computer-based exam will enable CPA candidates to take the exam at anytime at hundreds of testing sites and provide for faster processing of testresults.  According to the AICPA and the National Association of State Boardsof Accountancy, which co-administer the exam, computerization will also makeit possible to create more complex questions, though essays will likely beleft out.To prepare a large enough bank of questions to be used in computer-basedtests, which could be differentiated for each candidate, exams given as of Maywill include questions that will not be included in the test taker's score butstored for later use.  This will also enable the AICPA to judge the difficultyof the questions before using them in exams.  The future use of these testquestions necessitates the non-disclosure of the exam materials.In addition, non-disclosure will enable the AICPA to re-use questionsstatistically proved to be a good measure of candidates' knowledge and skills.And it is expected to increase grading fairness by providing for statisticalcomparisons between different exams.The AICPA said it will continue, however, to issue to candidates exampreparation materials, including the unofficial answers to questions that willno longer be used in exams.  -P.D.CCH Acquired by Dutch PublisherWith three years of costly rebuilding finally behind it, legal and taxpublisher CCH Inc.  was expecting to begin showing some hefty profits in thethird and fourth quarters of this year.  "We'll see some dramatic earningsgrowth in the last quarter," said spokeswoman Mary Dale Walters.The projection of dramatic earnings growth is pale by comparison to Riverwood,Ill.-based CCH's announcement that it had agreed to be taken over by Dutchpublishing giant Wolters Kluwer NV for $1.9 billion - more than three timesCCH's expected 1990 revenue of $600 million.  Wolters' offer of $55.50 pershare caused CCH's Class A shares of stock to nearly double in value to$54.62.The two companies said the acquisition would not cause any major changes inCCH's operating philosophy or management structure, which will continue to beheaded by CEO Oakleigh Thorne.  The Thorne family, which owns 57% of CCH, hasindicated it will tender its shares to Amsterdam-based Wolters, a majorbusiness-to-business publisher of legal, tax, medical and scientificinformation with operations throughout the U.S.  and Europe.Positioned for growthCCH said it will be in an even better position to continue investing in newtechnologies, building on its successful efforts in recent years to developCD-ROM-based research materials and its ProSystem fx tax software.  Indeed,CCH said its technology was a big factor in making it attractive to Wolters,which is just beginning to develop electronic publishing products in Europe.Wolters also expects CCH to boost its efforts to expand its U.S.  operations.One area the two companies expect to further explore is how they will deliverproducts, particularly electronic ones.  CCH has already taken its initialsteps along this course by working with AT&T and MSN, the new on-line networkof the Microsoft Corp.  Traditionally, CCH has distributed its products usingits own Access technology platform.  Now, it is interested in seeing how itcan meet customer needs by catering to their preferred distribution channels."Wolters Kluwer shares [our] philosophy," said Thorne, adding that CCH's newparent is "committed to expanding technology leadership and dedicated todelivering products via the most desired proprietary and non-proprietarymedia."  CCH's product line includes The Standard Federal Tax Reporter, TheU.S.  Master Tax Guide, CCH Federal Tax Guide, and various guides on humanresources and health care.-P.D.Course Work Waiver for ACAT Tax CredentialsThe Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT) is waiving therequired course work until July 31, 1996, for receiving the credentials ofAccredited Tax Advisor and Accredited Tax Preparer.The waiver is being offered to CPAs, licensed accountants, enrolled agents,holders of Master of Taxation or Master of Laws in Taxation degrees, attorneyswith specialist credentials in taxation, and Accredited Tax Advisors who wishto also become an Accredited Tax Preparer.Applicants seeking to become an Accredited Tax Advisor must have five years ofexperience in tax planning and consulting; Accredited Tax Preparer credentialsrequire one year of experience in tax preparation and compliance.  Allapplicants must have taken 48 hours of continuing professional education inthe past two years.  For a Waiver Interest Form, call (703) 549-2228.  -P.D.California Passes LLP LawCalifornia has joined the ranks of states with laws allowing accountants toestablish their firms as limited liability partnerships.The California law, which created a new form of legal entity for the statecalled a registered limited liability partnership, passed both houses of thestate legislature with few negative votes, largely due to strong support fromthe state's accounting and legal professions.  The law also covers attorneys.It became effective immediately when signed by Governor Pete Wilson inOctober.Like other states' LLP laws, California's offers LLP partners limitedliability protection while continuing the tax advantages granted topartnerships.  It limits the professional liability of individual partners totheir own actions, protecting them from any tort or malpractice liability ofother partners.Gale Case, president of the California Society of CPAs, said he expects manysmall as well as large accounting firms to form as LLPs, since small firmsusually can't afford as much insurance.  He added that small firms that doform as LLPs will probably begin to re-enter practice areas such as auditingthat they had considered too risky due to exposure to liability.The law stipulates that partners of an accounting firm LLP must be either aCPA, a public accountant or an accountancy corporation.  It precludes enrolledagents because they are not licensed by the state.Minimum insurance requirement.  To form as an LLP, an accounting practice mustsatisfy one of three insurance requirements:  malpractice insurance coveragenot less than $100,000 per licensed person, whether or not the person is apartner; at least $100,000 in trust or escrow cash, bank certificates ofdeposit, U.S.  Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit or insurancebonds; or a net worth of at least $10 million confirmed annually in a filingwith the California Secretary of State.  -P.D.New Privity Law In New JerseyAmong the many bills on tort reform making their way through the halls oflegislative bodies, those up against the toughest obstacles usually includemeasures on privity, which set the bounds in which accountants or othertargets can be sued by third parties.  Third parties, such as investor groups,are often the biggest source of claims against accountants resulting from theactions of the accountants' clients.But privity laws have been making some headway.  Although bills in such statesas Texas, which has passed other tort reform measures, were derailed by theaggressive lobbying of trial attorneys, efforts in New Jersey have beensuccessful in establishing strict privity standards.In New Jersey, the privity statute enacted and made effective in 1995 statesthat accountants can be liable for negligence to only two classes of potentialplaintiffs:  clients and non-clients who meet certain criteria.  The criteriafor non-clients requires the following situations:* They must have been "specifically identified to the accountant in connectionwith a specified transaction," and the accountant must have agreed that theaccountant's report would be provided to the non-client;* The accountant must have known that the non-client "intended to rely uponthe professional accounting service in connection with that specifiedtransaction";* The accountant must have "directly expressed" to the non-client, by words orconduct, an understanding of the non-client's intended reliance.  -P.D.Insurance For The AccountantThe Singer Insurance Group began in 1958 and more than 90% of its businesscomes from CPAs who refer their clients to them.  They set up a CompleteAccountants Program whereby they give seminars to accounting firms on whatthey should know about insurance for their clients.  They also do CPE seminarswhere they discuss the respective roles and responsibilities of CPAs andinsurance agents.  According to David Singer, vice president of the firm, CPAsare in a rather awkward position today.  Although they have professionalliability coverage which covers errors and omissions and although asaccountants they should be involved in the insurance process, he feels thatthey should not, however, be involved as insurance experts.  Singer believesthe accountant's primary role is to be a catalyst and to bring up ideas tothink about and then they should shift the E&O exposure to the insuranceagent.By the same token, Singer warned that accountants have to consider their owninvolvement with business interruption insurance.  He pointed out that if anaccounting firm has a fire, there is a reasonably good chance that theywouldn't need such coverage because their business isn't really beinginterrupted.  Instead, they would incur additional expenses to get back intobusiness right away.  That's known as extra expense insurance.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE PRACTICAL ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996Depreciation:  Courts Turn Thumbs Down On Irs's "Collectible" StanceIt's hard to believe.  Fourteen years after Congress adopted the ACRS and thenMACRS statutory cost recovery systems, the IRS is still fighting taxpayers incourt over what can and cannot be depreciated.  In three recent cases, the IRShas been told, enough is enough.The victorious included two professional musicians who used valuable, antiqueinstruments in their work.  These cases, decided under pre-'87 law, receivedmuch attention in the media, presumably because of the inherent human interestfactor.  But an even more recent Tax Court case, involving "exotic" cars, hasapparently expanded the result of the musician cases by making it applicableunder current law.  These cases, taken together, clarify the basic law ofdepreciation and seem to show that it is still evolving.  These cases may alsojustify practitioners reconsidering their understanding of this area to besure they are not overlooking potential deductions-either for themselves orfor clients.Musicians ReduxBrian Liddle, a professional musician, purchased a 17th century Ruggeri bassviolin (or viol) in 1984 for $28,000.  He insured it for its then-appraisedvalue of $38,000.  He used it to practice at home, at rehearsals and forperformances.  The bass suffered physical deterioration from this use andeventually lost its value for performance purposes.On his 1987 tax return, Liddle claimed a deduction for $3,170 under Section168's accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) then in effect.  The IRSdisallowed the deduction initially claiming that the viol would appreciate invalue.  Later abandoning that theory (see cases such as Noyce1), the IRSargued before the Third Circuit that Liddle could claim the ACRS deductiononly if he could first establish that the viol had a determinable usefullife.2 The IRS said this could not be done in light of the fact that the violwas over 300 years old and still appreciating in value.It also argued that the viol, as a work of art, did not have a determinableuseful life.  Generally, works of art that hang on a wall or works that areconsidered to be museum pieces are not depreciable because the Service hasruled that such items do not have a determinable useful life.3The Court reviewed the basics of depreciation both before and after 1981.Before 1981, Section 167 governed the allowance of depreciation and requiredthat the property have a determinable useful life.  See Regs.  1.167(a)-1(a)and (b).  This life was related to the asset's usefulness to the taxpayer'strade or business and could reflect economic as well as possibly physicalconsiderations.  In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) replaced thisapproach with ACRS as part of a plan to stimulate the economy.  ACRS allowed adeduction for "recovery property" under Section 168.  Recovery property wastangible property "of a character subject to the allowance fordepreciation"-used in a trade or business or held for the production ofincome.  Recovery property was assigned five categories for determining theactual amount of the deduction.The IRS argued that ACRS, then in effect, did not eliminate the pre-'81requirement that tangible personal property used in a trade or business mustalso have a determinable useful life to qualify as property of a charactersubject to the allowance for depreciation.The Third Circuit disagreed with the Service and held that only the followingtwo pre-'81 requirements had to be met:  (1) the asset must be subject to wearand tear or obsolescence and (2) the asset is used in a trade or business orheld for the production of income.The Court allowed Liddle the depreciation deduction because the viol was usedin his trade and did suffer wear and tear in that use.  The Court alsorejected IRS's attempt to classify the viol as a nondepreciable work of artbecause in Liddle's hands, the "bass viol was a tool of his trade."Richard Simon and his wife, professional violinists, purchased two 19thcentury Tourte bows which they used in their work.  The bows suffered wear andtear as a result of such use.  Although purchased in 1985, the tax year incontroversy was 1989 when the Simons claimed ACRS deductions of almost$11,000.  The same issues were raised here as in Liddle and the Second Circuitalso disagreed with the IRS, holding that IRS's argument (i.e., having tofirst show a determinable useful life) contradicted Congress's intent when itenacted ERTA.4The Court distinguished Browning5, a case involving a musician who sought todepreciate three antique violins, in which the Ninth Circuit upheld a denialof depreciation.  In Browning, the Ninth Circuit held that the musician failedto establish a useful life for the violins but Browning was a pre-ERTA caseand there was no evidence indicating that he used the instruments in hisprofessional work.Both Liddle and Simon were decided under the ACRS system that applied toproperty placed in service between Jan.  1, 1981 and Jan.  1, 1987.  After1986, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 replaced ACRS with a modified ACRS systemcalled MACRS which eliminated the concept of recovery property.Exotic CarsBruce Selig purchased in 1987 and 1988 "exotic" automobiles to exhibit at carshows for a fee.  Exotic cars are state-of-the-art, high technology vehicleswith unique design features or equipment.The cars were not set up for use on the street; they were not driven and wereused exclusively for shows or promotional photography.  Between 1987 and 1990,Selig claimed various deductions for depreciation on the cars.  The IRSchallenged whether cars maintained in pristine condition and shown for a feecould be depreciated.  The Tax Court held for Selig because the cars weresubject to obsolescence (due to the unique high-tech features), and the factthat he failed to show the useful lives of the cars was irrelevant.6The Court reviewed the history of depreciation in the tax law and the Liddleand Simon cases which had been decided under prior law.  The Court concludedthat in enacting the current version of Section 168, applicable to propertyplaced in service after 1986, Congress did not intend to reimpose the pre-ERTArequirement that a taxpayer must show a determinable useful life of theproperty.  The Court said it is following Liddle and Simon in interpretingSection 168 as restated.Richard J.  Sapinski, partner in Sills Cummis Zuckerman Radin Tischman Epstein& Gross in Newark, NJ, was Bruce Selig's attorney.  He agreed that Selig seemsto be carrying forward the result of the musician cases (Liddle and Simon)under the post-'86 law.  In fact, Sapinski was surprised that the Seligdecision was a Tax Court Memo decision rather than a reported decision.  Iexpected that the results of Liddle and Simon would apply under MACRS, saidDavid L.  Segal, sole practitioner in Philadelphia and the attorney whorepresented Brian Liddle, the bass violinist.The Selig Court listened to testimony indicating that new and improvedfeatures for the cars would come along within a few years and held that thecars had a limited useful life as show cars because of obsolescence.  It notedthat a precise useful life did not have to be determined to establish that thecars were depreciable.  It also said that the cars were not museum pieces ofindeterminable useful life.  In doing so, it distinguished Harrah's Club7, inwhich the Court of Claims did not allow a depreciation deduction for the costof restoring antique automobiles to a casino that maintained a car museum toattract business.The Selig Tax Court clearly stated that the fact that the show cars mightbecome museum pieces did not matter since it was satisfied that the exoticcars were show pieces and not museum pieces.  Sapinski explained that it wasirrelevant whether the exotic cars might become museum pieces or appreciate invalue.  "Our argument was that is irrelevant; that it's the asset's usefulnessin the taxpayer's trade or business [that is relevant]," said Sapinski.Sapinski also doesn't believe IRS will appeal Selig because it is appealableto the Third Circuit which already decided Liddle.  But he added that hethinks the IRS will still argue the basic issue.  "I would think this is acase-specific thing and I think they'll keep that option open.  If I were ontheir side, I would be looking for a lawyer with Louis 14th furniture to makean egregious case," said Sapinski.  Dr.  William Raby, CPA and editor of TheRaby Report, said, "I'm sure it's going to be appealed."  He thinks Seligmight be vulnerable as to applying Liddle and Simon to post-'86 law.Implications and Irksome QuestionsSelig should focus a new light on certain valuable assets that may benondepreciable collectibles or works of art in some circumstances butdepreciable business assets in other circumstances.  Some commentators believethat assets such as these may now be depreciable if they are used in abusiness in a manner that results in physical wear or tear or economicobsolescence.  Passive use in a business such as hanging on a wall may not beenough.  But what about assets such as antique furniture or carpeting that arepart of an office?In 1996, can practitioners say they understand depreciation?  These casesraise fundamental questions:  Is useful life necessary to depreciate an asset?If an asset is depreciable, is it always clear how to calculate the amount ofthe deduction?  "I think a lot of people were surprised that after 14 years,there was still a fundamental concept that hadn't been resolved," said AdaRousso, senior manager at Price Waterhouse in Washington, DC.Segal said, "Let me tell you what's at stake here, the depreciation deductionhas nothing to do with accounting...It is the primary tool for encouraging orslowing down capital formation.  The IRS thought there's lots more law to itthan in fact it turned out to be."Sapinski said the decision might mean depreciation has been overlooked forcertain assets such as classic furniture used in a trade or business.  Hepointed out that "Judge Halpern who decided this [Selig] case was a dissentingjudge in the Liddle and Simon cases.  He felt this would open the door todepreciation of Louis 14th furniture in a lawyer's office or other propertythat would otherwise not be depreciable because they are collector's items."Raby said, "I guess you'd have to ask yourself what it is people have thatthey are not now depreciating [which could be items being overlooked fordepreciation]."Sapinski added that practitioners should evaluate whether the assets they haveare properly classified and perhaps take a second look at what they may haveconsidered nondepreciable in light of these cases.  Segal said, "if people aregenuinely using their products in business in a way that subjects them toobsolescence, or wear and tear, then they should get a deduction becauseCongress wanted them to employ that equipment."Investment implications.  Segal, who is also president of the PhiladelphiaYouth Orchestra, suggested that the musician cases might provide anopportunity to refinance America's symphonies by placing musical instrumentsinto leasing partnerships.  Segal explained that orchestras have millions ofdollars' worth of great instruments which could be turned into cash for needyorchestras through a sales-leaseback.  An investor can buy the instruments forfull value and then lease them back to the orchestra for say a 1% per yearrental stream.  The investor can get seven years' of depreciation out it.  Theorchestra takes the purchase money and can invest part of it in an annuity anduse the rest for operating expenses.  The orchestra has no use for thedepreciation so it can pass it to investors; Liddle says as long as aprofessional musician is using it, the instrument is depreciable.How Much to Deduct?Under the current MACRS rules, among other provisions, depreciable assetsother than buildings can fall into one of six categories, i.e., three, five,seven, 10, 15 or 20-year class life.  The rate of depreciation depends on themethod, recovery period and whether the half-year or mid-quarter conventionapplies.  Tables are available to simplify the actual computation.  Congressintended to "deemphasize" the application of useful life and salvage valuewhen it reformed depreciation in 1981.While the decisions discussed in this article did not directly deal withcomputing a specific useful life, the Selig case raises a potentialdifficulty.  In Selig, the Tax Court held that the cars were depreciablebecause they were subject to obsolescence.  Sapinski said, "We didn't have toprove an exact period for useful life.  The accountant used the rates forcars, five years."  In Selig, the Court said, citing Columbia Malting Co.8 andReg.  1.167(a)-9, that a taxpayer could recover the cost of business propertyover a period shorter than the ordinary useful life of the property if thetaxpayer could show that the assets would become obsolete in the businessprior to the end of such ordinary useful life.  Selig had testified thatwithin three or four years, the cars' state-of-the-art technology couldchange.  An associate of Selig testified that the cars had a life of one ortwo years before something better came along.  Yet Selig's accountant usedfive years, the normal MACRS category for a car.Sapinski said, "It is my feeling that it would not be right [to write off thecars over a shorter period] because I think the whole premise is that youdon't have to get into these determinations because Congress has alreadychosen your slot."Raby said the issue is whether these assets (collectibles) are eligible fordepreciation under Section 168.  "That's a yes or no question.  Once you'vedecided the answer is yes, then the question is into what category do theyfall which then determines the useful life," said Raby.  He said MACRSeliminates arguments about useful life.One commentator, however, went so far as to say that in citing the ColumbiaMalting decision, Selig suggests that a taxpayer in a situation that issimilar to Selig should be prepared to show the period over which propertysimilar to the property in question has become obsolete.  This approach,however, seems inconsistent with the flow of logic indicated above.Ultimate Lesson"The main thing that you need to learn from [these cases] is that it pays tochallenge what are more or less 'received truths,'" said Raby.  He noted thatpeople had accepted that collectibles, whether they were antique cars, violinsor french desks, were not depreciable.  "I wonder how often, how many times inour daily work things come to us and we know you can't do something, and so wenever try doing it.  So, maybe practitioners have to stand back occasionallyand say 'why can't we do it?'," added Raby.MICHAEL G.  STEVENS, CPA, J.D., LL.M., is editor in chief of The PracticalAccountant.1 Robert N.

Allen didn't think that was enough.  He had an insurance agentaccompany the prisoner.Granted that didn't seem to play well with the insurance crowd but it strikesa rather interesting chord today primarily because many accountants are takinga proactive role as business consultants to their clients.  As a result,accountants are paying increased attention to the insurance carried by theirbusiness clients.Why is this so?  Why is the accountant doing so much of the work and not theinsurance broker or company?  And what's actually happening?Getting InvolvedBusinesses today want their accountants to get involved because to them mostinsurance brokers and companies appear to be glorified salesmen, only tryingto sell them more and more insurance.Alvin Goldberg, a furrier in New York City, pointed out that "most brokersdon't tell you that you're overinsured.  If anything, they tell you that youmay be underinsured."So, what is going on today is that business clients are seeking out theiraccountants to ride herd on exactly what insurance they need and what theydon't need.Add to this the fact that many businesses have little appreciation for thecasualty and liability risks to which their companies are exposed.Peter Berlant, partner in Anchin, Block & Anchin, an accounting firm based inNew York City, said that accountants today are more intimately involved withthe client's business than the broker, the insurance company or any otheradviser.  Why?  "Because we as accountants can very often identify risks thatother advisers can't.  For example, I have a client who is extremely dependenton a particular supplier.  We have advised them to obtain contingent businessinterruption insurance covering that supplier.  If the supplier has a problemsuch as something going wrong in the warehouse and can't deliver, then ourclient is protected against claims from his own customers."Berlant also believes that typically the insurance broker may not ask thequestions to get a real understanding of what the business is all about.That's where he feels the accountant can come into this.  "We don't replacethe broker but we are a resource for our clients in understanding thebusiness."Berlant illustrated this by recounting the case of a client, a wholesaleglassware importer who questioned the extent of her liability coverage.  "Wefelt that she had to have product liability insurance.  It's not an expensivepolicy but all she needed was for one glass to go from the factory to thecustomer with a chipped rim and all of a sudden even though she may not beliable, she's going to get sued."Berlant said that the accountant can also reduce costs by a simple review ofthe policy and the client's business operation.  For example, he noted that inthe workers' compensation area, the client many times overspends for insurancebecause of the classification of workers.  "It is vitally important that theworker is classified properly because that classification impacts considerablyon the ratings and charges."He pointed out that the accountant also has to know how the policy is written."The policy is subject to audit.  The auditors that the insurance companiessend in may not fully understand how the client's bookkeeping or businessworks.  For example, in most policies, the risks in workers' comp depends onthe number of hours the particular employee worked at a certain function.  Itis not supposed to be based upon wages; yet the premiums many times are basedon wages.  Most policies also exclude bonuses and overtime payments from thewage base in determining premiums.  Often, insurance auditors overlook thesethings and take the gross payroll figure instead.  Those numbers, whentranslated into premiums, can be rather significant."Nature of the ReviewVictor S.  Rich, senior partner in New York-based Edward Isaacs & Company,CPAs and financial consultants, said that the job is to make sure the areasare covered and that the insurance is adequate.  "How often we do it dependson how large the client is and how large an internal staff the client has.And, of course, what they are paying us to do or not to do."Rich explained that too often accountants jump into reviews before they knowwhat they are being asked to do.  "Are we doing an audit, a compilation, orwhat?"  he said.  "What's the nature of our engagement?"He added, "If our engagement is simply a compilation, we should not be lookingat insurance because we may be liable for not picking up something.  We lookat it when the client specifically asks the question."  He cautioned that bydoing the reverse, an accountant is extending the engagement beyond what wasanticipated when the engagement letter was signed.  "Are we compiling figures?Are we involved in a certification?  The levels of responsibility increasedepending on the nature of the engagement."How often then should these reviews be conducted?"Every time we go to a client," said Berlant.  "No matter how often or on whatbasis, insurance is part of our program.  Sometimes we will simply look to seethat they are maintaining coverage but typically once a year we go through thecoverages with the chief financial officer or the other principals of thecompany, looking not only for amounts of coverage but for the types ofcoverage."Theodore S.  Levy, partner and vice president in the accounting firm ofKamenitz Uhlfelder in Baltimore noted that his firm reviews the insuranceneeds of their clients when they do their year-end financial statements."It's part of our procedure to look at their insurance coverage.  Wescrutinize all the policies and we see if the coverage they have makes sense.This includes their limits of liability and how much inventory they areinsuring.  Sometimes, the clients say, same as last year.  We don't acceptthat because the client many times doesn't even look at their own inventorylevels."Kamenitz Uhlfelder orchestrates an administrative retreat which is acomprehensive, full-day planning session with the client's key personnel andadvisers.  Levy said, "we bring in their insurance people and we request thatthey give us a complete analysis of all the client's coverage."David Marcus, partner in the accounting firm of Paneth, Huber & Zimmerman inNew York City, said that his firm works closely with their clients' insurancebrokers and insurance companies.  "In effect, we act as the overseer in thatregard so that we are able to evaluate properly each proposal and compare oneagainst another."Marcus noted that his firm volunteers insurance reviews at least on a two-yearbasis, depending on the client.  He said that the reason for the two-yearspread is because of the proliferation today of multi-year (usually three)insurance policies.Marcus said that normally, unless something out of the ordinary happens suchas a major purchase, a change in the business, the addition of new principalsor something dramatic like an increase in premiums, they don't necessarily gointo a big review every year.Erwin Petschauer, principal in the brokerage firm of John Petschauer, Inc.  inRidgewood, N.Y., corroborated what Marcus detailed with respect to multi-yearplans.  He said that in the area of property casualty insurance, many largecompanies are writing three-year plans rather than on an annual basis.  "Toinsurance companies, it serves as a method of retention while to the businesscustomer, its fixes the premiums at a set amount for a period of time withoutany increase."  He cited General Accident Insurance Company as one companythat is using three-year plans.However, insurance brokers tend to favor an annual review.  Gerald L.  Tobias,principal in the Westchester, N.Y.-based Richwood Brokerage Company,emphasized that his firm reviews insurance religiously.  "We look at changesin exposures or limits and we review annually based on the expiration of aclient's insurance.  Most clients who are paying a lot in the way of premiumsmay even want insurance reviews more frequently."What to Look ForHaving business insurance doesn't necessarily mean that the business isprotected but having the right insurance is what it's all about."Basically, we try to stay ahead of the times," said Levy.  "For example, onepolicy that is becoming more and more popular these days because of the lawsuits now proliferating is employment-related practices liability insurance."He stressed that people don't realize how easy they can get sued forharassment or wrongful dismissal, even if they haven't done anything.  "Thiskind of insurance protects them in a number of ways:  it pays for legal feesand gives them the necessary liability coverage."Another area that companies overlook is employee benefit omissions.  "Forexample," Levy said, "if you forget to cover somebody in your group plan,you're liable if it's a benefit."  He added that "we can see the cost ofinsurance generally coming down a lot recently so we encourage our clients toprotect themselves to take advantage of this."Levy specifically noted that it is surprising how many businesses haveinadequate coverage.  For example, he pointed out an instance where employeesdrive their own cars for a business purpose.  "If there is an accident," hesaid, "they may not be covered because the car is being used for business andis insured instead for personal use.  The policy to protect this is called"Business Use of Owned Vehicle" and it is relatively an inexpensiveendorsement."Levy said that the partners in his firm constantly talk with their brokers andinsurance companies so that we are always on the alert for new products and wepass them on to our clients."Rich added that the real value an accountant brings to the table is tounderstand exactly what the insurance covers and whether it is adequate."Suppose you have a client with inventory covered at a public warehouse andthe client changes warehouses but doesn't amend the insurance to cover the newlocation?  Then it's clear what will happen and it happens more frequentlythan we would like."Rich pointed out that business interruption is important today.  "You mustmake sure that the loss coverage is sufficient.  You may have a growingcompany and your original insurance is for half a million dollars ininventory.  Now look at the company three years down the road where theinventory is running at $3 million.  But, you only have a half million incoverage.  You've got to expand the insurance with the expansion of thebusiness."He said that what he looks for is a risk reward analysis where you have todetermine what you are willing to pay for what you are willing to accept.  "Ineffect, it comes down to what's the deductible and what's the coverage?"Tobias said that he works with accountants on ways to lower premiums byraising deductibles.  "A client generally appreciates it when an accountantsays that they can save them money by raising the deductible.  If the loss canbe $4 million, is there a big difference in having a $1,000 or $5,000deductible?  Clients like this and are appreciative of accountants looking atthis to save them money."Picking the Right CoverageAccording to David J.  Singer, vice president of the Singer Insurance Group inTeaneck, N.J., there are some basic policies that accountants should review.1.  Regular General Liability.  Accountants should be looking for businesseshaving umbrella policies that cover a wide range of areas.  For example, manyinsurance companies will advocate a general insurance but will fail torecognize risk management.  "Insuring your computer is one thing," saidSinger, "but making backups and taking them offsite is even better.  It shouldbe coupled with a disaster plan.  Insurance then is just a part of riskmanagement."  2.  Fire & Theft Insurance.  Most clients have this but do theyhave any disaster recovery plans?  Singer believes that accountants mustadvise clients about this aspect.  "We know you have insurance but will itreally make you whole?  You still have to recover from the fire.  It's notjust a question of money here."  3.  Business Interruption.  This type ofpolicy will provide reimbursement for a major loss of income caused by aninsured catastrophe.  Singer notes that this is standard coverage.  "Almosteverybody writes it."  Two of the leaders offering this policy are the WausauInsurance Companies and the St.  Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company.  4.Employment Practices Liability.  This is a relatively new area to explore andit covers areas such as sexual harassment, discrimination, wrongfultermination and the like.  Many accountants working hand-in-hand withemployment practices attorneys will advocate the preparation of an employeehandbook or manual.  5.  The coverage here is not yet mainstream.  Only alimited number of companies such as Chubb, American International and Pen Ex,to name a few, are writing this policy.  Some insurance companies will onlylook at it if the business has a minimum number of employees.  6.  EmployeeBenefit Liability.  This is coverage that protects the employer from theliability in the administration of the Employee Benefit Plan.  It is becomingmore and more popular today with the increase in such plans.  This policywould include improperly counseling plan participants, improperly interpretingcoverages, handling records carelessly and failing to enroll or terminate planparticipants.  7.  Employee Dishonesty Coverage.  This is highly importanttoday, insisted Singer.  "As we know, when someone steals, the client sues theaccountant because the client thinks that the accountant should have beenSherlock Holmes.  We advise accountants to encourage all their clients to havethis type of coverage."Singer also recommended that accountants be aware of specialty-type coverages.For example, if the client is in a particular business, such as the travel,entertainment, advertising or computer industries, insurance coverage shouldbe provided for professional liability or errors and omissions.There is also the multi-peril policy that is a combination policy includingproperty, liability, bonding, valuable papers, business interruption and othercoverages.  The advantage here is that there are often discounts available forsuch a combination package policy.In addition, products liability is important and is usually made part of thegeneral liability policy.The so-called umbrella policy is another layer of liability coverage on top ofbasic liability policies such as automobile and general liability.  Thispolicy offers broader coverage and picks up exposures such as excess coverageunder specific personal policies (e.g., personal liability and automobile)that might not be covered in the basic policy.Key-person life insurance coverage should also be considered.  Robert Rudolf,managing partner of Richwood Brokerage, estimated that only about a quarter oftoday's businesses have key-person insurance .  "Key-policy coverage pays cashdirectly to the company as the policy beneficiary when the key person eitherdies or becomes disabled.  For example, you can insure someone for $50,000 or$50 million.  The idea is to peg it to that person's worth to the company,"concluded Rudolf.There are a wide range of other policies to consider such as deferredcompensation indemnification that applies to officers and directors ofcompanies, disability insurance and of course, group health insurance which isbecoming more and more involved.Part of any accountant's job is reviewing the insurance schedule.Traditionally, accountants review an insurance schedule, said Marcus.  "Forexample, with plants and equipment, we want to be certain that the coverage isadequate and to be sure it's the right type such as replacement cost versusoriginal cost.  We also check the inventory on hand to afford the client afull review of what they require to cover their inventory properly."However, when reviewing such a schedule, Singer mentioned some concretecautions.  "Take the business interruption policy.  There is generally aworksheet involved and that worksheet is very often filled out by accountants.It should not be!  What the client is doing is making a projection of whattheir profits will be and if they have a fire and they are underinsured, theywill sue the accountant if the accountant filled out that worksheet.  Theaccountant can help the client but the client is the one making theprojections.  In fact, the engagement letter the accountant has with theclient must have a disclaimer that those numbers are the client's and not theaccountant's."Picking the Right BrokerWhen it comes to finding a broker, Singer believes that the accountant shouldbe looking at the following areas:1.  Departmentalization within the insurance group because personal insurance,commercial, life and group health should be handled by different people.  2.Affiliation with at least a half dozen major insurance companies.  3.  Aspecific claims department because claims people are a special breed and theyknow how to deal with insurance companies.  4.  Ability to put together a riskmanagement program.  The broker shouldn't be just an order taker.Verifying Adequate InsuranceIn today's economic climate, many businesses look to the accountant to protecttheir interests.  There are few conditions that can reverse the fortunes of asuccessful company as quickly as the lack of adequate insurance coverage.According to Robert L.  Gray, executive director of the New York State Societyof CPAs, one of the most important services accountants can provide to protectthemselves and their clients is to verify that adequate insurance is beingcarried that will cover the most common and in some cases even remotecasualties.  Gray said that "This requires that the accountant have afunctional knowledge of the types of insurance available and the ability todetermine if the client is adequately covered."Gray added that "the accountant need not be an insurance specialist but mustbe able to work with and feel confident in the ability of a client's insuranceagent."STUART KAHAN is staff editor of The Practical Accountant.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE PRACTICAL ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJANUARY, 1996INSIDE THE IRSProviding Direct Deposit of Refunds to 1040 Paper Filers Instead of yourclients waiting for their refunds to come via the postal worker, they can nowsee them directly deposited in their checking or savings accounts.The IRS has released Form 8888, Direct Deposit of Refund, which can becompleted and attached to Form 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ, 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.  TheService will then send the refund directly to the client's financialinstitution provided, of course, it is one that will accept direct deposits.The Service said that the form cannot be used if the taxpayer is filingelectronically.  In that instance, there must be a specific request for directdeposit by using Form 8453, 8453-OL or 8453-NR.It also does not apply to Form 1040PC (since direct deposit election can bemade with that form) or if the taxpayer is filing a tax return for a prioryear; Form 8888 can only be used for the current year returns.  In addition,it doesn't apply to a deceased taxpayer or where a joint return is being filedas a surviving spouse.The IRS said that it has not yet made any provision for notifying the taxpayerwhen the direct deposit has actually been made.  For now, it will be up to thetaxpayers to check with their own financial institutions to determine if themoney has been received.  Finally, the Service said that it will only makedirect deposits to accounts in U.S.  financial institutions located in theUnited States.Surprisingly, IRS Unhappy With $13 Million AllocationThe IRS gets $13 million under an appropriation bill signed by the Presidentand is not terribly thrilled with it.  The problem is that the money isearmarked for a program that would use legal firms and private collectionagencies to collect unpaid taxes.In a letter sent to Sen.  David Pryor (D., Ark), Margaret Milner Richardson,the IRS Commissioner, said that she had "concern" regarding the language inthe appropriations bill that would mandate the Service to spend $13 million"to initiate a program to utilize private counsel law firms and debtcollection activities."She added that she had "grave reservations" about using private contractors tocontact taxpayers on their delinquent tax debts without Congress having athorough understanding of the costs, benefits and risks of embarking on such acourse.Questions aboundIn her letter, Ms.  Richardson set forth a number of areas to be consideredsuch as the impact private debt collectors would have on the public'sperception of the fairness of tax administration and the security of thefinancial information provided to the IRS.She also expressed concern about how taxpayers' rights would be protected andtheir privacy guaranteed as well as whether privatizing collection of tax debtwas really a good business decision for the federal government.  She cited thefact that presently the IRS telephone collection efforts yield about $26 forevery dollar expended compared with more complex and difficult cases thatyield only $10 for every dollar spent.  Accordingly, she doubts whetherprivate collectors will be able to obtain the same successful return as theIRS.The matter is still up in the air because Sen.  Pryor (a key opponent of thebill) isn't entirely clear on whether the IRS will be required to spend themoney.  Right now the Service is studying how best to proceed.Updated Electronic Filing Procedures for 1996The IRS has issued Rev.  Proc.  95-49 setting forth the various requirementsfor electronic filing for the 1996 tax season for those who participate in theprogram with respect to Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ.  It updates andsupersedes Rev.  Proc.  94-63.  The effective date was Nov.  22, 1995.Under the new changes, the Service noted that Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZcannot be electronically filed after Oct.  15, 1996, even if the taxpayer hasbeen granted an extension to file a return beyond that date.  It also pointedout that an amended tax return cannot be electronically filed nor can returnswith foreign addresses or those for a decedent.Furthermore, the new Rev.  Proc.  details the procedures that applicants mustfollow to be accepted into the electronic filing program including theirresponsibilities, the penalties that could be applied, advertising standardsand administrative reviews, to name a few.With respect to such applicants, the procedure makes it easier for a certifiedpublic accountant to be accepted into the program by dispensing with thesubmission of a fingerprint card along with the application and requiringinstead evidence of the individual's professional status.The Latest IRS Audit Techniques GuidesThe IRS keeps pumping them out.  The Market Segment Specialization Program(MSSP) audit techniques guides help IRS examiners focus on the significantissues in a particular industry or class of taxpayers.  According to theService, they are designed to make audits more efficient and to ensure theuniform application of tax laws.  Here is what's in the three latest guides:Beauty and barber shops.  The IRS noted that the salon industry is cashintensive, that the majority of the work force had a high school education andwere graduates of a cosmetology school.  The Service often found that thebooks and records provided were rather limited and that the examiner wouldhave to conduct a very good initial review by utilizing various questions inorder to determine income.  The guide contains more than 50 potentialquestions.The IRS said that additional considerations were in reconciling the reportedtax return income to the taxpayer's financial status, evaluating the intensivecash situation to determine the extent of the income probe and designing atest to determine income from a reported or known reliable variable directlyrelated to that income.The Service emphasized that an important examination step, of course, was tocompare the type of services and the number of appointments to the amount ofincome reported.  It provided specific audit techniques to the industry thatcan be used including how to calculate unreported tips.Auto body and repair industry.  The almost 100-page guide explained that mostauto body shops were small to medium sized businesses operated as soleproprietorships, small partnerships or closely held corporations and theyranged in size from the corner shop to large franchises with many locations.It pointed out that body shops were particularly interesting because theycombined a service-type business with retailing aspects.The IRS noted that although they provide labor and skill, they must alsopurchase and resell the needed parts.  Accordingly, this, they maintained,often created conflicts in determining whether shops were required to maintaininventories.The guide stated that the industry was extremely competitive as a result ofthe influence that insurance companies exerted and inasmuch as insurance paidfor many claims, they looked for the most cost-efficient businesses.  Thus, ashop that was willing to use less expensive parts as opposed to factoryoriginals would be preferred.The Service called attention to the fact that because inventory adjustmentshad been consistently made in the auto body-repair industry, the examinerwould find it necessary to become acquainted with procedures for making achange in the accounting method.  For example, for a taxpayer on the accrualbasis, the change will be limited to the inventory itself.  For a cash basistaxpayer, the change will include the sales and purchases.Also, the Service pointed out that with the advent of Rev.  Proc.  92-20, theexaminer needed to consider the possibility of allowing the taxpayer to spreadthe adjustment over several years.The guide contains 26 sample questions that may be used in the initialinterview, pointing out what would indicate an underreporting of income aswell as specific audit tips and special employment tax issues that mighteasily arise.Reforestation industry.  The comprehensive report was the work of a team fromExamination Collection and the State of Oregon Revenue Department.  Theirbasic goals were to determine if compliance was a problem in this industry, ifthe contractors were filing all required federal and state returns, if thereturns were substantially correct and then to make recommendations to theproper governmental agencies in order to strengthen voluntary compliancewithin the industry.The IRS said a major concern was that many transactions between contractorswas done with cash, thereby creating little or no audit trail.  Those paymentsalso reduced the likelihood that a Form 1099 was filed or that the contractorseven deposited the cash into their business accounts.  The Service noted thata possible indicator of unreported income could be illustrated by thecontractor who produced receipts for business expenses paid in cash but notpreviously deducted on the return.A detailed guideline for interviewing contractors along with suggestedquestions is included.Time for Action Regs ProposedIn proposed rulemaking IA-36-91, the IRS has issued a document that containsproposed regs relating to the time for performance of acts by taxpayers and bythe Commissioner, a district director, or the director of a regional servicecenter, where the last day for performance falls on a Saturday, Sunday orlegal holiday.  In particular, the proposed regs would remove the list oflegal holidays and other outdated material.The list of holidays would be replaced by citations to the law (legal holidaysin the District of Columbia is found in D.C.  Code Ann.  28-2701) from whichthe holidays would be discerned.  In this way, said the IRS, future changes inthe law regarding holidays would not require amendments to the regs.Practicing Before the IRS Doesn't Get Any EasierThe Office of Director of Practices has outlined four specific scenarios thatillustrate the types of conduct that would warrant disciplinary action onthose who practice before the IRS.Coming under Circular 230, the Service said that these represent composites ofmatters coming to the director's office and do not constitute precedent in anyone matter.  They are as follows:* Practitioner A makes estimated tax payments exceeding his personal taxliability but doesn't file corresponding income tax returns.  He gives theexcuse that he had no time because of a busy schedule.  He could get suspendedor disbarred.* Practitioner B represents a client whose return has been selected for audit.The practitioner calls the revenue agent who will be conducting the audit buthe is unavailable.  They go back and forth, each missing the other's call.Finally, Practitioner B telephones claiming it's a medical emergency,whereupon the alarmed agent takes the call.  The practitioner's actionconstitutes what is called "disreputable conduct."* Practitioner C cancels conferences with an appeals officer on five differentoccasions leaving messages on his answering machine that he had schedulingproblems.  Conduct constitutes "unreasonable delay" and could warrantsuspension or disbarrment.* Practitioner D pleads guilty to making false statements in obtainingfederally insured mortgage and winds up with a felony conviction.  Thedirector can impose a suspension on the practitioner based on dishonesty.IRS Briefs* Mediation to resolve Tax Court cases.  In a memorandum to fieldadministrative officers, the IRS has outlined a procedure for the use ofmediation to resolve certain docketed Tax Court cases.  Any agreement reachedthrough mediation would then be submitted to the court as a stipulation ofsettled issues.* Appointments to international posts.  The IRS has appointed John Lyons toassistant commissioner, Thomas Smith to deputy assistant commissioner andMichael Danilack III to associate chief counsel, all in the internationalarea.* Federal-State reference guide.  The IRS has issued a special guide book forstate and local government employers that contains information on SocialSecurity and Medicare coverage and employer-tax-withholding requirements asthey pertain to government employees.

How aboutopening a small consulting firm where your client base comes from what youwrite?  Write?The accountant with the proclivity for reducing thoughts to the printed pageis Jack P.  Friedman, a transplanted New Yorker now living in Dallas, who overthe years has written and published 21 books and more than 200 articles.Along the way, he has also accumulated an extraordinary string of degrees anddesignations including CPA, Ph.D., MBA, BBA, MAI, SREA, ASA and CRE, to name afew.  In effect, what Friedman has done is build first a foundation based onhis unique experience and interest and then construct an accounting practicefrom there.He is primarily a consultant in matters concerning real estate but also insome areas that have a more general business orientation.  Friedman noted thatmuch of his current work is in litigation support, for several reasons."First, attorneys prefer a published author as an expert witness.  Publicationof a book or professional article lends credibility.  Second, litigationsupport offers a fairly high hourly compensation rate.  Also, the mix ofassignments that I receive in litigation support present challenges andprevent boredom."Writings=Client ListFriedman's books are extensive ranging from consumer guides to graduate schooltextbooks and professional references.  They include The Dictionary of TaxTerms (Barron's),The Encyclopedia of Investments (Warren, Gorham & Lamont),Income Property Appraisal and Analysis (Prentice-Hall) and Keys to Investingin Real Estate (Barron's).His client list includes Champion International Corporation, the City ofDallas, Simon Property Group, Exxon and the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation.Where does he get his clients?  They generally come to him because of what hehas written.  For example, a law firm in Kentucky involved in the condemnationof a public utility found themselves faced with three appraisals from thecondemnee relating to the market value of the property.  The firm sent foreducational materials of professional appraisal associations, found Friedman'sname and credits and called him to review the appraisals.  He did and said hefound them deficient.  "Based on my testimony at the hearings," he pointedout, "the trial judge precluded any of the appraisal testimony from the otherside.  I have since assisted the firm in other matters."Friedman also related the story of a prominent real estate broker in Dallaswho was interested in selling her own firm.  "It was a substantial business,"he said, "with a unique market niche."  The broker visited his accountant togain an understanding of the ramifications of the sale and to enlist theaccountant as an ally in marketing the business.  The accountant researchedthe business literature on the sale of a real estate brokerage firm, cameacross Friedman's name as having prepared articles and monographs on thesubject and then brought him in to counsel the owner."All discussions," noted Friedman, "had to be absolutely confidential becauseleaks of a possible sale could cause injury to the firm's value."  The firmwas sold in less than two months at a price and on terms suggested byFriedman.Project orientation.  Friedman believes that his course of practice issomething that can be done without the ongoing burden of a bigger professionalstaff.  In fact, he keeps a lid on having a lot of people running around hisoffice.  He works primarily with one full-time administrative assistant andthree part-time people, all of whom have extensive experience in real estateaccounting, appraisal analysis and investment analysis.The firm's personnel philosophy is to have relationships with others as stafffor potential assignments, but not to take on the obligations or overhead offull-time staff.  "Therfore," he pointed out, "people with various specialtiesmay be brought in to work on a complex project, on an as-needed basis."  Hesaid that this modus operandi provides greater freedom and flexibility.Getting Into PrintFriedman noted that his first five articles grew out of the work he was doingas a CPA, which was in helping a real estate developer package FHA 236 housingprojects for sale to investors as a tax shelter.  Most of his subsequentarticles have been in response to a current business problem or have grown outof research needed to shed light on a particular issue.What does it take to get things written and published?  Friedman offered thesetips:* Write what you are most interested in.  * Start with an article 10 to 40double-spaced typewritten pages.  Don't begin by tackling a full-length bookproject.  * Prepare an outline.  That will provide a path to follow and moreimportantly will allow you to work on it over a period of time-in free momentsbetween what should be more pressing activities.  * Send it in even if theeditor declines interest in the topic.  The editor may like it when he or shesees it.Friedman also offered a tip on manuscript preparation.He points out that almost all the publishers will edit the manuscript, somemore than others.  "Still, although editors can make a silk purse out of asow's ear, they're more likely to decline an obviously substandard piece (suchas one that is replete with typos), so seek out a typist who can prepare apresentable manuscript."  In fact, Friedman goes a step further and insiststhat you proofread your manuscript carefully before submission because "eventhe best typist may have misunderstood you."He said that even if you can't find a publisher, "a well-thought out,beautifully typed and printed manuscript can be used in your own firm'spromotional material."Friedman emphasized the fact that "manuscripts don't write themselves.  Ittakes real work."  Also, you must be realistic.  "Don't expect immediateresults.  The payoff after publishing may take months or years."  To him, it'spaid off not only in accounting fees but in book royalties, as well.He believes that there are many benefits to publishing.  "It brings prestigeto your employer or client and highlights you as an expert on a subject,making your name valuable both inside and outside your firm."Friedman's writings corroborate this and prove the point that putting the pento the paper can pay off handsomely.Jack P.

In determining its estate tax liability, the estate firstdetermined the fair market value of her interest and then subtracted a 30%discount of $819,000 to reflect lack of marketability and control.  The estatethen determined the special use valuation of that interest.The estate's pro-rata share of the special use valuation was more than$750,000 less than the discounted fair market value.  As a result, the estatethen reported the discounted fair market value less an additional $750,000 forthe interest in the partnership under the special use valuation election.The IRS argued, and the Tax Court agreed, that the fair market value of theinterest for this purpose should not have been reduced by the 30% discountsince the estate was also taking the $750,000 special use valuation reduction.Law:  Under Section 2032A, an election can be made for estate tax purposes tovalue property according to its qualified use rather than at its highest orbest use.  But the maximum reduction in valuation is $750,000.  By Section2032A(g), the election applies to interests held in a partnership.  In Estateof Maddox, the Tax Court did not permit a subtraction for a minority interestdiscount against the special use valuation itself.Held:  For the estate.  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held thatthe true fair market value for Section 2032A purposes is not modified in anyway and so it was proper to subtract the discount.  Neither the statute northe legislative history suggest that Section 2032A is designed to modify thedefinition of fair market value.  An accurate determination of fair marketvalue must involve the use of the minority interest discount.The special usevaluation reduction of $750,000 can then be applied.  Estate of Hoover, 76AFTR 2d 95-7305, (CA-10, 1995).PROCEDURETransferee Bound by Transferor's Closing AgreementHarvey Pert is married to Kathleen Pert who was previously married to TimothyRiffe.  For four tax years, Kathleen, as representative of Riffe's estate andin her own behalf signed closing agreements to settle tax liabilities assertedagainst her and Riffe and penalties asserted against Riffe.  She also agreedto a stipulated decision of the Tax Court to settle liability for another taxyear.The IRS asserted transferee liability against Harvey Pert as both transfereeof Kathleen and successor transferee of Riffe.  Harvey claimed that he couldlitigate the underlying tax deficiencies despite the signed closingagreements.Law:  Section 7121 authorizes written closing agreements which cannot bereopened unless there is a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentationof material fact.  It also says that a closing agreement may not be annulled,modified, set aside or disregarded in any suit, action or proceeding.Held:  For the IRS.  Pert could not relitigate any of the liabilities thatKathleen settled in the closing agreements or the stipulated decision.  Aclosing agreement binds a transferee of the party to the closing agreement ina manner analagous to the way res judicata binds a transferee to a priorjudicial decision in which the transferor was the party.  Also, there is nobasis for distinguishing between a transferee and a successor transferee forthis purpose.Res judicata, under which parties and their privies to a prior action thatconcluded with a final decision on the merits, are bound as to all issues thatwere or might have been decided in the prior action, also applies to personsin privity with the taxpayer (e.g., as a transferee and transferor).Thus, res judicata bars a transferee from relitigating the income taxliabilities of a transferor once a final decision has been entered by the TaxCourt in the transferor's case if the decision was stipulated.The Tax Court refused in this case to reconsider the principle that a TaxCourt decision entered pursuant to the stipulation of the parties isconsidered to be judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.

Another way is touse tax and accounting programs available from the same vendor, so that thedifferent programs all speak the same language.  A third way is to use athird-party bridge product that provides data conversion between differentsoftware programs.For example, the Audisys Corp.  of Portland, Ore., said its TAXi tax importbridge is capable of transferring data from virtually any accountingapplication into several popular tax return software programs, including CCHProSystem fx, Lacerte, Pencil Pushers, CLR Fast/Tax and TenKey's Tax ShopEntities.  It said TAXi is set up to automatically convert data from severalaccounting and write-up packages, including ACCPAC Plus, ATB, CreativeSolutions ws-2, TAASC Easy ACCT and UniLink Write Up Plus.  And because it'scapable of reading DOS and ASCII formats, TAXi can convert data, thoughprobably at a slower pace, from other packages as well.  TAXi has otheradvantages, too.  It can prepare reports in either a book or tax basis, itmaintains and updates tax code dictionaries in accounting software and itenables users to switch from an accrual to a cash basis accounting method.To be sure, Audisys has its work cut out for it.  "Data conversion has its ownset of problems ...  there's always something missing," said James Metzler, afrequent lecturer in computer technology and a partner of the Buffalo,N.Y.-based accounting firm Gaines Emhoff Metzler & Kriner.Indeed, CCH and TAASC, two of the vendors whose tax software can receive datavia TAXi, say they are not directly cooperating with Audisys and recommendtheir own bridges to users.TAXi's ability to maneuver quickly also raises some questions.  Pencil PushersCEO Harvey Stein, who said he supports Audisys's efforts, said, however, thatthe time and effort it takes to code each account being converted with TAXiseems to negate the advantage of using it.But others say TAXi is the only vehicle available that enables users tointegrate virtually any tax, accounting and writeup packages of their choice -even from among competitors.  "It allows the user to make the choice of whomthey want to bridge with," said Greg King, vice president of marketing forLacerte Software, adding that TAXi "breaks down some walls set up by competingvendors."Even though Lacerte has its own bridges with certain accounting and writeupvendors, King said it supports TAXi as a way to give users complete freedom indesigning their own connections.  He added that TAXi's critics overlook thefact that, after its initial set-up of codes, it requires only typicalmaintenance to update data.TAXi's price is an initial $279 with a $129 renewal cost.-Paul DemeryNew Electronic AccountantThe Winter 1995 issue of The Electronic Accountant, recently released,features multi-media offerings developed by its new Editor in Chief, LaurenceK.

Unfortunately, in thecase of transfers of closely held businesses, the owner of these businessesand the IRS don't always see eye-to-eye.  Over the years, the IRS has beenenmeshed in many battles over the valuation of minority interests in closelyheld businesses.  In 1993, the IRS appeared to have given up when it issuedRev.  Rul.  93-12, which allowed minority discounts for a parent's gifts of a20% interest in a closely held business to each of five children.  However, aclose examination of later Technical Advice Memorandums (TAMs) indicates thatthe IRS is still fighting over minority discounts.  A review of the seeds ofthis controversy makes it easier to understand the current battle lines.It's Worth Much LessBecause of the lack of market transactions, the valuation of a closely heldbusiness interest must involve a review of the corporation's intrinsic worth;which includes its earning capacity, the book value of its stock, its dividendpaying capacity and goodwill.  The IRS provided an analysis of these factorsin Rev.  Rul.  59-60.  One factor mentioned is the size of the block of stocktransferred and the block's inherent degree of control.  Although the Serviceadministratively recognizes this concept, it has repeatedly challenged thetaking of minority discounts in valuing closely held businesses for bothestate and gift tax purposes.A minority discount is based on the fact that the minority shareholder cannotunilaterally control the corporate decision making process including thepayment of dividends, the election of directors and officers and theliquidation of the corporation.  The range of the minority discount that isclaimed usually varies from about 20% to as much as 50%Generally, ownership of less than 50% of the voting stock of a closely heldcorporation will constitute a minority interest.  However, if the governingstate law requires greater than 50% of the voting stock in order to affectcorporate action, then the transferred block, if less than that greaterpercentage, will be a minority interest for discount purposes.  For minoritydiscount purposes, it is only voting control which is relevant and not thevalue of the transferred shares.Breaking It UpOwners of majority interests in closely held businesses often look to takeadvantage of the minority discount by giving stock to a number ofbeneficiaries so that each receives a minority interest.  In the case oflifetime transfers, courts have generally allowed each block to be valuedseparately.1 However, they also hold that if the transfer occurs at death,aggregation is required.2 The fact that a block of closely held stock which isincluded in the gross estate is divided among several beneficiaries isirrelevant for valuation purposes.  The imposition of the estate tax, unlikethe gift tax, is based on what the decedent owned at death and not what wasgiven to each beneficiary.On the flip side, courts have held that a transfer, either by gift or atdeath, remains a transfer of a minority interest subject to a possiblediscount even if the transferee already has control of the corporation or willachieve corporate control as a result of the transfer.3IRS Pulls BackUntil recently, it was the IRS's position that a minority discount would notbe allowed with respect to the transfer of stock among family members whenthat family controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer.In Rev.  Rul.  81-253, the Service concluded that where the family owned acontrolling interest, the stock would be valued as if all of it were held byone person.  The result was that each share transferred would be consideredpart of the controlling block.Example:  Alpha Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding.  Johnand Betty Smith each own 40 shares while Bob and Wendy, their two children,own 10 shares apiece.  John and Betty transfer to Bob and Wendy one share eachof their stock, which clearly is a minority interest.  However, since thefamily controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer, the IRS woulddeny the minority discount.Generally, the courts have rejected the IRS's application of familyattribution as being inconsistent with valuation principles clearly stated inthe regulations.4 According to these regs, the transferor should be viewed asa hypothetical willing seller who is independent of the other shareholders.5Rev.  Rul.  93-12 revoked Rev.  Rul.  81-253 using the example of a parent whotransferred all of the shares in a wholly owned corporation by making gifts of20% of the shares to each of his five children.  The IRS ruled that the sharesshould be valued in the hands of the donees without regard to the shares heldby other family members.The IRS has recently issued two TAMs further defining its position withrespect to this type of minority discount.  In TAM 9432001, the decedent owned48.59% of the stock with the remaining 51.41% of the stock owned by his son.Decedent's will provided that all of his stock would pass to his son.  The IRSconcluded that the minority discount would not be lost merely because the sonowned the remaining shares in the corporation.In TAM 9449001, the Service addressed the issue whether simultaneous gifts tofamily members would be valued separately.  The donor, who owned 100% of thestock in a closely held corporation, gave simultaneous gifts of the stock toeach of his 11 children.  The IRS ruled that each gift would be valuedseparately.Unfortunately, Rev.  Rul.  93-12 and the two TAMS might only be a short-termconcession.  It appears that the IRS still has an arsenal of weapons that itis using against a claim of a minority discount.Substance-Over- Form SalvoThe IRS will aggregate minority stock as components of a single control blockwhen it perceives a tax avoidance motive for the transaction.  In Estate ofMurphy,6 an individual, pursuant to a general power of appointment, controlleda 51.41% block of stock in a closely held corporation.  Eighteen days prior toher death, she transferred .88% of the stock to each of her two children,leaving her with a 49.65% interest.  The estate claimed a minority discountfor (1) the two .88% stock gifts and (2) the 49.65% block of stock owned atdeath.The Tax Court ruled that the minority discount did not apply to either.  Itconcluded that the attempt to reduce the ownership interest below 50% bygifting 1.76% of stock prior to death constituted tax avoidance.  According tothe Court, the transfer "lacked substance and economic effect."  The courtaggregated both the gift and testamentary transfer for valuation purposes.But it is clear that the IRS and the Court failed to recognize that asubstantial change did occur.  Implicit in the court's reasoning is that thedecedent retained control over the corporation until her death.  But, thisignores the legal significance of the decedent's stock transfer whicheffectively stripped her of control over the corporation.The court's conclusion would be acceptable if there was some sort of anagreement that the children were required to vote the gifted stock inaccordance with their mother's wishes.  However, no such agreement existed, sothe decedent's 49.65% stock interest should have been considered a minorityinterest.7Recently issued TAM 9504004 further shows the IRS's propensity to applysubstance over form.  In this TAM, the decedent, 19 days before he died fromterminal cancer, sold one-half of his 60% interest in the family corporationto child A, who at the time owned 20% of the corporation prior to the sale.This increased child A's interest to 50%.  The decedent's two other childrencollectively owned 20%.  Simultaneously with the sale, the corporationredeemed the decedent's remaining 30% interest.  The redemption increasedchild A's stock ownership interest to 71.4%.  The estate stipulated that theprincipal purpose of the simultaneous stock sale and redemption was totransfer decedent's controlling interest in the corporation to child A.For valuation purposes, the decedent's estate treated the sale and redemptionas involving two separate transfers.  However, the IRS concluded that forvaluation purposes the sale of decedent's 30% stock sale to Child A and thesimultaneous redemption of decedent's remaining 30% interest must be viewed asa single integrated transfer of a controlling corporate interest to child A.Swing Vote AttackA portion or all of the minority discount may be lost if the transferred stockis determined by the IRS to have a swing vote characteristic.  Minority stockis considered as having such a characteristic if it may enable anotherminority holder to achieve majority control.Example:  Two shareholders own 49% of the stock and a third shareholder owns2%.  The stock owned by the 2% shareholder is perceived as possessing a swingvote potential; it arguably may be able to command a premium in excess of itspro-rata value.The adverse effect of the transferred stock with swing vote attributes isillustrated in the following example based on TAM 9436005.Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common shares of Betacorporation.  On Dec.  18, 1994, John gifted 30 shares to each of his threechildren.  He also transferred five shares to his wife.  In valuing thetransfer, John discounted the value of the transferred shares by a minoritydiscount of 25%.  According to the IRS, John would not be entitled to aminority discount for any of the three 30% blocks since each had a swing votecharacteristic.  Any of the three children could join with another and controlthe corporation.This is inconsistent with case law which recognizes that where a donor makessimultaneous gifts of stock to different donees, each gift is valuedseparately in determining the fair market value for gift tax purposes.8 TheIRS disputed donor's argument that if it had not been a simultaneous transfer,the result would have been different.Although the Service agreed that at the time of the transfer of the firstblock it would not reflect a swing vote attribute, it contended the value ofthe second 30% block transferred would reflect a swing vote characteristic.According to the IRS, the transfer of the second 30% block would also resultin an increase in the value of the first block transferred since the firstblock would belatedly acquire possible voting control in the form of swingvote.  The IRS reasoned that this increase in the value of the first blockwould constitute an indirect gift to the first block recipient at the time ofthe second transfer.  The IRS concluded that even if the transfers were madeat different times, the total value of the gifts would ultimately be the sameas if they were made simultaneously.The IRS's decision that the second transfer constituted an indirect gift seemsto stretch unduly the concept of an indirect gift.  Only the value of theproperty which passes at the time of the gift should be subject to the gifttax.  The second transfer carried out the donor's intent to transfer 30 sharesof stock to a particular donee.  It was not the donor's intent to transfervalue to another shareholder.  Furthermore, the IRS's position is built uponthe principle that any increase in the value of one family member's stockconstitutes a gift to that shareholder.  In essence, what the IRScharacterizes as an indirect gift is a phantom gift.  Consider the following:Example:  Family Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding whichis owned by three sisters:  Linda (46 shares), Sally (30 shares) and Betty (24shares).  Linda is bored with corporate life and decides to gift her shares toher two sisters.  It is her intent to treat her sisters equally, so she gives23 shares to each.  After the gift, Sally is in control of the corporationwith 53 shares while Betty owns 47 shares.Under established case law, Linda would be entitled to a minority discountwith respect to both transfers.  The value of Linda's gift to Sally is limitedto the value of the shares actually transferred.  There is no basis forfinding an additional indirect gift to Sally.Assume the same set of facts, except that Linda decides to have her sharesredeemed from the corporation in a transaction which does not have as itsintended purpose the objective of transferring control of the corporation toSally.  There is no question that the redemption would result in increasingthe value of Sally's shares.  However, it would be an unintended stretch ofthe gift tax rules to suggest that Linda has made a gift to Sally as a resultof the redemption.  That would only be the result if one extends the IRS'sperception of an indirect gift.  It should be noted that the courts haverejected similar attempts by the Service in the past to create phantom incomein the form of a constructive dividend to the remaining shareholders.9In support of its swing vote position the IRS primarily relies upon Estate ofWinkler.10 In that case the IRS contested the amount of the minority discountfor a decedent's 10% ownership of a corporation with two differentfamilies-the Winklers and the Simmons-each owning 45% of the stock.  The IRSdenied the minority discount for estate tax purposes claiming that the ownerof the 10% block could effect control over the corporation by joining witheither family.  According to the Tax Court in this case, a willing buyer wouldpay a premium for this 10% stock interest.The court's rationale here is inconsistent with the regulations' concept of ahypothetical willing buyer and willing seller.  It invites an unintendedsubjective and very speculative inquiry into the feelings, attitudes andanticipated behaviors of the recipients of the stock, other shareholders andpotential purchasers.The IRS's position would then result in the minority discount being eithereliminated or reduced whenever the minority block of stock being transferredwould provide control if coupled with any other minority blocks.  Except inEstate of Winkler, the courts have generally not embraced this position.  Infact, the Ninth Circuit in Propstra11 rejected such an approach and allowed aminority discount for an estate.  It reasoned that inquiries into theanticipated behavior of the surviving co-owners was logically inconsistentwith the regulations and would require subjective assessments that might proveto be groundless.  In Estate of Bright12, the Fifth Circuit did not considerthe swing vote characteristics of a 27.5% stock interest.  At the time of thetransfer, the decedent's wife owned 27.5% of the corporate stock and anunrelated party owned 30%.Query?  Is swing vote potential limited to those situations where only oneminority block shareholder could achieve control?  In TAM 9436005, theminority block which could achieve control by aligning with the transferredshares was owned by one person.  However, in TAM 9449001, the IRS implied thatminority stock could possess swing characteristics even if the benefittingminority block was owned by more than one shareholder.Section 2704 ThreatPrior to the passage of Section 2704 in 1990, family business interests wereoften structured so that voting and liquidation rights would lapse upon atransfer resulting in a reduced estate or gift tax.  Use of lapsing rightswould then result in a closely held business being valued at its going-concernvalue, which very often is less than its liquidation value.In Estate of Harrison,13 a decedent was both a general and limited partner ina family partnership in which his sons were also limited partners.  Pursuantto state law, the decedent, as general partner, possessed the power lapsing atdeath to liquidate the partnership and to receive the liquidation valueattributable to both his general and limited partnership interest.  Thelimited partners did not possess such power.  The estate valued his limitedpartnership interest at its going-concern value of $33 million instead of atits higher liquidation value of $59 million that the IRS contended.  The valueof the general partnership interest was not in dispute.  The Tax Courtconcluded that the value of the limited partnership interest was $33 millionsince the liquidation right lapsed at death.Congressional concern regarding perceived valuation abuses as a result ofusing lapses to artificially reduce transfer tax value resulted in the passageof Section 2704.  It overrules the result in Harrison by eliminating thedisappearance of value caused by a lapse in either the voting or liquidationrights (defined in Reg.  25.2704-1(b)) of the transferred interest.  It treatsthe lapse of either a voting or liquidation right as a taxable transfer if theholder of the right and members of the family (as defined in Section2704(a)(1)) control the partnership or corporation, both before and after thelapse.  The drop in value triggered by the lapse is recaptured as anadditional transfer.  The value of the transfer is equal to the excess of (1)the total interest value (including voting and liquidation rights) held beforethe lapse, over (2) the value (without the lapsed right) immediately after thelapse.Example:  John owns 70% of the outstanding common stock of Alpha corporationwhile his daughter Betty owns the remaining 30% interest.  John's voting stockis automatically converted to nonvoting stock at his death.  The pre-lapsevalue of the 70% interest, which possesses voting rights, is valued at $1million.  The post-lapse value of John's 70% interest, without voting rights,is reduced to $400,000.  The amount of the Section 2704 transfer is valued at$600,000, the difference between the value of the stock as voting andnonvoting stock.Section 2704(b) addressed similar perceived valuation abuses regardingintra-family transfers of corporation or partnership interests where the rightto liquidate is restricted.  It provides that applicable restrictions14 on theability of a corporation or partnership to liquidate are disregarded whenvaluing an interest in such entity.  Section 2704(b) applies if there is atransfer of a business interest to, or for the benefit of, the transferor'sfamily and members of the transferor's family control the entity immediatelybefore the transfer.Example:  Sally owns all of the preferred stock in Profit Corporation.  Thestock carries a right to liquidate which cannot be exercised until 1999.Sally's two children, Bob and Betty, own all of the common stock, which is theonly voting stock.  In 1994, Sally gifts the preferred stock to Bob and Betty.Under Section 2704(b), the value of the gifted stock is determined withoutregard to any restriction because it is not a restriction which by its termswill never lapse.  Because the restriction lapses subsequent to the transfer,it is disregarded.  Therefore, the Profit preferred stock is valued as thoughthe restriction on liquidation did not exist.It has been suggested that strict application of Section 2704 may preclude theapplication of the minority discount.15 Consider the following:Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common stock of Betacorporation, which is the only outstanding class of stock.  On March 1, 1995,John gives 30 shares to his son, Bob, and 30 shares to his daughter, Betty.The voting rights attributed by the corporation's bylaws to such stock lapseupon the transfer.  The value of the corporation on the date of the gift was$1 million and the per-share value prior to the gift was $10,000.  Thepost-lapse value of each share of gifted stock is $7,500.  Assume that therecommended minority discount would be 25%.  Since the right to vote thetransferred shares lapses upon the stock transfer, there is a potentialSection 2704(a) transfer equal to $2,500 per share.  Thus, the per-share valuesubject to gift taxation would be $10,000 per share.  Such a result wouldeliminate the minority discount.  But for Section 2704(a), the per-share valuesubject to gift taxation would be reduced to $7,500 as a result of theminority discount.  However, Section 2704(a) creates a transfer equal to thevalue of the lapsed voting rights.Congress considered including in Section 2704 a provision that the minoritydiscount would not be allowed.  Despite the challenge, the committee reportsprovide that Section 2704 currently is not intended to affect minoritydiscounts or other discounts.  Reg.  25.2704-1(d) appears to be consistentwith this point.  According to the reg, when valuing a gifted interest with alapse, the starting point for determining the amount of the 2704 transfer isnot the value of all interests owned by the holder immediately before thetransfer.  Instead, it is the value of all such interests determinedimmediately after the lapse as if the lapsed right was nonlapsing.Example:  At his death, D owned all of the preferred stock of Alphacorporation and his child, Betty, owned all of the common stock.  Thepreferred stock possessed 60% of the total voting power with the common stockpossessing the remaining 40%.  Pursuant to the corporate bylaws, the votingrights of the preferred stock terminated on D's death.  The value of D'sinterest immediately prior to his death was $100,000.  The value of thatinterest immediately after death would have been $90,000 if the voting rightshad been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects the end of D'sinvolvement in Alpha.The regulations recognize the $10,000 discount attributable to the loss of akey person.  Therefore, under Section 2704(a), the beginning value of thetransferred stock is the post-transfer value after application of the key-mandiscount.  The same analysis should also apply with respect to the minoritydiscount.  If so, then the starting point for determining the amount of theSection 2704 transfer should be the post-transfer value after application ofthe minority discount.Example:  John owns 80 shares of the total of Money Corporation's 100outstanding shares of common stock.  He gifts 40 shares to each of his twochildren.  Per the corporate bylaws, the voting rights of John's common stockterminated upon the stock transfer.  The per-share value of the transferredstock prior to the gift was $1,000 per share.  The value of that interestimmediately after the gift would have been $750 per share if the voting rightshad been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects a 25% minority discount.Assume that as a result of the lapse the per-share value of the transferredstock drops to $600 per share.  If we assume that the beginning value forSection 2704(a) purposes is $750 which incorporates a 25% minority discount,the value of the 2704(a) transfer is $150 per share ($750 minority discountvalue less $600) and not $400.Final Legislative OffensiveWe understand that the IRS is pursuing a legislative attempt to eliminate theminority discount.  This would not be the first direct legislative threat tothe minority discount.  In 1987, the House version of Section 2036(c) providedthat absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the deemed value ofstock in a corporation is its pro-rata share of all the stock in the class.The Senate version of Section 2036(c) did not contain a similar provision.The House provision on minority discounts was dropped from the final Section2036(c) bill.Historically, the minority discount has played a significant role in manyestate plans.  Although the IRS has reversed its position with respect tofamily attribution in Rev.  Rul.  93-12, it has established significantpositions elsewhere to regain any perceived lost ground.  As the battlescontinues, the concern is that the IRS might ultimately win the war.  nCARL C.  RADOM, J.D., LL.M.  is a member of the Kansas City law firm of Lewis,Rice & Fingersh, L.C.MICHAEL A.

He believes the current surge of speculation about a salewas triggered by the leak of a confidential study from Merrill Lynch,which last month made an unsolicited presentation to Lloyds Bankadvising on the possible divestment of SMH. "We have to contend withthese rumours every three months," Weiershauser said.Although it is not the first time Lloyds has apparently considered thesale of its 75 percent of SMH, on this occasion various circumstancessuggest that the time is right.According to the Merrill Lynch presentation report, there are a numberof international banks which could be considering the sale of theirGerman private banking subsidiaries in the short and medium term.Germany's new regulations on capital adequacy and capital backing forderivatives business, and in particular the new rules on minimumvolumes for trading business, all place the viability of smaller Germanbanks in question, Merrill Lynch said.The additional work and expenditure necessary to tackle thesechallenges would induce many banks to seek a strong parent bank tofinance the necessary investments in edp and personnel, or else towithdraw from certain businesses.Another dilemma is that some of the exclusive and confidential serviceswhich are the hallmark of German private banks can no longer beprovided under the new legislation. German banks are now obliged, forinstance, to pass on suspicions of insider trading.But the crucial argument of Merrill Lynch's presentation was that SMHis better placed than most to tackle these difficulties. SMH isparticularly attractive to potential purchasers, according to Merrill,because of its above-average financial performance, excellent marketreputation and highly professional management team.The bank has operated its own international capital markets businessfor some years and has the expertise to comply with the new capital andtrading regulations without any real difficulty, Merrill added.Nevertheless, Lloyds will be aware that several other big banks havesuffered losses and embarrassment from their German private bankingsubsidiaries. Barclays' Merck, Finck, lost substantial sums overseveral years and humiliated its shareholders by publishing profitfigures for 1993 before having to admit that the bank had made a lossafter all.Recently it has been rumoured that Grunelius Privatbankiers, the tinyprivate bank owned by Deutsche Bank, will also be sold off or evendisbanded. In 1994, Grunelius' assets shrank by nearly 14 percent toDM206 million ($143 million). Commissions income fell whileadministrative expenses rose, culminating in a net loss of DM1.8million. Managing Director Gerd Schmitz- Morkramer left several monthsago and has not yet been replaced.But if Lloyds is indeed considering a sale of SMH, which it acquired in1984, the reasons would probably lie with its own strategy.It is telling that Lloyds, which has never been a major internationalinvestment house, has always operated SMH at arm's length as anon-consolidated subsidiary. But Lloyds has recently amended itsstrategy and foreign capital markets subsidiaries no longer seem to fitin at all.Lloyds is now aiming to focus on the mass market at home and hopes tobecome the strongest and most profitable institution in UK retailbanking. The recent merger with the TSB retail bank followed takeoversof the Cheltenham & Gloucester building society and the insurer AbbeyLife. Rather than retaining SMH which is engaged primarily in upscaleGerman private banking and capital markets business - Lloyds could selland use the proceeds of sale to pursue its new strategic aims.In the light of Lloyds' new strategy, it is clear that the profitableshareholding in SMH which could be divested to another large financialinstitution without stiffening competition in Lloyds' core UK market.Traditionally, Lloyds has included in its core business any subsidiarywhich generates return on equity of at least 15 percent. SMH achievednet return on equity of more than 27 percent in 1993, but slipped backto 3.3 percent the following year as a result of depleted commissionsincome. Weiershauser indicated that commissions income had made a"respectable" showing in 1995, but declined to give details.However, the sale - if it does happen - may not occur for months.Lloyds' profits are so good - indeed, the bank is considering a sharebuy-back - that it need not accede to the first bidder. If it doessell, Lloyds can almost certainly afford to wait until an advantageousprice is offered.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONSPRIVATE BANKING is one of the most troublesome terms in the financialservices lexicon. Consider the number of definitions.Ask a mainland European to define the term and, in all probability, aprivate bank will be described as a banking institution not owned bythe government. Probe a little harder, especially in Switzerland, andthe respondent may qualify his answer by pointing out that a privatebank tends not to be incorporated, is structured on the partnershipmodel, and is totally reliant on the partners' resources for bankcapital.Go to the UK or the US and a more familiar definition will be given.Private banking is concerned with the provision of banking services forhigh net worth individuals. However, as innumerable articles in PBIhave pointed out over the years, this definition is not without itsdrawbacks.The first problem is that no one has yet come up with a definitivedescription of "high net worth". To judge from the plethora of "privatebanks" coming into existence, the high net worth threshold is fallingby the day. It will surely not be long before the whole of the retailbanking sector will be subsumed by the private banking market.A second problem is that most of the services provided by "privatebanks" are not concerned with banking, i.e. the collection of deposits,the making of loans and the provision of payment services. Assetmanagement, tax planning and the establishment and administration oftrusts, inter alia, are the essence of private banking, or moreaccurately, of wealth management.Although the possession of a banking licence can be advantageous in anumber of respects - it facilitates offshore and international "privatebanking" as well as providing an aura of greater security - it is notcritical to the business of wealth management.In fact "private banks" are probably responsible for only a smallproportion of the total stock of wealth owned by "high net worth"individuals, although it is likely that they dominate the internationaland offshore markets.This poses a considerable dilemma for the editor of PBI. It may bepossible to identify a discrete target market in terms of wealthmanagement institutions that possess a banking licence. The problem isthat they constitute a small sector of the market within which privatebanks compete.Clearly a way around this impasse is to redefine "private banking".Henceforth, as far as PBI is concerned, private banking will be definedas "the provision of financial services and wealth managementfacilities for affluent customers".ONE CONSEQUENCE of this definition is that the scope and content of PBIwill be extended. From time to time previous editors have dabbled withother institutions active in the wealth management sector such as legaland accountancy firms, broker dealers and the plethora of institutionscontained within the "independent financial adviser" umbrella. Althoughwe do not intend to cut back our coverage of institutions active in theinternational private banking sector - indeed we intend to expand boththe depth and breadth of our coverage - the "non-bank" private banks orwealth management institutions will assume a higher profile.This is at it should be. Last year a study produced by PSI of TampaFlorida showed conclusively that US banks were losing market share inthe private banking sector to broker-dealers. The losses were notconfined to "middle-income affluent", a market segment which might beconsidered particularly vulnerable. Perhaps, more worryingly, theyincluded the "elite private banking" segment, or clients who had onaverage $1.2 million of investible assets and who contributed over$10,000 in annual revenue.The dynamism exhibited by non-bank sectors of the wealth managementsector makes it a natural for coverage in PBI. In the US, for example,the investment companies and broker dealers are having a profoundeffect on the evolution of the financial services sector. They haveoften been a hothouse of new product developments, many of which can beusefully taken up by "conventional" private banks.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BOOM IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENTBY COINCIDENCE, according to statistics published by the Association ofSolicitor Investment Management (ASIM), it appears that the investmentmanagement activities of UK legal firms are currently booming. Not onlydid funds managed by its members double during 1995 but there has beena substantial increase in the number of firms active in the sector.It is no surprise to find that the firm with the biggest involvement isan Edinburgh-based firm, Murray Beith & Murray, which has #180 million($280 million) under management. Many of the firms currently active inthe Scottish fund management sector can trace their origins to thelegal and accountancy professions. This is especially the case withBaille Gifford, Scotland's largest specialist fund manager. For therecord it still maintains a partnership structure.There are two sets of factors responsible for the increased involvementof solicitors in the wealth management sector. Like retail banks, theyhave seen margins on their traditional business areas tumble as aconsequence of new entrants and increased competition. On the otherhand, they already had some of the core capabilities required forsuccessful involvement in the sector. They appear to be more thanwilling to buy in what they lack.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BROKERS POST HIGHER EARNINGS THAN BANKSIN THE last four years, brokerage houses serving individual investorshave posted consistently higher profits than investment banks,according to research by the Security Industry Association (SIA) in NewYork. The trend marks a sharp reversal from the 1980s, when investmentbanks dominated Wall Street earnings by posting profits that were morethan twice those reported by "full-line" brokerage firms catering toindividual investors.In 1994, which saw a global correction in the bond market, WallStreet's investment banks were thrown for a loss, while the full-linebrokerages remained firmly in the black. And in 1995, a stockmarketrally pushed the brokers' earnings some 60 percent over those ofinvestment banks (see chart)."The securities industry has been turned upside down," said SIAresearch chief Jeffrey Schaefer. In the 1990s, he explained, profitsgrew due to three factors: the success of capital raising activities;the booming business of money management both for institutions andindividuals; and the phenomenal growth of mutual funds. While the firstfactor has helped investment banks, full-line brokerage houses havetaken advantage of all three factors, with retail investment servicesgiving them a strong edge."The biggest difference [from the 1980s] has been the role of mutualfunds, which I call the financial intermediary of the 1990s," Schaeferexplained."Long-term mutual funds, which only became attractive toindividuals in fixed-income markets in 1985, have allowed individualsto participate in the equity and bond markets of the 1990s and still beable to diversify."The performance of full-line brokers in 1995 is particularly impressivegiven the strong performance of investment banks, due to last year'smerger and acquisition boom and the surging revenues from the issuingof securities. Investment banks have also benefited from 1995's bondrally, which has greatly enhanced the value of their large bondportfolios. Investment banks' fees from underwriting new stocks andbonds have recently begun contributing from their bottom lines again.In 1995, full-line brokerage firms have benefited far more from theyear's record stockmarket trading volume and price appreciation.Excluding new stock issues, market activity has increased the value ofstocks by $2.1 trillion, or 33 percent, to a total of $8.4 trillion.Last year was one of only three in the past 21 years when stock pricesincreased more than 30 percent.Brokers have also been better positioned to exploit the explosion ofstock mutual funds, which are far more profitable for retail brokeragesthan bond funds. In 1995, an astonishing 87 percent of net cash flowinto long-term mutual funds went into equity instruments, according tothe SIA.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Inthe competition to fill the position of the new Chase's chief cardsexecutive, Ward was edged out by his opposite number at Chemical,Charles Walsh.A 27-year veteran at Chase Manhattan, Ward served in the 1970s as thebank's credit and marketing officer for Japan and then Chase's chief oftrade and export finance in Europe and the Middle East.In 1987, he was named credit policy officer of Chase's Individual Bankbased in New York, and became president of Chase Personal FinancialServices in 1991.At Amex Bank, Ward will replace Steven Goldstein, who informed Amexofficials of his desire to resign when discussions concerning apossible sale of Amex Bank were concluded in October.American Express had tried to sell its international private bank, anEdge Act institution chartered only for offshore operations, for $1billion, or 1.25 times book value. The bank has performed poorly inrecent years, reporting a return on assets of 0.58 percent on assets of$13.39 billion in 1994.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

He hopes to attract between30,000 and 40,000 customers within four to five years.This is the first time that German retail investors have been offeredSwiss investment products by direct marketing routes. The marketingcampaign has begun with large full-colour advertisements in the Germanbusiness press, and, from next month, will branch out into direct mailaimed at high-income private investors - particularly those deemed tohave an interest in Switzerland as vacationers or owners of holidayhomes.In most markets, an advertising campaign of this kind would beunremarkable. But in Germany, Credit Suisse's advertisements arereminiscent of the mood three years ago, when the German banks madefrenzied appeals to investors to avoid tax by transferring theirsavings to accounts in Luxembourg. Some banks, particularly DresdnerBank, are still being "punished" for this, with regular police raidsand confiscation of confidential client records in branches suspectedof assisting tax evaders.Lacher is resigned to criticism from competitor banks and the Germanauthorities. But he points out that the Credit Suisse advertisementsavoid the innuendo employed by some German banks during the Luxembourgcampaigns. Indeed, Lacher is playing so safe at present that thecurrent campaign does not even stress the advantages of the Swiss francas a reserve currency. However, the next set of ads may do, he said.Moreover potential tax evaders will not be given any new opportunitiesby CS Direct Invest. In fact, since the transfers will not be made inperson (often the case with Luxembourg accounts in 1993) investors haveless chance to evade tax.Investments in the funds from German clients are transferred first toCredit Suisse's Frankfurt offices, and then en masse to Switzerland.Foreign money transfers of more than DM2,000 ($1,400) must beregistered with the local branch of the Bundesbank, and the names ofeach investor must be supplied on request. "These transfers leavefootprints in Germany," Lacher said.Customers have an incentive to use this automated route because CreditSuisse waives the usual bank fees for foreign payment transfers.Nevertheless, Lacher concedes that "the border region is a problem".Germans living near Zurich, Basel or Schaffhausen prefer to drive intoSwitzerland with cash in a briefcase and deposit it in a Swiss custodyaccount. By that means, they can escape the attention of theBundesbank, and, possibly, the German tax authorities too.CS Direct Invest was launched in Switzerland last May and has attracted25,000 enquiries. The bank declines to say how many have so far becomeCS customers.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The proposal,which has attracted the anxious attentions of federal banking and taxauthorities, is now being actively studied by Montana regulators.While the proposal appears far-fetched at first sight, Montanaauthorities said it could lead to the establishment of an innovativeoffshore deposit facility in the mountain state.In late 1995, Robert Svoboda, a former banker and Montana resident nowliving in Santa Barbara, asked Montana regulators to commission afeasibility study to investigate the possibility of establishing aSwiss-style secret banking facility in the state. Such a bank would bestate-chartered, and would not benefit from federal deposit insuranceand the federal regulation that goes along with it.The unit would provide highly confidential deposit services toforeigners through the use of numbered accounts. Svoboda's mostaggressive scenario would allow non-resident aliens to deposit funds ina Montana bank, which could then put the funds in trusts that coulddeposit the money in non-taxable investments or transfer them to otherbanks and countries. Depending on clients' investment and depositneeds, the bank could provide varying "levels of privacy.""This isn't for money-laundering or helping people to keep from payingtaxes," Svoboda told American Banker in December. "It's a safe havenfor money, and it's private."According to state authorities, Svoboda described his initialmotivation as "philanthropic" - secret banking facilities could providehis former home state with significant revenue in state-levied fees onassets and possibly escheatment revenues, where funds in secretaccounts might revert to the state treasury if they are not claimed byheirs of deceased depositors.Such an institution might also benefit from Montana's relativelyunregulated financial environment and the Montana state constitution'sunusual privacy provisions.Responding to Svoboda's proposal, Montana's legislature formed aninterim committee late last year to study the idea. The committee hasmet four times and will meet next in late January, when it will hearpresentations from federal authorities, including representatives ofthe Internal Revenue Service, the Department of the Treasury and theFederal Reserve Bank."No precedent exists for this anywhere in the country," said ChrisOlson, Montana's deputy banking commissioner, who freely admits thatstate banking authorities currently lack the legal and regulatorybackground to evaluate such a novel plan. Outside the state, bankingexperts have greeted the Svoboda proposal with incredulity or derisivelaughter."The people who haven't laughed are the Feds," said Steven Maly, alegislative aide who is co-ordinating the state legislature's interimresearch effort. "Knowing that we do a lot of fishing up here, the Fedshave warned us that we would be bottom-fishing attracting the worstcriminal element - with this sort of activity."Maly said he was surprised by the level of concern expressed by federalauthorities. "Without saying as much, they seemed to be telling us,`This could happen, and we're not going to help you do it.'"Disregarding the wrath of the Feds, Maly believes a Montana secretbanking facility is simply not practical, given existing US law andregulation. For example, he sees no way to circumvent the federalrequirement that all deposits in excess of $10,000 must be reported tothe US Treasury Department.But Maly is evaluating the possibility of minimizing federalsupervision of a state-chartered depository for offshore funds whichhave no tax liability and which waive the requirements for federaldeposit insurance.A state-chartered foreign funds depository might provide offshoreclients a higher degree of privacy than other US banks, and it mightprovide some non-taxable investment services as well. In particular, asignificant level of federal oversight could be avoided where funds aredeposited but not transferred out of the depository."We're thinking about something that is much simpler and more primitivethan a secret banking facility," Maly explained."We're not planning tocompete with existing offshore facilities. Instead, we're looking atcreating a new and different way of attracting legitimate flightcapital. One angle we're looking at is tying deposits to preciousmetals, especially platinum, which is produced in Montana."The cost advantages of in-state production and storage of preciousmetals, coupled with new financial technology and reduced regulation,could create a commercial opportunity to establish a new kind ofoffshore depository in Montana, Maly said.He believes that such a facility might be attractive to rich familiesin Taiwan, for example, who are looking for secure and relativelysecret international deposit facilities, and who already hold asignificant amount of their wealth in precious metals.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The OCC's letter comes more than a year afterCongress passed the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and BranchingEfficiency Act, which ushered in a new era for national banking in theUS.The OCC's action aims to "level the playing field" for US banks wishingto extend their trust business to states where they have no trustcharters. According to the OCC, trust banks can now ignore state lawsrequiring them to have operations based in those states. Moreover,national banks need not apply for special permits if state-charteredbanks are exempt from them.Banks have long complained that state regulatory requirements, whichgenerally stipulate that trust departments must have in-stateheadquarters to obtain special exemptions, have contributed toinefficiency by preventing consolidations. However, the OCC's ruling islikely to face resistance from state regulators uncomfortable withfurther intrusions from federal banking authorities.The OCC's letter came in response to an inquiry from Midwestsuper-regional Banc One, which is eager to centralise its 11-statetrust business under a single national banking charter.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Trust departments must also report instances wheresurcharges or the cost of settling customer disputes have caused anaccount to lose more than $100,000.Up until now, trust departments have reported only the size ofdiscretionary and non-discretionary assets by account type. The newrule applies to 2,819 trust departments that manage more than $100million in assets. These units control 99 percent of the over $11trillion held in trust at US financial institutions.The new regulation was drafted by the Federal Financial InstitutionsExaminations Council, an inter-agency group of federal regulators thatsupervises federally insured depository institutions.The rule will permit examiners to produce uniform measurements of theperformance and risk management policies of trust departments, and toget a fuller picture of their solvency and profitability.Regulators have called for new scrutiny of the US trust industry, asthe gathering and managing of trust assets has gained momentum inrecent years. In the five years ending in 1993, US trust assets grew 61percent to $10.6 trillion.The American Bankers Association in Washington has protested againstthe new regulation as a violation of confidentiality. Bankers areconcerned that the information may be used to gauge the profitabilityof competitors, and that such information may become public as theresult of litigation, as happened recently in a suit filed against thederivatives activity of Bankers Trust.Regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank have responded that theprofitability information it collects on trust departments will remainconfidential, although the central bank will release compositeprofitability data which will be of use to the industry.Bankers have responded that little benefit will come from such data, asprofitability benchmarking services are already offered by privateconsultants. The Financial Services Association of Niles, Michigan, forexample, currently sells a service called Trust Compare, which allowstrust departments to benchmark their profitability against that ofother institutions using the service.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Banco Popularrecently ended the collaboration agreement on the grounds that therewas too much competition between the two institutions."After six months in operation we came to the conclusion that for abank such as ours, well positioned in the domestic market and with asubstantial branch network there were few advantages to be gained fromsuch an agreement. We realised that basically all we were doing waspresenting our clients to Bankers Trust. As a result, we decided to endthe agreement," Fernando de Soto of Banco Popular told PBI.Last year Banco Popular chose to develop its private banking servicesin close collaboration with Bankers Trust, as a means of giving aninternational dimension to its existing service and product offer. Eachbank opened its own specialised private banking branch in Madrid.Bankers Trust was to be responsible for managing client assets but eachbank had separate relationship managers and was responsible formarketing its services. For Bankers Trust, whose presence in Spain hasbeen mainly geared towards foreign customers, the agreement with BancoPopular was seen as a means of drawing closer to the domestic market.Banco Popular is adamant that competition was the only motive forending the relationship, but with its reputation for tight risk controland prudent investment practices, Banco Popular can hardly have beenpleased by Bankers Trust's loss of prestige.The US bank's reputation has taken a severe battering over the last 18months as a consequence of its derivative-related activities and thelawsuits brought against it by disgruntled clients such as Proctor &Gamble.In the meantime, Banco Popular will continue to deal with its high networth clients through the branch network."This system worked very wellin the past and there is no reason why it shouldn't continue to do so,"said de Soto.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Ian Orton reportsJAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US are the best countries for tax-averseindividuals to be domiciled. According to Tax Freedom Day 1996, areport which attempts to compute the number of days an individual hasto "work" for the government, these three countries demand far lessfrom their citizens than other OECD members, especially constituents ofthe European Union.In 1994 a Japanese worker had, on average to work only 119 days - oruntil April 29 to pay off his or her tax bill (see chart). Australianworkers had to work a day longer. It took US workers another six daysto work off their annual tax load.Onerous as these requirements were, however, they were much lower thanthose faced by Europeans, especially members of the European Union. TaxFreedom Day would have arrived in the European Union on June 14, orafter 165 days, compared with June 7 or 158 days for the OECD.Some European countries fared relatively well. In Portugal a workerwould "only" have had to work for 132 days or until May 11 to meet hisor her tax obligations. In the UK the equivalent date was May 17 or 138days.Conversely, however, Scandinavian workers would have had to work wellinto the second half of the year to clear their tax obligations.Norwegians and Finns would have had to work for 185 days, Danes 200 andSwedes 208 - or until July 27 - to achieve tax freedom.As always, with any international comparison, there are considerablemethodological problems and, as a consequence, the tax freedom dayscalculated for each country are not necessarily a"true" reflection ofthe time needed to work-off the annual tax obligation.To some extent they reflect the methodology used by Gabriel Stein, thereport's author. As such, the figures give only a rough approximationof where Tax Freedom Day might occur in each country.For each country shown in the chart, total tax revenue as a percentageof GDP at market prices has been compared to the equivalent UK figures.The difference between the two figures has then been translated intodays of the year, and this has then been added to - or subtracted from- the British Tax Freedom Day.In 1996, the average UK employee will have to work 142 days, that isuntil Tuesday May 21 to pay off his or her tax bill, the same number ofdays as last year. The 2p reduction in the standard rate of income taxannounced in the November budget has been offset by increases in otherareas, such as excise duties on tobacco and petrol.Nonetheless, the situation is still an improvement on the 1970s andearly-1980s when the tax burden was much higher. The 1980s and early-1990s saw a continuous fall in the tax burden with Tax Freedom Daymoving earlier and earlier from June 6 in 1982 to May 17 in 1993. Itthen shot back five days in 1995 and shows little sign of reverting tothe 1980s trend.The situation would be even worse if government borrowing was takeninto account, however. Stein argues that this should be added to thetotal burden of taxation, since it eventually has to be paid for byfuture taxpayers. This would mean that the UK taxpayer would not befree of both burdens until Monday June 3. Nonetheless, as a result of afall in government borrowing, this would be an improvement on thesituation in 1993 when the relevant day was June 13.For much of the European Union, where many countries have much heavierdebt burdens than the UK, the situation would have been even worse.As tax burdens rise, as governments attempt to conform with theMaastricht criteria before 1999, this should mean that there should besubstantial opportunities for private bankers, especially those whichplace emphasis on tax-planning.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Ulrich Sutter talked to DrSieghardt RometschTHE PAST year produced outstanding results for Trinkaus & Burkhardt,one of Germany's oldest private banks. Net profits increased by 24.9percent to DM92.9 million ($64 million), an all-time high.Interest income leaped to DM177.7 million, an increase of 23,7 percenton the previous year, while commission income was marginally down by3.4 percent at DM160.6 million. Since flotation in 1985, Trinkaus hasseen its total asset base jump by more than 260 percent.Operating from their Dusseldorf headquarters overlooking theprestigious Konigsallee, Trinkaus has experienced its fair share of upsand downs especially during the 1970s and early 1980s, admits DrSieghardt Rometsch, a partner responsible for corporate banking."The bank was caught up in the aftermath of the Herstatt bankingcollapse. Despite performing well, we were forced to look for outsidehelp to rebuild our capital base, and this resulted in Citibankacquiring a controlling stake. This produced a change of strategy andwe abandoned retail banking," said Rometsch."The Citibank connection was relatively short-lived, and in 1980 thebank was acquired by Midland Bank. Our fortunes changed rapidly,largely as a result of Midland Bank's decision to give us a largedegree of autonomy. It surely was paramount to the success we haveachieved so far", he said with pride. "Reducing Midland's shareholdingfrom 90 percent to 70 percent subsequently helped strengthen ourposition with our customers as an independent private bank."A former general manager with Chase Manhattan Bank, Rometsch arguesthat most foreign banks have failed to be profitable in the Germanmarket, as a consequence of adopting relatively short-term strategies."The exception, of course, is Citibank which has successfullyestablished itself in the retail banking sector. The vast majority ofbanks, however, do not understand that private banking is predicated onrelationships and has to grow organically. It will sometimes take yearsfor a relationship to create the trust necessary to sustain profitablebusiness. Once we have crossed this line, they accept us as partners.Only then will the typical private banking client entrust larger sumsto us."Rometsch is also critical of many foreign banks management systems."These often reduce the individual's creativity and his overallperformance. Matrix management is still very common especially with USbanks. From my own experience, I have found this style a handicap tothe successful private banker."Since Trinkaus & Burkhardt abandoned retail banking to concentrate onasset management, securities and corporate banking, its performance hasimproved significantly. The bank now has some DM35 billion of assetsunder management of which DM18 billion comes from private bankingclients.Contrary to the industry trend, which has resulted in a reduction ofminimum thresholds, private banking clients must have at least DM1billion in free assets of which they must place DM250,000 withTrinkaus."As soon as profit margins were being squeezed, we decided to setrigorous benchmarks, to avoid getting involved in price competition. Weanalysed our markets and came to the conclusion that we had a franchisein the regional Mittelstand market, especially in companies with aminimum turnover of between DM100 million-DM200 million. I think youneed a certain minimum size to be able to stay in the business and todeliver good performance.""A typical account manager at Trinkaus will look after between 40-60clients. Training has been made a priority since the mid-1980s. Ourstaff spend an annual average of 60-90 hours on in-house training."As a small private bank we are fully aware that we must be availablefor our clients from 9 am to 5 pm. So our approach is somewhatdifferent from other institutions. We just don't think it isjustifiable to send them on seminars in training centres. After all,our clients should expect excellent performance and this means that weshould be working all the time".International expansion has so far been on a modest scale. Besides fivedomestic offices, representative offices were set up in Luxembourg andZurich in the late-1970s. Overall, business expansion has largelyconcentrated on the affluent region of North Rhine Westphalia."The Mittelstand is our main business focus", explains Rometsch."Although they have always been very export-oriented, they simply havenot achieved much penetration in Far Eastern markets, although we hopethis may change."The Hong Kong of German industry is eastern Europe. They are morecomfortable with the distance and culture and a majority speak theGerman language. Today our natural market also includes Luxembourg andparts of the Netherlands, where we are experiencing good results. WhenHSBC decided to close their Luxembourg banking activities it was onlynatural for Trinkaus to look after their clients. Through thisconnection we maintain an Asian client base".The integration process within the HSBC Group has been smooth. "Ourlink with HSBC is a strong selling argument", he claims. "We haveintroduced a substantial number of clients to HSBC. Nevertheless, wehave to be aware, that operating as a private bank within a groupnetwork requires enormous sensitivity on our part. It is almost like awalk on a razor blade - as independent private bank operating withinthe network of one of the world's largest banks."European expansion plans, however, are far off the agenda at Trinkaus."We have no plans to become a global player in the private bankingmarket. We are a truly German private bank with strong roots in theMittelstand. This is our strength on which we have built our expertiseover centuries".Rometsch concluded: "If clients within the HSBC Group need advice on DMproducts, they certainly find them at Trinkaus & Burkhardt."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996BACK TO THE FUTURE?Midland Bank, a UK subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai BankingCorporation (HSBC), established a domestic private bank in 1993 whicheschewed much of the conventional wisdom associated with the sector.Ian Orton spoke to Peter Renn, its first managing director, about thephilosophy behind the initiative and the progress achieved to dateOF ALL the new domestic private banks established by the large UKfinancial institutions during the 1990s Midland Private Banking hasundoubtedly attracted the most interest, not least because of itsdecision to use staff drawn from the commercial bank.Purists could argue that Midland's initiative is yet another instanceof the private banking moniker being devalued. For Peter Renn, however,the establishment of Midland's private bank, is a natural consequenceof the changes affecting the UK banking sector generally."The UK retail banking sector has experienced rapid change over thelast ten years. This is particularly the case as far as serviceprovision has been concerned. New technology is making it easier toservice retail customers through remote media. There are far fewerbranches. However, there is still a demand for personal service,especially from the more affluent segment of the customer base. Hencethe decision to establish the domestic private bank."According to Renn, in some respects the establishment of domesticprivate banks by the large UK banks is a throwback to an earlier era.The UK banks only became mass market institutions during the 1960s.Before then their customer base had an element of exclusivity. In thisenvironment it was possible to provide a relatively high level ofpersonal service, albeit in a much more narrowly defined market.Thirty years on, the new private banks are attempting to re-establishan aura of exclusivity and personal service - and generate high qualityfee and commission income as a consequence."It is also a natural consequence to an increasingly competitiveenvironment. Product differentiation and market segmentation arelogical responses to increased competition," said Renn.The HSBC UK strategyThe domestic private bank was an outcome of a global review of itsinterests in this sector conducted by HSBC following its acquisition ofMidland in 1992.At that time, Midland had two operations which catered for thefinancial services requirements of the affluent. Samuel Montagu cateredfor very high net worth individuals. Midland Personal Asset Managementcatered for the needs of private clients with more modest means.The review resulted in the pooling together of the group'sinternational private banking operations under the umbrella of HSBC.Each of the component banks would retain or operate with its own namein order to capitalise on existing reputations and ensure that staffand relationships were country-focused rather than legalentity-focused.This meant that in the UK Samuel Montagu and the British Bank of theMiddle East would continue to cater for the financial elite from ajoint office in Hill Street, London. It was also decided to establish adomestic private bank based on Midland Personal Asset Management."It was a natural outcome. The Personal Asset Management business had anumber of private banking elements such as a brokerage, fund managementand trusts. What it didn't have were the human resources or the brandrecognition to communicate a quality service image. The establishmentof a private bank provided an opportunity for these attributes to beprovided," said Renn.The importance of personal serviceThe provision of a high level of service was perceived from the outsetas the key to enabling Midland to differentiate itself from otherinstitutions."There is no shortage of definitions of private banking or, for thatmatter, private banks. I think the term private banking should reallybe used to describe the market rather than the nature of the productsor services provided. Private banks can trace their origin to a numberof sources - legal and accounting firms, fund managers, stockbrokers,even commercial banks."Although each institution will attempt to follow a different strategythere is often one basic similarity between them - they will tend toemphasise one particular product. This will often reflect theirorigins. Private banks which evolved out of legal or accountingpartnerships will emphasise their trust and tax planning capabilities,asset management specialists their fund management skills and so on. Inother words, the nature of the service will be product-orientated."At Midland we had to decide whether to go down a similar route and, ifso, what type of products we should offer. After conducting a lot ofresearch we decided to go down a different route by making theprovision of high quality service the keystone of our strategy".Customer preferencesMidland's research suggested that prospective clients were looking foradvice and an ongoing relationship from a private bank. "There is adefinite gap in the market as far as the provision of advice isconcerned. Although people are becoming more affluent there is noshortage of financial worries. There is less certainty of unbrokenunemployment. People are living longer. Meanwhile, the government isreducing health and welfare provision. No matter how affluent they maybe now, people are being forced to address long-term financial planningissues and they need advice."The research also showed that potential clients were not particularlyinterested in being sold a plethora of banking or investment products.Nonetheless, they were appreciative of a broad range of productofferings drawn from a variety of suppliers.They were also looking for specific - or rather seamless solutions totheir financial problems. It was clear from the outset that "packaged"solutions would not generate much enthusiasm.The emphasis placed on advice and the preference for a "bespoke"private banking service was critical in a number of respects. Despitethe fact that an organisation the size of HSBC is in a position toprovide from its own resources all of the products and servicestraditionally associated with private banking, it was felt that theprivate bank should function as an independent intermediary. It wouldtherefore have the freedom to buy in - on the client's behalf - anyrelevant product or service.Second, given the nature of the "product" offered, considerableemphasis was placed on the ability of relationship managers to provideservice of a quality that would satisfy prospective clients.Relationship managers in this environment have to encapsulate a numberof skills and functions and must develop an almost encyclopedicknowledge of the banking and financial services sector. They also haveto be readily accessible.Staffing the private bankMidland decided to staff the bank with people drawn from the commercialbank supplemented, where necessary, by outside recruits. These wereoften drawn from the IFA sector. Although this decision has beengreeted with some surprise by outside commentators - not to mentioncompetitors - Renn is unrepentant about the efficacy of the approach."The first point to make is that in the current UK regulatoryenvironment it is virtually impossible for unqualified personnel to belet loose in the private banking market. All of our people wererigorously trained and are in receipt of one of the qualificationsrecognised by the Personal Investment Authority."We also used very stringent selection criteria to identify potentialrelationship managers. We understood quite clearly that wealthycustomers will only deal with experienced people with the authority totake decisions and act on them."The commercial bank was in a position to meet this requirement. "A bitof grey hair does you no harm in this particular environment. AtMidland, we had quite a large pool of very experienced bankers to drawon. Many of the bank's more senior personnel could look back on 20 or25 years of banking experience. We were very keen to encourage thesepeople to come and work for us."It was also decided from the outset to provide the bank with a localfocus. "We thought it was of critical importance to ensure that ourpeople were locally based - not located in a remote City office. Youcan't develop significant relationships if the customer has to travelto London every time he, or she, wants to see a private banker."There are over 30 Midland Private Banking branches located throughoutEngland and Wales. They share a common location with the commercialbank branches.Tied versus IFA statusMidland's strategy meant that the new private bank's "natural"competitors would be the IFA sector. "These are the institutions whichmost closely match what Midland are trying to do."The decision to go down the IFA route or to concentrate on sellingMidland or HSBC products was a tough one to make. We rejected the tiedoption. We knew that customers might feel compromised by being offeredonly Midland or HSBC-branded products. Their options are limited."We also decided to stay clear of packaged products and services.First, a package will not necessarily address the specific customerrequirements. Second, customers may feel that they are having to payfor something they do not really need. A `bespoke' approach is muchmore efficacious. It is cost effective - customers only pay for whatthey need - and it is much more flexible. It doesn't cost much more toselect and manage a customised portfolio of stocks and shares than unittrusts, for example."Pricing was something that Midland Private Banking was conscious offrom the outset. "Although the customer base was comfortably off, wewere conscious of the fact that, in many instances their money had beenhard earned. They did not expect to be ripped off."Positional advantagesRenn maintains that the bank had two important positional advantagesover the IFA sector, however. The first was that it had awell-recognised brand name. The second was that it could rely on thecommercial bank for potential customers."On the whole, IFAs do a very good job in the financial planning andwealth management market. Nonetheless clients are sometimes put off bya relative lack of security. There have been a number ofwell-publicised cases involving IFAs where probity - and the securityof the client's assets - has been severely compromised."Clients do run a notional risk assessment of institutions. One of theperceived strengths of the Midland Bank name is that we are a large,safe and well-run institution. Size is important in this market as, Ithink, the aftermath of the Barings crash showed."The bulk of the private bank's customers have been generated byinternal referrals. The customer threshold is income or free assets of#100,000, although this is more a guideline figure rather than a stricteligibility criterion. "Midland Private Banking targets the`comfortably off' portion of the market rather than the very affluent".Renn admits that a customer recruitment strategy which relied veryheavily on referrals from the commercial bank could have beenproblematic. This is especially the case in the new sales culture whichis permeating retail banks. A customer lost to the private bank maymean the loss of potential sales revenue for the retail bank."There is always scope for a potential conflict of interest unless youmake sure you have the right organisational structure in place. We werehelped by the fact that local private bank branches were structured aspart of the General Manager's department. As such, a referral amountedto an internal transfer within a single arena, not a transfer from onedepartment to another. We were also fortunate in that when the bank wasbeing set up, the Midland branch network was in the process ofupheaval. Very senior bankers were being put back into the branches andthis probably eased the transition."In practice, the strategy has worked well with the commercial bankgenerating a substantial proportion of Midland Private Banking'scustomer base. "In most cases, we have had an almost seamless transferof an old relationship". During the first half of 1995, for example,the retail branch network generated 3,500 customers.The futureRenn maintains that the future for the UK private banking sector isvery good. The market is opening up and many of the old cliches are nolonger relevant. There is a lot of "new money" about. Senior companyexecutives, entrepreneurs, media people, athletes - even lotterywinners are domestic private banks' natural constituency. MidlandPrivate Bankers is well placed to take advantage.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"We wantto become the card of choice in our cardholders' wallets."The move comes at an especially important time for AT&T, bothcorporately and in the card unit itself. AT&T Universal suffered acharge-off rate of 6 percent, adding up to a $39 million loss, duringthe third quarter of 1996. It was largely in anticipation of thisdisappointing result that unit president David Hunt resigned late lastsummer (see Cards International 163).More recently, and on the heels of Universal Card's disappointing thirdquarter, AT&T chairman Robert Allen named John Walter president, chiefoperating officer and chief executive of the telecommunications giant.The appointment prompted renewed industry speculation that AT&T willseek to spin off or simply sell the Universal Card portfolio."It is certainly not going to surprise anyone if it does go on theblock," said an industry observer. As for the rate cut itself, fewthink other issuers will respond."It has that sort of scent to it; a desperation move," said BruceBrittain, president of Brittain Associates, an Atlanta-based marketresearch firm. "It has just not been terribly successful in gettingrevolvers."According to Brittain, the industry average for revolving a balancefrom one month to another is 60 percent, while on the AT&T card it is39 percent. "And it was 39 percent in the third quarter of last year,so it hasn't seen any improvement," he added."It is true that we have a large share of transactors," Kolakowskisaid, "but we can rely on our AT&T relationship to make that aprofitable relationship." Speaking of the rate cut, she said, "We doexpect it to have a positive effect in 1996."Kolakowski expected more aggressive marketing from AT&T Universal inthe near term, and described the card unit's strategy as twofold."We are aggressively pursuing strategies to control our losses, and allour marketing programmes are going to concentrate on getting a greatershare of cardholders' wallets." Controlling losses, she said, would bemainly a matter of tightening credit standards: "We have slicedacquisitions in 1996."While AT&T Universal is the world's third largest card issuer in numberof cards in circulation, behind Dean Witter, Discover and Citicorp with24 cards and 18 million accounts respectively, it is seventh inreceivables.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"The first phase will see thelaunch of both classic and gold Visa cards, as well as attractiveadditional account and card-based services providing broad customerappeal," Sainsbury said in a statement.The new 24-hour banking operation will be telephone-based and willoperate out of the Bank of Scotland's call centre in Edinburgh,alongside the Scottish bank's own Banking Direct service, rather thanas part of it."We have the necessary infrastructure in place, but the productsoffered will differ. They will be genuine Sainsbury products," said IanFiddes, the bank's director of marketing services.Sainsbury said it would be the first supermarket retailer to enter theconsumer banking market. The only other UK retailer to possess such alicence is Marks & Spencer, which launched its charge card back in1987.The move has wrong-footed its main rival, Tesco, which, untilSainsbury's announcement on October 25, had led moves by UK supermarketgroups into the financial services market.Tesco launched its own budget account in June, offering 5.12 percentinterest on deposits, ten times some bank and building society depositrates. This, however, is operated by NatWest, which possesses thebanking licence. One leading UK banking analyst said the Sainsbury'smove was "one big step on from that".Tesco, which has recently taken over from Sainsbury as the UK's biggestsupermarket group, refused to say whether it would respond by settingup its own bank. "We do not comment on the activities of our rivals," aspokeswoman said.But other retailers have not discounted such a move. Kevin Hawkins,Safeway's head of communications, said: "We have not ruled out theprovision of financial services should it fit with our customerproposition."For some time now, UK banks have had problems with their public imageand are becoming increasingly concerned with the activities of the more"consumer-friendly" retailers. Bankers and analysts alike are promotingcollaborative joint ventures, like the Sainsbury venture, as the wayforward.Tony Surridge, head of co-branding at NatWest UK, who was behind thebank's joint venture with Tesco, said if the UK banks did not set upalliances with retailers, US credit card operators would. "We wouldrather be inside the goldfish bowl than looking in from outside," hesaid.Recently, British Gas, a major UK utility, and HFC Bank, a subsidiaryof the US Household Financial Corporation, teamed up to form GoldbrandDevelopment to manage its new Goldfish credit card. The Goldfish creditcard offers a loyalty point scheme whereby customers can save up to #75on their gas bills.British Gas and HFC said the Goldbrand joint venture company was aimingto"rewrite the rules in financial services".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The card isbeing offered to all Bangkok Life Assurance clients with individual orgroup life policies.The affinity card is being offered as a blue or gold proprietary card,and with classic and gold Visa card and standard and gold MasterCardoptions.The joining fee has been waived for applications before the end of theyear, as has half of the annual fee for the first year.Otherwise, joining fees are Bt300 and Bt400 for local blue and goldcards respectively and Bt600 for the international options. Full annualfees are Bt600 for the blue cards, Bt900 for the local gold cards,Bt1,000 for the classic/standard card and Bt1,500 for the internationalgold card.In April, Bangkok Bank launched a similar card with Bangkok Insuranceoffering two alternatives - Bt500,000 cover or Bt300,000 insuranceagainst death or illness at a monthly premium of Bt235 to Bt2,510 andBt140 to Bt1,506 respectively. The cover is limited to cancerdiagnosis, a disease which is one of the biggest killers of Thais.The scheme was targeted at all Bangkok Bank cardholders aged between 21and 59 years, although applicants were required to fill in a healthform.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

A little more than half of US consumerswho own a co-branded airline card say that owning the card influencestheir choice of carrier, according to a new study by BrittainAssociates, an Atlanta-based research firm."Airline frequent-flier programmes have a lot of appeal to a fairlynarrow segment, but it's a viciously loyal segment," principal BruceBrittain told Cards International.According to the study, about 6 percent of all US households claim toown a credit card that provides air travel rewards linked to cardusage. Of these programmes, ten are co-branded card issues bearingeither the MasterCard or Visa marque, along with a bank's. Four of theprogrammes generate points that can be redeemed for travel on anyairline."The majority of owners tell us that they use the card both for airfareand other purchases," Brittain said. "And compared to other co-brandedcards we study, airline card owners use these cards much morefrequently."It was such loyalty that American Express and Advanta hope to breakwith their Rewards Accelerator Card that enables users to earn pointson their Amex membership rewards programme through a bank card (seepages 1 and 6).Among the surprises in the study, Brittain said, was the rapid growthof the Delta SkyMiles Optima portfolio. "It's really vaulted up there,"he said, and now rivals United's programme. Amex was careful to forbidbalance transfer from any Optima card to the new Rewards Accelerator.Brittain added, however, that"the American Airlines AAdvantageportfolio with Citibank is still the 800lbs gorilla among theseprogrammes, with twice as much business as its nearest competitors."Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE LABEL CARD BULLETIN via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996SUIT FILED AGAINST VISAWAL-MART STORES, the world's largest retailer, and The Limited havefiled suit against Visa USA, charging that Visa's "honour all cards"policy regarding debit and cheque cards is illegal.Visa immediately responded in a statement saying it would fight thesuit.The court action alleges that Visa's rule that each of its merchantmembers accept all Visa cards, whether they be credit, online debit orcheque card instruments is in violation of US anti-trust laws.The suit hinges on the differing costs to retailers of processingVisa's online debit cards versus banks' ATM cards with debit functionsattached and routed over local POS networks. According to the suit, themerchants' profitability may erode when customers are allowed topresent online Visa debit cards.Visa, according to its statement, "will vigorously defend this actionand believe that we will prevail".The grounds on which it will defend itself hinge on two points,according to Stephen Theoharis, senior vice-president and director oflitigation with the card association.First, he said, Visa successfully defended itself against a similarsuit brought in 1983 by upscale retailer Nordstrom's. Second, itregards the "honour all cards rule" as fostering rather than stiflingcompetition worldwide."If I can go into one of 13 million establishments worldwide andpresent any Visa card for payment, we believe that encouragescompetition," he said.Regarding Visa's use of Nordstrom's precedent, the only differencebetween 1983 and 1996, Theoharis said, is the enormously-enhancednumber of debit cards, offline and online, in circulation."Clearly, the debit card has been embraced by consumers," Theoharissaid. "But the number of cards has nothing to do with the issuelegally." There are about 35 million offline, or "cheque" cardscurrently in circulation in the US.Theoharis added: "They seem to be arguing that the debit transaction beprocessed over regional POS networks. But what they don't seem tounderstand is that one half of the bank ATM cards that are also debitcards are Visa cheque cards.  "I think there is a misperception on Wal-Mart's part. We have no rules for routing transactions. The merchantsare free to route that transaction as they see fit."Curiously, MasterCard International, which has a similar rule, was notmentioned in the suit. Industry speculation centres on Wal-Mart'sreluctance to sue MasterCard, its partner in a recent agreement tooffer the retailer's first-ever co-branded credit card in associationwith Chase Manhattan and FDR.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE LABEL CARD BULLETIN via NewsNetNovember 1, 1996BRANDING MEANS BONDINGIn an increasingly-competitive cards market, a co-branding programmecan provide issuers with a keen edgeOVER THE past year co-branded and affinity products have outperformedall other card products in the market place. As competition becomesmore fierce and brand loyalty decreases, co-branding is taking on a newsignificance, Virlea Mays, president of the Mays Marketing Group tolddelegates at Lafferty's International Retail Financial ServicesConference for Southern Africa in October."If we want the customer to want, use and keep our products, the way westructure strategies and go to the market with our card products iscritical," she said."The credit card business is intensely competitive. It is expensive tomarket, especially in the US, and by combining the marketing resourcesand marketing expertise of two major organisations, you get moremuscle."Co-branding offers significant benefits and enhancements to bothparties. Marketing expertise is shared by the issuer and co-brander, asis the revenue.The co-brander is typically profit-driven and usually has a recognisedbrand or logo, merchant outlets and sales volume, often through aproprietary card. Solicitation is done primarily by or through the co-brander.But the co-branding process is fraught with difficulties. Finding theright partner and working out the relationship may seemstraightforward, but it is often not the case."The associations are important but the co-brand partner and the issuerare the most critical component. And as they develop the partnership,the most important thing is to define the contractual relationship andthe product and the value proposition of that product," said Mays.The partners must start with an equitable contract and establish mutualobjectives. The two sides should design the product, value propositionand packaging, and define credit approval criteria and credit limits.A marketing plan should be developed and quality service standardsdefined. While the ongoing relationship should be formalised, decision-making and conflict/resolution processes and a termination agreementshould also be defined. But for the issuer, negotiating revenue andexpense sharing details is crucial."The ability to forecast how the revenue is shared can make thedifference for the issuer in terms of complete and total profit andloss," explained Mays. "A lot of contracts were written so that theissuer ends up with all of the responsibility and takes the full bruntof the loss if the product fails or the programme simply doesn't work."The time spent developing the partnership and working on the contractis a key factor and one that is often overlooked, according to Mays."This is where the time needs to be taken and in most cases is not.Everybody is rushing to get to the market and the correct length oftime is often not taken in the development of the contract," she said.The length of the contract also has to be worked out and Mays adviseddelegates to settle for a contract of between seven and ten years."Nobody is down in the three-year range, except maybe some affinityprogrammes. There may be some five-year contracts out there, but thereis just too much riding on this, so contracts should be in theneighbourhood of seven to ten years," she said.When working out the rebate and reward structure, the co-brandingpartners should be careful to make the product easy for the customer tounderstand."Some rebate and reward structures work very well, some are way toocomplicated for a consumer to really get caught up in to use the card,"said Mays.She cited a survey conducted by Visa in the US where consumersindicated they wanted something that is simple and easy to use."We are all customers and we don't want a ten-page book to figure outhow to get our reward," she said. "We want reasonably easygratification and no tricks, no restrictions, no caps and no finepoints."The process is attempting to create a connection with the customer andcreate some sort of emotional connection, even if that emotion isgreed."When the product is designed, the next piece of the equation is todefine the marketing plan. This involves developing strategies for:* Acquisition - acquire new accounts and appeal to customers to wantthe card.* Activation - generate a balance and induce activity so the cardholderwill use the account.* Retention - become the "card of choice", so profitable customers keepaccounts."Many of the programmes designed in the US and in other parts of theworld, such as AT&T, do a great job in acquiring but they do not do thebest job possible at activation. The activation today in AT&T is stillonly about 49 percent and the industry average is 65 percent," saidMays.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

It is 78% owned by the Malaysian government.Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE PLACEMENT REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NEW YORK CITY PLANS TO SECURITIZE TAX LIENSThe nascent movement among municipalities to securitize delinquentproperty taxes took a major step forward last week when New York Citystepped into the fray, requesting proposals from investment banks on howbest to securitize $200 million to $250 million of tax liens. It would bethe biggest such securitization ever.     The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrearstotaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; andit is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the seniornotes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.     Although the document states that an objective is to complete thetransaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "prettytight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completionof any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment ofpending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is thecity's advisor.     A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pendinglegislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city asthe lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes whensomeone falls behind on their property taxes. The proposed issue will bebacked by the better-quality of these tax liens, mostly commercial realestate with a high likelihood of repayment.     One of the basic principles behind these transactions is that thepooled tax liens will eventually generate cash in one of three ways: theproperty owner will pay the back taxes, the bank will foreclose and pay theback taxes, or the municipality will itself foreclose and sell theproperty.     According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizationswill accomplish four things: to increase the cashflow from delinquent taxliens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need forthe city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.     "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficientmethod to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure processthe City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restorefairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improvecollection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieveupward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term saleprogram will be the initial securitization," the request for proposalstates.     The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike atraditional private placement, the issue will be fully underwritten by theinvestment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital willbe funneled into the city's operations fund.     The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was lastFriday, and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about twoweeks.     Which underwriters the city will choose is anyone's guess, but onequestion in the document does ask bankers to describe their experienceimplementing new products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list ofthose with specific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.     Most recent was Smith Barney, which priced a $19 million issue for theCity of New Haven, Conn., in the fall. The issue has a two-year average,seven-year final life, priced at 220 basis points off the curve, and had$25 million of collateral. Fitch Investors Service rated it BBB and ThePrincipal Finance Group scooped up the entire offering.     New Haven sold its liens into a trust, which then issued the taxablenotes. There will be no recourse to New Haven and in this way is similar toa deal in the fall of 1994 from Jersey City, N.J., which was agented by CSFirst Boston.     Other tax lien deals are due to follow soon. Breen Capital Group isabout to launch a $50 million securitization backed by a diverse pool oftax liens, culled from its own portfolio. The deal, which will be placed byBarclays de Zoete Wedd, is currently structured with a four-year final,two-year average life. The deal will likely be overcollateralized.     Price talk has not been heard yet, but because the portfolio is "hand-picked" and will not carry the concentration risk of a single-city deal,BZW will aim for a tighter spread than New Haven, a source said. Both Fitchand Standard & Poor's are expected to rate the transaction.     Meanwhile, Philadelphia is expected to make its securitization planspublic soon.

The company, considered a mid-BBB, is reportedly looking for 10- of12-year money in the form of senior unsecured notes. Price talk was 130over Treasurys. Bids were expected this week.     One investor expressed concern about the company's cyclicality, notingthat Elkem is coming off its best earnings in six or seven years. "I thinkit's on the fence between an NAIC-2 and 3," the investor said.     Last fall ABN-AMRO brought a $20 million deal from Elkem's U.S.subsidiary. Those senior notes, considered an NAIC-2, had a 10-year final,seven-year average life and priced at 125 off the curve.

The deal would be just the third under anew program by the International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank.     The deal comes on the heels of another IFC-linked deal. Just beforeChristmas, J.P. Morgan and ING Securities placed a $100 million issue withinstitutional investors for Grupo Industrial Bimbo, S.A. (Gibsa), whichowns a popular Mexican bread sold under the brand name Bimbo (PPR Nov. 13,p. 1).     Under the program, the IFC extends a loan to the company and keeps asmall portion for its own account. It then sells the remainder to aDelaware trust in form of participation interests subsequently issued toinvestors.     As a division of the World Bank, the IFC can ensure certain paymentguarantees that generally yield an investment grade rating.     Details about the Edelsur deal were sketchy at press time, but sourcessaid it was apparently divided into floating- and fixed-rated tranches thatwould be filled out according to demand. Price talk was reportedly Liborplus 200 for the floater and the equivalent spread for the fixed.     On the Gibsa transaction, more details were available. The 10-yearbullet priced at 305 off the curve and was popularly referred to byinvestors as the Bimbo deal. The structure did evolve somewhat since itfirst hit the market mid-November. At that time it had a 12-year final,seven-year average life and the notes were being talked at 275 to 285 offthe curve.     Gibsa, with sales last year of $1.25 billion, was founded in 1945 andmakes such products as breads, cakes, potato chips, and tortilla chips,among others. Besides a 90% market share in much of Mexico, the company hasplants in Argentina, Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador. It has also startedto make some acquisitions in the U.S. tortilla market.     A source pointed out that the company's distribution network is soextensive and well respected that Gibsa currently has a distributionagreement with Mars, and until recently also had one with Wrigley's.     The new program is part of the IFC's attempt to tap the U.S.institutional market -- such as insurance companies and pension funds.Back to Headline List CopyrightPRIVATE PLACEMENT REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996ABN-AMRO PAVES WAY FOR ROGERSABN-AMRO recently found circles for a $25 million issue from RogersGroup, one of the largest aggregate companies in the nation.

But is Enami's fate indicative of what willhappen to similar issues in 1996?     When Enami, Chile's second largest copper producer, hit the market inlate October, price talk was a tight 95 off the curve for the seven-yearpaper. But the BBB+ paper quickly widened to 120.     "The market was demanding much wider spreads than was initiallyanticipated," a source said.     Unfortunately for Enami, its entry into the market coincided with ageneral widening of emerging market spreads, particularly those "quasi"emerging markets whose sovereign rating is investment grade, such as Chile,Malaysia and the Czech Republic, sources said.     For instance, a recent public Chilean deal from Celulosa Arauco yConstitucion SA also had to swallow a wider spread than initiallyanticipated. An eight-year tranche that started at 80 over Treasurys gotdone at 105 and has since traded even wider.     "It's not a dramatic shift, and it's not just Chile, and it'll stillbe a good year," a source said. "But you'd expect it to be a runaway yearfor issuance given that long-term interest rates are at a 20-year low. Butwith banks so aggressive, I don't think you'll see the amount of issues inthe private market you might expect.

The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100 million offeringof 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis points overTreasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The notes,which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language, enablinga public-style execution of the offering without registration at theSecurities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted fromStandard & Poor's rating the issue just below investment grade, said AnnieAstor, chief financial officer.     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates inDecember, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank toissue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's firstindependent bond offering.     Jefferies & Co. captured the lead underwriting position on the dealbecause of its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney Inc. acted asco-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15 insurancecompanies.     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by the bank'sphenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had an averagereturn on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the bank'sinitial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated in valueby 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion assetbank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last year.     The deal for FirstBank follows a first-time subordinated offering byanother Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the month. BanPonceCorp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in 10-yearsubordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125million.

FOR SECURITIES (183 words) BRIEFS (793 words) CRA (741 words) FANNIE SET TO BOOST LOAN LIMIT (267 words) CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996NBD, 1ST CHICAGO EXPECT EASY COMPLIANCE MERGERThe fact that National Bank of Detroit and First Chicago both hadline management compliance systems before they merged Dec. 1 will ease thefuture merging of their compliance departments, NBD's general counsel toldRCW.        The compliance program at the new holding company, FirstChicago/NBD Corp., will probably be run in a similar way, Dan Lis said.Only the holding companies have currently merged; the only banks that willmerge are in Illinois--NBD Illinois and First National Bank of Chicago--which will merge at mid-year. At that time NBD will fold into FirstNational.        So far, the plan of how to structure the new compliance programhasn't yet gone to senior management or been implemented, but according tobank executives this is not a problem.        "There was no danger in not having a compliance program completelyset up in time for the merger, because our functions and the way the twobanks approached compliance were very similar," said Lis. "We will not haveany gaps in coverage because of this."        How to merge CRA functions, which are separate from compliance,also wasn't considered until after the merger. According to M. Chris Snow,NBD's CRA officer, before Dec. 1 the CRA department was just making sure itgot through the approval process, which included a couple of protests."When we sat down to combine our offices, we realized that our publicaffairs divisions both held CRA (departments), but were different in otherways," said Snow. "So far we've only had two meetings to integrate thedepartments."        Lis said that like the pre-merged institutions, First Chicago/NBDCorp. will probably have corporate compliance officers in each line ofmanufacturing business, who will have corporate-wide responsibility. Therewill probably also be distribution compliance officers in charge of eachstate, since each state operation serves as a distribution arm of productsand services, speculated Lis. Those officers will report to the bankpresident of that state.        Those officers, together with certain executive officers, includingthose of the law and auditing departments, will comprise a corporatecompliance committee. The auditing and law departments will serve assupport for the line management.        Lis said the manufacturing arms of the bank take up such retailbanking functions as mortgage, consumer banking, deposit services andmarketing. Distribution involves the sale of the bank's products.        "The most significant difference between the new compliancedepartment and the old ones is that before, at NBD, there was a singlecorporate compliance officer. Now we will use the corporate compliancecommittee structure, similar to the one First Chicago had," said Lis.        "There will also be some decrease in personnel due to redundancy asa result of the transition, not as a result of the new structure. Forexample, before we downsize there may be two lawyers who study the samereg, two compliance officers who monitor it, etc."        There won't be many problems combining the bank's CRA departmentseither, said Snow.        "Even though First Chicago was a larger bank, its market was smallcompared to ours, and its CRA was focused more in their public affairsgroup, out of their downtown Chicago office, since they didn't have manybranches," she said. "By contrast, NBD's CRA efforts were spread over fivestates, each with a state coordinator. Each state was also broken up intoregions, with a part-time regional person.        "I think we will move the centralized CRA to Chicago, like thecentralized lending analysis, since our corporate headquarters will bethere, and keep the information flowing back and forth from the regions,"Snow continued. "We still need to keep the regional efforts because theneeds of each state are different--CRA has to be much closer to thecustomer and geography. Before, we had to rely on a local person to tell uswhy a trend was the way it was, but the new reg lends itself more tocentralized data.        "Right now we're not worried about who will be in what job, butthat whatever data analyzer we purchase will be flexible enough to acceptdata from any operating system, be it consumer or commercial loaninformation. We'll have small business reporting from five different banks.        "Our CRA department is responsible for choosing the data baseanalyzer, and senior management and our technology task force is in chargeof hiring a geocoder and purchasing loan collection systems, sincemarketing will also use the information. We'll have some say in the latter,but not a lot of input."        "Then we'll make (CRA) lending decisions based on what the numberstell us. We would be doing the switch to data collection regardless, butthe merger will make the switch go faster, since we'll already be in achange mode."        "We might be hiring a couple of new people to do lending analysisfor the new CRA reg, the number will depend how much we can automate," saidSnow. "Our plan is not to grow our CRA department, since our CRA philosophyis to keep the authority with the local state bank president or regionaldirector. We hesitate to hire too many CRA people because it is too easy tooffload the responsibility to them."--Lisa TroshinskyBack to Headline List CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996LARGE BANKS FACE RISK-BASED EXAMSBy the end of the first quarter, large national banks can expect tobe examined against nine risk factors identified by the Office of theComptroller of the Currency.        The agency's new Supervision by Risk program, released Jan. 4 byway of its "Large Bank Supervision Handbook," is for national banks withtotal assets of at least $1 billion and for banks that are part of multi-bank holding companies with at least one bank with assets of $1 billion ormore.        Banks smaller than $1 billion in assets will be treated ascommunity banks and their new risk-focused exam guidelines are expected byJune.        Intending to help banks manage risk to capital and earnings,examiners will focus on credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, foreignexchange, transaction, compliance, strategic planning and reputation.Examiners will then put together a customer-tailored profile for each bank.        While the OCC has been examining banks based on a variety of risksfor several years, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said, the newhandbook marks the national standardization of this process.        "By delineating and defining each risk, bankers and examiners will,for the first time, be able to use the same terminology when discussingrisk-related issues, and examiners will be more consistent in theirapproach to similar institutions," said Ludwig.        Supervision by Risk, announced by Ludwig last September, will bepart of banks' annual on-site safety and soundness exams and might alsooccur throughout the year in various target examinations.        If a risk is identified as an unwarranted problem, banks will beexpected to take steps to correct the problem, and examiners will monitortheir progress.        The OCC has also provided a Risk Assessment System within thehandbook--a checklist within the nine risk categories, for banks' self-assessment regarding the quantity of risk, the quality of risk management,the level of supervisory concern, and the direction of risk.        Within each risk category, examiners will identify whether risk isincreasing, stable, or decreasing in each bank. The new handbook alsoemphasizes two-way communication about bank risk between bankers andexaminers.        According to the handbook, each bank's individualized riskmanagement program should include identification, measurement, control, andmonitoring of risks.        The OCC defines the nine risk categories as follows:         Credit: The risk from an obligor's failure to meet the terms ofany contract or fail to perform as agreed. Credit risk also arises inconjunction with selecting investment portfolio products, derivativestrading partners, or foreign exchange counterparties; through country orsovereign exposure; and through guarantor performance.         Interest Rate Risk: The risk from movements in interest rates.Should consider risk from both an accounting perspective (the effect on thebank's accrual earnings) and the economic perspective (the effect on themarket value of the bank's portfolio equity). In some banks, interest raterisk is captured under a broader category of market risk.         Liquidity Risk: The risk from a bank's inability to meet itsobligations when they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses.Includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in fundingsources; and the failure to address changes in market conditions thataffect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss invalue.         Price Risk: The risk from changes in the value of portfolios offinancial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, andposition-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, andcommodities markets.         Foreign Exchange Risk: The risk from movement of foreign exchangerates, found in cross-border investing and operating activities. Market-making and position-taking in foreign currencies should be captured underprice risk.         Transaction Risk: The risk from problems with service or productdelivery--a function of internal controls, information systems, employeeintegrity, and operating processes.         Compliance Risk: The risk from violations or non-conformance withlaws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards. Alsoarises in situations where the laws or rules governing bank activities maybe ambiguous or untested. Compliance risk exposes the bank to fines, civilmoney penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.         Strategic Risk: The risk from adverse business decisions orimproper implementation of those decisions. This risk focuses on more thanan analysis of the written strategic plan; it focuses on how plans,systems, and implementation affect the bank's franchise value.         Reputation Risk: The risk from negative public opinion, affectingthe bank's ability to establish new relationships or services, or continueservicing existing relationships. This risk can expose the bank tolitigation, financial loss, or damage to its reputation. Banks thatactively associate their name with products and services, such as withfiduciary services, are more likely to have higher reputation riskexposure.

Box 70004, Chicago, Ill. 70673-0004. oMortgage Reg OKs Endorsements        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity ConversionMortgage program can now process these loans without approval from thedepartment. HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approvedlenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its directendorsement program.        Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17, but the finalrule, which appears in the Federal Register, makes the change official; italso completes one of many streamlining procedures HUD has initiated overthe last several months.        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECMthat lenders haven't issued a conditional commitment for is eligible fordirect endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insuredbefore Sept. 15, 1995, must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUDoffice for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance. If HUDdeems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it will give thelender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE program. oFannie Joins Plan For American Indians        Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certainAmerican Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated withlending on tribal trust lands.        Starting in January, Fannie will begin taking part in the RuralHousing Service's Rural Housing Native American pilot, but will limit itsinitial participation to 10 tribes.        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they havea good working relationship with the Rural Housing Service and the Bureauof Indian Affairs, although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be addedlater in the pilot.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996FLORIDA TO REQUIRE CONTINUING ED.

Despite numerous complaints by community groups under the CommunityReinvestment Act, including two days of hearings in New York City inNovember, the Fed didn't include any conditions in its order, other thanrequiring the bank to fulfill an $18 billion CRA commitment it announcedlast fall.        The Fed said that both banks meet the credit needs of theircommunities, citing Chemical's lead bank's two consecutive "Outstanding"CRA grades and the Chase lead bank's recent "Satisfactory" ratings.        Activists were especially angry that the Fed didn't wait for theOCC to complete its CRA review of Chase before acting on the application.Instead, it relied on a 1993 exam.        The merger still has to be approved by the New York State BankingDepartment. oOCC To Relax RulesOn Community Work        The OCC has proposed streamlining its CRA regulations in order tospur more community investment by banks. Instead of the four-part test nowrequired of banks to prove that a community investment is in the publicinterest, the OCC would only require banks to self-certify that investmentswill benefit LMI families or small businesses.        The proposal is in the Dec. 28 Fed Register; comments are due bythe beginning of March.        "The proposed changes encourage national banks and community groupsto work together by allowing them the flexibility to determine how best tostructure their own partnerships in support of community development," saidComptroller Eugene A. Ludwig.        According to the OCC, national banks and their community partnershave invested a combined total of $2.16 billion in CDCs and communitydevelopment projects since December 1993, when the Community Developmentregulation was adopted.        The proposed revisions preserve the community development focus,but would:         Allow national banks greater flexibility to determine ifinvestments promote the public welfare by modifying the current publicwelfare test;         Retain the requirement that the investment primarily benefit LMIpersons, families, or small businesses, but make it clear that this benefitcan be provided in a variety of different ways;         Simplify the self-certification and prior approval processes byeliminating a current five-day OCC review period for investment proposalsthat the OCC has previously approved for another bank;         Eliminate the reg's list of eligible investment structures toallow bank management flexibility to determine appropriate structures forits investments.        Also, the OCC adopted a final rule Dec. 27 allowing banks toreinvest proceeds from these investments in any way they choose instead ofbeing required to reinvest in the community. oRegulators ClarifyCRA Transition        Federal banking regulators have clarified that once an institutionchooses or is forced to comply with the performance tests and standards ofthe new CRA, it must comply with all of the requirements of the new rule.(See Fed Register Dec. 20 and RCW Jan. 8 issue, p.2)        The regulators gave this example: Small institutions will beevaluated under the small bank performance standard beginning on Jan. 1,1996. But for examiners to properly evaluate a bank, the institution mustalso comply with other provisions of the new reg, including delineating anassessment area, maintaining a public file and providing proper publicnotice--requirements that don't under the transition rules, becomeapplicable until Jan. 1 or Jul 1, 1997.        In another example, if a large bank elects to be evaluated underthe lending, investment and service tests before being required to do so inJuly 1997, the bank would be required to comply on Jan. 1, 1996, with therule's other provisions.        The regulators also intend to provide banks with guidance on CRAstrategic plans--the types of information to include and when and where tofile the plans--and how to qualify for wholesale bank status. OTS, forexample, plans to issue a CEO letter in the near future. oManagement InterlocksChanges Proposed        The financial institution regulatory agencies published a proposedrule in the Federal Register Dec. 29 that revises their regulations onmanagement interlocks. Comments are due Feb. 27.        In order to remove unnecessary obstacles faced by small banksseeking to attract qualified management, the agencies propose to eliminatethe provision in the current rule that prohibits management interlocksbetween an institution under $20 million in assets and a bank with assetsof $20 million or more that are both located in the same MSA. This changeis intended to provide small banks with a larger pool of qualifiedcandidates for management positions.        The agencies aren't proposing any changes in the way the managementinterlocks regulation is applied to banks in the same community, a smallergeographic area than an MSA.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE WATCH via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996CRAFor December, the OCC gave these banks "Outstanding" scores:CALIFORNIA: Six Rivers National Bank, Eureka;

Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers toraise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effectJan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider theviews of its customers before rendering a decision, may make itsannouncement as soon as Jan. 15.        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last twoweeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and thepotential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fullydiscuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said thosedetails would be made available shortly.        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgagecompanies that have traditionally directed most of their business to FannieMae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to takeadvantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not returnrequests for comments.        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddieraised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the lastmonth, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over thechange in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knewthat to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting toFreddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't besurprised."Back to Headline List WT02-B39-25IA074-000493-B042-309http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi102.html 205.156.212.5 19970122011622 text/html 65737HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:14:22 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:31 GMTContent-length: 65550Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi102.html Sample Issue Copyright RETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNet January 9, 1996 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES 1996: YEAR OF THE US INVASION?

Increasingliberalisation of interstate branching laws also means that trulynational banks are emerging in that country - something beginning to bereflected in the marketing campaigns of major banks.State barriers have not proved an obstacle to the major credit cardbanks in the US, which have seen their sophisticated marketingtechniques rewarded by extraordinary returns in their home market.Latterly, these banks have become increasingly visible abroad,particularly in Europe, where the credit card market remains full ofpotential compared with the saturated US scene.While, in the short-term, some major conventional US banks may bepreoccupied with effecting mergers in their home market, theindications are that once the domestic scene has settled down they andother organisations will surely turn to foreign markets. Already namessuch as Citibank, Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch InternationalBank have accumulated substantial foreign business.US investment banks have for decades followed their corporate clientsabroad; 1996 may be the year when the revolution in delivery systemswill enable their retail brothers to begin to emulate them in selectedmarkets and sectors.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

NYCE'sannouncement in late December follows a year of new home bankinglaunches by some 30 large banks, most of which are using personalfinance manager home banking packages from Microsoft and Intuit as ahome banking interface. In addition, Chicago-based regional ATM networkCash Station has recently announced an outsourcing alliance withprocessor EDS for the provision of home banking services.NYCE, which is based in Hackensack, New Jersey, plans to build its ownhome banking processing platform within the NYCE processing system,which will support home banking and bill payment transactions conductedover touch-tone phones. Calling its approach "home banking `lite'",NYCE will offer a low-cost plain-vanilla home banking service forcustomers who do not need advanced graphical and consultative functionsthat PC personal finance manager (PFM) software packages now provide.But NYCE's system will also accommodate more sophisticated PFM- drivenhome banking programs now offered by many large US banks. NYCE alsoplans to pursue state-of-the-art home banking features, like electronicpresentment, which would allow utilities to deliver billselectronically, as well as alliances with other financial servicesproviders like insurance firms.NYCE's technical platform will be based on Tandem fault-tolerantprocessing hardware, similar to the system NYCE now uses to run itscore ATM and POS networks, which processed some 350 milliontransactions in 1995. Vicorp, a Connecticut-based technology provider,has already installed "device-independent" software that will manageinteractions, via telephone, screenphones, ATMs and PCs.The payments infrastructure and experience of regional networks likeNYCE may allow them to offer more cost-efficient services to smallerinstitutions, with start-up costs as low as $10,000. Intuit hasrecently announced its intention to team up with regional networks toprovide smaller institutions with affordable home banking services. Forits part, NYCE has begun negotiations intended to bring on otherregional networks as equity partners into its new home banking venture.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BANK INSURANCE REFORM STYMIEDAN IMPASSE over new bank insurance legislation has all but killedprospects for repeal in 1996 of the Glass Steagall Act, the legislationwhich imposed "fire walls" between the US commercial banking andsecurities industries in 1933. Although an agreement is still possible,repeated attempts to bridge the conflicting interests of the commercialbanking and insurance agents' lobbies failed in 1995, as they did in1991, leaving further deregulation of US bank insurance in theuncertain hands of courts and regulators. The result may be that, whilethe Supreme Court and the Office of the Controller of the Currency(OCC) may achieve some piecemeal deregulation of US bank insurance inthe next few years, US banks will still have to cope with a complex anddifficult regulatory climate.In December, House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach floated a newamendment that would strip the "retirement CD" of federal depositinsurance, which insurers are demanding, if they would agree to abideby the upcoming decision by the Supreme Court on the right of BarnettBanks to sell insurance nationally. If Barnett won, all banks would beable to follow its example, but if Barnett lost, Congress would imposea five-year moratorium on the expansion of US bank insurance powers.Both the American Bankers Association and the Independent InsuranceAgents of America opposed Leach's latest compromise.The Supreme Court's decision on Barnett - which is expected this spring- could lead to significant deregulation in its own right. The court iswidely expected to uphold Barnett's right to sell insurance nationallyfrom small towns of under 5,000, owing to a peculiar "small-townexemption" found in the US Banking Act of 1865. But US bank insurancewould still be regulated at the state level, where local insurancelobbies are extremely influential. A favourable Supreme Court decisioncould also spur the OCC to extend national bank insurance powers beyondannuities the OCC sanctioned in 1991, to life and other insuranceproducts.Largest US Retail Banks end of 1994 and 1995 (assets in $billions)end of 1994                       end of 1995 1.

The deals highlighted the rapidconsolidation of the US banking industry. Five years ago, five majorinstitutions vied for market share in New England, but today just twobanks dominate the region. Fleet and Bank of Boston now control a thirdof all deposits in New England, and account for 37 percent of depositsin Massachusetts and 55 percent in the Boston metropolitan area.The two deals brought the total value of 1995 US banking mergers andacquisitions to $73.2 billion, more than the totals for the threeprevious years combined, according to SNL Securities inCharlottesville, Virginia. As a result of 1995 merger activity, thecombined assets of the top 10 US retail banks increased 23 percent to$1.6 trillion (see chart). The top ten 1995 deals, which involved suchinstitutions as Chase Manhattan, First Union and First Chicago, werevalued at $47.5 billion, or nearly two- thirds the year's total.Analysts listed three developments which drove 1995's merger boom:national banking and branching legislation passed in 1994, flatindustry revenues which spurred large players to pursue technology-driven consolidation, and a bull stock market which boosted bank sharesand allowed banks to pay for acquisitions with their own stock. Allthree factors are still very much in force, and analysts expect bankmergers to continue, especially as large acquiring institutions likeNationsBank and Bank of America enter the merger arena.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

The deal will also balance the international businesses of Bankof Boston, a quarter of whose revenue now comes from volatile LatinAmerica, with an expanded US regional retail franchise.In an unusual move, all Bank of Boston retail branches will now use thename of BayBanks, which Bank of Boston chief executive Charles Giffordcalled "the top consumer bank in the country", while the holdingcompany, with its commercial and foreign subsidiaries, will use theBank of Boston name. BayBanks' chairman, William Crozier, will becomeBank of Boston's chairman and will continue to direct retail operationsuntil his retirement in 1998, while Gifford will become chief executiveof the new institution.Bank of Boston said that the acquisition, which is priced at 2.2 timesBayBanks' book value, will save $190 million in expenses, or 11 percentof the two banks' combined cost base. Bank of Boston, which will take aone-time restructuring charge of $140 million, expects to see $50million in additional annual revenue, or 7.7 percent of currentearnings, after 18 months. The merger will eliminate some 2,000 jobs,or 8 percent of the banks' combined work force, half by attrition andhalf by lay-offs.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

While manyanalysts praised the deal's geographic logic and its low price of 1.1times book value, others questioned Fleet's ability to absorb NatWestfollowing its acquisition in early 1995 of Shawmut National and its $36billion in assets (see RBI 321). Fleet will now become the ninth-largest US commercial bank with $90 billion in assets.National Westminster had originally put its US unit up for auction inSeptember, asking $4 billion in cash, a difficult hurdle for US banks,which almost always finance large acquisitions with stock. Fleet solvedthis problem with an unusual deal structure: Fleet will pay $2.7billion in cash up front, and another $560 million in "earn-out" fromNatWest New York's revenues over the next eight years. Fleet will alsoissue $600 million in preferred stock, half of which will go toNational Westminster, and $400 million in debt securities.The deal marks the end of National Westminster's 25-year attempt toestablish a beachhead in the volatile US banking market. Before thedeal, NatWest Bancorp had become the largest foreign- owned commercialbank in the US, with $31.1 billion in assets ($13 billion of which willbe sold by Fleet to finance the acquisition). But the bank failed tocreate sufficient scale, and blundered into buying several New Jerseybanks before the US real estate market collapse in the early 1990s.National Westminster ended by spending a total of $3.3 billion buyingits US franchise and then bailing out its loan losses. NationalWestminster is expected to use the cash from the sale to acquire a USasset management firm.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BRANCHES STILL PROVIDE MOST REVENUENEW RESEARCH by First Manhattan Consulting Group suggests that most USretail banking profits come from customers who do all their business atbranches and that retail customers who rely exclusively or primarily onremote delivery still represent a small, if strategically significant,segment.Culling data from five major US retail institutions, First Manhattanfound that 40 percent of retail customers rely exclusively on branches,48 percent use branches and self-service systems, 8 percent usebranches for deposits only, 2 percent use mostly self-service, and theremaining 2 percent conduct all business through remote deliverysystems.But the 40 percent who only use branches contribute 60 percent ofretail earnings, while the 10 percent who use self-service except fordeposits contribute 20 percent of profits. The "mixed channel users"are the least profitable group, representing 50 percent of all retailaccounts but only 20 percent of retail profits."We had better be careful in any attempts to radically downsize thebranch system," First Manhattan president James McCormick told anaudience of retail bankers at the recent Retail Delivery Systemsconference in Atlanta. The branch system continues to offer commercialbanks a strategic stronghold in their struggle against non-banks, hesaid.McCormick noted that "mixed-channel" users are the toughest to serveprofitably, and that the best solution is to push these customerstoward remote systems in a way that assures that"self- servicesubstitutes for branches, not complements them". A number of USinstitutions, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Keycorp, havepursued this goal by offering low-cost ATM accounts to customers whoagree to use only remote media for routine transactions. But McCormicksaid this approach should be evaluated carefully, lest banks forfeitvaluable transaction revenue.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996THE BENCHMARKING IMPERATIVERichard McManus explains the rationale behind benchmarking and suggeststhat bankers have much to learn from both within and outside theirindustryRETAIL BANKS facing increased competition from both traditional and newrivals are looking for methods to improve the value proposition thatthey present to current and prospective customers. As competitionratchets up those that do not keep pace are doomed. Discriminatingcustomers will take flight, opting for providers that devise productand service combinations which more closely match requirements.In an increasingly competitive environment it is crucial to have aclear vision of the future and a sure touch in managing change.Benchmarking can help in both regards if it is properly undertaken.It helps an organisation shape its future strategy and build necessarycapabilities on the basis of an understanding of what has worked forother successful organisations. It involves learning from theexperience of others, rather than solely by doing and making one's ownmistakes.`Piggy-backing' on the success of others makes particular sense whenagility gives an edge in the marketplace. Customers spoilt for choiceare demanding, and winning their support is the aim of each marketparticipant. But with the pace of change increasing `time-to-market'also matters. And to create motivating customer propositions morequickly there is merit in systematically trawling for best practiceboth within and outside the financial services sector.Benchmarking can support step-change improvements in the customer valueproposition. One of the most significant barriers to innovation is pastsuccess. This gives rise to organisational arrogance which takes theform "we always do things in such and such a way" or "we know best".Innovative ideas may be dismissed with an assertion that currentsuccess confirms there is no need to change. Or, equally, inflexibleemployees may suggest a new approach `invented elsewhere' simply willnot work.Benchmarking, at the activity level, can highlight organisationalarrogance. But, at the same time, it can kick-start innovation bygenerating concrete examples of best practice. Such examples showinnovation to be the prerequisite of survival rather than unnecessaryor infeasible.Retail banks committed to learning from others can look for creativeapproaches which build customer value advantages vis-a- vis competitionwithout sacrificing speed. The senior management team, armed with anacute appreciation of evolving customer needs and changing competitorcapabilities, should seek out proven approaches which can be adapted.The customer-driven retail bank cannot afford either to stand still orwaste time re-inventing the wheel.Inevitable popularityIt is not surprising that businesses `catch the benchmarking bug' incompetitive marketplaces. In essence, properly undertaken benchmarkinggives senior management the wherewithal to overcome organisationalinertia. It entails the adaptation of demonstrable success to sustain acustomer proposition which is preferred over and above the alternativesoffered by local competition. It generates information which helpsmanagement improve customer value and create defensible advantage.Benchmarking output is, therefore, an essential raw material ofsuccessful competitive strategy. And in an increasingly internationalmarketplace the scope of a benchmarking study must be global.In Strategic Benchmarking, Gregory Watson has charted the evolution ofbenchmarking as a developing science. He argues that there are fivegenerations.In the `first generation' it is nothing more than reverse engineering.This reflects the fact that benchmarking became popular initially inthe fields of civil engineering and computer hardware and software. Thechallenge was to better the functionality offered by a competitorproduct.In the `second generation' `competitive benchmarking' involves movingbeyond product-oriented examples to include comparisons of theprocesses that lie behind the products. The point is that a successfulcompetitor needs to know both what the market requires and how toprovide it cost effectively.In the `third generation' `process benchmarking' represents a naturalprogression. Enlightened organisations come to realise that the how isoften more important than the what. Product innovation can givecompetitive advantage but this can be easily and rapidly copied. But itis often far more difficult to identify and replicate the processeswhich the innovator has pioneered. These processes are not in thepublic domain.In the `third generation' Watson asserts "quality leaders recognisedthat they could learn more easily from companies outside their industrythan from competitive studies".There are two reasons for this claim. The first is that it is oftendifficult to share information within an industry without promptingconcerns over anti-competitive behaviour or stalemate competition. Thesecond is that information from outside an industry often provides moreinsight because it forces management to think from first principlesrather than implement incremental improvements. In summary, thoselooking outside their immediate industry can expect a willingness toshare information and a freshness of view.In the `fourth generation' `strategic benchmarking' represents afurther increase in sophistication. Watson suggests it is"a systematicprocess for evaluating alternatives, implementing strategies andimproving performance by understanding and adapting strategies fromexternal partners who participate in an ongoing business alliance".In essence, it involves a commitment to learn how the business can bere-engineered to support better customer value propositions. It entailsroot and branch change rather than minor improvement and, as a result,it is likely to give a competitive edge.Watson argues that the `fifth generation' will be `globalbenchmarking'. This will entail businesses scouring the world for bestpractices which can valuably be applied to improve their own customervalue propositions. Leading-edge businesses already adopt thisapproach.In planning a global consumer financial services strategy a few yearsago, GE Capital decided to benchmark (among others) American Express,Citicorp, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, MasterCard, Barclays Bank and AIG. Thepoint is that a parochial perspective leaves an institution vulnerable.It is ill-prepared for competition from powerful traditional and non-traditional rivals in other geographic areas.The popularity of benchmarking today probably in part reflects the wayin which this practice has evolved. In Watson's `first generation' itrepresents nothing more than straightforward competitor analysis. Andno business in a competitive marketplace can argue against this.But by the `fifth generation' benchmarking has become something quitedifferent. It is all about trawling internationally to establish whichbest practices will underpin motivating customer propositions. It takesaccount of the fact that customers are the arbiters of commercialsuccess. And it recognises that a parochial orientation will not promptnecessary innovation.In spite of the way in which benchmarking has evolved, however, therecan be no doubt that even institutions new to the practice need to cometo terms with the fifth generation. It is futile to plan a gradualmigration from first to fifth generation behaviour. An institutionfollowing this course in a competitive market will not survive longenough to complete it.Activities and ProcessesBenchmarking is predicated upon the notion that all businesses,including the retail banking business, can be broken down into a seriesof activities and processes. This is significant for two reasons. Thefirst is that some activities and processes, are more important thanothers. The second is that comparative measurement both within andoutside an industry sector is possible at this level.The critical activities and processes are those that add most customervalue. Superiority in undertaking these will lead to significantcomparative advantage in a competitive marketplace. And an organisationlearning from international best practice at the activity and processlevel will be capable of world class performance.So what are the activities and processes that make up the retailbanking business? One possible diagrammatic representation of theactivities is shown in Figure 2. But the processes that lie behindthese activities are necessarily in a state of flux as customers'tastes change, new technology becomes available and competitorinnovation makes an impact.In the product management area, for example, design and packaging usedto be all that was required. When a competitor came out with a newproduct that met with success in the marketplace others moved quicklyto copy it. But this is where the problem lies.It is impossible to build a worthwhile advantage vis-a-vis competitionwhen emulation is relatively easy. And, to use Watson's terminology, asfirst and second generation benchmarking became prevalent, productmanagement needed to evolve. It is now more a question of targetingparticular customer segments by devising a suitable mix of products.The optimum mix reflects the long-term mission of a retail bank ratherthan the recent market success of a local rival. This is importantbecause it demonstrates that a product range which suits oneinstitution may be completely inappropriate for another which has adifferent customer focus. And as the European enthusiasm for allfinanzspreads throughout the world it is wise to question whether it isnecessary to add insurance to traditional retail banking products.The answer depends on the customer focus and whether the retail bankcommitted to allfinanz is in the vanguard or merely copying successfullocal rivals.In essence, some but not all customers will buy a comprehensive rangeof financial products from one supplier because they lack theconfidence or inclination to shop around. And allfinanz first-moverswill tend to win these customers leaving late converts with theunenviable task of trying to change the buying behaviour of othercustomer segments.Against this backdrop, it must be wise to benchmark product managementin allfinanz first-movers and to review critically the market responseto late converts.So much for product management. The marketing and sales activity issimilarly in a state of flux. In the past, this required little morethan some corporate image work and the dissemination of productinformation. But enlightened retail banks are now making sure theirmarketeers focus on building meaningful customer brands.As previous issues of CEO Confidential have argued this involvespositioning products and services in such a way as to ensure they arepreferred by customers. Effective brands improve profitability becausethe associated benefits of increased market share or superior pricerealisation outweigh the costs of brand creation. It is worth notingthat the most profitable retail banks often achieve this position bycharging high prices. This may reflect an uncompetitive market or themarketeers earning their keep.It seems that marketing and sales will be more about sophisticatedcustomer segmentation and carefully tailored communication in thefuture. The segmentation will compartmentalise customers on the basisof buying behaviour and motivation.It is possible to address such coherent groups in a persuasive waybecause they act and think alike. The marketing and sales initiativeswhich result from this approach are a far cry from the generalcorporate positioning statements on which too many retail bankscurrently rely.When it comes to benchmarking there is no shortage of organisationsthat are committed to sophisticated customer segmentation and theassociated tailored communication. In the finance sector, the creditcard companies embracing affinity group marketing lead the way. But theairline and automotive industries, among others, can also providevaluable insights.Distribution management is probably one of the most critical activitiesfor retail banks today. This reflects the fact that convenience sooften underpins the financial institution selection decision. Andconvenience implies ease of access.In the past, retail banks with a comprehensive branch network werepreferred because branch-based distribution was the norm. Wherealternatives existed either few customer were aware of them or mostwere disinclined to use them. But this is all changing.Direct delivery channels, particularly those using the conventionalphone, are in the ascendancy. And, as traditional retail banks launchtheir telephone banking operations, they legitimise and promote thischange in delivery emphasis. This is all well and good but, in a sense,retail banks with extensive branch networks are playing into the handsof non-bank rivals without a bricks and mortar heritage.This is not to say that turning one's back on direct delivery is arational choice. But the key distribution management issue facingtraditional retail banks is how to ensure a smooth transition from thedelivery emphasis of the past to that suitable in the future.The critical concern for the branch-reliant is how to achieve a highbranch utilisation while focusing attention on new delivery channels.Natural pressure to justify the overhead of new delivery channels canlead to existing customers being encouraged to migrate from branchdelivery. As a result, an unchanged branch overhead becomes moreburdensome. New efficient costs are overlaid on inefficient costs. Butthe net result is a worsening cost position, particularly whencannibalisation is the norm and, therefore, capacity utilisation ineach channel is poor.Against this backdrop it is wise to benchmark those institutions thatprove themselves skilful in both managing capacity utilisation andmatching delivery channel to customer segment.Wells Fargo is an example in the finance sector of a retail bank thathas become more reliant on ATMs and supermarket branches without beingencumbered with the costs of the traditional branch network. But thereare also lessons from other retail businesses.Some department stores have embraced the shop-within-a-shop conceptwhere concessions are given to specialist retailers in order to bolstersales per outlet. Other retailers have built complementary mail orderbusinesses without wholesale outlet closure. And there are examples inthe restaurant and leisure business of one operator running competingconcepts with distinct delivery formats.In the finance sector it is wrong to think about delivery as beingcompletely separate from the product proposition. Quite the reverse isthe case. There must be a fit between the customer segments, theproduct and the delivery channel. But the same is true for other retailconcepts that seek to build a brand image.The delivery approach is an integral part of the brand. And more andmore retail banks will come to realise that different delivery channelsare best targeted at different customer segments.In the long term, it is probable that many will seek to make differentproduct and delivery combinations into distinct brands. They willfollow a trail blazed by businesses in other sectors and as a resultbenchmarking will help.In the customer service area the transition which will be important formost retail banks is from uniform service to customised service. Theemphasis in recent years has been upon introducing and policing higherservice standards. Many banks have recognised that failing to make thegrade in customer service is an unforgivable failing in the servicebusiness. But the desire to improve service has led to inflexible andsometimes inappropriate standards. Service means different things todifferent people and, worse still, it means different things atdifferent times.Bearing in mind this and the cost of service provision the astuteretail bank will strive to match service performance to the customerand the occasion. Those adopting this approach are treating customerservice as a profit rather than a cost centre.From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that in the financialservices sector the direct providers will make the running. They areable to make the notion of the `segment of one' an operational reality.But outside financial services there will be valuable lessons from thehotel, airline and restaurant business. Each of these grapple with theproblem of treating different customers in different ways within thesame delivery channel. And each suffer from the difficulty faced byretail banks where the delivery channel is an integral part of theoverall proposition.In processing and administration the retail bank emphasis is going toshift away from securing back-office efficiency towards tasks whichimprove customer information and facilitate risk management. It is notthat efficiency is a bad thing. It is a prerequisite, but it is alsoinsufficient for success.The challenge facing retail banks is not only to do things efficientlybut to do the right things. And the learning organisation realises thatday-to-day interactions with existing customers can provide a wealth ofinformation to help in customer retention and customer acquisitioninitiatives.Not to put too fine a point on it, failure to build a `feedback loop'from arrears management to marketing is pure folly unless the aim is tokeep the arrears department busy!From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that the credit cardcompanies will pioneer state-of-art processing and administration inthe finance sector. They already ensure that prospective profitabilitydrives marketing initiatives and they are sophisticated in riskmanagement.But outside the finance sector there will be valuable lessons to belearned from direct response marketing companies and the mail orderindustry. And it is possible that government bureaucracies facingpressures to cut costs may also give some pointers to retail banks. Inmany countries the tax authorities, for example, have simplifiedadministrative tasks and shifted much of the burden onto their clients.Those embarking on re-engineering of the back-office should take note.In customer information the retail bank emphasis is going to be upongarnering the information which is necessary for customer segmentationand marketing purposes. This will certainly represent far more thanbasic demographic information and details on who holds which products.Information will include the kind of data which enables a retail bankto cluster customers into groups which are homogenous both in terms ofproducts purchased and motivating factors. And it will involve anassessment of profitability by customer and segment.The key point is that it is such customer information which will helpsenior management determine the long-term strategy for the retail bank.As a result, customer information helps shape the other activitieswhich make up the retail bank and redefine the important processes. Incompany jargon, the organisation becomes customer-driven.From a benchmarking point of view retail banks and credit cardcompanies that have got to the bottom of customer profitability will bewell worth studying. And, as with processing and administration, directresponse marketing companies and the mail order industry will providesome pointers.In conclusionBenchmarking on a global basis provides valuable input to the strategyformulation process. It is not done once and for all but should ratherbe a continuous process. This reflects the fact that rivals willundoubtedly copy success.A key task for senior management is to set for the organisationchallenging objectives that stand the test of time. This involvesstriving for superiority and not purely in those activities andprocesses which have the greatest impact upon customer value. Theemphasis selected will reflect the customer focus, the organisationalheritage and the anticipated competitor approach. The benchmarkingquestions to be answered are quite simply:What do we benchmark?  Who do we benchmark?  How do we act on the basisof benchmarking insight in our organisation?Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Over the pastten years the economy has sustained annual GDP growth of 6 percent.The main consequence of this - the colony's 6 million people growingever wealthier and more middle class - has proved a rich seam for HongKong's retail banks.These banks, which make up around 30 of the 180 licensed banks in HongKong, have enjoyed levels of profitability which their westerncounterparts could only dream of.Banking profits have been sustained even against a background of zeroreal interest rates (the prime rate of 9 percent remains identical tolast year's annual inflation) and narrow spreads.But as 1997 looms large, uncertainty over Chinese intentions is havinga damaging and uncertain effect on the market. A report to be publishedlater this month by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts thatgrowth will fall dramatically from 4.5 percent in 1995 to 3.5 percentthis year and just 1.7 percent in 1997.This could prove damaging for retail banks which, so far, have managedto avoid large-scale branch closures and panic consolidation which nowso pre-occupies western banks. It may also bring with it bad customers - a rarity in Hong Kong where getting into financial difficultiesinvolves Chinese "loss of face".Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of Hang Seng Bank, thesecond largest locally incorporated bank with 138 branches, recognisesthe problem."The general impression in Hong Kong is that the industry is confrontedby a less favourable trading environment," he says. "The feeling isthat a period of high growth has passed and that a period ofconsolidation will follow. But let's not forget that, although growthmay be slowing in the industry, banks in Hong Kong are still among themost profitable in the world."If ever the idea meeteth the man then retail banking and the people ofHong Kong are one of life's happy coincidences. Unlike in the west,where single bank relationships are the norm, Hong Kong residents haveon average 2.4 accounts in 1.9 banks. This is a territory in which evenlittle old ladies play the currency markets with their nest egg andexpect their bank to provide them with foreign exchange depositaccounts with which they can swap currencies at a whim.Another headache for the banks is the almost frenetic use of the systemby individual customers. The Hongkong Bank estimates its customersinteract with it on average an astonishing 16 times a month.The precise size of the retail banking market is difficult to gauge,but $HK 2.1 trillion ($290 billion) is held as deposits with licensedbanks of which savings deposits comprise $HK 418 billion and currentaccounts just $HK 115 billion.Current accounts play a relatively insignificant role in Hong Kongretail banking with banks regarding deposit accounts and mortgages asthe core product on which to initiate a relationship with a customer.The newspapers, both Chinese and English, are full of advertisementsfor the latest interest rates on deposit account and mortgage products."What you want is someone to come in and take a mortgage from you. Youhave then got them for at least nine or ten years," says David K.P. Li,deputy chairman and chief executive of the Bank of East Asia."They would typically be a young couple in their late 20s or early 30sborrowing between $HK1.5 million and $HK1.8 million to buy a 900 squarefoot apartment, the repayments on which would set them back around 60percent of their income. You can then sell them decoration loans,credit cars, overdrafts and help them with hire purchase for a car," headds.Ironically, in a city brimming with local entrepreneurial talent, themain product innovators in Hong Kong retail banking are the foreignbanks.Inextricably linked to the colony, Hongkong Bank and Standard Charteredwear thin the definition of foreign, but they dominate the market alongwith Citibank and the Hang Seng Bank, the latter part of the HongkongBank since the mid-1960s but separately listed and, perhaps to a lesserdegree, the Bank of East Asia.They have led the way with smart cards, foreign currency depositaccounts (targeted at mid-range customers in Hong Kong) and tax loans,a very popular product in a territory where there is no PAYE.This is something readily conceded by smaller local banks such as theDah Sing Bank, a traditional trade finance bank which only moved intoretail in the last few years."Basically, I would agree that the bigger foreign banks have dominatedthe market. It has been difficult for the smaller banks because of lackof resources and the cost of technology, but I sense that things arebeginning to change," says Derek Wong, Dah Sing's head of retail.A yet to be proven catalyst to greater competition could be the slowbut still partial demise of the Hong Kong interest rate cartel whichbegan two years ago.Under the cartel, all deposit interest rates used to be fixed weekly bythe Hong Kong Association of Banks. In October 1994 time deposits fixedfor more than one month were deregulated and in January last year itwas left to individual banks to set their rates for deposits over sevendays.The larger banks remain unhappy about the break-up. According to recentanalysis, it has led to a 5 percent drop in deposits as a result offalling interest rates.Hang Seng's Au is worried it has created another uncertainty in the run-up to 1997. "Although the industry is not against deregulation there isa concern it has affected bank profitability and that some banks maycompensate by writing more risky loans," he says.The smaller players believe it has brought much needed competition tothe market, allowing them to buy market share by setting their owninterest rates."The status quo ante made no sense really. Deregulation offers moreopportunity to the medium-sized banks. We can offer lower interestrates as a way of competing against the bigger players. I believe wecan also react faster than the local banks," says Sergio Rial, theBrazilian general manager of Dutch bank ABN AMRO in Hong Kong.Western banks have a lot to learn from the luxurious and airy design ofmany of the branches in Hong Kong. In a place where land is moreexpensive than anywhere else in the world there is no point in buildinga shed. Customers too are treated with great courtesy in the banks,something not typical in the retail business across the whole of HongKong."In the UK if you go into a branch to make a transaction, say deposit acheque, all you will get is a stamped stub. It astonishes me how peoplewill deposit large sums of money and virtually have no proof of doingso. In Hong Kong, the customer will get a printed out receipt preciselyrecording the transaction," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail,marketing and planning, Hongkong Bank.The ATM is king in Hong Kong with many more machines per 10,000 of thepopulation than in the US or the UK. You cannot, in fact, pass an ATMin Hong Kong without seeing a large gathering of people, many seeminglynot queuing to use it, but perhaps taking time out to worship Mammon,surely Hong Kong's truest god. Customers not only draw money out atATMs but also pay their utility bills with the use of a swipe card.The love of gadgetry of all kinds would seemingly make Hong Kong ripefor a direct banking revolution. The fall-off in economic growth wouldalso seem to necessitate that the banks move faster towards automationin order to cut costs and retain profit margins. Yet Hong Kong's movestowards direct delivery are perhaps more primitive than their westerncounterparts.The leading banks have offered telephone banking since 1990 but it isstill very much an in-branch service. The nearest one gets to a UK-style First Direct operation is a voice response computer at the otherend of the line.A key reason why the direct banking has not swept the colony is theproblem of getting phone operatives in a land of virtually fullemployment.As Sergio Rial of ABN AMRO explains: "The real barrier to telephonebanking developing in Hong Kong is that professional people don't wantto sit behind a phone all day and in this place they have a right tochoose. Skilled people want to do creative jobs, not pay people'sutility bills and check passwords," he says. "It is one of those thingsthat has not really caught on and it is presenting real difficultiesfor the banks."I think what will happen here is that there will be a sudden quantumleap from ordinary branch banking to PC home-based banking, largely by-passing the telephone banking stage. This will satisfy the enthusiasmfor gadgetry among Hong Kong people and solve the cost headache for thebanks."Citibank insists its telephone banking operation has been a successwith its customers. "We have achieved 90 percent satisfaction from ourcustomers compared to 82 percent from our normal branch bankingbusiness," says Peter Wong, the bank's vice president of globalconsumer banking in Hong Kong.Many of the banks have not as yet embarked on major branch closureprogrammes. Hongkong Bank has closed just 20 in the last two yearsbringing its total down to 220; the Dah Sing Bank has reduced itsnumber over the same period from 53 to 43; Citibank has closed mainlysmaller branches, and most of the other banks have only made limitedcutbacks.There have, however, been moves to segment the market by developingspecific branches for different categories of customers.The most marked move in this direction has come from the Hongkong Bank,which now has three different types of branches - select branches forupmarket customers, standard branches for regular customers and day andnight automated branches."Competition for profitable retail customers in the territory hasrarely been keener. We have responded by introducing a strategy thatinvolves segmenting the way we serve the market," says Hongkong's EricTai. "The select branches will guarantee that we can provide our valuedupmarket customers with the highest quality of service."The Bank of East Asia services its upmarket customers by deliveringservices direct to a customer's office or home. "It is a far moresubtle way of dealing with major clients and, I believe, just aseffective," says Dr Li.One of the most controversial aspects of banking in Hong Kong is thestranglehold the larger banks have over the Hong Kong Association ofBanks (HKAB).It is chaired in rotation by Standard Chartered, Hongkong Bank and nowthe Bank of China (which began its first term of office this year).Many other banks have restricted rights of membership to its committeeand yet the HKAB is all powerful, still setting regulated interestrates, policing the system and acting as a clearing house.The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the supposed central bank, does noteven issue notes (still done by the major banks) and is not even abanker to the Government.Dr Li, who apart from running the Bank of East Asia is the solefinancial institution representative on the colony's main law makingbody, the Legislative Council or Legco, insists the system must change."The whole system is very colonial. It is what Singapore was like 45years ago. The Hong Kong Association of Banks is an old boys' club withthe chairmanship running between three banks," he says. "The GovernorChris Patten talks about democracy, but we have one of the mostundemocratic institutions on our own doorstep. The whole systemencourages `yes' people. I certainly thought the cartel worked againstthe interests of the consumer."It is a view echoed by Peter Wong, banking director of Citibank, whichdoes not always get its own seat on the HKBA committee: "It is not alevel playing field. The HKBA should incorporate more players so theflow of information can be better."Li also insists that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation isstill the lender of last resort and, as such, exerts too much controlover the system. He wants the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to assumethat role officially."The colony must have an official lender of last resort. At present,the smaller banks may have a credit line of say $HK30 million from theHongkong Bank and if it exceeds that it may get charged 3 percent aboveprime which is very steep," he says.Hong Kong unlike other banking centres has not yet seen a period ofmajor consolidation between banks.The main highlights have been the purchase by the Dah Sing Bank of theHong Kong Industrial and Commercial Bank from the Hong Kong governmentand then three years ago its acquisition of the Wingon bank from theHang Seng Bank. The Dao Heng, the third largest local bank, bought theHang Lung Bank in 1989 and the Overseas Trust Bank in 1993.Opinion is divided as to whether harsher economic conditions will leadto a spate of more substantial mergers. Dr Li again: "I think consolidation will come. I think there are twoor three banks here that would benefit from merger, although I believethere is a cultural resistance to it. A lot of the local banks arefamily controlled and Chinese people don't like to lose face by seeingtheir family's heritage being taken over."Banks, which have stayed clear of retail for generations, are nowmoving into the market.The Dah Sing Bank, traditionally a trade finance bank, has come up withsome of the most aggressive retail products in the marketplace.One is a credit card which has a generous cash bonus point scheme thateffectively reduces the monthly rate of interest on borrowings to 1.5percent, significantly less than the 2 percent to 2.5 percent marketaverage.Competitors say the card has flopped and is losing money, somethingwhich Derek Wong head of retail denies. "We have built up a lot ofbusiness over the past 18 months with this card. We had a lot ofinitial free advertising because it was such a revolutionary newproduct," he says.ABN AMRO, one of the oldest established international banks in HongKong, has also been a late entrant to retail, although it is perhapsthe first non-British European bank to do so. It has also gone in hardon price undercutting other banks, particularly in mortgages.General manager Rial insists the strategy has worked, claiming thatretail banking had grown from nil to 30 percent of profits of the bankin Hong Kong in three years: "It has proved to be a very good move. Wehave a leaner structure than many of the other banks and we do not havethe costs of a large staff branch network. We are also an AA bank, sowe can fund ourselves better than many of our competitors," he says.But the biggest issue in Hong Kong retail banking as in the colony as awhole has to be 1997. It creates an uncertainty that perhaps only afinancial centre as strong as Hong Kong could withstand. There is afeeling in the banking community that those who were going to leavehave left and that capital outflows over the coming 18 months will notbe that significant."The current situation is no good for business. The name- callingbetween the various political interest groups only makes peoplenervous. It will be better when the 1997 deadline passes," saysRandolph Sullivan, managing director, Dao Heng Bank.And ABN AMRO's Rial believes stories of Hong Kong's death as afinancial centre have been greatly exaggerated."Shanghai will notreplace Hong Kong as a regional financial centre in my lifetime atleast. To be a financial centre, the market has to accept that you area financial centre and whole infrastructure and framework has to bethere. Hong Kong will continue to be pivotal in Asia," he adds.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.  All rights reservedBack to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL BANKER INTERNATIONAL via NewsNetJanuary 9, 1996BANKING ON THE LONG HAULEric Tai, senior executive, retail marketing and planning with HongkongBank speaks to Andrew MoodyERIC TAI is senior executive, retail, marketing and planning forHongkong Bank, the leading international bank in Asia outside of Japan.It has 500 offices in 19 countries in Asia and boasts one of thelargest global proprietary ATM networks in the world with 170,000machines. The bank's earnings have expanded by a compound rate of 22percent over the past 25 years. Tai began his career in insurance andhad a spell working for Commercial Union in the UK. Before joiningHongkong Bank, he worked for Citibank and ANZ.RBI: Retail banking margins in many countries in the west are now verynarrow and there are pressures to cross-sell higher margin products.Are there similar pressures in Hong Kong?Eric Tai: Retail banking is more profitable in Hong Kong than in theUK, for example, on virtually every ratio you want to talk about. Thisis partly to do with serving a smaller geographical area and havingcustomers with a higher savings ratio, around 30 percent compared to 9percent in the UK. This means you can do things in a more costeffective way without the same pressures to cross-sell.But although we are not driven to sell other products to supplement ourretail banking income we do so because people want to buy theseproducts from the banks, which they trust. The fact that we also makemoney out of this is just a win-win situation. We are moving intoderivative products and we have just launched a universal life productwhich we haven't sold before.RBI: Why is banking in Hong Kong so profitable?ET: It is not because of margins, which are actually narrower than inthe UK or US. Rather, it is lucrative because of Hong Kong's huge tradeflows, because GDP has grown at 7 percent annually since 1980 andbecause Hong Kong is the world's largest forex centre and seventhlargest stockmarket. Per capita income now exceeds that of Europe. Andvery, very few bank loans go bad.RBI: Which product do you have to sell a customer in Hong Kong in orderto build a long-term relationship?ET: We don't have the situation in the UK or the US where everyone ischasing the cheque account. The market is very different here and theyare not something we chase, although they are free funds. We havepeople with heaps of money who don't have cheque accounts.The coat hanger product and the one we chase is the deposit accountand, to some extent, AssetVantage and PowerVantage. These lock thecustomer in on a much more all-round basis than mere transactionalbanking. Our strategy works in that we have a relationship with 60percent to 70 percent of the bankable population.RBI: What is your view of the partial break up of the Hong Konginterest rate cartel?ET: It has certainly put more pressure on margins and has freed upcompetitive forces in the marketplace. It has added extra uncertaintyin the marketplace and reduced the predictability and stability of theeconomy in the run-up to 1997.RBI: A number of your rivals are trying to compete heavily on price.How are you responding to this?ET: The deposit interest rates offered by some of our competitors couldsometimes be as much as 20 percent higher than ours. There has beensome market buying and market share purchasing, but we have nointention of being a price driver.We do a lot of things sufficiently well to reduce the impact of thisand segmenting the market is also a way of coping with the competition.RBI: How much emphasis has Hongkong Bank placed on providing directbanking services to its customers?ET: We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another.We can do telephone, we can do fax. We are not doing home banking yetbut we are coming along with it. We are currently working with HongkongTelecom jointly to do TV banking. All the different interfaces whichare possible technologically are being looked at to find the most costeffective and most customer receptive forms of direct banking toimplement.Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is stilloffered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separateentity such as First Direct.RBI: Has the move towards direct banking been driven by costconsiderations?ET: Retail banks, like all businesses, in Hong Kong, face staffshortages. Unemployment has held steady at under 3 percent for years,which has led to a steady rise in personnel costs. At Hongkong Bank,with our big branch network, the staff shortage has been so acute atlower levels that we now employ several hundred bank tellers fromChina.The positive aspect of this staff shortage is that we have been forcedto introduce a high level of technology in our branches. We have put inplace machines that automatically provide up-to- date balances onpassbooks, as well as automatic deposit machines which count acustomer's cash deposit and credit it instantly to his or her account.RBI: Hongkong Bank has taken the somewhat unique step of creating threedistinct types of branches for different grades of customer. What isthe logic behind this?ET: We believe creating three distinct type of branches is the bestmethod of delivering the right products and services to the rightcustomers. So we have what we call select branches for our high gradecustomers, standard branches, which are just normal branches, andautomated branches, which operate day and night.To be a customer at a select branch you have to be invited by a branchmanager or be a user of a particular product. The automated branchescurrently have two people in them and with more investment intechnology they will be taken out.A product which would gain you access to a select branch isAssetVantage, which is a bundled collection of products sold as a half-way point to private banking. This is similar to first class service onan airline. You need to have a minimum deposit of $HK200,000 ($25,900)and for this you are able to have savings accounts in 30 differentcurrencies and also gold trade.We have also launched PowerVantage which is more like business class.It is intended for younger high-earning customers. We have alsolaunched a special kind of account aimed at small business operatorscalled BusinessVantage.Although we segment the market, however, banking is banking is bankingand you can't really offer a significantly different service to onecustomer compared to another.Banking in Hong Kong is often a social activity and since you areoffered coffee and chocolates at the select branches people often bringtheir friends to the bank to do their transactions.RBI: Are you pandering to the notion that banking in Hong Kong is tiedup with status?ET: I have a very good friend in the UK and he says to me that hecannot stand the high street banks because they don't look after him.They don't treat him as someone special and this is something we try toavoid here.RBI: What pressures are there on you to close branches and reducestaffing to rationalise costs?ET: We have streamlined branches from around 240 two years ago to 220now. We will continue to look at cutting the number of branches, butthe actual network remains unchanged.Essentially what we have done is to close some of the smaller branchesand consolidate the bigger branches. Some of the closures have beenmade for safety reasons because we had a fire in one of our branchesand needed improved safety facilities.We are reducing staffing by using more part-timers so we have theappropriate number of staff in the branches according to how busy weare. The more flexible use of people has enabled us to cut staff costssignificantly. We want to find more efficient ways of doing things but,at the same time, we don't want to reduce the service we provide tocustomers. In fact, we set a minimum service standard for a particularproduct and work to those benchmarks continually checking our customersatisfaction levels.RBI: How much pressure comes from the fact that bank customers usetheir banks more regularly in Hong Kong than in other parts of theworld?ET: Yes, essentially it does. It puts a lot of peak load requirement onour network, particularly when salaries and social security are paidinto customer accounts.We have customers in our mid-market sector who will interface with thebank up to 16 times a month, which is more or less every day, if youignore the weekend. The number of transactional interfaces is indeed aproblem and we can only deal with it by having efficient systems.RBI: How big an impact do you think 1997 will have on the retailbanking market in Hong Kong?ET: As far as we are concerned we are here for the long haul. If wedidn't believe in China we would not be opening branches there. Thechange of sovereignty will naturally have some effect. But I think thepotential is still there to carry on doing business the way we thinkbest. If some of our customers decide to place their money abroad thenwe hope our global network will capture some of it.RBI: How much Chinese money is coming into Hong Kong?ET: Heaps. We estimate that China has invested $US20 billion in theterritory.RBI: How much benefit have you derived from the link up with Midland inthe UK?ET: I believe it has added to our global presence. These things areoften difficult to quantify. Our customers, however, now have access toATM machines in the UK, which can often be very useful.RBI: How much competition do you face from non-banks?ET: This is certainly on the increase. It is a big issue for us.Property developers and retailers are providing their own credit cards.I think if we don't take them seriously they will become big.RBI: What is your view of the Hong Kong economy?ET: It has come off since the property boom of 1993/94 which generateda lot of income. The credit squeeze in China to reduce inflation therefrom 30 percent to around 20 percent has had some effect over the past12 to 18 months. US demand for Hong Kong goods has also subsided. Theseseem to be the main factors behind the fall off in growth.RBI: How much of a presence do you have in other Asian countries?ET: The bank's greatest success is in Hong Kong itself but we do have asignificant presence in other countries in the region. We are thelargest foreign bank in Singapore, where we play a role in running thecheque clearing system. We also have a key presence in India, where wehave 21 branches.We are constrained from expanding in many countries but have beenhelped recently by market liberalisation. In the Philippines, we aretaking advantage of this and are expanding our network from two toeight branches. We have also been allowed to add two new facilities inThailand and are growing steadily in Indonesia.Indochina is becoming increasingly important for us. We have justopened an office in Burma and are in the process of upgrading our repoffice in Ho Chi Minh City to a branch.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Unless bankers are proactive and cooperate with regulators now tosolve issues, such as whether chip-card transactions are cash or checkexchanges, "it will be decided when a member of Congress loses a chipcard or stored value card with $1,000 on it," warned Karen Petrou,president of ISD/Shaw Inc. consultancy in Washington, D.C.     Although the industry ignored legislators last year, when askedfor suggestions about regulating electronic banking, a few rulings,opinions and real life experiences exist to guide you.SFNB Operates Within Existing Law     Banks could copy Security First Network Bank (SFNB) of Pineville,Ky., without a major investment in regulatory applications orchallenges, said Stuart Stein, a partner in the financial institutionspractice group with Hogan & Hartson law firm in Washington, D.C. Stein's firm advises SFNB on banking law applicable to its newbusiness strategies.     SFNB found that it could be the first to offer Internet bankingwithout applying for a new charter or filing a separate FederalReserve application, he said.     Initially, Cardinal BancShares, SFNB's parent company, receivedapproval to consolidate and sell five branches to spin-off SFNB.  Butit did not need Regulation Y approval from the Federal Reserve.  Reg Yapplies to bank and non-bank holding company expansion, Steinexplained.     After the spinoff, SFNB changed its business from traditionalthrift activities to soliciting deposits and purchasing loans over theInternet, Stein said.  The bank opened its Internet doors last yearand recently expanded its offerings to include joint checkingaccounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposits and checkimaging to view cleared checks on-line (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 3.)     The next step for SFNB may require more regulatory involvement. The bank plans to buy Five Paces Software and then license thetechnology platform on which SFNB was built, Stein said.  Licensingthis technology to other banks likely will be considered a newbusiness practice for SFNB, which will require Federal DepositInsurance Corporation and Office of Thrift Supervision approval, headded.     The Five Paces technology, which includes a secure operatingsystem that resides at the bank, was created for SFNB by WebTech Inc. of Atlanta, an affiliate of Atlanta-based SecureWare.      SFNB is not alone in its strategy.  Several banks joined lastyear to buy Meca Software from H&R Block and plan to license Mec' homebanking program to other banks.Two Agencies Publish Rules     Clearly, the SFNB experience shows that banks can deliver anypreviously offered service electronically without receiving anyregulatory grief.  But two agencies have published opinions and ruleson electronic banking regulation.     The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published a rules'revision Feb. 9 supporting activities, such as those proposed by SFNBand Meca.  The revision of part 7 of the OCC regulations states thatbanks may market technology they acquired or developed for bankingpurposes to third parties, said Julie Williams, chief OCC counsel (seebox, p. 3).     The FDIC recently released two letters written in Octoberaddressing a bank's questions about Internet banking deposit insuranceand the possible deposit broker role of third-party vendors.  Theopinions can be applied to the industry as a whole.     One letter addresses customer funds transferred to an accountestablished at a bank by the sponsoring company to facilitate Internettransactions.  The FDIC said that federal deposit insurance would flowthrough to funds deposited in a third-party agency account with theinsured institution.  Insurance flows through if the companysufficiently disclosed the capacities in which money was transmittedto it by customers and that the company maintained adequate recordsindicating the identity of customers for which it held funds.     This approach appears to differ significantly from the approachused by Mark Twain Bank in its DigiCash trial.  In that system, fundsare deposited directly with the bank into an insured account.  Themoney becomes uninsured when withdrawn and placed into the bank's e-cash mint, or transferred onto the hard drive of a customer'scomputer, said Thomas Vartanian, managing partner of the Washington,D.C. law office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.     The second FDIC letter concludes that a sponsoring company orthird-party vendor in an Internet funds transfer program would not bea deposit broker.     That opinion was based on the fact that the company's "primarypurpose" was the provision of electronic payment system, rather thanthe placement of funds with a depository institution.  Since nointerest was being paid on the agency account, the FDIC obviouslyunderstood that the safety and soundness concerns articulated bySection 29 of the FDI Act were not applicable in this case, Vartaniansaid.    Be aware, though, that the main exclusion for this FDIC ruling,"primary purpose," is considered on a case-by-case basis.  The FDICconsiders the following key characteristics when asked if an agency isa deposit broker:*   Fees.  Does the party receive fees from the bank for placing fundswith the institution?*  Purpose.  Would the relationship have been established but for thepurpose for placing funds in the bank?*   Other Reasons.  Is there any other substantial purpose for theactivity or business other than the placement of funds in the insuredinstitution?Think About Product First    "Regulatory analysis can vary depending on what you're talkingabout," said Scott Anenberg, partner and chair of the financialinstitutions group at the Washington, D.C., law firm Shaw, Pittman,Potts and Trowbridge.  Legal issues differ whether you're just takingdeposits or doing loans over the Internet, he said.    Decide what the product is, how it will be offered, who will beoffering it and who is the target market before investigatingregulatory options, Anenberg said.    Also, speakers said, consider the competition, which may notalways be another bank.  In the smart card market, for example,Florida-based Blockbuster Entertainment Group  [VIA] is working on apilot and creating set-top box applications.  (Scott Anenberg, Shaw,Pittman, 202/663-8000; Karen Petrou, ISD/Shaw, 202/296-5240; JulieWilliams, OCC, 202/874-5770; Thomas Vartanian, Fried, Frank, 202/639-7016.) Specifics of OCC Revision     The Office of the Comptroller (OCC) of the currency, last week, released revisions to Part 7 of its interpretive letters.  The finalrule:*   Modernizes bank data processing rules to recognize bankinvolvement in the area of electronic money.  A national bank mayperform, provide or deliver, through electronic means or facilities,any activity, function, product or service that it is now authorizedto perform, provide or deliver.  *   States that a national bank may market and sell excess capacity inelectronic activities to third-parties for uses not related tobanking.*   Clarifies that some lending activities must be completed at bank'smain office or branch.  A bank loan recipient must appear in-person atthe bank's main office or at a  branch to collect funds.  Loanorigination, approval and disbursal of loan proceeds by third partiesneed not be performed at a main office or branch.*   Defines interest to include fees for late payments, insufficientfunds, annual banking services and cash advances.  The fees can beapplied across state lines as with credit cards. *   Defines rules regarding banks' ability to lease excess space,share space and share employees with businesses other than otherfinancial institutions.  *   Provides national banks with added flexibility to structure theirprocedures governing board and shareholder actions by permitting thereliance on recognized complete bodies of corporate law and state lawswhere the bank's main office is located.*   Updates letter of credit provisions to reflect current industrypractices and to cover a broader category of transactions that are thefunctional equivalent of letters of credit. Back to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEWS via NewsNetFebruary 16, 1996GROCERY STORES PROVING POPULAR BANKING VENUE    Branch location will continue to play a central role in thecustomer relationship, even as on-line banking and smart card deliverychannels become more popular, banking analysts predict (RDSN, Jan. 19,p. 3.).  But the size, location and services offered at branches willchange, analysts say.    In-store branches and mini-branches for grocery chains are twoalternative strategies to brick and mortar branches emerging in theindustry.  Last year, the number of in-store branch locationsincreased 25 percent and now stands at more than 3,000, according toInternational Banking Technologies (IBT) of Norcross, Ga., an in-storebranch consulting company.  These branches average 400 to 800 squarefeet and are staffed with several bank employees.    Mini-branches are the newest solution emerging as a tool to reachbusy consumers, said IBT's President John Garnett.  Mini-branchesrange in size from 35 square feet to 100 square feet and are automatedwith self-service loan and teller machines and video conferencingmodules.  The mini-branch is staffed by one or two employees, he said.     Mini-branches have greater space devoted to automated and self-service delivery, freeing specialized staff to make one-on-onecontacts in the supermarket aisles, Garnett said.  "We think this willfill the gap in stores that are too-tight for a full branch," headded.      IBT is finalizing its mini-branch prototype, which has yet to betested at a store, Garnett said.Success Story     One bank that has contributed significantly to the increasingnumber of in-store branches is First State Bank of Austin, Texas.      The $415 million-asset institution operates a total of 16 in-store branches at Wal Mart Supercenters and Kmarts, covering a morethan 1,200 miles between Midland, Texas and Corpus Christi, Texas. Five additions are planned this year, said Joseph Long, First Statechairman.     The bank, which trained employees to roam Wal Mart aisles anddiscuss loans with customers, has experienced loan volumes double thatof what was expected.  Deposit volumes also are higher than predictedat the in-store branches, he said.    "It's the repeat business in the grocery market, I think, thatmakes [in-store branches] work as well as they do," Long said. Studies indicate that the average American visits the grocery storetwo to three times a week.  Those numbers do not include theadditional reasons why consumers might visit Wal Mart SuperCenters,which often house opticians and unisex hair salons.  A supercenterconducts 30,000 to 60,000 transactions daily, Long said.    First State has been able to increase its market coverage at afraction of the cost, Long added.  Stand-alone brick and mortar bankscost $1 million or more to build compared to the $260,000 price tagfor an in-store mini-branch, he said.    In-store branches can be created for as little as $175,000. Mini-branches will fall under that figure because rent and staffingrequirements are even less, Garnett said.    In-store banking provides many benefits for banks, Garnett said:*   High-touch delivery channels.  The channel  fosters sales,allowing automation to handle routine transactions similar to IBT'smini-branch model.*   Merger and Acquisition Tool.  In-store branching makes it feasiblefor acquiring banks to maintain a presence in key markets whentraditional locations are closed to maximize efficiency.*   Opportunities to build market share.  Banks can move into newmarket areas without as much capital investment as with traditionalbranch expansion.  For example, all but one of the Wal Mart branchesopened by First State Bank is in a new market area for the bank, Longsaid.  Additionally, the inexpensive branch is a tool for communitybanks to ward off competition from larger banks.*   Increased customer service.  The in-store branch is open longerand located where consumers must go anyway.  It allows bankers tomaintain face-to-face contact even in the evening hours.  The branchesalso can provide services similar to brokerage firms.Consumer Attitudes Positive    National Commerce Bank Services Inc. (NCBS) of Memphis, Tenn., anin-store branching consultancy, recently predicted that the number ofin-store branches will reach 7,500 by the year 2000.  NCBS recentlyinterviewed about 800 shoppers in 20 states who said in-store bankingis important to them and that the branch should offer more than justdeposit and withdrawal services.  The study revealed that of thoseinterviewed:*   93 percent consider in-store bank very important;*   70 percent shop more frequently at the supermarket because ofbranch access;*   79 percent would use the in-store bank at least once a week andmore than 80 percent would visit the store just for bankingactivities; and*   About 40 percent said the in-store branch should add home equityloans, personal loans, safe deposit boxes and money market/mutual fundservices.    Two U.S. consulting companies specialize in advising banks oncreating in-store branches.  Pricing for the services vary accordingto the number of in-store branches needed, the mixture of bank-provided and vendor-provided materials and whether the firm has arelationship with the grocery store, Garnett said.    IBT is a business unit of First Data Corporation of Hackensack,N.J., offering a solution called Sales Platform, which has beenadopted by more than 250 U.S. banks and 950 in-store grocery branches,Wal Marts and Kmarts.  Customers include The State Bank and Union Bankin Central Valley, California.  NCBS is the consulting division ofNational Commerce Bancorporation, which has placed 62 of its 77branches inside supermarkets.  NCBS has advised more than 200 banks indeveloping 600 in-store branches.  Customers include newly signed onSunTrust Banks of Atlanta.

Back to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEWS via NewsNetFebruary 16, 1996VISA CASH BENEFITS STILL UNPROVEN     The Visa Cash division of Visa International is betting that itcan divert some of the nation's $1.8 trillion in annual cashtransactions under $10 into Visa Cash exchanges. Visa believes thesetransactions are under the limit for which most people will use acredit card.     The banking industry has been awash with big ideas about smartcards that will hold all of a consumer's vital information, frommedical records to cash transactions.But Visa Cash stored-value card is designed to be simple and to helpconsumers get over technology hurdles, said Mary Buckley, Visa's vicepresident of stored value products.  Visa proposes to operate VisaCash on its existing VisaNet system and charge a fee for processingtransactions.      For banks, the card is a vehicle to put its name in consumerhands, an additional customer service and a fee generator, Buckleysaid.     But the service will require substantial upgrades inautomated teller machines' (ATMs) hardware and software and changes inmerchant point-of-sale equipment, said Basil Bromberg, president ofSmart Cards USA consultancy in Dallas.  "Change-over of equipment outin the field to support this card is going to be a multimillion dollareffort."    Additionally, the VisaNet system limits Visa Cash consumers tothe same merchants where they could use a credit card, Bromberg said. He criticized Visa for failing to offer enough information to helpbanks to make decisions about implementing the Visa Cash system.    Indeed, when asked about pricing and profitability potential,Buckley directed inquiries to each individual bank partner.  But sheacknowledged that, like the credit industry, smart cards may bringmore profits to the issuing banks that earn interest on funds throughfloat or unused cards funds.  Acquiring banks, on the other hand, canearn merchant transaction fees.    Visa Cash is in the pilot stages.  The 1996 Summer Olympicspilot, for example, will provide many answers to industry questionsabout smart card consumer acceptance, profitability and feasibility. "There's a lot of work to be done to validate the benefits.  When thetents are down and the athletes have gone home, we'll still be inAtlanta,"  Buckley said.    Visa, at least seems to be ahead of its competition.  MasterCardis developing a smart card system but has no pilots, Bromberg said. American Express initiated a pilot at its headquarters in December. The cards, issued to less than 50 employees, contain credit functionson a chip, but no cash applications, said spokesman Toby Usnik. (BasilBromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502; Toby Usnik, American Express,212/640-5060.)                          VISA CASH AT A GLANCE                             P.O. Box 8999                   San Francisco, Calif. 94128-8999                             415/432-3789Contacts: Mary Buckley, vice president of stored value products.Partners:  First Union, Les caisses Desjardins, Scotiabank,NationsBank, Toronto Dominion, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union,Wachovia.Major Pilots:  More than 150,000 stored-value cards to be issued inAustralia, accepted by about 1,000 merchants.  In Atlanta, Visa Cashpartnered with several banks to issue cards in association with the1996 Summer Olympics.  In the Atlanta pilot, First Union teamed withat least 12 merchants to accept Visa Cash.  In April, Visa launched astored-value card system for employees at its headquarters.  The $20cards are used in the cafeteria and vending machines.                 Back to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEWS via NewsNetFebruary 16, 1996MASTERCARD, VISA SET STANDARDS.     Debit and credit payments over the Internet received a boostrecently when card-association giants MasterCard and Visa scrappedtheir competing Internet security protocols and backed a uniformsecurity standard.  The companies believe the new protocol will makethe Internet safe for commerce, but consumer adaptation may be furtherbehind.  "I don't think their announcement is going to do very muchfor the progress or the pace at which the mass market adopts theInternet as a viable channel for commercial or retail enterprise,"says Mark Hardie, an analyst with The Tower Group, in Wellesley, Mass. "It's a complicated issue and there's more to it than simplyMasterCard and Visa agreeing that they'll use the same standard."  Thelarger issue is whether consumers will flock to the Internet as theyflock to suburban malls, he said.  The standard, called SecureElectronic Transaction (SET), combines features from MasterCard'sSecure Electronic Payment Protocol and Visa's Secure TransactionTechnology.  The protocol underlying SET is software-based public keycryptography from Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security.  It isthe same technology that MasterCard and Visa were using separately,which software vendors say they're able to support simultaneously. The question remains whether software-based public key encryption isan adequate form of security.  "It's better than nothing," says BobGargus, president of Atalla Corp., the San Jose, Calif.-based divisionof Tandem Computer Corp..  Atalla manufacturers hardware-basedencryption devices for automated teller machines and is offering peripherals for client-server systems to secure Internet-basedcommerce (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 6).  Standard specifications are to beavailable in a few weeks and operational by the fourth quarter.

America Online of Vienna, Va., plans to work with financialcompanies to offer mutual fund information and transactions online. It will be called the AOL Mutual Fund Center.  (Ted Leonsis, AOL,703/448-8700.) Back to Headline List CopyrightRETAIL DELIVERY SYSTEMS NEWS via NewsNetFebruary 16, 1996MICROSOFT TRANSACTS WITH VISA    As RDSN went to press, Microsoft and Visa Interactive revealedthey are working together to offer banks a turnkey remote bankingsolution.  Under the agreement, Visa Interactive will act as aprocessor for Microsoft's personal finance software, Money.  The morethan 30 banks offering Money have been processing payments through Intuit Services Corp. (ISC), also the processor for Intuit's [INTU]personal finance software, Quicken.     The processing arrangement, expected to be approved by VisaInternational next month, apparently offers a choice of processors forbanks that provide personal finance software from either Microsoft orIntuit, said Mark Hardie, technology analyst with the Tower Group inWellesley, Mass., who received a pre-announcement briefing fromMicrosoft and Visa.    Being forced to process transactions through ISC, rather than thebank's usual processor or a new one chosen by the bank, has been acommon complaint among banks offering the Intuit and Microsoftprograms.  The ISC contract is often the second or third processingarrangement banks must enter into to offer personal finance software.Microsoft Strategy    The Visa partnership may help Microsoft improve its relationshipwith the banking industry, which fears the software giant will becomea major competitor.    When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates spoke to about 6,000 bankersat the Bank Administration Institute 's Retail Delivery '95 inDecember, he promised bankers future processing choices for homebanking.  Microsoft likely will keep its ISC relationship for banksthat want to use that processor, Hardie said.  "I don't thinkMicrosoft would be as successful going to banks directly and tellingthe banks to set up their own payment systems," he added.    Additionally, the Visa choice may provide a new comfort level forbankers who fear Microsoft, but are familiar with the Visa, Hardiesaid.    Microsoft's challenge is to keep Money competitive among Internetbanking and payment strategies, Hardie said.  Several competitors,including ISC, are creating products for Internet banking.    It's too early to say how the partnership will affect ISC, whichhas been the exclusive Money and Quicken processor by default, ISC'sChairman Bruce Burchfield told RDSN.  ISC will not disclose itstransaction volume numbers until Intuit's quarterly report ispublished next month.    It is unlikely that the larger banks, already processing withISC, will change to Visa because they would have to create a newinterface to replace one that already exists, Burchfield said.    Indeed, the Microsoft/Visa turnkey system will likely be mostattractive to smaller banks that do not have the resources to investin development, Hardie said.

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996FINES TOTALING $258,000LEVIED BY NASD AGAINSTWORTHEN RESPONDENTS     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several ofits officers and registered representatives in connection withthe sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and RelatedCases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit againstWorthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted assafe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fundsales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthenbanks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year alongwith Worthen Investments.     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQStock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individualrespondents, without admitting or denying the allegations againstthem, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by theAssociation's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that theymade, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to theircustomers about the characteristics and safety features of themutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition toconducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligencein connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fundproducts."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies ofall customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintainan adequate supervisory system.     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  Inaddition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additionalsanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of allinternal policies and an agreement to form an investmentcommittee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthenpersonnel to market all securities.  The committee is toespecially consider the suitability of sales literature topromote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results ofthe independent audit and investment committee reviews aresubject to NASD inspection.     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen'sexecutive vice president and former compliance officer.     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-yearsuspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in allcapacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he boreresponsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to publiccustomers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sentmisleading sales correspondence to public customers thatmisstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fundinvestments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who usesuch correspondence, NASD said.     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-daysuspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as aprincipal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findingsthat he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondencethat misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  Inaddition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies ofcustomer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm'sfiles and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.     Higher fines were levied against the seven representativeswho were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highestamount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, theseven representatives were fined $130,900.     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., whichwas the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with theinvestigation "and promptly instituted new policies andprocedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent futureviolations."

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CFTC DISMISSES NUMEROUS'FRIVOLOUS' MOTIONS INNFA DISCIPLINARY CASE     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a Dec. 1 ordertossed out 59 motions filed by J&J Development Corp. and affirmeda National Futures Association (NFA) decision that imposed a fineof $2,000 against J&J for failure to keep timely financialstatements.  J&J Development Corp. v. National FuturesAssociation, No. CRAA-95-2 (CFTC).     Calling J&J's numerous filings "egregious," the CFTC saidthey were prohibited under CFR Section 171.10(d).     The numerous motions began after J&J appealed an NFAdecision that sanctioned the company for not filing financialstatements seven times between June 1990 and August 1992.  TheCFTC said J&J began its blizzard of motions with a monster briefthat was four times longer than permitted under CFTC regulationsand contained 456 exhibits.     The CFTC noted that the brief was followed by the filing of59 motions between January 1995 and July 1995.  The motionsgenerally reiterated points made in the brief, the CFTC said.     "[R]ule 171.10(d) itself provides that 'frivolous orrepetitive motions dealing with the same subject matter shall notbe permitted,'" the CFTC said.  "We find that most of appellant'spleadings in fact are the very sort of filings that Rule171.10(d) is intended to prohibit.  Although we decline to imposesanctions pursuant to Rule 171.11, we admonish J&J for itsegregious abuse of the process."     The CFTC noted that J&J's motions fell into three generalcategories.  Most of them were made up of arguments alreadycontained in the brief.  A second category was composed ofprocedural arguments, and a third responded to NFA's oppositionbrief.     The NFA also filed procedural motions, which included amotion to strike J&J's brief and exhibits.  The motions weredismissed as moot following the CFTC's ruling in favor of theNFA.     "[O]ur review of the record and the parties' appellatesubmissions establishes that NFA's findings and conclusions aresupported by the weight of the evidence; we therefore adoptthem," the CFTC said.  "We further conclude that NFA committed noerror material to the outcome of this proceeding, and the partieshave not raised any issues that merit extended discussion.Accordingly, we affirm NFA's decision without opinion."Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SIXTH CIRCUIT: INVESTORS'CLAIMS AGAINST BROKERARE TIME-BARRED     Disgruntled investors in high-risk limited partnershipscannot arbitrate their claims against a brokerage firm becausethe six-year statute of limitations has passed, a divided panelof the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 27.  DeanWitter Reynolds Inc. v. M.C. McCoy et al., No. 94-5779(6th Cir.).     In a 2-1 decision, the majority said the limitations periodbegan to run when the investments were made and when theinvestors received prospectuses that clearly outlined thesubstantial risks, not when the investments later soured.     The dissenting judge found a material factual issue fortrial on the investors' argument that the limitations period wasequitably tolled because the brokerage firm fraudulentlyconcealed the unsuitable nature of the investments.  Thedissenter also said the National Association of Security Dealers(NASD) Code of Arbitration Procedure does not bar equitabletolling of the Section 15 limitations period.     The investors, described as unsophisticated retirees, statedthat their primary goals were preservation of principal and asteady income stream.  They were allegedly told by Dean WitterReynolds that limited partnerships would meet those goals andwere promised 20% returns and safety.  The NASD Code ofArbitration Procedure with its six-year time period wasincorporated by reference and stipulation into their agreements.     Dean Witter subsequently filed a declaratory judgmentcomplaint in the Eastern District of Tennessee, alleging thatclaims for improper investments were time-barred.  The investorswere permanently enjoined from litigation and arbitration.     The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a majority opinion by JudgeAlice M. Batchelder.  The arbitration claims were filed more thansix years after the investments were made and the clock beganticking, the court said, not when they later allegedly discoveredthe unsuitability of the investments.  Adopting the investors'reasoning would undermine Section 15's intent of setting asix-year limit on the arbitrability of claims, it said.     The majority also found the prospectuses to be clearlyworded and not misleading, even to novice investors.     It found no need to decide whether Section 15 is subject toequitable tolling, saying the investors failed to offersufficient evidence of fraudulent concealment.     In a dissent, Judge Karen Nelson Moore found a materialfactual issue as to whether Dean Witter had engaged in fraudulentconcealment.  She also said the equitable tolling doctrineapplies to claims filed more than six years after an investmentin unsuitable securities.     The due diligence requirement may be relaxed when aconfidential or fiduciary relationship exists, she said, and theprospectuses in this case are neither clear nor comprehensive.She also noted that a Dean Witter agent took the initiative tomeet with the investors, reassured them their goals would be metand made other statements that were gross exaggerations orclearly capricious.     In addition, Section 15 does not bar an equitable tollingclaim in Judge Moore's view because there was no evidence theseinvestors agreed to waive their right to use the equitabletolling doctrine.Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SEC SUIT REMAINS INTACTDESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT'SECURITIES' DEFINITION     Noting that a question may ultimately exist as to whetherthe instruments used in multimillion-dollar transactions by theFoundation for New Era Philanthropy are securities under federallaw, Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Anita B. Brody onNov. 16 denied former New Era president John G. Bennett's motionto dismiss on that point and issued a discovery schedule.  SEC v.Bennett et al., No. 95-3005 (ED PA); see Securities & InsiderTrading LR, Aug. 21, 1995.     The motion by Bennett for a more definitive statement of SECcharges that he and New Era sold more than $100 million inunregistered securities in 1993 alone was denied by Judge Brodybecause Bennett "has not made clear the substance of hisobjections."     Bennett argued that the crux of the SEC's complaint iswhether the New Era notes are securities within the meaning ofthe federal securities laws.  Under every criteria, Bennettcontends, the notes fail to qualify as securities, i.e., asnotes, investment contracts and other evidence of indebtedness.     Judge Brody stated she was unable to say at this pointwhether the legal test for registered securities has been met.After discovery has been completed, the judge ruled, Bennett mayagain raise the issue and the parties at that time will addressthe economic realities of the transaction.     Regarding the motion for a more definitive statement fromthe SEC, the judge stated that the defects to which Bennettalludes are not obvious and that plaintiff did not have torespond to allusions to theories of potential liability in thecomplaint, only to factual allegations.  Because Bennett did notcomply with Rule 12(e), which requires him to point out thedefects complained of and the details desired, he has not madeclear the substance of his objections, Judge Brody stated.

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996SUP. CT. HEARS FINALITY OFPACT v. DE REPRESENTATIONADEQUACY ARGUMENTS     In arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court Nov. 27,Matsushita Electric Industrial Ltd. argued that if the NinthCircuit U.S. Court of Appeals' invalidation of a Delaware statecourt settlement of shareholder claims against it is notoverturned, corporations will have no assurance of the finalityof state court settlements that include federal securities lawcharges.  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. et al. v.Epstein et al., No. 94-1809 (U.S.).     Shareholder attorneys countered that Section 27 of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, which gives federal courtsexclusive jurisdiction to enforce any liability, prevented such asettlement -- especially where the securities law claims were notlitigated and were based on different wrongs than those at theheart of the state law breach of duty allegations.     In 1990, Matsushita acquired MCA Inc. for $6.1 billion.  Theacquisition was accomplished through a tender offer of $71 pershare of MCA common stock.     Rather than tender his shares, Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairmanand CEO at the time, entered into a separate agreement withMatsushita, known as the "Capital Contribution and LoanAgreement," pursuant to which Wasserman exchanged his shares forpreferred stock in a wholly owned Matsushita subsidiary calledMEA Holdings.  Sidney Sheinberg, MCA's COO at the time, tenderedhis shares pursuant to Matsushita's $71 per share offer.  Twodays after Sheinberg tendered his shares, he received anadditional $21 million in cash, ostensibly in exchange forunexercised MCA stock options.     Subsequently, former MCA shareholders who tendered theirshares for the $71 tender price filed suit in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Central District of California, alleging thatMatsushita violated SEC Rule 14d-10 by treating Wasserman andSheinberg differently from other shareholders in the tenderoffer.     The district court granted Matsushita summary judgment onclass action plaintiff representative Lawrence Epstein's claimthat Matsushita's agreement to pay Wasserman consideration thatwas different from the $71 per share tender offer violatedRule 14d-10.  The trial court subsequently granted Matsushita'smotion for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims.Appeals were filed.     During the pendency of the consolidated appeals, theDelaware Chancery Court entered a judgment approving thesettlement of a state court class action that released all claimsarising out of Matsushita's tender offer for MCA stock --including the securities law charges.     The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's orderdenying plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment againstMatsushita on the Wasserman claim.  The panel also vacated thedistrict's court's order granting Matsushita's motion for summaryjudgment on the Sheinberg payment.     In addition, the appeals court held that the Delawarejudgment does not preclude the Epstein class action.  Finally,the panel vacated the district court's orders denying the Epsteinplaintiffs' motions for class certification and for leave toamend their complaint.     In its petition for writ of certiorari, Matsushita assertedthat the circuit court created an anomalous exception to the FullFaith and Credit Act that will frustrate the settlement of classaction litigation.  It also argued that implying a private rightof action under Rule 14d-10 violates principles announced by theSupreme Court and conflicts with decisions of the District ofColumbia, Third and Sixth Circuits.  Furthermore, Matsushitacontended that the circuit court expanded Rule 14d-10 in conflictwith the law in the Fourth Circuit and the tender offerregulatory scheme created by Congress.     Walter Minton, one of the plaintiffs, filed a separate briefin opposition, arguing that this is an appeal from aninterlocutory decision, not a final judgment, and the issuespresented arise because of the unique facts of the case.  Mintonalso stated that there is no need for the Supreme Court to decidewhether there is a private right of action under Rule 14d-10.     In a Feb. 13, 1993 opinion that followed a fairness hearingon the proposed settlement by objectors, then Vice ChancellorMaurice Hartnett noted that a "whiff of collusion" was not enoughto bar approval, especially since the pact -- in a revised form -- had an opt-out provision.     The justices asked plaintiff attorneys why the Californiaobjectors had not opted out of the settlement instead ofattacking it collaterally.  Plaintiff's attorneys argued that theDelaware Chancery Court made no inquiry into the adequacy ofrepresentation, thereby inviting a challenge to the settlement.     Nevertheless, some justices questioned the assertion thatonly a federal court could release federal securities claims.     Counsel for Matsushita are Barry R. Ostranger, Mary KayVyskocil, Paul C. Curnin and Joseph M. McLaughlin of Simpson,Thatcher & Bartlett in New York City.  Of counsel is GeoffreyHazard Jr., Trustee Professor of Law, University of Pennsylvania.

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996CFTC FINDS DEFENDANT'SBID TO VACATE DECISIONDID NOT FIT RULE 60(b)     Although Steven C. Brenner claimed that sanctions leveledagainst him by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should belifted because he satisfied a judgment, the CFTC ruled Nov. 11that Brenner's motion to set aside a final decision had beenfiled too late for him to obtain relief under FRCP 60(b).  In theMatter of Steven C. Brenner, No. 90-7 (CFTC).     "To obtain such relief, generally a party must firstdemonstrate that he acted within a reasonable time and show ameritorious defense," the CFTC said, noting that Brenner's motioninvolved a decision rendered four years ago.  The CFTC pointedout that a Rule 60(b) motion must be made "not more than one yearafter the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken."     In 1986, the CFTC ordered Brenner to pay a judgment of$5,987.20 to a complainant.  There was no record of Brenner'smaking the payment by early 1987, and he was automaticallyprohibited from trading on any contract market.  The CFTCEnforcement Division, however, learned in 1990 that Brenner hadviolated the trading prohibition in 1987 and 1988.     The Enforcement Division moved for a summary disposition.Brenner did not respond to the charges nor did he appear at aconsequent hearing before an administrative law judge.  The ALJfound Brenner liable on the charges and imposed a 10-year tradingban and a $10,000 civil monetary penalty.  Brenner did not seek amodification, and the summary disposition became a final order.Brenner did not appeal the order to the CFTC, and the case wasclosed.     In June 1992, the CFTC was informed that Brenner was tradingunder a fictitious name.  The Enforcement Division sought and wasgranted an injunction prohibiting Brenner from trading futures bythe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.     Brenner responded in February by asking the CFTC to setaside the sanctions on grounds he had paid the $5,987.20 judgmentin 1987.  He argued that his attorney had been incompetent fornot bringing the satisfaction of the judgment to the proper CFTCauthorities.  The complainant alleged that he was not paid until1994.               The Enforcement Division argued that Brenner's motion shouldbe denied because he had failed to demonstrate the "exceptionalcircumstances" necessary for the granting of relief underRule 60(b).   The CFTC, however, found that Brenner did not reachRule 60(b) because he brought his action well after the one-yearlimitation period.     "[W]e initially note that the sanctions Brenner seeks tohave vacated were imposed four and half years prior to theinstant motion.  Nevertheless, Brenner offers no explanation forthe delay in presenting the evidence he now asks us to consider.Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that his motion hasbeen filed within a reasonable time."     The CFTC noted that even if the action had been broughtwithin the period of limitation, relief under Rule 60(b) cannotbe granted based on the incompetence of a defendant's attorney.Quoting Nelson v. City College of Chicago, 962 F.2d at 755(7th Cir.), the CFTC said the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court ofAppeals has "never held that an attorney's gross negligencejustifies relief under Rule 60(b)."Back to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES & COMMODITIES LIT. REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996INVESTORS SAY RECEIVERLACKED AUTHORITY TO SELLSECURITIES-BACKED ASSETS     A group of California securities investors argued in aNov. 20 brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that theCentral District of California went beyond its jurisdiction inapproving a receiver's sale of real estate that the investorsclaimed they owned through the purchase of securities.  SEC v.American Capital Investments, Inc.; The ACI Investors Associationet al. v. Shaffer, Nos. 95-55193, 95-55283, 95-5587 and 95-55878(9th Cir.).     "The Receiver cannot sell the Investors' interests in theproperties because they are not within the Court's jurisdiction,"the investors argued.  "Under binding recent Supreme Courtprecedent (O'Melveny & Myers v. F.D.I.C...), the Court must lookto State law to define its remedial jurisdiction in Receivershipcases.  Under California law -- as well as all otherjurisdictions -- a Receiver steps into the shoes of the defendantfor whom he is appointed and brings into custodia legis only thesame quality and quantity of title as was owned by thedefendant."     The case began in August 1993 when the Securities andExchange Commission filed a complaint alleging securities fraudagainst American Capital Investments, Inc. (ACI), which had beenselling securities interests in real estate investments.  By thetime the SEC obtained a restraining order, 156 investors hadpurchased securities backed by commercial real estate.               The investors -- later organized as the ACI InvestorsAssociation -- claimed they held title to the property directlythrough deeds and indirectly through partnerships with ACI.  Thejurisdictional issue presently before the Ninth Circuit had itsgenesis in the September 1993 federal court appointment ofRichard G. Shaffer as ACI's receiver.  Shaffer took over ACI'sreal estate assets and sold the properties to a Canadianinvestment firm.     According to the investors' opening brief, "The investorscontend that no one can sell what he does not own.  The Receiverseeks to sell 100 percent fee interests in eight ACIcommercial/office properties -- despite that fact that ACI didnot own 100 percent fee interests.  The investors own majorinterests in at least four of the eight properties...."     The investors claimed the Central District of California didnot have jurisdiction to approve the sale and appealed to theNinth Circuit.     Citing to O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct. 2048 (1994),which had relied in part on Allen v. Ramsay, 179 Cal.App.2d 843,4 Cal.Rptr. 575 (1960), the investors argued that federal courtsdo not have the power to displace state law in cases involvingthe authority of receivers.     "There is no principle of California law which would permita Receiver to sell a better state of title than he acquired when'he stepped into the shoes' of the Defendant," the investorsargued.  "Applying the law to this case, there is no power toconvey a better title to the ACI properties than ACI itself hadand the district court's sale order is therefore void."

REPORTER via NewsNetJanuary 1, 1996OFFICER ARGUES THAT NASDEXCEEDED AUTHORITY IN CASEINVOLVING NONMEMBER FIRM     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned asecurities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in aNov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appealsthat the National Association of Securities Dealers stretchedbeyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involvinga misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securitiesand Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceedsthe power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks toimpose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investmentbanking or securities business for his alleged failure to act inhis corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"according to the brief.     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument onallegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporationslaw by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-chartered, non-NASD member private business.     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reservedunder the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued."Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law andthe relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to statelaw....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs ofprivate corporations and federal law shall not intrude into thoseinternal affairs."     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrinecorporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check forthe full amount to the AIFC customer.     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld paymentfor two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation wasunsupported.     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of adisciplinary action against Alderman by the District BusinessConduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being anofficer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vicepresident.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC foundAlderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of theNASD's Rules of Fair Practice.    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of hisbusiness, shall observe high standards of commercial honor andjust and equitable principles of trade."     According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and finedhim $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD'sNational Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed theDBCC.     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladderwhen Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission toreview the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealedto the Ninth Circuit.      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law -- notthe NASD -- governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of thecompany.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bankaccounts fell to a vice president for finance and not toAlderman, the brief argued.      "The standards to which directors are held are establishedby state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent andprudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearlyrecognized that the Board's responsibility is limited tooverseeing the operation."     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.The SEC is represented by Randall W.

First of all, the nature of the consumer market is changing,with a large portion of the population moving from being saversto investors, "in part driven by low rates, in part driven by thefact that baby boomers are inflation-conscious and investment-driven," said Ed Furash, a Washington, D.C., bank consultant.This group is searching for yield and isn't content with currentsavings account and certificate of deposit (CD) earnings.      Banks, in turn, are stuck with a big distribution system andthe need to increase fee income to offset their shrinking netinterest margins. "At the same time, banks don't have a lot ofloans to make--the demand and quality aren't there," he said.      Banks have to stop the drain on deposits caused by plunginginterest rates.  "In the battle between banks and non-banks, it'sessential banks enter non-bank products such as annuities andinsurance.  If not, non-bank competitors will steal banks blind,"Furash said.      An illustration of the strength fee income can generate isSt. Louis-based Mark Twain Bancshares, which recently reported a37.94 percent increase in 1992 earnings over 1991.  The bankattributes its strong performance in part to its revenues fromits fee-based divisions (bond, brokerage, mortgage and trust),which grew a collective 30.01 percent in 1992 compared to 1991.   You Can Jump in All at Once or Dip in a Toe at a Time      Some banks are taking bold steps in their commitment toinvestment products. A prime example is NationsBank Corp.'spartnership created this fall with Dean Witter Financial ServicesGroup Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.  The twosubsidiaries each own 50 percent of the new firm, called NationsSecurities, a Dean Witter/NationsBank Co., headquartered inCharlotte, N.C.  The company is an independent securitiesbrokerage firm and has about 400 investment officers now workingat selected NationsBank banking centers around the country.      Another tactic is to set up a separate bank subsidiary, thenhire outside investment professionals.  First Chicago Corp.'sbankers call customers before a CD is about to mature.  Customersdisappointed by the new CD rates available are referred tononbanker investment professionals; mutual fund sales havetripled.      Other banks are cautious about the investment product wave'sfuture, or don't have the time or money for new productdevelopment.  But banks can still profit from rent and fee incomegenerated from investment firms sharing branch space.  Anotherstrategy is to take advantage of third-party processors that, tovarying degrees, help banks sell investment products.   Don't Expect a Magic Carpet Ride      Unfortunately, investment products aren't a guaranteed magiccarpet ride to profitability.  Successfully marketing investmentproducts requires a lot of planning, including developing amarketing plan that focuses on customers' needs; after all,investment product managers shouldn't try to sell a high-growthstock fund to a 90-year-old woman.      The mutual fund industry may now have more than $1.67trillion in assets, but so far bank proprietary funds have reliedmainly on converting existing assets rather than acquiring newcustomers, said Kenneth Hoffman, president of the Optima GroupInc., a Connecticut-based marketing consulting firm thatspecializes in helping banks market mutual funds.      The majority of bank proprietary mutual fund growth iscoming from the cannibalization of existing assets, he noted; tochange that trend, banks must put on their marketing hats.When asked what pitfalls to avoid, Furash fired off this list:Improperly explaining the product, including giving full andcomplete disclosure of the risks;  Offering funds that areattractive to the bank, not the customer; Trying to sell a stockor fund without understanding what the customer wants; Confusingthe customer by selling too many options.  Most people want threeor four different options, plus some advice on allocation; Notoffering the right mix of options; Failure to perform duediligence, investigating mutual fund vendors.Many more potential traps probably lie ahead, so go cautiously.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK SECURITIES NEWS via NewsNetMarch 12, 1993   Market Ripe for the Taking   Market Ripe for the Taking      Despite snares, industry analysts are predicting that bankinvestment products will be successful.  Baby boomers' propensityto invest will be coupled with the fact that banks can use theirexisting distribution system and their image to cash in on thisgrowing market.  Banks have a traditionally more trustworthyreputation than non-banking institutions, said Furash.   Bank of America Funds Show Strong Growth      Bank of America is an example of a bank reaping big rewards.Its Pacific Horizon Mutual Funds grew by 83 percent last year, asopposed to the entire mutual fund industry's growth of 23percent.  The nine funds had $12.2 billion in average assetsunder management in 1992, compared with $6.6 billion in 1991.      The growth of new assets in 1992 was principally due toinstitutional clients--banks trust departments and Fortune 500companies--that chose mutual funds over direct instruments, saidDebra McGinty-Poteet, senior vice president and manager of mutualfunds for Bank of America.      Other reasons are low interest rates that make funds moreattractive to investors and marketing and sales efforts byConcord Financial Group Inc. (the distributor) and therelationship managers at Bank of America Funds Management, saidMcGinty-Poteet.  Bank of America's and Security Pacific NationalBank's April 1992 merger also resulted in the convergence ofseveral funds.      Bank of America NT&SA is the investment adviser to thePacific Horizon Funds.  Concord Holding Corp., a proprietary bankmutual fund administrator, administers the Pacific Horizon funds;its subsidiary, Concord Financial Group Inc., is the sponsor andunderwriter and distributor.      Here are some tips from Hoffman on how to make mutual fundsand other investment products tempting enough to keep existingdeposits as well as attract new customers--and their money.      1.  Give investment products the marketing efforts they deserve.Banks aren't placing a priority on marketing funds, and "manybanks have attempted to pass marketing responsibility over totheir distributors without effectively communicating theirexpectations," said Hoffman.  According to a survey performed byOptima, 17 percent of senior fund managers reported that nodollars were committed to mutual fund marketing, while 28 percentdidn't know what percentage of operating expenses went to fundsmarketing.       Optima Group discovered in its survey that banks with amarketing plan are twice as likely to view their fund product as"very successful," yet more than one-half of the banks surveyed,with proprietary funds, had no developed marketing plan.      The best approach is to cultivate a joint marketing planwith the distributor, said Hoffman; that is done by about 36percent of the banks with a marketing plan.  Another 29 percentdid one in-house, while 36 percent left marketing to thedistributor.      Banks also err by not properly allocating advertisingdollars.  "The strategy that works well for Fidelity and Vanguardis unlikely to work for your bank for two fundamental reasons:First, customers of the mutual fund companies are unlikely toswitch; second, the mutual fund companies will always outspendyou," he said, adding that the large mutual fund companies canspend more than $100 in advertising and marketing for every newcustomer they acquire.      2.  Avoid turf wars.  Retail bankers are used to thinking oftrust departments as handling clients with tax, estate andinvestment management concerns.  In turn, trust departments viewbrokers as people poised to steal the best customers, and viewretail customers as unprofitable.      The choice is "to rely exclusively on converted assets andlet your departments squabble over control of the marketing ofthe mutual funds or to develop a consistent, well thought-outmarketing plan that commits a significant portion of bankresources to capitalize on the immense potential of mutualfunds," said Hoffman.      3.  Capitalize on Competitive Advantages.  One of thoseadvantages is customer access, including information fromdatabases, branches and loan applications.      "Frequent contact with customers provides a tremendousopportunity to cross-sell existing customers into mutual funds.This is an advantage which brokerage firms, insurance companiesand other financial competitors do not have.  At a bank,customers literally 'come to you,'" Hoffman said.      4.  Focus on customers with the greatest promise.  Carefullyanalyze available data, including DDA dollar velocity, CDbalances, credit card balances, credit lines and savingsbalances.  Doing so separates the investors from the savers.      DDA dollar velocity, the amount of money a customer putsinto his checking account each month, can be a prime indicator ofcustomer income.      Combined with other research such as car buying habits andresidence location, the resulting market segmentation can be usedfor mailings and telemarketing, Hoffman said.  Its effectivenessin using it to market investment products can then be tested andrefined.      "This data on purchase behavior is critical," said Hoffman."Banks should take pains to update it, nurture it and make it anoperable part of future marketing efforts.      5.  Divide and conquer, then offer something extra.  Dividepotential customers into three groups:  the traditional mutualfund retail customer, the affluent and the high-end trustcustomer.  Retail customers traditionally don't understand thedifference between stocks and bonds.  But they could become alucrative market if those products are explained properly.      The high-end investors need more services, such as trustservices and portfolio rebalancing.      Customers that fall in the middle may require a relationshipmanager; they often need more service than the traditional retailcustomer but don't possess the assets of a trust customer, saidHoffman.      6.  Offer brokers incentives.  Instead of worrying that thebrokers will take away the largest customers, bankers need tofocus on strengthening those relationships.  Besides offeringmonetary incentives, bankers can give brokers access to customerdata and sales support.  Separate customer statements for thefunds are attractive, as are prospectus wraps with strong salesmessages, dedicated wholesaler telephone support, service supportand cross-sale programs to encourage customers to commitadditional dollars to the fund.Back to Headline List CopyrightBANK SECURITIES NEWS via NewsNetMarch 12, 1993BANKS AGAINST NON-BANKS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS      Despite the hard knocks banks have taken in the recent past,commercial bank trust departments have come out winners over thepast 10 years when it comes to equity investments.      In fact, over the past decade banks have outperformed mutualfunds, insurance companies and investment advisors in equityfunds under management, according to an annual study conducted byCDA Investment Technologies Inc., an independent investmentperformance measurement service.      The Rockville, Md.-based company also found that banksreaped higher equity returns than insurance companies and mutualfunds over the last three- and five-year periods.      Fixed income returns also fared well, with banks remainingcompetitive with those experienced by mutual fund and insurancecompanies over the last three-, five- and 10-year periods.   Bank Trust Departments Produce Returns as Good as Non-Banks      The survey results are evidence that bank trust departmentsare holding their own and producing good investment returns fortheir clients.      "Not only do the absolute returns compare favorably to ourmajor competitors, but bank-managed portfolios have exhibitedmore consistent results under varying market conditions, areflection of lower risk profiles," said Henry Gooss, managingdirector and chief investment officer of Chemical Bank.      For the one-, three-, and five-year periods, investmentadvisors achieved the highest annualized rate of return inequities, but banks edged them out over the last 10-year period.      The chart below summarizes the study's findings for the one-, three-, five- and 10-year period ended Dec. 31, 1992:ANNUALIZED RATE OF RETURN ON EQUITIES                      1-Yr      3-Yr      5-Yr    10-YrBanks                  8.7%    11.3%      15.7%   15.6%Mutual Funds           8.5%    10.0%      14.0%   13.5%Insurance Cos.         7.5%    10.3%      14.9%   15.4%Investment Advisors    9.3%    11.9%      16.3%   15.3%S&P's 500              7.6%      The survey also found that banks have performed consistentlyin the fixed-income area against mutual funds and insurancecompanies.  Investment advisors were excluded for lack of data.      For the one-year period, banks, at 6.8 percent, wereslightly behind mutual funds (6.9 percent) and insurancecompanies (7.1 percent).  Over the last three years, banksachieved a 9.8 percent annualized rate of return, ahead of mutualfunds (9.4 percent) and behind insurance companies (10.2percent).      Over the five-year period, banks, which achieved a 10-percent annualized rate of return, were again behind insurancecompanies (10.6 percent), but still ahead of mutual funds (9percent).  This pattern repeated itself over the 10-year period,with banks reaping 10.6 percent, mutual funds bringing in 10.2percent and insurance companies achieving 11.3 percent.      The Rockville, Md.-based research firm based its equityresearch on a survey of 1,489 managers, consisting of 217 bank-pooled funds, 73 separate/variable insurance accounts, 577 mutualfunds and 622 investment advisors, which manage a total of $1.2trillion in assets.

The Financial Services Act (H.R. 458), introduced by Rep.Peter Hoagland (D-Neb.) in January, would expand bankers' abilityto engage in full mutual fund activities by permitting banksubsidiaries and affiliates to underwrite and distribute mutualfunds. Mutual funds represent a significant market for bankers.Approximately 120 banks now offer over 675 proprietary mutualfunds; total assets are an estimated $25 billion.  But undercurrent law, banks must use a middleman instead of having fullcontrol over sponsorship and distribution of their own products.      Banks are only permitted to serve as investments advisers,custodians, transfer agents and fund administrators.      National banks, their subsidiaries and bank holding companysubsidiaries are also allowed to both broker and recommendsecurities of investment companies for which they serve asinvestment advisors.   Act Would Give Bankers More Freedom      The act would give bankers the freedom to sponsor,distribute and underwrite mutual fund shares--eliminating theneed to involve a third-party provider. Also, managementinterlocks between a bank or bank holding company and the mutualfund subsidiary would be permissible.  The act would also requireone-time disclosures to be made to customers regarding, amongother things, the lack of FDIC insurance for these investmentproducts.      This bill has seen no action yet.  It was first introducedin the closing hours of the last session, mainly for purposes ofdiscussion.  Keep an eye out.   The Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act      This bill (H.R. 578), introduced by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) in January, would amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,an act criticized by industry players for having no teeth.      The bill proposes to rectify the deficiency by providingenhanced supervision and regulation of investment advisers byproviding for:       Higher registration fees (initial and yearly) forinvestment advisers to fund more SEC inspections and surveys ofunregistered advisers; More frequent SEC examination of high riskadvisers;  A record-keeping requirement to verify suitability;SEC authority to designate a self-regulatory organization toconduct investment adviser examinations; Enhanced disclosurethrough brochures containing general information, advancetransactional reports revealing commissions and third-partypayments, and periodic reports of all charges; Client assets;Disqualification from being an investment adviser for a felonyconviction; Confidentiality with respect to personallyidentifiable information unless consent is given.      Because the bill doesn't propose any change in thedefinition of investment adviser, it wouldn't apply to banks ortheir trust departments as they are currently exempt from thedefinition.  It would, however, have an impact on banks that haveestablished separate subsidiaries.      This act was also introduced last session and passedcommittees in both the House and Senate, but differences couldn'tbe worked out before the recess. Testimony has already begun thissession, and further action is expected.Back to Headline List WT02-B39-29IA074-000493-B043-58http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi27.html 205.156.212.5 19970122011751 text/html 38624HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:15:57 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:21 GMTContent-length: 38437Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi27.html Sample Issue Copyright SECURITIES WEEK via NewsNet January 8, 1996 Vol. 23., N SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES NEW CALIFORNIA ACTION SEEKS RESCISSION OF PRU PARTNERSHIP RESIDUALS (519 words) MEGA-PRODUCER LANYI LANDS AT OPCO'S MIDTOWN BRANCH (168 words) NYSE MEMBERS FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE SEATS AS PRICES SOAR (359 words) LAWYERS FIGHTING OVER ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN NASDAQ ANTITRUST SUIT (257 words) PRU'S FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MANAGER MOVES TO NASHVILLE (120 words) DEBATE REMAINS ON RULES TO ENSURE BEST EXECUTION FOR MULTIPLE TRADED OPTIONS (691 words) NASD SEEKS NEW BROKER/DEALER COMPENSATION LIMITS ON MUTUAL FUND AND VARIABLE CONTRACT SECURITIES (404 words) BROADCASTING ANALYST JOINS SCHRODER WERTHEIM (125 words) STRAUS TO JOIN JEFFERIES AS INSTITUTIONAL SALES MANAGER (77 words) GLAZER TO JOIN WHEAT FIRST IN A NEWLY CREATED POSITION (77 words) VOLPE, WELTY MAKES MANAGEMENT CHANGES FOLLOWING RECORD YEAR (136 words) JOSEPHTHAL'S SATLOFF JOINS PRIME CHARTER (87 words) S.W.I.F.T.

The group, which brought its case in California Superior Court inSacramento County, is also demanding rescission of both the residualpayments and its members' limited partnership investments because the firmfailed to disclose financial incentives for brokers to sell the funds.   Among former high-ranking Prudential Securities executives receivingresidual payments is James Darr, the former head of the firm's DirectInvestment Group, who has frequently been mentioned during investigationsof the firm's partnership problems. According to published reports, Darrhas received more than $2 million in partnership residuals.   ``We're saying that the fraud was not over and done with at the time ofthe sales,'' said Allan Haley, one of three lawyers representing the group.``Every day Prudential pays residuals is a continuation.''Prudential has responded to the claim and a hearing on that response isscheduled for Jan. 30.   The plaintiffs have petitioned the court to enjoin and restrainPrudential from ``making or receiving'' further residual payments withoutfirst making full disclosure of each contractual obligation currently ineffect and offering to rescind each contract for the sale of a Prudentialdirect investment made in California.   The suit also is seeking to rescind each limited partnership sale madeafter Sept. 1, 1982, and force Prudential ``to account for and to disgorgethe profits made through its unlawful and unfair business acts andpractices in California.'' The investors made their partnership purchasesbetween 1983 and 1987.   The foundation of the suit is in a California statute stating anyfinancial interests a broker has in a security must be disclosed prior tothe transaction. Unless the broker notifies the client of the existence ofthe financial interest, a client has a right to cancel the transaction.   ``Not disclosed in any offering document or sales communication directedto any plaintiff or other purchaser was the fact that the registeredrepresentative of PSI making such sale had been given by PSI anindeterminate, open-ended participation in the cash flow, earnings,refinancing and distribution rights held by the PSI affiliate involved inthat PSI partnership,'' according to the plaintiffs' filing.   The suit also includes a 1982 memo from former Prudential CEO GeorgeBall that states: ``Starting September 1st, 50% of Bache's net earningsfrom Tax Investment Group programs, from which Bache Properties, BacheEnergy, or Bache Leasing subsequently earns asset residuals interestsand/or cash flow, will be paid to Account Executives who sell $25,000 ofany such offering.''   Prudential's response said the plaintiffs' claims are made beyond thestatute of limitations, coming eight years after their initial investments,that the California laws under which the claim is filed is pre-empted byFederal statutes, and that the state's Business and Professional code isnot applicable to securities transactions based on a similar 1988 ruling inHawaii.   San Francisco law firm Steefel, Levitt & Weiss is representingPrudential in the case.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NMEGA-PRODUCER LANYI LANDS AT OPCO'S MIDTOWN BRANCHBy:Daniel Colarusso   Andrew Lanyi, author, radio show host, and $4 million-producer, lastweek agreed to bring his team to Oppenheimer & Co.'s Midtown Manhattanoffice from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., branch manager Jordan Berlinconfirmed.

While some NYSE participants seem eager to pay higher prices formembership privileges on the world's largest equities market, others areunwilling or unable to pay up, and drop out, sources said.   Attorney James Rothenberg said that he had unfilled demand from aspecialist and a floor broker wanting to purchase a lease on a seat at anannual cost of $150,000 each, up from recent lease prices of between$130,000 and $140,000. Prices are typically negotiated between the lesseeand the lessor as a private agreement and the NYSE does not get involved,an NYSE spokeswoman said.   Demand for seat leasing is skyrocketing because of the recent rise intrading volume and the positive direction of the market, Rothenberg said.   Sources said that about 740, or more than half of the 1,366 seats on theBig Board, have been leased. The rise in demand for the limited amount ofseats creates major problems for some members, sources said.   ``It's definitely a problem. It's hard to get a lease,'' a source said.A lot of specialists, he noted, are trying to lock in costs by payingpremium prices for two-year leases. They are afraid that next year's pricesmay be even higher, he said. As a result, some two-dollar brokers are notable to make it and they drop out, he noted.   The high prices for seat leases reflect record prices for seat sales,sources noted. One source predicted that a seat soon could go for as muchas $1.15 million up from the last seat sale at $1,05 million in December.   At the end of 1995, the Big Board's market capitalization reached $6trillion. There were 2,675 NYSE-listed companies with 155.2 billion sharesavailable on the exchange, according to statistics from the Federation ofInternational Stock Exchanges.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NLAWYERS FIGHTING OVER ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN NASDAQ ANTITRUST SUITBy:Heike Wipperfurth   Lawyers on both sides of the antitrust suit involving 33 of the biggestNasdaq market makers filed court motions in December accusing the otherside of not providing enough documents, sources said.   The bickering between the opposing sides will be carried into the courtroom for a hearing on January 17 before Judge Robert Sweet in the U.S.District Court for the Southern District of New York, an attorney said.   Defendants' lawyers filed a motion in late December requesting moredocuments relating to how `class' was defined by the plaintiff lawyers, hesaid. Plaintiffs' lawyers, on the other hand, are fighting for additionalaccess to documents and tape recordings and are asking for permission toconfer with the Justice Department, he noted.   Both sides think that they do not have everything they are entitled to,he said. This is ``the typical bickering over how much paper each side isgoing to produce at the beginning of a big case,'' he added.   In addition, the source said that Judge Sweet has to make a decision ona motion filed by the Los Angeles Times in December, requesting, amongother things, that the court break its confidentiality order and provideaccess to the tapes and other material handed over to the plaintiff lawyersby the defendants.   The antitrust suit accusing major Nasdaq market makers of collusion,price fixing and overpricing was filed after an academic study brought topublic attention of indirect evidence of implicit collusion among marketmakers.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NPRU'S FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MANAGER MOVES TO NASHVILLEBy:Daniel Colarusso   Mike Baker, Prudential Securities' former San Francisco branch manager,last week moved to Nashville to take over the firm's branch in the city,sources said.

The letter, while noting that the COOP ``has [previously] endorsed[Phlx's] filing in principal,'' also indicated that it ``has receivedlittle or no support from the other exchanges.''Under Phlx's proposed rule, which was submitted as the exchange's proposalto ensure that customers receive the best offered price on an option at alltimes, when a market maker or specialist at another exchange makes a betterbid than his counterpart at another exchange where the order was firstsubmitted, the order would automatically be sent to the exchange making abetter market.   Part of the Phlx rule also requires that public customer orders bedesignated as ``Principal Acting as Agent,'' or PA orders, to differentiatethem from trades submitted by institutional customers. However, sourcessaid, that rule provision has led to some market makers and specialistsrefusing to honor posted prices for anything other than small customerorders.   Previously, a majority of the industry had instead supported, and stillsupport, a so-called ``Trade or Fade'' rule, which allows market makers andspecialists to match a better bid, or to contact his counterpart at theother exchange to negotiate the price. Then, if the market maker orspecialist making the better bid decides not to deal with his counterparthe can withdraw (fade) the bid.   While the Trade or Fade rule has been used up until now, the COOP notedin its letter to the SEC that several exchanges have indicated that ``theirmarket-makers/specialists match the Best Bid/Offer (BBO) [only] 93% of thetime they receive options orders that are eligible for automatedexecution.''Although the COOP called the results ``a commendable feat,'' it alsoindicated that ``the member firm community is very concerned about theportion of the remaining 7% who do not obtain the BBO.''   The Trade or Fade rule, the COOP added, is by it nature limited inaddressing the problem, and it added that in any case ``it has beenreported that some trading crowds are not honoring Trade or Fadeprocedures.''Phlx's rule would seem to solve the problem, but the COOP noted in itsletter that the nation's other four options exchange don't support it.   In the past, the other exchanges have argued that to properly implementa Trade or Send rule a fully automated linkage system would need to bedeveloped, something that was originally part of an overall plan for themultiple trading environment but that was abandoned as too costly beforemultiple listing was imposed on the entire market for new listings.   As a compromise, Phlx's rule was supported in principal with theprovision that the exchange make various adjustments, but sources indicatedthat many COOP members now regret the endorsement.   For its part, the SEC has not been pressuring the exchanges extensivelyto accept a standardized rule, probably because the BBO has occurred in thevast majority of cases. With competition for new listings heating up,though, the agency could begin to push the industry more strongly.   Previously the regulator delayed a vote on any rule regarding the issueuntil December of last year, allowing a November deadline to pass. Thecurrent government shutdown followed, so the agency has yet to act and it'sunclear when it will be able to do so.   In the meantime, the COOP has scheduled a meeting for this Saturday forindustry representatives to discuss the issue, along with some otherissues. Among the topics to be discussed will be whether to reconsider thedevelopment of a linkage system to determine if it would be ``economicallyfeasible.''   Separately, The Options Industry Council, an educational andinformational group comprised of the nation's options exchanges and TheOptions Clearing Corp., last week reported that equity options volumereached an all-time high in 1995, with 174.4 million contracts changinghands, surpassing the previous record, set in 1987, by 6%.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NNASD SEEKS NEW BROKER/DEALER COMPENSATION LIMITS ON MUTUAL FUND ANDVARIABLE CONTRACT SECURITIES   The NASD is seeking SEC approval to amend its Rules of Fair Practice tolimit the use of ``cash and non-cash compensation received bybroker/dealers who sell mutual funds and variable contract securities.''   The NASD said the amendments would ``tighten and broaden existing ruleson the sale of these investment products,'' and added that they wereproposed ``in response to the increased use of non-cash compensation andcertain types of incentive-based cash compensation for the sale ofinvestment company and variable contract securities.''   Such practices, the NASD said, ``may heighten the potential for amember's loss of supervisory control over sales practices and increase thepossibility of the perception of impropriety,'' resulting in a loss ofinvestor confidence.   Broadly, the new rule amendments would do the following:   -- Prohibit, except under certain circumstances, broker/dealers fromreceiving any cash or non-cash compensation from anyone other than the NASDmember with which the individual is associated.   -- Require that NASD members maintain records of compensation receivedfrom an investment company, an adviser to an investment company, a fundadministrator, an underwriter and any affiliated person.   -- Prohibit receipt by a broker of cash compensation in connection withthe sale of investment company securities, unless the arrangement isdescribed in the current prospectus.   -- Retain the prohibition, only with respect to the Investment CompanyRule, against a broker receiving compensation in the form of securities.   -- Prohibit, with some exceptions, NASD members and associated personsfrom accepting, directly or indirectly, any non-cash compensation inconnection with the sale of investment company and variable contractsecurities.   -- Prohibit, again with certain exceptions, an associated person fromaccepting cash sales incentives for the sale of investment company orvariable contract securities.   Separately, the NASD has also submitted new rules to the SEC designed toeliminate potential confusion by investors purchasing mutual funds andsimilar products on the premises of banks, savings and loans, credit unionsand other financial institutions other than broker/dealers.   The new rule would require NASD member firms, among other things, toconduct business in a location distinct from the area where retail depositsare taken whenever possible; provide customers with a written documentoutlining differences in insurance coverage and risks for securities andinstitution deposits; and prohibit member firms from making payments,including referral fees, to individuals employed by the financialinstitution who are not registered with the member firm.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NBROADCASTING ANALYST JOINS SCHRODER WERTHEIMBy:Heike Wipperfurth   Eric Stewart last week joined Schroder Wertheim & Co. as a broadcastanalyst, expanding the research coverage of its media group.

Cited first by the exchange was the linkage agreement between Liffe andthe Chicago Board of Trade, which was formally signed just last month aftermonths of prior negotiations.   Liffe noted that the linkage will provide market users with increasedaccess to major government debt futures and options products on both sidesof the Atlantic during U.S. and European business hours. Initially, thelinkage will include Liffe's German government bond (bund) contract and theCBT's U.S. Treasury bond contract, which are scheduled to begin trading inthe second quarter of this year.   Next, the exchange said, in April of this year it will commence anotherlinkage with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange that, underan agreement signed last year, will begin the trading of a fungiblethree-month Euroyen futures contract.   Also slated for this year is a merger between Liffe and the LondonCommodity Exchange, which the exchange said will be the first step in``providing a platform for the development of a liquid European time zoneagricultural and soft commodity complex in London.''   In an effort to maintain a leading technological edge, Liffe noted thatthis month it would launch its APT trading system for options, a move itsaid would create the first fully functional screen-based options tradingsystem in the world.   Other technological initiatives, the exchange said, include thedevelopment of its so-called LOTS system, designed to provide theindustry's first comprehensive electronic business processing system, andthe development of an unnamed automated system for its equity optionscomplex.   Finally, the exchange noted that an agreement has been reached withLondon Stock Exchange for Liffe to lease the LSE's former trading floor,office and storage space, which will allow it to meet its medium-termneeds.   Like other exchanges around the world last year, Liffe suffered a dropin volume compared with the prior record year, but still had its secondbusiest year ever. The exchange indicated that the various initiatives ithas in store for 1996 will help it continue to grow.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightSECURITIES WEEK via NewsNetJanuary 8, 1996   Vol. 23., NCHICAGO MERC PROPOSES FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON BRAZILIAN AND ARGENTINEBRADYS   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week filed for regulatory approvalto trade futures on Brady Bond indexes based on Brazilian and Argentineissues.

This forms part of the MITI's overallstrategy to promote a wider range of applications for electroniccommerce.According to Visa, the pilot of the Smart Commerce Japan project willinvolve the distribution of 35,000 chip cards which will conform to theEMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) specifications, together withcompact stored-value card readers, to current Visa cardholders who haveexperience using the Internet.A source at Visa Japan told SCB that other Internet projects are alsobeing conceived by the ministry. Following the test of Smart CommerceJapan, it is expected the MITI will develop other electronic datainterchange (EDI) type systems for the Internet.Other systems being envisioned will facilitate the exchange oftrade-related information between individuals and corporations on theInternet, with later systems allowing similar exchanges betweencorporations.The Smart Commerce Japan project is slated for a pilot debut in thefirst quarter of 1997. It is believed to be the world's first system tocombine the EMV-compatible integrated chip card for electroniccommerce. Other payment systems available on the Internet are based onconventional magnetic stripe technology.The project will allow Visa cardholders to use their card not only forcredit and debit transactions but also for stored-value transactions onthe Internet. Cardholders might even be able to load up theirreloadable stored-value cards on special terminals in their homes.Team leader of Smart Commerce Japan, Toshiba Corporation, said theproject will promote electronic shopping and put powerful chip cardsinto the hands of thousands of Japanese consumers.The project is undertaken by a consortium headed by Toshiba and willalso involve international credit card association, Visa International,Daiei Group, Japan's largest retailer and the Hankyu Toho Group, adiversified entertainment, retail and transportation group.A spokesperson for Toshiba said the company's role in the project willinvolve the provision of system integration from the EMV compatiblechip card and related devices to back-end servers.According to Visa, the lack of security for financial transactions overopen networks has hampered the development of electronic commerce. Toovercome this constraint, Toshiba and Visa have revealed that they willbe working to develop hardware applications to facilitate securepayment over the Internet. It is expected that when the pilot commencesin the first quarter of 1997, a common application standard willalready be in place.Visa International had earlier partnered software giant, Microsoft, todevelop Secure Transaction Technology (STT), an open standard forsecurity and payment applications. Visa would not confirm whetherMicrosoft are involved in the Japanese project.A source at MasterCard, the other international card associationcurrently developing a standard for secured Internet paymenttransactions, said: "It is perplexing that for Internet transactions,which are global in nature, it is necessary to create a Japanesestandard for secured payment. We will certainly be watching thisproject with interest."The source at Visa, however, said there is no intention to create aJapanese standard for secured transactions. "The objective is not tocreate a de facto standard, if another standard comes out and is wellaccepted, we will use that. But what we do want to create isinternational operability. There will eventually be a commonality ofstandards between what Visa and MasterCard are attempting to do."A spokesman for Toshiba said: "We will adopt a world-standard securitytechnology, which is compatible with the settlement system forEMV-based IC cards."It is understood that Toshiba will co-operate with NetscapeCommunications Corporation, a leading Internet-related softwareprovider, to develop the Internet platform for the project. It willalso develop the system for EMV chip transactions over the Internet, aswell as the Sun Microsystems' Java-based interface software between theEMV chip card and the transaction system.Visa said that, during the pilot, experiments will be conducted to findways to deliver the convenience of shopping in cyberspace to those whodo not own a home PC, such as the construction of"Virtual Mall Kiosks"placed in convenient locations. Several credit card issuers, majorretailers and Japan's leading banks will be involved in the pilot.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

According to Jones, Stewart will be a "relationship managerfor all of the Americas", with Canada, the US and other nationalsubsidiaries reporting through his office."We'd like to get Canada and the US operational on an integrated basisand then expand southward," to Latin America, Stewart told SCB in arecent interview. Stewart has a business as well as technicalbackground from his days with AT&T's Bell Laboratories, where he wasinvolved with research and development."If you're dealing with North American corporations, it's important tohave someone on the ground, in the same time zone, available formeetings at short notice. He'll sweep the whole load of issues. We havemore people wanting to talk to us than we can cope with at the moment,"Jones said, though he declined to identify the banks involved.In the US, to date, Mondex has encountered heavy resistance and has notyet been embraced. Detractors claim that US regulators will neverauthorise Mondex because it is harder to audit and control centrally.Mondex is the only electronic purse scheme that proposes card-to-cardtransfers between users without requiring that transactions be routedthrough a central clearing mechanism. This will only encourage taxevasion and money laundering, critics have said.But Stewart said he was optimistic that regulators at the office forComptroller of the Currency and the federal Reserve Board would beconvinced of security and integrity of the Mondex scheme.In mid-1995, Mondex got its first foothold in the US at Wells FargoBank, which initiated a test among fewer than 100 employees. Jones saidhe hopes the $50 billion-asset San Francisco bank will roll out thesystem and become a charter member of the Mondex USA franchise.Elsewhere, according to an industry observer, NationsBank and NBDMichigan (National Bank of Detroit) are said to be in discussions withMondex. Spokesmen from the two banks declined to comment.There is also speculation that Midland Marine Bank of Buffalo willparticipate, since it is owned by the UK Midland Bank, the otherfounder of Mondex.In another significant development last month, National WestminsterGroup, which created Mondex in conjunction with Midland Group, sold NewJersey-based subsidiary NatWest Bancorp.The bank, which owns retail branches in the New York City area and acredit card bank based in Delaware, was purchased by Fleet FinancialGroup of Boston in a cash deal worth $3.26 billion. Jones said it hadbeen pretty obvious that NatWest USA would be an important part ofMondex USA, but that discussions have already begun with Fleet.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

"On the one hand, we are helping our Spanishcounterparts to actually set up their own electronic purse and, on theother hand, we are providing, on a more general level, basic know-howand information to countries as diverse as Israel, Brazil, the UK,France and Canada".She added that the Spanish electronic purse project should be up andrunning by mid-1996."Both SIBS and the Spanish banking sector are keento make the two systems mutually acceptable, which means the Portuguesewill be able to use their electronic purse in Spain, and vice versa.SIBS says the number of electronic purses in circulation is risingfaster than had been expected. Luis Cid, head of SIBS, recently toldjournalists that Portugal issued in the month of October alone what ittook the Danish three years to achieve.However, he conceded that the numbers are still well below the 10million cards SIBS expects to be in circulation within the next fiveyears.SIBS has already sold around 360,000 cards to the country's banks.Until October 1995, over 100,000 cards were in circulation, with atotal loaded value of Esc174 million ($1.16 million). In the sameperiod, there were 7,028 POS terminals in operation, 4,343 of whichwere off-line terminals exclusively for the electronic purse. Of thisnumber, 43 had been integrated into vending machines of various kinds.The value of the average payment transaction (of which there were over685,000 in the first nine months of the electronic purse's career) isEsc370 ($2.5), which substitute for petty cash payments.SIBS also says that the upgrading of the country's ATMs to acceptelectronic purse loading facilities is virtually completed and that theelectronic purse will be usable nationwide within two years.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

At the moment,these purchases are carried out from a distance (by telephone, fax,minitel or ordinary mail) in 90 percent of cases.Every Carte Bleue member bank will be able to market the purchasingservice, and to personalise it, should it wish to do so, in order tosatisfy the requirements of its client companies.The purchasing system, as it is defined today, will work from a commonoperational core, which will have to evolve in order to become richeras its market develops both nationally and internationally.In 1994, the Groupement Carte Bleue conducted two studies of the waypotential customer firms viewed the service. What emerged from them wasthat 38 percent of those surveyed expressed an interest in the service.A study carried out in 1994 by Andersen Consulting evaluated the Frenchpotential for service purchasing to be more than Fr110 billion, butonly took into account the market involving the country's 500 largestfirms in terms of turnover.Jean-Marc Bornet, the chief executive of Carte Bleue, told CI that hehad great confidence in the future of the purchasing service: "Thequestion arose as to whether the purchasing service would beexperimented jointly once it had appeared in the Carte Bleue catalogue,but the Groupement finally decided against this."French banks will, in fact, start off with the new product at theirown individual pace. It should be remembered that a large number oftelematic services are already offered to companies by French banks,and the role of the purchasing service is to enrich the servicesalready available".Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

However, central bank regulators in the country haveexpressed reservations about a possible loss of revenue if stored-valuecards (SVC) take off.According to a report published by Visa International, called Payments2001, the number of chip-based cards in Australia will swell to 27million by the year 2001. Meanwhile, the number of consumers holdingcards is expected to rise to 2.8 million by the same year.One of the greatest breakthroughs that will be facilitated by smartcards is the ability to load funds on to the card at home. This couldbe the catalyst for a massive increase in the use of home bankingservices, said the report.The Australian market also has the benefit of a sophisticatedtelecommunications infrastructure. "The hurdles to connectivity arealready coming down. One fundamental is the broad band cable which isbeing laid through Australian suburbs and which will not only provideAustralians with Pay TV but also all the utility of two-way datacommunication in cyberspace."In a survey conducted by Visa, Australian consumers were asked toevaluate three stored-value options - a disposable card, a stand-alonereloadable card and a multifunction card. The survey found that 72percent of respondents favoured some form of stored-value function. Ofthat figure, 44 percent want the chip embedded on their existingcredit/debit/ATM card. However, a substantial 37 percent preferred adisposable card, while the remaining 19 percent opted for a reloadablecard.Interestingly, disposable cards were preferred by those consumers whothought of buying the cards for family and friends as gifts. "Almost 50percent of Australian consumers would buy disposable cards for someoneelse, and 40 percent would buy stand-alone reloadable cards forothers."Another finding of the report was that 88 percent of consumers wantedthe capability to reload value onto their SVC at any ATM or eftposdevice and about 46 percent wanted the option of reloading the card athome through a special device.Identifying and signing the right merchants was given as an essentialrequirement for the success of stored-value cards. Petrol stations werehighlighted as the most important, with 61 percent saying they wantedto use their card there. Meanwhile, 60 percent identified grocerystores, 40 percent pointed to payphones, 34 percent buses and trains,and 29 percent mentioned post offices.One issue which has not been resolved is the reaction of regulators toa potentially radical shift in the means of payments. At the moment,central banks earn money from issuing notes and coins, calledseigniorage.According to Ray Jones, assistant secretary of the business finance andsuperannuation branch of the Australian Federal Reserve: "The fiscalimpact of stored value cards will depend upon the speed and extent oftheir market penetration. A sudden loss of a substantial revenue streamwould naturally have some public finance implications, but whether thisis a likely outcome is by no means clear at the moment."According to Ian Harper in an article in The Australian FinancialReview, "they [stored-value] represent the first real threat to the useof currency notes and coins in everyday payments. The bank and theTreasury fear this may at last be about to change. And they have muchto lose."However, he went on to say "there does not appear to be any significantdownward trend in seigniorage earned by the banks", but he attributedthis to the fact that stored-value cards are in their infancy.Harper predicts that the Reserve Bank will not allow this revenuestream disappear if stored-value does take off. "The bank also earnsseigniorage by obliging banks to hold compulsory reserves with it andpaying them low rates of interest or none at all. The trouble is thatbanks might not be the main players in stored-value cards."The real worry for the Reserve Bank and the Treasury is the prospectof multiple issuers which have no connection with the banking system atall and no reason to pay seigniorage to the Reserve Bank," said Harper.Copyright:  Lafferty Publications Limited.

Since the appointment of a new management team in May 1991,the company has taken streamlining and other special pretax chargestotaling $196 million (including $38 million in the fourth quarter of1995), invested more than $200 million in equipment and plant expansions toposition itself for growth and productivity improvements, and made nineacquisitions having an aggregate purchase price of over $400 million.   The company maintains 14 printing plants, one warehouse, oneprepress/warehouse facility, five prepress facilities, onedistribution/bindery facility, two distribution centers, and one multimediafacility. The company supplies all of the ink and a substantial amount ofthe paper it uses. An extensive network of sales offices located throughoutthe U.S. is staffed by approximately 250 sales and marketingrepresentatives.   Assuming exercise of the overallotment option, KKR is sellingapproximately 12 million of the shares being offered, affiliates of MerrillLynch are selling about 2 million shares, and numerous less than onepercent holders are selling their shares. KKR's stake will be reduced to50.1% (approximately 49% assuming exercise of the overallotment option).Certain minority shareholders have agreed not to sell any of theirremaining shares for 120 days after the close of the offering, and thecompany, KKR, and remaining stockholders have agreed not to do so for 180days. As of October 1, 1995, debt was 59% of total capital. In 1995,lenders increased the maximum available under the company's creditfacilities, of which about $89 million remains available.   Since 1991, the actions of the new management have resulted in asignificant improvement in profitability. Measured by adjusted operatingincome margin which excludes steamlining and other special charges,profitability has increased from 3.4% of revenues in 1991 to 7.1% in thefirst nine months of 1995. This has occurred despite that revenue growthover that time has largely been derived from acquisitions and increases inpaper prices, offset to some extent by higher paper costs.   Because of the company's substantial leverage, we think free cash flowis a good method of valuation. Importantly, cash flow has been adequate topay down a substantial amount of acquired debt. The company projectscapital expenditures in 1996 will total $75 million and scheduled debtprincipal payments total $21 million, leaving free cash flow by ourestimate of about $20.5 million, or $0.60 a share. We also expect free cashflow will increase an average 40% annually over the next several years asdebt is repaid. Discounting projected free cash flow at the riskfree rate,the stock price could increase 100% to 125% over a five year period. In theshort term we see the stock climbing to 22 to 24. We recommend purchase ofthe shares as a long term holding.Underwriters: Donaldson, Lufkin; CS First Boston; Morgan Stanley;PaineWebber; Smith Barney. Offering: 13,780,328 com. shs.

The New York MTA,with 26.8 million people, has the highest population of any MTA in thenation. The FCC determined the company's license fee at 85% of the averageper population price of the winning bids for the top 23 MTAs, times the NewYork MTA's population. The company has been accruing interest on thisobligation at the prime rate and expects interest only payments to begin in1996. The company is also participating in the Entrepreneurs' Band Auctionfor small businesses for additional PCS licenses in each of the 493 BasicTrading Areas.   The Omnipoint System has been designated by a key industry standardsetting group as IS-661. IS-661 is one of four technical common airinterfaces (CAI) competing for adoption by PCS license holders, the othersbeing PCS-1900, a system similar to the digital wireless standard commonacross Europe and adopted in many other countries, CDMA, and TDMA, both ofwhich are being upbanded to the 1900 MHz section of the radio spectrum fromcurrent cellular technologies.   Each CAI has its proponents among equipment manufacturers and serviceproviders. The Omnipoint System, as the company proposes to implementIS-661, is a hybrid system that will interface with PCS-1900 based systems.It also incorporates certain coding features of CDMA between cell sites,but uses timing features of TDMA within cells to separate channels. Thecompany expects that initial capital costs to deploy a commercial IS-661system, incremental capital costs per subscriber, and ability to rapidlyscale up a system as demand grows, will enable it to offer a variety ofwireless services at lower costs than current cellular and wirelinecompetitors.   The company has entered into or committed to agreements with NorthernTelecom for Omnipoint to buy, and for Telecom to sell infrastructureequipment and finance system buildout, up to $612 million. It has alsoentered into a series of agreements with Ericsson for, among other things,the development of dual mode IS-661/PCS-1900 handsets. The agreementsobligate the company to purchase $250 million of infrastructure equipmentand $100 million of handsets from Ericsson, which will provide up to $375million of vendor financing. Additional handset development, manufacturing,marketing and sale agreements have been entered into with JRC Internationaland Hansol Paper Co., the latter being primarily in Korea and other partsof Asia.   Proceeds from the offering will be used for interest payments on the NewYork MTA license, for development and marketing of Omnipoint technology andequipment, and in connection with additional PCS licenses, if any,purchased by the company. Other than the New York MTA license obligation,other debt as of September 30, 1995 totaled $26 million.   The three largest shareholders are Avance Capital, which will own 22% ofthe outstanding shares, Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, L.P. 16%, andAllen & Co. 9.7%. Insiders and their affiliates in the aggregate willcontrol 64% of the stock. About 1.2 million shares will be eligible forsale in the public market beginning 90 days after the offering closes, and26.4 million upon expiration of the underwriter's 180 day lockup period.   Although IS-661 has obtained separate CAI designation, IS-661 systemsare designed to be compatible with PCS-1900 systems. PacBell and BellSouth, which will construct PCS-1900 systems in certain license areas, havetentatively agreed to provide each others' subscribers with roamingcapability in the others' license areas. The company expects to have apilot system in operation in New York City in the first half of 1996, andto begin wider deployment by the end of the year.   Significant revenues will not occur until 1997, even if all goesaccording to plan, which it will likely not, judging by the experience ofother wireless service firms. We believe losses will be sustained through1999. Nevertheless, based on per POP valuations of wireless services firms,we think the stock price will initially rise from the 13 to 15 rangeproposed for the offering, but is likely to be volatile as quarterlyresults exceed or fall short of expectations.

The company exited the retail arenain early 1994, which was conducted primarily through the Computerlandfranchise business.   The current business strategy is predicated on the belief that themarket for outsourced PC network services is growing at a compound annualrate of more than 14%, and that profitability can grow at a faster ratebecause the valued added services which comprise a growing percentage ofthe company's business have higher margins than the traditional serviceswhich it provided, such as product procurement and repair and maintenance.   The company's technical workforce currently exceeds 2,200 employeesnationwide, including a rapidly expanding systems engineering force, whichgrew from about 200 in March 1994 to over 600 as of October 1995. Thecompany will seek to expand its business globally by entering strategicalliances with international partners. Over the past four quarters, about225 customers purchased products and services totaling at least $1 million.The domestic sales network as of October 31, 1995 consisted of over 540field sales and service representatives. A variety of service automationsoftware products have been implemented to reduce the cost and enhance thedelivery of the services to the customer. Products from over 700 vendorsare provided.   Proceeds from the sale of eight million shares for the company will beused to repay debt. The company maintains a $425 million credit facilitywith IBM Credit Corp. at prime plus 1.06%. As of July 31, 1995, long termdebt would have been 70% of committed capital on a pro forma basis,however, this is somewhat misleading since a large portion of the creditfacility is used to finance inventory.

About 80% ofthe documents generated each year are not needed for frequent reference,and can be considered inactive records, for which it provides storageservices in 66 facilities in 25 markets across the U.S. containing anaggregate of 4.9 million square feet of space.   As of September 30, 1995, Iron Mountain stored approximately 21 million1.2 cubic foot cartons for 14,000 customers. New customers are obtained bya dedicated sales force. An ongoing fee is collected for storage, andnonrecurring fees are charged for storage materials and services, such asdocument retrieval. The company also provides vital records services foritems such as master audio and video recordings, and provides courierservices via a fleet of approximately 200 vehicles. We believe that growthin the number of documents generated and outsourcing of document storageactivities has resulted in an increase in the number of cartons storedwhich has outpaced the 4% attrition rate experienced by the company due todestruction or permanent removal. Internal growth has been augmented byadditions of new customers and acquisitions of other document storagebusinesses.   Proceeds from the shares sold on the company's behalf will be used toredeem a warrant, fund several pending acquisitions and repay debt incurredfor other recently completed acquisitions. Long term debt on a pro formabasis as of September 30, 1995 was 64% of total capital. About $17 millionwas subsequently borrowed to fund recently completed acquisitions. CEORichard Reese will own 16% of the stock outstanding after the offering, andVincent J. Ryan will control 36%, including 20% held by Schooner CapitalCorp. The sellers are Schooner, Chase Manhattan Investment Holdings, andSecurity Pacific Capital Investors, L.P. A small number of shares becomeeligible for sale in the public market beginning 90 days after theoffering, but most of the currently outstanding shares are subject to a 180day (360 day in the case of Ryan and Schooner) underwriter's lockupagreement.   Although there will be about $47 million of additional borrowingcapacity available under the company's credit agreement, we believe thatfurther leverage would necessitate the curtailment of planned capitalexpenditures. It already appears that current obligations have beenextended to maintain debt levels at their current level. If additional debtis assumed for more acquisitions, as is the company's plan, we think thatit will have difficulty meeting interest and scheduled principal repaymentsafter 1998. Scheduled payments this year of about $2 million, and of $3.3million and $3.4 million in 1997 and 1998 should not be a problem, but the$8.3 million payment in 1999 becomes difficult if the balance sheet isleveraged further.   How did the company get into its current financial position? We thinkit overpaid for the businesses it has acquired, paying about 2.1X revenues,which is the same ratio of our 1996 revenue projection to the proposedmarket capitalization of equity plus debt.

SCA is characterized by rapid and irregular heart beat, orventricular fibrillation, in which the heart's normal electrical signalsbecome disorganized and erratic, causing the heart to cease pumping bloodwithin a few minutes. Defibrillation involving the application of anelectric shock to the heart, causing it to resume a regular rhythm, isnecessary to prevent death from SCA. It has been documented that timelydefibrillation can boost the survival rate from SCA to over 70%. Oftenparamedics or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) equipped and trained inthe use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) do not arrive on sitequickly enough, resulting in average SCA survival rates in the U.S. of 5%.AEDs use computer technology to interpret the patient's heartbeat todetermine if defibrillation is necessary. This contrasts with hospitalbased defibrillation units with which most people are familiar, thatrequire medical personnel to interpret an electrocardiogram.   This company has developed and clinically tested an AED which itbelieves is easier to use and maintain, requires less training, and costsless than current AEDs in use. The American Heart Association (AHA) hasendorsed the training and use of AEDs by ``first responders'', i.e. policeand fire personnel in addition the paramedics and EMTs, and The Departmentof Transportation has adopted guidelines which include AED training forEMTs beginning in 1995. The goal is that police and fire personnel, whotypically are on the scene prior to medical personnel, can administer AEDin a timely manner. Also, EMTs, who usually receive substantially lesstraining than paramedics, are typically not trained in the use of AEDs dueto the expense of training and purchasing AEDs for EMT ambulances.   The company has conducted two clinical trials which show no differencein efficacy between its AED, called the ForeRunner, and AEDs currently onthe market. The trials actually measured the efficacy of a method ofdelivering the electric shock that uses lower energy relative to thestandard higher energy AEDs currently in use. A 510(k) application to theFDA was submitted in December 1995 for clearance to market the ForeRunneron the basis that it is substantially equivalent to AEDs that have been onthe market since before 1976.   Proceeds from the offering and cash on hand, which together on a proforma basis totaled $49 million as of September 30, 1995, will be used tofund product introduction, to build a sales and marketing organization, forcontinuing research and development, and for working capital and generalcorporate purposes. Long term obligations are nominal. Four venture fundgroups will own 5% or more of the stock to be outstanding after theoffering, including entities affiliated with Mayfield Fund 23%, OakInvestment Partners 7%, Weiss, Peck & Greer 6%, and Medical Innovation FundII, L.P. 5%. Insiders in the aggregate will own 37%. Future sales of nearlyall of the shares currently outstanding are subject to a 180 dayunderwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume limitations.   Despite the submission of a 510(k) application to the FDA, we mustclassify this offering as speculative. The FDA may require additionalclinical data or may rule that the ForeRunner does not qualify for pre-1976device equivalency. The ForeRunner has never been tested in the field. Thelow energy electrical stimulation which it uses does not meet current AHAguidelines, and certain states have additional laws regarding which AEDsmay be used. The company and five of its founding employees are subject toa lawsuit brought by their former employer alleging misappropriation oftrade secrets and tortious interference with business relations. Even ifall these issues are resolved, we believe it will take at least three orfour years for the company to become profitable.

Among the services which the companyprovides are Phase I clinical testing, laboratory analysis, Phase II-IVclinical trial management, clinical data management and biostatisticalanalysis, treatment investigational new drug applications, medical writingand regulatory compliance, and health care economics and outcomesresearch.   In the nine months ended September 30, 1995, the pharmaceutical industryaccounted for 74% of net revenues, biotechnology 16%, the NationalInstitutes of Health 8%, and other 2%. Therapeutic areas from whichrevenues were derived were virology/AIDS/infectious diseases 30%,gastroenterology/metabolic diseases 27%, critical care 11%,pulmonary/allergy 11%, central nervous system 10%, and other 12%. AtSeptember 30, 1995, there were 165 active contracts with about 110 clientsin the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and the backlog was $50.2 million, versus$21.6 million a year earlier.   Contracts are based on specific project proposals developed by thecompany's business development personnel in response to potential clients'requests. We believe the contract cycle can be quite lengthy. Contracts areusually on a fixed price basis, so the company bears the risk of costoverruns. Senior management has experience with the regulatory process inprevious positions with Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. At September 30,1995, 86 employees had post-graduate degrees.   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt incurred to make afinal S corporation distribution to current stockholders. Total debtoutstanding will equal 14% of total capitalization. The company will seekto renegotiate the terms and the amount of its credit facility. Insiderswill own 77% of the shares outstanding after the offering. Most of thecurrently outstanding shares become eligible for public sale under Rule 144after a 180 day lockup period.   We estimate revenues per employee in 1995 will be about $78,000, whichseems low. It is likely that the company has been adding significantnumbers of business development, research and other personnel, which havenot been reflected yet in revenue growth. This is supported by thesubstantial increase in backlog and in the rise in selling, general andadministrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 20.4% in 1993 to33.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 1995. The revenue per employeemay be misleading. Even so, we find it difficult to believe thatcompensation levels at the company are adequate to motivate professionalresearch personnel. A recently adopted stock option plan should aidemployee retention. The company has likely benefited in its hiring fromdownsizing of R&D staffs at major pharmaceutical firms that have beenacquired.   Still, we think that a business in which the overwhelming key to successis the performance of its employees in conducting research under fixedprice contracts, in which many variables can lead to unpredictable resultsand cost overruns, and which is not capital intensive, is better suited tobe a privately held entity. Minority shareholders are apt to find theirinterests do not always come first. Moreover, at 30X our $0.50 EPS for 1996on revenues of $55 million (with 24% more shares outstanding), whichrepresent 43% and 47% gains over projected EPS of $0.35 (pro forma forincome tax provision) and revenues of $37.5 million, we believe the sharesare amply valued.

Examples include voice mail andautomated call routing. Increasingly, computer telephony integrationapplications are being developed for more important transactions such asbrokerage orders and mail order pharmaceuticals, for example. Voice recordshave long been kept for critical communications such as emergency responsecenters and air traffic control facilities. Organizations' growing need torecord, process, and store large amounts of voice data has resulted in theintroduction of digitally based voice logging systems that can handle largevolumes of calls at lower costs.   This Israeli based company's principal product, NiceLog, can record,store and retrieve up to thousands of analog and digital telephone linesand radio channels, and enables simultaneous access by multiple users.NiceLog incorporates enhanced digital networking and voice processingtechnologies in the areas of computer telephony integration, digital signalprocessing, mass storage and database management. It uses an openarchitecture that provides connectivity options to networks such as Novell,IPX, and TCP/IP using DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and UNIX operating systems(a Windows 95 version is expected to be introduced in 1996), andtelecommunications interfaces such as T1, E1, ISDN, and analog trunks.   An add-on module, Call Logging System, enables prompt location andretrieval of data records according to several key record details, such astime of call, duration, extension number, and calling number. The companyhas sold hundreds of NiceLog units (each capable of handling 96 channels),to more than 150 users worldwide. A fax logger and a logging system forcustomers with requirements in the eight to 24 channel range are underdevelopment. The company also develops and sells communicationsintelligence systems, primarily the NiceFix, which enables users to detect,locate, and monitor transmissions, or ``get a fix'' on the transmittingobject, and provides engineering services for other defense applications.   The company primarily sells its products to distributors specializing inthe voice logging market. For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, 86%of total sales were to customers outside of Israel and 52% were tocustomers in the U.S. The company has arrangements with IPC InformationSystems and Etrali, two trading room switching equipment suppliers, tomarket its products, and with Northern Telecom and AspectTelecommunications to market the compatibility features of NiceLog withtheir automated call distribution systems. Contracts have been won tosupply up to 800 U.S. air traffic control centers with NiceLog systems overseven years and for the air traffic logging system at the new Hong Kongairport. These two contracts have a combined value of $3.4 million to $13million, for a period of one to seven years.   Proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporatepurposes. The ordinary shares trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and on12/27/95 closed at 10 13/16. In October 1995, the company sold its 57%stake in NiceCom, a developer of advanced data communications switches, to3Com for $53 million, and subsequently paid dividends of $2.10 per share.No long term debt is outstanding. Insiders as a group will own 19% of theshares outstanding after the offering.   The U.S. air traffic system contract award is a major win because itgives credibility to the company in the U.S. Still, the company hasgenerally not been profitable, and despite the contract award, we do notthink the company's products have a clear technological advantage overcompeting systems. Most costs are recorded in New Israeli Shekels, whilemost sales are made in, and the reporting currency is, dollars. Israeliinflation in recent years has exceeded the rate of devaluation of theshekel against the dollar, thereby lowering dollar earnings. This and thedividends paid after the sale of NiceCom made the shares more attractive toIsraeli investors, who may have pushed up the stock price, despite the lackof dollar profits.   It is not assured that a liquid market will develop for the ADSs. Therecent dollar equivalent share price in Tel Aviv is about 23X our $0.45 EPSestimate for 1996. We do not believe this adequately discounts the risks ofbuying the stock, and we would avoid the shares.Underwriters: Lehman Brothers; Oppenheimer. Offering: 2,000,000 ADSs (allby the company).

It also owns a 44% interest in a newlyformed management services organization for a physician association basedin Connecticut of over 240 multi-specialty physicians and has a 50%interest in a medical facility development company. The business is theconglomeration of several physician management firms operated under commoncontrol by CEO Abraham D. Gosman, who is also CEO of Meditrust and foundedThe Mediplex Group, which was acquired by Sun Healthcare Group in June1994.   Several factors are combining to put the solo physician or smallpartnership practice at a disadvantage to management organizations. Forexample, the information systems that are necessary to respond to therequirements of managed care organizations and the Medicare and Medicaidprograms are costly and usually beyond the means of most practices. Byjoining a physician management organization, physicians can cut costs andreduce the volatility of their earnings. In other words, the changingpayment structure of the U.S. healthcare system has made the practicemanagement model a better deal for most physicians. Healthcare reformsbeing proposed should only bring more pressure to bear on physicians tojoin management groups.   Up to $32 million of offering proceeds will be used to repayindebtedness to Mr. Gosman and about $50 million will be used to repayobligations guaranteed by, or to substitute for collateral provided byGosman. On a pro forma basis, long term debt would be 18% of total capital.The company is negotiating to obtain an acquisition/working capital line ofcredit. Gosman will own 40% of the stock outstanding after the offering.All of the shares to be issued to him and other management and foundingstockholders are subject to the holding requirement of the Securities Act,and may not be sold in the open market until the second anniversary of theclosing date of the offering.   The company intends to pursue an aggressive acquisition strategy, sofuture results may vary substantially from our estimates. Industryfundamentals favor physician management organizations, and because only asmall percentage of the approximate 650,000 physicians in the nation havejoined a management group, we think there are ample acquisition candidates.As the company brings more physicians within its structure, it will realizeeconomies of scale and cost efficiencies will result in much improvedmargins.   We are projecting a pro forma loss for 1995 of $0.20 a share on revenuesof $128 million, including a $2.5 million charge in the fourth quarter towrite down certain acquired assets at their book value. In 1996, ourforecast is $160 million in revenues and EPS of $0.25. Tentatively in 1997,revenues could top $200 million, and EPS could more than double.

Thiscompany markets and distributes repair and maintenance products principallyto the apartment housing market, and in 1995 initiated sales to thehospitality, health care, and institutional markets.   The primary marketing tool is the Wilmar Master Catalog, containing over14,000 skus of standard and specialty plumbing products, 36% of sales inthe first nine months of 1995, electrical 19%, hardware 16%, chemical andjanitorial 6%, appliance parts 5%, window and floor coverings 5%, HVAC 5%,paint and accessories 4%, and other products 4%. The catalog iscomplemented by a local direct sales force in 34 markets and a telesalesforce in other markets which maintain frequent contact with the company's19,500 active customers. These efforts are augmented by national andregional accounts serviced by senior management and by participation inBuyers Access, a group purchasing organization of apartment propertymanagement firms. Members of Buyers Access accounted for 23% of sales inthe nine months ended September 30, 1995.   The company operates 10 distribution centers and offers next daydelivery for orders over $25, either by its own trucks or a contractservice. The company has found that customers order significantly more inareas in which it offers next day delivery. Standard or customized billingservices can be provided, and electronic order access is available. Thecompany has developed foreign sourcing of a broad array of private labelproducts, which accounted for 18% of net sales in the first nine months of1995.   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay all company debt andredeem all outstanding preferred stock. In March 1995, CEO William Green,the sole stockholder at the time, sold a substantial interest in thecompany to Summit Investors. Additional funding was borrowed to completethe November 1995 acquisition of One Source, operator of a supplydistribution business in Miami, for $3.7 million. As a result of therecapitalization, Green and Summit Investors have withdrawn $28 million incapital from the company.   Green will convert $5 million of preferred stock into common shares atthe offering price, giving him a 28% interest after the offering. SummitInvestors paid $55,000 for their 3.1 million shares, or 32% interest. Salesof additional shares of common stock to the public are subject to a 180 dayunderwriter's lockup agreement, although sales of the shares purchased bythe Summit Investors do not become eligible for sale under Rule 144 untilMarch 1997, unless the SEC amends the Rule to cut the holding period fromtwo to one years. Such an amendment is under consideration.   We think the key to the company's growth has been the value addedservices which it provides to property managers. Many properties areheavily leveraged or under capitalized, so maintaining a repair andmaintenance products inventory is just one more headache. The companysolves this problem, and we believe most competing firms do not provide asimilar breadth of products and services.   We think the company will continue to grow, gaining market share andforcing out weaker, local firms. It made its first acquisition only lastNovember at a fraction of the value which the underwriters have placed onthe firm. Other acquisitions at favorable prices are likely to be availablefor some time. Geographic expansion and new end market penetration alsopresent strong growth opportunities. The hospitality, health care, andinstitutional markets accounted for only 1.5% of net sales in the firstnine months of 1995. We believe the company covers less than 50% of thenation currently. On a pro forma basis assuming the acquisition occurred atthe beginning of 1995, we estimate EPS was $0.45 a share on sales of $72.5million. Pro forma assuming the offering and related transactions occurredon 1/1/96, we project EPS of $0.60 on sales of $90 million. It is stillearly in the IPO cycle for outsourcing firms, which typically means thatthe success of the first offering raises the valuation standard until thequality of firms looking to capitalize on the trend deteriorates.

IPO   Simultaneous with the consummation of the offering, this company willacquire the seven companies, all of which provide document managementservices primarily to health care institutions, professional services (suchas legal services) firms, and financial institutions. One or more of thefounding firms provide micrographic services, electronic image processing,active document and file storage and maintenance, inactive documentarchival storage, and information and database management services. Theseservices are provided for all three target markets.   In addition, certain of the companies provide medical records releaseservices to health care institutions, litigation support to professionalservices firms, and remittance processing to financial institutions. Thefounding companies have been in business an average of 22 years and operate33 facilities in 21 states. Selling is conducted at the local level,typically by senior management, but the company expects to add a directsales force where appropriate.   Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay the cash portion of thepurchase price for the founding companies, to repay debt, and for generalcorporate purposes including acquisitions. Future acquisitions are likelyto be financed wholly or in part with common stock. Long term debt isnominal. Negotiations are ongoing with a leading financial institution forlines of credit in the aggregate amount of $25 million to be used foradditional acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes.   Insiders will own 39% of the stock after the offering. All of thestockholders of the company, including the former owners of the foundingcompanies will be contractually prohibited from selling any of the sharesfor a period of two years after the acquisitions are closed. Recently, inNovember 1995, Ed H. Bowman, Jr. was appointed CEO of the company. Mr.Bowman's previous experience was with First Data, HBO & Co., and AndersenConsulting. Chief Development Officer Thomas C. Walker has been responsiblefor the acquisition or divestiture of over 100 businesses over a 29 yearperiod.   We think that the value added services which the company provides is amore attractive business than the archival storage business of IronMountain, another firm which is planning an IPO. Both firms are likely tobenefit from the growing trend for businesses to outsource their documentmanagement operations and from consolidation within the industry. Moreimportantly, F.Y.I.'s proposed market capitalization is about 1.2X ourprojection of 1996 revenues for the founding companies, versus the 2.1X atwhich Iron Mountain is seeking to sell shares. Our pro forma combined EPSestimate for 1995 is $0.85 on revenues of $47.5 million.

Coyle, CFAJanuary 9, 1996Investment opinion   We are recommending the purchase of SGS-THOMSON as a low-risk way tobenefit from the strong demand expected in the semiconductor industry overthe next several years. Semiconductor stocks have been hammered in recentmonths as investors have chosen to take profits in light of weaker thanexpected results being reported by several companies, and amid signs ofpricing pressures in the highly visible memory segment. However, we do notbelieve these factors portend an overall slowdown in the market, but ratherreflect isolated pockets of weakness in certain segments of the industry.   SGS-THOMSON should continue to prosper in this uncertain environment, asits product and geographic diversity makes it less susceptible to the risksof more narrowly focused semiconductor companies. In addition, thisdiversity gives us confidence in revenue and earnings visibility, a factorthat should be highly prized by investors during 1996.   Finally, the volatility seen in the last several months underscores theneed for careful investment selection in this group. As such, we recommendfocusing on stocks that are not overly exposed to one industry or productline and that can be purchased at a low multiple to future earnings.SGS-THOMSON meets this criteria at just 7.4X our estimate for 1996 andshould be purchased by investors seeking above-average capitalappreciation.Overview   SGS-THOMSON is a leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips and devicesfor a variety of end markets. The company sports a diversified line-up ofsome 3000 products that are sold to more than 1500 customers, includingOEMs in the computer systems (27% of sales in 1995's first nine months),telecommunications (23%), consumer products (19%), industrial (21%) andautomotive (10%) industries. Revenues are also well balanced globally,with Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Japan accounting for 47%, 25%,24% and 4%, respectively, of revenues in 1995's first nine months.   The company's principal focus is on differentiated products (51% ofrevenues in 1995's first nine months), a segment which mainly containsanalog and mixed-signal (analog/digital) integrated circuits (ICs). AnalogICs provide the critical link between electronic systems and a variety ofvariables including sound, light, temperature or speed. Mixed-signalcircuits combine analog and digital functionality on a single-chip toprocess both analog signals and digital data. During 1994, SGS was the #1worldwide producer of analog and mixed-signal devices.   Because of the close relationships needed with customers to designdifferentiated products, SGS-THOMSON is less vulnerable to pricingpressures than commodity producers. In addition, these products have longerlife cycles than commodity devices, are less susceptible to technologicalobsolescence and cost less to make as older and more reliable manufacturingprocesses can be employed. Market projections are for differentiatedproducts to grow at a 21% annual growth rate through 1998.   The balance of SGS's revenues are logic and memories (24% of revenuesin 1995's first nine months), discrete (16%), and standard & commodities(9%). The company's logic devices, which include microprocessors,microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs), are generallydifferentiated from competitive offerings by patents and specializedproduct design skills. In contrast, the company's non-volatile memoryproducts (EPROMs, EEPROMs, SRAMs, flash memories, chips for smartcards) aregenerally considered more commodity in nature and mainly differentiated byprice. The company does not manufacture DRAM memory chips. During 1994, SGSwas the #2 worldwide producer of non-volatile memories.   SGS-THOMSON Holding II controls 69% of the outstanding shares and isequally owned by a consortium of French and Italian shareholders that areindirectly controlled by their respective governments.Targeted products should help drive top line growth   Despite its broad-based product portfolio, the company is also wellpositioned to benefit from exposure to several promising growth segments inthe semiconductor industry. MPEG (motion picture experts group) chips,which utilize advanced digital video compression to improve the quality ofvideo and audio, are gaining widespread acceptance in the fast-growingmultimedia computer segment. The company was the leading worldwide MPEG-2supplier in 1994 and market forecasts are for the MPEG market to reach $2billion in 1996, up from $600 million in 1995. The company is alsotargeting the fast growing flash memory market. Flash memories can beerased and reprogrammed electrically without having to be physicallyremoved from a system, like EPROMs. Because of their flexibility, low costand small size, the use of flash memories is expected to proliferate.According to In-Stat, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based research firm, the flashmemory market is expected to grow 32% in 1996 from about $1.3 billion in1995. Longer term, we expect the company to benefit from its licenseagreement with Cyrix. Under the agreement, the company has the option tomanufacture and sell Cyrix's line of microprocessors, including its highlytouted M1 chip that is set to challenge Intel's Pentium family. Volumeproduction is set for 1996's second quarter but any meaningful contributionis more likely to come in the 1997 time frame.SGS benefiting from strong industry demand   Revenues and earnings were up 40% and 37%, respectively, in the threemonths ended September 30, 1995, and 34% and 32% for the nine month period.The company has benefited from strong global demand for semiconductorsacross all key product categories and geographies. We are estimatingrevenue growth of about 25% in 1996, which assumes that the company willgrow in line with projected industry growth rates. The SemiconductorIndustry Association has forecast a 26% increase in worldwide semiconductorsales for 1996, but we believe the company's growth rate is likely to beslightly lower due to its lack of exposure to the fast-growing DRAMmarket.   Gross margins have trended down from the 42% rate experienced in 1994and the first quarter of 1995, mainly due to costs associated with capacityadditions. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by recent management commentsthat margins could range between 40% and 42% in 1996. Since margins arecurrently at the low end of this range, we have built in some upside in ourforecast with a 41% gross margin estimate.   The company continues to increase spending at healthy levels in aneffort to keep pace with growing demand. SG&A expenses grew as a percentageof sales in 1995, excluding a $15 million non-recurring item, owing togreater marketing efforts. The company continues to spend aggressively onresearch and development, a trend we view positively. We expect littlediversion from these spending trends in 1996, and have conservativelytargeted these categories to grow cumulatively at rates slightly below our25% earnings growth estimate.   We are forecasting earnings of $4.25 for 1996, up 12% from our $3.80estimate for 1995. The earnings gain is being restricted by an increase inthe tax rate to 26% from an estimated 20%. In 1995, SGS realized certain tax breaks from the initiation of capital expenditure programs in certaincountries. We also expect a 6% increase in the number of sharesoutstanding, reflecting the October 1995 public offering of 8.9 millionshares at US$43.50 a share.Company adding capacity to address demand   SGS-THOMSON is aggressively expanding manufacturing capacity over thenext several years to meet projected industry demand. The company hasapplied 1994 and 1995 investments to three new front-end fabricationplants, two of which are now in operation. In addition, two older plantsare being converted to process newer and larger wafer sizes. The company isexpected to use the proceeds of US$377 million from its October publicoffering to help fund these additions. Capital spending in 1995 is expectedto total some $900 million.Is it time to buy semiconductor stocks?   Semiconductor stocks went on a roller coaster ride in 1995, with animpressive surge seen from the beginning of the year through September. Astracked by the S&P Semiconductor Index, semiconductor stocks rose by morethan 70% during that time frame. This performance was then followed byextreme volatility and subsequent profit taking that saw many semiconductorissues fall by 30% to 40% from their highs. The S&P Semiconductor Indexfinished up only 35% for the year. Is the 1995 sell-off a harbinger ofthings to come for 1996?   We don't believe so. Industry fundamentals are in place for selectedsemiconductor issues to do very well in 1996. Our bias would be towards themore broadly diversified companies versus companies that are overly exposedto a particular industry, customer or product line. Furthermore, we wouldstay away from companies specializing on more price-sensitive, commodityproducts. We think this criteria is critical as pockets of softness arebeginning to surface in various segments of the market, particularly in thecommodity segment. We do not believe this portends a dramatic decline inthe demand for semiconductors, but rather a pause from the overheatedconsumption levels of 1995 and heightened uncertainty about longer termgrowth rates in key personal computer and telecommunications industries.Our view is that growth in these segments will remain strong, although notat the rates seen in previous years. In addition, the proliferation ofsemiconductors in automobiles, electronics and appliances should complementnicely the growth in PCs and phones. In summary, we expect semiconductorissues to remain volatile over the next several months, but for investorsto eventually revisit higher quality names that can prosper in thisfast-changing industry.Valuation   Valuations on all semiconductor issues have come down dramatically sincethe latter part of 1995, and many now sport single-digit P/E multiples on1996 earnings. While we believe many of these issues warrant this type ofmultiple because of imminent pricing pressures and the lack of cleanearnings visibility, other stocks have been unduly punished by overly harshinvestor sentiment towards the group.   We believe SGS-THOMSON is one of those issues, as its broadlydiversified product line and customer base will prove to be a bufferagainst periodic pockets of softness that inevitably surface in endmarkets. In our opinion, the company's diversity effectively lowers therisk of a customer or product driven event slowing sales and earningsmomentum. When coupled with the current low valuation on the shares, SGS islikely to be an investor favorite when positive sentiment returns to thegroup.   With the shares trading at just 7.4X our 1996 estimate of $4.25 a shareand down from the high of 57 1/2, we see a strong likelihood of P/Eexpansion as semiconductor stocks eventually return to favor. Based on ourfavorable long term views of the industry, we can easily rationalize a P/Emultiple of 10 on 1996 earnings, giving the shares a value of $42.50, up33% from current levels. We would also note that this valuation may proveconservative based on what we view as the company's 15%-20% long termgrowth rate. Based on the its low risk profile along with strong underlyinggrowth prospects, we recommend that investors accumulate the shares forabove average capital gains.SGS-THOMSON52 week range:                  $57 1/2 - 24 1/21994 EPS:                       $3.041995 est.

Lead products include BioTropin, authentic humangrowth hormone (hGH); and Oxandrin, an anabolic steroid approved in variousindications for weight gain.   BTG sells hGH overseas; the worldwide hGH market totals about $800million to $1 billion. The company markets Oxandrin domestically, and U.S.market could easily top $100 million. Both drugs are still in the earlystages of their product cycle and have yet to capture a meaningful share oftheir markets; revenue growth has substantial upside potential. The mostpromising pipeline drug is Androtest-SL, a sublingual form of testosterone,which is being prepared for a New Drug Application with the FDA. Androtest-SL will be marketed to hypogonadal males and men withtestosterone deficiencies. The U.S. market is valued at about $625 millionand is growing approximately 16% a year.   We predict revenue growth of 45%+ through 1997 and estimate earnings in1995 at break-even, those in 1996 at $0.15 per share, and $0.45 in 1997. As BTG turns cash-flow positive in 1996 and with over $12 million in cash,we doubt the company will see the need to do an offering of shares (all therage in biotechs these days) or raise capital through debt.   Our 12-month price target is $12 based on a reasonable price/earningsratio of 27X 1997 earnings. Considering that most publicly tradedbiotechnology companies, even 1995's success stories like AgouronPharmaceuticals and Cephalon have no immediate earnings expectations norany commercial drug products (no P/E's either), Bio-Technology General hasa compelling investment profile based on the fundamentals in thishigh-growth, high-risk sector.Overview   This small-cap biopharmaceutical develops and manufacturespharmaceuticals and genetically engineered products. BTG focuses on drugsthat treat endocrinology disorders, cardio/pulmonary diseases, opthalmic,and skin disorders. Through marketing partners and distribution agreements,the company sells its products in Western Europe, Japan, Israel, Canada,the U.S. and Mexico.   BTG's flagship drug is called Bio-Tropin, human growth hormone (hGH),and is used to treat short stature, growth hormone deficiency, anddwarfism. hGH is secreted from the pituitary gland and controls importantphysiological functions essential to normal development and maturation. Theworldwide market for hGH is very large, estimated between $850 million and$1 billion, and growing by about 10% each year. The major geographicmarkets are the U.S. with a $300 million market potential, Western Europeat $250 million, and Japan, slightly less than the U.S. Currently, BTG isselling Bio-Tropin in Western Europe and Japan through licensees, as wellas in other smaller markets in East Asia and Latin America.   Bio-Tropin accounted for approximately $7.2 million of BTG revenues in1994 (65% of the total) mostly through sales in Japan by licensee JCRPharmaceuticals. JCR began selling Bio-Tropin in mid-1993 and is startingto make inroads on capturing a more significant portion of the Japanesemarket. Sales contributions from its Western Europe market was slight in1994, as its licensee, the Ferring Group, had a late start: sales to theNetherlands, Germany, and Sweden commenced in 4Q 1994. During late 1995,Ferring started selling in the U.K., France, Spain, Denmark, Belgium,Ireland, and Luxembourg. The 1995 comparisons in both the Japan and WesternEurope market have been very favorable and as Bio-Tropin is still in a``launch stage'', projected growth rates are high. We estimate BioTropinsales from Japan in 1995 at $11 million and will grow about 15% through1997. In Western Europe, revenue contributions will approximate $2.3million in 1995 and grow at 45%+ through 1997.Problems with BioTropin in the United States may have clouded investors'perception of the stock   Unfortunately, BioTropin's biggest and most lucrative market, the UnitedStates, is closed off . After obtaining FDA approval to market Bio-Tropinin the United States, Genentech filed a suit claiming patent infringementand was able to prevent BTG from selling its hGH domestically. Genentechis, of course, trying to preserve market share of its own hGH drugs inAmerica. In August 1995, Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical was alsoslapped with a preliminary injunction by Genentech when it tried to sellhGH products in the U.S., as well. BTG has appealed the ruling and expectsa decision by March 1996. Although there is a good chance that the companycould succeed in overturning the injunction, we are not including thepossibility of U.S. sales in our earnings model. Whatever happens withthe court case, we believe that Bio-Technology's present markets forBio-Tropin as well as revenues from other products will promulgate adequateearnings growth in 1996 without U.S. sales.Oxandrin addresses an underserved and growing market   The problems related to Bio-Tropin has muddied the waters in relation tothe company's other promising products. In the unfolding of Genentech'sinjunction, investors have forgotten about Oxandrin, BTG's approved drugfor weight gain. Oxandrin is an anabolic steroid used in patients sufferingfrom severe weight loss (``wasting syndrome'') due to chronic infection,extensive surgery, or trauma. Wasting syndrome, clinically known ascachexia, is a metabolic disruption frequently occurring in patients with acompromised immune system. Cachexia causes the body to break down proteinstores to meet energy requirements rather than first using stores of fat.The combination of losing body weight and muscle mass in a seriously illpatient leads to a life threatening condition.   Oxandrin has distinct advantages over the current crop of therapies usedin wasting syndrome. Megace, an injectable anabolic steroid, has a higherliver toxicity profile and also may lead to androgenic effects in femalepatients. Megace has also demonstrated limited efficacy in weight gainthrough adding lean muscle mass. Weight gain with Megace adds mostly waterand fat. Human growth hormone, while effective in adding weight, isprohibitively expensive at over $50,000 per treatment year. Reimbursementfor hGH in this indication is not expected by many insurance companies norfrom state Medicaid or AIDS Drug Assistance programs. Oxandrin on the otherhand, can be taken orally, halts weight loss, adds lean muscle mass, andcosts about $20 per daily dosage (roughly $6,000 per treatment year).   Oxandrin, as discussed, is already approved for a variety ofindications. Additionally, BTG is trying to expand the labeling of Oxandrinthrough Treatment Investigative New Drug trials. Treatment IND statusallows the company to be reimbursed during the trial. A Phase IIITreatment IND trial in AIDS cachetic patients is going forward in 1996 anda Treatment IND trial for Turners Syndrome has already been completed. TheTreatment IND could ideally generate a revenue stream of $8 millionalthough our forecasts are more conservative at $5 million in 1996. Approximately 75,000 AIDS patients in the United States are cachetic.   Severe weight loss is not just a symptom of AIDS patients. Cancer andaging are two vast markets in which Oxandrin can easily be adopted. BTG hasa dialogue with medical specialists treating wasting conditions andoncologists concerning Oxandrin's use. Cachetic cancer patients numberbetween 250,000 to 400,000 in the United States alone. We believe thecurrent labeling of Oxandrin will allow it to be given to cachetic cancerpatients.   In November 1995, Bio-Technology General announced an alliance withQuantum Health Resources to distribute Oxandrin nationally. Quantum'stherapies and services are provided through four regional centers, 20licensed branches, and 17 service branches throughout the United States. Quantum's expertise is in long-term chronic disorders and specializeddisease management where the needs of patients differ markedly from acuteor short-term illnesses. Due to Quantum's recent problems with its mainstayhemophilia service unit, we believe Quantum will place a strong emphasison growing Oxandrin business.BioLon's smaller revenue contributions round out BTG's drug portfolio   BioLon is a sodium hyaluronate product used in cataract surgery andintraocular lens transplantation. It is a high-viscosity, gel-like fluidwhich also has applications in dry eye syndrome and as a general contactlens solution. Marketing partners sell BioLon in Canada, Spain, SouthKorea, India, Mexico, and Israel. Labaoratoire Chauvin is launching BioLonin Europe during 1996 and a New Drug Application is planned to be filed inthe U.S. Upjohn-Pharmacia sells hyaluronic acid in the United States underthe trade name Healon. Healon goes off patent in February 1996. Revenuegrowth from BioLon will come principally from the U.S. and to a lesserextent, Europe. Although competition will no doubt be fierce, revenuecontributions from BioLon will approximate $4 million in 1996 and about $6million in 1997.Androtest-SL represents the company's most promising pipeline drug   This pipeline drug is a sublingual form of testosterone that is absorbedin the bloodstream through the mucosal membrane under the tongue.Androtest-SL is designed to treat hypogonadism, a testosterone deficiencythat affects about 250,000 males in the United States alone. Androtest-SLis also being developed to treat delay of growth and puberty which affectsabout 80,000 boys (U.S. market). Hypogonadal males, either through aconstitutional deficiency or through aging, suffer lower testosteronelevels which leads to impotence, suppressed libido, and loss of musclemass.   Current therapies include testosterone injections, scrotal patches, andtransdermal patches attached to the upper thighs and stomach area. Whilethe intramuscular injections are being abandoned in favor of the newtransdermal patches (such as those marketed by Theratech and Alza), webelieve that Androtest-SL will provide an even more convenient alternativefor hypogonadal males. The obvious disadvantage that transdermal patcheshave compared to injections is delivery. However, the patch must be wornconstantly which may lead to irritation and discomfort. As an oral tablettaken three times a day, Androtest-SL provides a convenient alternative topatches and painful injection.   The drug has proved effective in Phase III trials and is being preparedfor registration with the FDA. An NDA filing is expected at the latest bymid-1996 with sales commencing as early as mid-1997. Androtest-SL hasOrphan Drug status for constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Like theOxandrin market, the hypogonadal market is a segment that hasn't beenproperly addressed in the past. Competing transdermal patch companies likeAlza and Theratech are attempting to expand this market for men withimpotency, mild testosterone deficiency, and males that experience lowertestosterone levels because of aging. Under this criteria, the expandedmarket numbers between 3 million and 5 million males in the United States.But even without such indications, Androtest-SL's ease of use andcompetitive profile may help it capture as much as $12 million in revenueswhen marketing commences in 1997.   BioTropin, Oxandrin, BioLon, and Androtest-SL constitute the productswhich will generate earnings growth in the next five years. Other productscurrently being sold include psoriasis treatment, Silkis, sold in Europethrough marketing partner Cilag S.A. and Delatestryl, an injectibletestosterone product being phased out in favor of Androtest-SL. Aside fromAndrotest-SL, drugs in development include Porcine Growth Hormone for theproduction of leaner pork products; OxSODrol (Phase II/III trials) for theprevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns; and Bio-Hep-B, athird generation vaccine against the hepatitis B virus.Financial summary and valuation   We're expecting Bio-Technology General to post break-even numbers whenit reports its fourth quarter and year-end results sometime in February1996. Third quarter 1995 net income was $0.00 per share, which excluded anextraordinary gain of $0.03 due to debt forgiveness. Bio-Technology Generalreached a major turning point in 1995 as its revenues (including interestincome) matched its expenses and the company demonstrated the ability to goforward in 1996 as a profitable company.   The company will probably have a burn-rate of approximately $5 millionfor 1995 and end the year with about $12 million cash and equivalents. Withonly half a million in long-term liabilities and nearly $15 million inworking capital, the company has a credible balance sheet. We arepredicting earnings of $0.15 in 1996 and $0.45 in 1997 broken out in Table1.   In 1996, the company will be cash flow positive and will probably notneed to raise substantial capital in the form of a secondary offering ordebt. Also, resources for marketing and sales infrastructure are alreadyin place along with several international marketing partnerships. BTG hasbypassed the dilemma that many biotechs meet when products are approvedwithout a sales force to market them. However, should the opportunitypresent itself and market conditions prove favorable, we would view asecondary offering as a positive development since BTG would be issuingshares from a position of financial strength.   Both administrative and R&D expenses have been pared down in recentyears as management has made a commitment to keep operating costswell-controlled. Expenses in both categories will increase modestly in1996 and 1997. The company also has over $50 million in net operating losscarryforwards which expire from 1996 through 2009, therefore no provisionsfor income tax has been made in our earnings model.   We think that Bio-Technology General is an overlooked biopharmaceuticalwith excellent growth potential and a robust pipeline unusual for asmall-cap concern. Its products meet the needs of immature, underservedmarkets and possesses a fundamental investment profile in a sectornotorious for pie-in-the-sky prospects. Our one year price target is $12.00based on a price/earnings ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. The ratio reflectsan average of generic drug companies' and pharmaceutical p/e ratios. Weare using a we strongly recommend purchase of the shares.BIO-TECHNOLOGY GENERAL52 week range                   6.37 - 21994 EPS                        d$0.231995 estimated EPS              $0.001996 estimated EPS              $0.151997 estimated EPS              $0.45Indicated quarterly dividend    NilP/E on 1994 EPS                 NMP/E on estimated 1995 EPS       NMP/E on estimated 1996 EPS       39P/E on estimated 1997 EPS       13Shares outstanding              43.3 millionShare float                     32.6 millionInstitutional holdings          17%S&P 500                         609.45Fiscal year ends December 31.SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA                                  Year ended December 31                                      1994        1993Revenues  ($000s)                   16,937      13,296Net income  (loss) ($000s)          (7,419)    (22,825)Earnings (loss) per share ($)        (0.19)      (0.63)                                  Year ended December 31                                      1992        1991Revenues  ($000s)                    6,791       5,388Net income  (loss) ($000s)         (10,535)     (8,065)Earnings (loss) per share ($)        (0.32)      (0.31)Table 1.

Last year, 489 IPOs were added to S&P's New Issues Index, comparedwith 496 the year before, while total dollars raised came to $31.1 billion,compared with $34.0 billion in 1994. Both years significantly trailed therecord 672 deals and $56.9 billion raised in 1993. Despite the fireworkssurrounding many technology deals, they are typically smaller than thosefor mature companies reentering the market via a reverse LBO or ADRs, REITsor closed end funds, which were popular offerings at various times over thelast 10 years. Despite some highly visible reverse LBOs and ADRs such asNabisco Holdings, Royal PTT Nederland, ENI, Canadian National Railways,AVX, Gucci Group and Estee Lauder, there were fewer reverse LBOs and ADRson the IPO roster last year.   With the economy slowing down, there were many industries that were offlimits to underwriters during the year. Financials and technology were in,but heavy industry, basic materials, consumer durables and consumernondurables were out. With overall market leadership narrow, underwritershad to concentrate their energies in the few in-favor industries.   Although the year ended with a bang, with $14.0 billion raised from 201deals during the last quarter, we believe that both the number and dollarsraised in 1996 will be slightly lower than last year's totals. Standard &Poor's is of the view that the total return of the S&P 500 will be lessthan double digits and that intermediate term fixed income investmentscould provide similar returns over the next 12 months. With the economyexhibiting sluggish growth and interest in technology temporarily on thewane, we think that underwriters will easily be able to beat the 61 dealsand $3.7 billion raised in the first quarter of 1995. That was when themarket was treading water while waiting for interest rates to level off.Comparisons, however, will get tougher as the year wears on. Should theeconomy show signs of picking up, a number of offerings could surface inspecialty retailing and consumer products and services.Telecommunications equipment and Internet plays were the big winners   The S&P New Issues Index almost doubled in value last year, its bestperformance since 1991, when it rose 106.1%. It finished 1995 up 96.5%. Theindex tracks the performance of new issues, including REITs and closed endfunds, for the first six months of trading. To be added to the index, IPOsmust be firm underwritings priced at or above $5, with an offeringcapitalization of at least $5 million. We exclude bank and S&L conversions,best efforts deals and unit deals that include warrants. The index is priceweighted.   Fully 62 deals more than doubled last year based on offering price andwhat they closed the year at. Another 77 rose more than 50%. Before youget the idea that buying IPOs is like shooting fish in a barrel, though, itshould be pointed out that 135 deals fell in value, while another 109 roseless than 20%. Put together, they amount to 50% of all deals brought lastyear.   The biggest winner was Premisys Communications, which sextupled in lessthan nine months. The company makes integrated multiple access servers andconcentrators that support prevailing centrex and digital switchtechnologies as well as emerging frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode(ATM) technologies. Its products allow the proliferation of frame relaybased ISDN services within a traditional broadband network structure. Rightnow it is delivering just about the only ATM concentrator around. Revenuesfor the September quarter rose 149%, while earnings quintupled to $0.25.AT&T is its major customer and accounts for a third of revenues. One dangeris that when AT&T splits up, the new entity that makes equipment may choosea different vendor, or more likely, other more traditional switchmanufacturers will catch up technologically and cause profit margins,currently quite high, to eventually come down. The shares are currentlytrading at 80X consensus projected fiscal 1996 EPS.   Three of the next four winners were Internet plays, Spyglass, NetscapeCommunications and UUNET Technologies. Spyglass more than quintupled, NSCPalmost quadrupled, and UNET more than tripled. These companies went publicso early in their corporate lives that one could only conjecture as to howfast they might grow. All three are trading at multiples quantum leapshigher than just about any other non-Internet related or biotech growthstock.   We are of the view that the Internet will be the dominant masscommunications medium in the 21st century. Nonetheless, once forward fiveyear sales and earnings growth rates for these companies become defined,their share prices will be adjusted downward. In the meantime, shares ofNetscape, the company with the best shot at becoming a dominant player inInternet services, is trading at over 20X projected 1997 revenues!   Just about all the other big winners were technology related. There werenine software companies among the 25 biggest winners, plus threetelecommunications related companies. The only exceptions were RentersChoice, Compdent, Sequana Therapeutics, Garden Ridge and Spin-Tech.   PDT makes light activated drugs to treat or diagnose a variety ofdiseases. The company has yet to generate revenues or a profit, but it isentering phase III trials for a drug to be used on hard tumors. DSPCommunications is developing chipsets for wireless personal communicationsapplications. To date, sales have come from chipsets for Japanese digitalmobile phones. Customers include Kenwood, Kyocera and Sanyo. Renters Choiceruns 325 rent-to-own stores. Nine month earnings more than doubled on a 60%increase in sales. Verity is a maker of tools for the dissemination oftexts over various electronic networks. Although the company is stillrunning losses, revenues are up substantially. Greatest interest is in itsTopoc search engine for the Internet.As usual, small deals done by third tier underwriters populate losers list   The largest deal that landed on our losers list was Asia PacificResources. It has a 60.7% interest in a major Indonesian producer of pulpand rayon and almost wholly owns another firm that operates the largestsingle line pulp mill in the world. Three paper mills are planned, two inChina and one in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the company has not earned muchmoney since going public in early April. With economies slowing in mostmajor markets, the company could be expanding capacity at just the wrongtime.   Electronics Communications provides cellular phone services andequipment. Sales dropped over the last nine months, with operations goingto a loss due to one-time advertising charges. AHI Healthcare Systemsintegrates individual physicians and small medical groups into localmanaged healthcare delivery networks. Although revenues more than doubledin the nine months to 9/30/95, a larger than expected loss was reported dueto high development costs. Losses are expected to continue for at least onemore quarter.   Other losers brought by large underwriters include HighwayMasterCommunications. It offers a wireless communications network for use bytruckers. Although revenues rose substantially of late, losses failed tonarrow. Number Nine Visual Technology initially received a very favorablereception by investors. This maker of graphics accelerator products forpersonal computers continues to show a very positive sales trend, but aloss was reported for the September quarter. Analysts expected earnings of$0.25 a share.   Many of the worst losers were brought out by small underwriters such asInvestors Associates, Hampshire Securities, John G. Kinnard, Needham & Co.,Paulson Investments, Lexington Securities, and J.W. Charles. Small soleunderwritings tend to do well initially, but then tail off rapidly as timegoes on. Most of these deals have generally weak underlying fundamentals,but are operating in industries that are currently in favor. Theunderwriter insures success at the IPO by developing more than enoughdemand to float the shares at the offering, and those that are retailoriented often drive the share price higher by convincing its clients tobuy additional shares in the aftermarket. Then the underwriter moves on tothe next deal. Lacking sponsorship and with a market capitalization toosmall to hit the radar screens of most buy side managers, the offeringsinevitably drift lower.   Salomon Brothers brought out three deals that found their way on thelosers list, as did Alex. Brown. Even the most successful underwriters,however, bring out companies that falter due to subsequent poorer thanexpected results. Some deals that initially moved higher before plummetingincluded Business Resource Group, Number Nine Visual Technology, HelloDirect, TGV Software and EqualNet Holdings.Goldman Sachs dominates list of biggest deals   Of the 10 largest deals, Goldman, Sachs kept the books on six of them.No one else had more than one in the top 10. Goldman's largest deal wasNabisco Holdings, which went public early in the year. It advanced 33.2% invalue by year end. Other large Goldman deals were Prudential Reinsurance,PMI Group, Intimate Brands, Canadian National Railway and Borders Group.Morgan Stanley's largest deal was Royal PTT Nederland, which edged up 2.4%in the last five weeks of the year, Smith Barney's was Union PacificResources, up 20.8% in less than three months, CS First Boston's was ENI,rising 4.2% in five weeks, and Merrill Lynch's was DST Systems, whichadvanced 35.7% in two months.   The best performer in the aftermarket among the 10 largest deals wasPrudential Reinsurance, which advanced 39.6% by year end. The runner-up wasDST Systems. Large deals with offering capitalizations of more than $100million that rose more than 30% are on page 11.As usual, technology and white shoe underwriters lead in IPO aftermarket     performance   Technology, regional and white shoe underwriters usually lead the packin bringing out the most successful offerings, and 1995 was no exception.Rauscher Pierce leads the list. Of its four deals, one, Renters Choice,tripled, while another, Belmont Homes, doubled. Other regional houses thatbrought out excellent deals were William Blair and Robinson-Humphrey.   The major specialty technology underwriters, as usual, brought out dealsthat did much better than average in subsequent trading. Alex. Brown,Montgomery, Hambrecht & Quist and Robertson, Stephens all served bothinvestors and corporate clients in pricing their deals well. As is also thenorm, second tier technology underwriters such as Needham & Co., Miller,Johnson, Kuehn, and Unterberg Harris, for the most part brought out weakerthan average deals when they took the lead. The exceptions this year wereCowen & Co. and Volpe, Welty.   Salomon Brothers has been struggling to remain a major underwriter ofequity issues. The poor performance of their deals in the aftermarket in1995 will not make their task any easier going forward. The multi-officeretail brokers typically bring out poorer performing deals. PaineWebber haslanded in the lower half of the list for many years and appears thereagain, as does Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Smith Barney and DonaldsonLufkin. There were no exceptions to the rule this year.   The most deals were brought by Goldman, Sachs, followed by Robertson,Stephens, Alex. Brown, and Morgan Stanley. Both Goldman, Sachs and MorganStanley have consistently brought out better than average deals. OfGoldman's 36 IPOs, only six finished the year under water. Just five ofMorgan Stanley's offerings finished under their IPO prices.Sector rotation likely in 1996   From an investment perspective, over the next six months or so, we wouldemphasize those groups that could generate strong corporate earnings growthregardless of how the overall economy does. They include health care,(particularly HMOs and subacute care companies), energy services (thedrillers), REITs, insurance, computer networking, telecommunicationsequipment, and farm related businesses.   We may also see more foreign stocks. Many emerging markets could turn inbetter performances than the U.S. in 1996. Our bets are on the CzechRepublic, Argentina, Chile and the Philippines. Following on the heels ofGucci, we would also expect an increased number of ADR offerings of familyowned consumer product companies based in Europe.   With technology stocks in a deep freeze, many IPOs in this sector willbe postponed until the climate improves. That may not be until later in theyear. In the meantime, it appears that value could beat growth in a marketenvironment in which the total return of the S&P 500 this year may notreach its long term average of 10.1%.   At least for the first quarter, we would emphasize low P/E plays. Of thetech companies that do venture forth in this environment, they are apt tobe better priced. Although they may not move much in the immediateaftermarket, they could do well when technology comes back into favor,possibly late this year.   Groups we would not commit additional funds to now would be personalcomputer related technology, cyclicals, nonprecious metals, and consumerfinance stocks.Information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable.However, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness is not guaranteed.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightS&P'S EMERGING & SPECIAL SITUATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996   Vol. 16, NCAPITAL GUARANTY   FSA Holdings completed its proposed acquisition of Capital Guaranty for$23 a share in cash and stock on December 20, 1995.Information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable.However, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness is not guaranteed.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List CopyrightS&P'S EMERGING & SPECIAL SITUATIONS via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1996   Vol. 16, NC-CUBE MICROSYSTEMS   A two-for-one split was paid to shareholders of C-Cube Microsystems onDecember 19, 1995.

Natale, CFAEditorThe tug of war between value and growth goes on   Last year, growth beat value. The growth half of the S&P 500 provided atotal return of 38.1%, as measured by S&P/BARRA, while the value half ofthe index generated 37.0%. But, for the five years ended 12/31/95, valuegenerated a 16.9% compound annual total return, against 16.1% for growth.In 1996, value could again have the edge. With P/Es well above thehistorical norm and economic growth slowing down, investors are seeking toreduce perceived investment risks by searching out less expensive stocks inindustries that have not already run up. Indeed, we would be looking toplace money in industries that run on their own operating cycles, that is,that are less affected by what is going on in the overall economy.   For example, oil service companies, especially the drillers, stand tobenefit from increased exploration expenditures by the major oil companiesthis year. That is because new technologies such as 3-D seismic andhorizontal drilling have reduced finding costs, making the redevelopment ofolder fields and of new small fields economical. In addition, after 10years of depression, the supply of oil rigs is finally coming into balancewith demand. Day rates rose substantially last year even though natural gasprices plummeted and oil prices went nowhere. Our favorites here are GlobalMarine and Nabors Industries.   Another group attractive to value and growth players alike is healthcare. New rules coming out of Washington, D.C. could adversely impacthospital and nursing home businesses, but the drive to reduce per capitacosts will push increased use of subacute rehabilitation services andMedicare and Medicaid patients into HMOs. We have three rehab companies onour buy list, Mariner Health Group, RehabCare Group, and TheraTx. All aretrading at or below the market multiple as measured by the S&P 500. HMOs onour buy list are Pacificare Health Systems and United American Healthcare.   Semiconductor companies now look like value plays in the sense that theynow sport low P/Es despite prospects for above average, albeit somewhatcyclical, earnings growth. Many on our buy lists have been beaten up oflate and offer considerable appeal for investors looking beyond theuncertainties surrounding the industry as excess inventories are workeddown. Industry growth this year will not match the 40% increase inworldwide shipments experienced in 1995; 26% will be more like it. Still,that should more than justify a recovery in P/E ratios. In addition toSGS-Thomson, which is recommended in this issue, we like Exar, which makeslower end application specific integrated circuits, Integrated Circuits,which manufactures mixed signal Ics, and Sierra Semiconductor, which issupplying chips to fast growing ATM and frame relay telecommunicationsswitch makers. All of these companies are trading at single digit multiplesagainst current forecasted 1996 EPS.   We also suggest taking another look at real estate plays. With Standard& Poor's predicting the total return for the S&P 500 to be less that 10% in1996, REITs could provide comparable or better returns with less risk.Except for retail properties, real estate values continue to climb,particularly for office properties. Our favorites in this area includeCatellus Development, an almost pure play on the California recovery, FirstUnion Real Estate Trust, which has one of the lowest dividend payouts as apercent of cash flow in the REIT industry, which bodes well for steadydividend increases over the next 18 months, and Property Capital Trust,which is liquidating, and we feel will provide a total return well into thedouble digits as it does so over the next three to five years.   Other industries that we would target for investment, either throughIPOs or otherwise, are domestic farming (i.e. Case and Tractor Supply,insurance, and telecommunications equipment (Stratacom, SierraSemiconductor).   Finally, some leading emerging foreign markets should also providebetter returns than the S&P 500 in 1996. We would play them via listedclosed end funds. Our favorites are Czech Republic Fund and FirstPhilippine Fund.   Despite the weak start to the year by small stocks, we continue tobelieve that they will beat the S&P 500 this year. Earnings growth forcompanies in the SmallCap 600 is projected to be much stronger than the S&P500 in 1996, while the P/E ratios of small stocks are only slightly higher.Although investors are very unlikely to garner the same returns achieved in1995, small stocks should provide excellent relative returns in 1996.Illustration(s):Illustration: Illustration: Graph: S&P SMALLCAP 600 VS.

OF BANKING & FINANCIAL SVCS. via NewsNetJanuary 31, 1996   Vol. 12, NTHE NEW CRA EXAMINATION PROCEDURESChanges Designed To Reduce the Examination Burden Have Focused RegulatoryAttention on Community Reinvestment Results. The Interpretation of Key CRAStandards Remains Subject to Substantial Examiner Discretion.By:Christina M. Gattuso*In May 1995, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office ofThrift Supervision, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the``Agencies'') issued final revised regulations under the CommunityReinvestment Act (``CRA'') (the ``Revised CRA Regulations'').1 In thepreamble to that rulemaking, the Agencies noted that they would worktogether to improve training for examiners, to increase interagency effortsto apply standards consistently and reliably, and to minimize unnecessarycompliance burdens. Consistent with those efforts, on November 13, 1995,the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (``FFIEC'')officially released new CRA examination procedures that were jointlyadopted by the Agencies for monitoring an institution's compliance with theRevised CRA Regulations (the ``Procedures'').There are four sets of examination procedures -- procedures for large,retail institutions; for small institutions; for wholesale and limitedpurpose institutions; and for institutions with an approved strategic plan.In accordance with the Revised CRA Regulations, examiners began using thesmall institution examination procedures on January 1, 1996. The otherthree sets of procedures do not become mandatory until July 1, 1997.However, examiners will use the Procedures in conducting examinations ofthose institutions that elect to be evaluated under the Revised CRARegulation prior to that date.2In some instances, the assessment criteria set forth in the Proceduresmirror the twelve assessment factors under the prior CRA regulations.3Examiners will still review and rate institutions on the geographicdistribution of their loans; their record of opening and closing offices;their participation in community development projects; their real estate,small farm, and small business loans; and their participation in governmentloan programs for housing, small farms, and small businesses. Under theProcedures, the examiners will continue to review, but the institution willnot be rated, on any practices by the institution that are intended todiscourage applications, any prohibited discriminatory or other illegalcredit practices,4 the institution's ability to meet community creditneeds, the institution's delineated community, and the institution'swillingness to explore other activities. Under the Revised CRA Regulationsand the Procedures, examiners will no longer look at, and an institutionwill not be rated on, its ascertainment of community credit needs,marketing, and board of director involvement in the CRA process.   The Procedures emphasize that examiners are expected to exercisejudgement and common sense to minimize the burden imposed on theexamination process and to perform only those steps necessary to arrive atan accurate assessment of the institution's CRA performance.5 Consistentwith the Revised CRA Regulations, the Procedures establish evaluationmethods based on a review of objective data that can also be used byinstitutions to measure their own performance under the CRA. An examiner'sassessment of an institution's CRA performance will be based on a number ofobjective factors, which include the number and amount of loans originated,the amount of qualified investments, and the types of services provided bythe institution.6 However, by necessity the Procedures allow for examinerdiscretion in the assessment process in order to account for thedifferences among institutions and the communities they serve. While theneed for flexibility in assessing an institution's performance isimportant, unless the examiners are provided with clear guidance andcomprehensive training, inconsistencies in CRA examinations are likely tocontinue. The Agencies believe that the training examiners have receivedand will continue to receive in the future will enable examiners to makemore informed judgements in the areas in which they have discretion andshould ensure consistency in the examination process.7EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR LARGE RETAIL INSTITUTIONSThe Revised CRA Regulations provide that a financial institution with totalassets of $250 million or more or, regardless of size, one that is owned bya holding company with total banking and thrift assets greater than $1billion, will be examined under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests.The Procedures set forth the items that will be reviewed in assessing aninstitution's performance under those three tests.Examination ScopeThe Procedures set forth factors that will be reviewed and compiled by theexaminers at the pre-examination stage to determine the scope of theimpending CRA examination.8 To make this determination, the examiners willreview the institution's prior CRA evaluations, information provided bycommunity contacts, and the lending data and demographic data reported foreach assessment area.9 The examiners will also consider the number of otherinstitutions in the assessment area and the opportunities available in theassessment area for lending, investment and other services. Based on thisinformation, the examiners will determine the scope of their on-site andoff-site examinations.Performance ContextThe Procedures require the examiners to establish a ``performance context''for the examination by evaluating information about the institution, itscommunity and its competitors. In this regard, the examiners will reviewstandardized worksheets and other agency information to obtain relevantdemographic, economic, and loan data on each assessment area underreview.10 The examiners will also review agency-prepared community contactforms for groups within the institution's assessment area, and may contactlocal community, governmental, or economic development representatives toupdate such information.11 To determine the institution's ability andcapacity to serve its assessment area, the examiners will review CallReports or Thrift Financial Reports (``TFRs''), annual reports, supervisoryreports and prior CRA evaluations. The examiners will also consider anyinformation the institution provides on its local community and economy,its business strategy, and its lending capacity, and any information thatotherwise assists in the evaluation of the institution.12 However,examiners will not require the institution to create such information; norwill they ask for any information other than what the institution hasdeveloped as part of its normal business practice.   Finally, by reviewing the public evaluations and other financial data,the examiners will determine whether any similarly situated institutions13serve the same or similar assessment area and, if so, whether they wouldprovide relevant and accurate information for evaluating the institution'sCRA performance. The Procedures note that the examiners should considerwhether such information would help to identify lending opportunitiesavailable in the institution's assessment area that are compatible with theinstitution's business strategy and consistent with safe and sound bankingpractices; constraints affecting opportunities to make safe and sound loansand qualified investments compatible with the institution's businessstrategy in the assessment area; and successful CRA-related productofferings or activities used by other lenders serving the same or a similarassessment area.   The development of the performance context will likely occur prior toinitiation of the on-site examination. The Revised CRA Regulations and theProcedures make clear that an institution need not compile or maintaininformation related to the performance context. However, to the extent theinstitution compiles information to analyze the demand for loans,investment and services within its assessment area, it would be to theinstitution's advantage to provide such information to the examiner for usein developing the performance context.Assessment AreaUnder the prior CRA regulations, an institution's delineated community wasreviewed and rated as part of an institution's overall CRA performance. TheRevised CRA Regulations require an institution to define its assessmentarea but do not require that an examiner rate the institution's assessmentarea. The Procedures and the Revised CRA Regulations state that examinerswill use the institution's assessment area unless they determine that ``theassessment area does not comply with the requirements for assessment areasset forth in the final rule.''14 Since this is not a rated area, anincorrect identification or definition of an institution's assessment areawill not result in a downgrading of an institution's CRA Rating.15As long as an institution's assessment area meets the requirements of theRevised CRA Regulations, the examiners should not second guess theassessment area. In order to meet the requirements of the Revised CRARegulations, the assessment area should consist of one or more metropolitanstatistical areas (``MSAs'') or contiguous political subdivisions. Itshould also include the geographies16 where the institution has its mainoffice, its branches, and any deposit-taking ATMs, and the areassurrounding such locations where the institution originated or purchased asubstantial portion of its loans. In addition, the assessment area shouldconsist of whole geographies; it should not exclude low or moderate incomegeographies and should not illegally discriminate; and not extendsubstantially across consolidated MSAs or state boundaries unless theinstitution is in a multi-state MSA. If the examiners find that theassessment area fails to meet these regulatory criteria, the examiners willdevelop a revised assessment area and will evaluate the institution'sperformance based on that revised assessment area.Public File ChecklistThe Procedures provide that there is no need for the examiners to revieweach branch or each complete public file during every examination,particularly if the institution has complied with the public filerequirements of the Revised CRA Regulations in previous examinations.However, it is likely that the examiners will review the public files inthe first examination of every institution under the Revised CRARegulations and the Procedures. In cases where a review of the public fileis undertaken, the examiners will determine whether an accurate publicnotice is displayed in the lobby of each branch, and whether the file(s) inthe main office and in each state contain all information required by theRevised CRA Regulations.17Performance CriteriaLending TestThe Lending Test is the primary test for large, retail institutions, sincefailure to achieve at least a Low Satisfactory rating in this area makes itimpossible to achieve an overall Satisfactory rating. The examiners willrate the institution's lending performance under the following criteria:lending activity; geographic distribution; borrower characteristics;community development lending; and innovative or flexible lendingpractices. The analysis under the Lending Test is similar to the analysisconducted under the prior CRA regulations.   After the examiners determine the loans to review for purposes of theLending Test,18 the examiners will test a sample of loan files to verifythe accuracy of data collected and/or reported by the institution and toensure that (i) affiliate loans reported by the institution are not alsoattributable to another affiliate subject to CRA;19 (ii) loans reported ascommunity development loans meet the definition of community developmentloans;20 and (iii) all consumer loans in a particular loan category havebeen included, when the institution collects and maintains the data for oneor more loan categories and elects to have the information evaluated. Theexaminers will also identify the dollar amount and number of loans underevaluation that the institution has made or purchased within its assessmentarea, taking into account the institution's resources and business strategyand other information that the examiners gather under the performancecontext, including population, income, housing, and business data. Theexaminers will also review any analyses offered by the institution toprovide insight into the reasonableness of the institution's geographicdistribution of lending.21 If the areas of low- or no-loan penetration arefound in the institution's analyses, the examiners will review explanationsand determine whether the institution took action to address thedisparities.   While the Procedures direct the examiners to supplement their reviewwith an independent analysis of geographic distribution as necessary todetermine the extent to which the institution is serving geographies ineach income category, they make clear that an institution is not requiredto lend in every geography. The Procedures also permit the examiners tocompare the institution's lending performance to that of other lenderswithin its assessment area if the examiners determine that such an analysiswould provide insight into the reasons for an abnormally low penetration oflending in the assessment area. Taking all of these factors intoconsideration, the examiners will determine whether the institution'sabnormally low loan penetration in certain areas should constitute anegative consideration in rating the geographic distribution of theinstitution's loans.   In terms of borrower characteristics, the examiners will review anyanalyses prepared by or for the institution to determine the reasonablenessof the institution's loan distribution by borrower characteristics. To theextent necessary, the examiners will supplement the analysis provided bythe institution with an independent analysis. If the institution adequatelyserves borrowers within its assessment area, the examiners will look to itsperformance outside its assessment area based on borrower characteristicsto determine whether such performance would enhance the assessment of theinstitution's overall performance.   The examiners will also review the institution's community developmentlending, using information obtained in the performance context to determinethe responsiveness of the institution to available community developmentopportunities and the extent to which the institution has demonstratedleadership in community development lending.   Finally, the examiners will evaluate whether the institution usesinnovative or flexible loan products, and, if so, the degree to which theloans serve low- and moderate-income individuals in new ways or serveborrowers not previously served by the institution. In addition, theexaminers will look at the success of any innovative or flexible loanproducts offered by the institution, including the number and dollar amountof such loan products originated during the review period.22 To somedegree, an institution's rating under the Lending Test will be based onobjective data. However, examiners will still be required to determinewhether an institution's lending activity is reasonable or adequate, termsthat are not defined in the Revised CRA Regulations or the Procedures, inorder to reach a conclusion as to which rating to assign to theinstitution.Investment TestThe review of an institution's performance under the Investment Test issimilar to the examiners' review of this area under the prior CRARegulations. Under the Investment Test, the examiners will identifyqualified investments23 by reviewing the institution's investmentportfolio, and, if elected by the institution, the investment portfolio ofits affiliate(s). Investments that were made since the last CRA evaluationand those that were made prior to the previous CRA evaluation but stillremain outstanding will be considered. The examiners will also considerqualifying grants, donations, or in-kind contributions of property sincethe last evaluation that are for community development purposes.   In evaluating the institution's investment portfolio, the examiners willdetermine whether the investments benefit the institution's assessment areaor a broader area that includes the institution's assessment area; whetherthe investments have been considered under the Lending or Service Tests;whether an affiliate's investments have been claimed by anotherinstitution; the dollar volume of investments made to entities that are inor serve the assessment area, in relation to the institution's capacity andconstraints, and the assessment area's characteristics and needs; the useof any innovative or complex investments; and the degree to which theinvestments serve low- and moderate- income areas or individuals, and areresponsive to available opportunities for qualified investments.24   After considering the number and dollar amount of qualified investments;the innovativeness and complexity of qualified investments; the degree towhich these types of investments are routinely provided by other privateinvestors; and the responsiveness of the institution's qualifiedinvestments to available opportunities, the examiners will reach aconclusion regarding the institution's performance under the InvestmentTest. As with the Lending Test, there will be some degree of subjectivityin reaching this conclusion since examiners will need to determine theadequacy of an institution's qualified investments in order to assign arating.Service TestThe Service Test evaluates the institution on the basis of the retailbanking and community development services provided by the institution.With respect to retail banking service, the information used by theexaminers to evaluate the institution is similar to information reviewedunder the prior CRA regulations. As was the case under the prior CRAregulations, the institution should be prepared to provide an explanationfor any material differences in the hours of operations or servicesavailable at branches within the institution's assessment area.   The examiners will also review the institution's record of opening andclosing branches within its assessment area since the previous evaluationand the extent to which any such openings or closings have had a negativeor positive impact on low- and moderate-income geographies within theinstitution's assessment area. In addition, the institution will beevaluated on the basis of the accessibility and use of alternative systemsof delivering banking services in low and moderate income geographies andto low and moderate income individuals.25 Finally, the examiners willassess the quantity, quality, and accessibility of the institution'sservice-delivery systems provided for all income areas within itsassessment area. In making such an assessment, the examiners are directedto consider the degree to which services are tailored to the convenienceand needs of each geography.   As part of the Service Test, the examiners will also review theinstitution's community development services, which can include at theinstitution's option, services through affiliates of the institution. Theexaminers will identify such services and determine whether the servicesqualify under the definition of community development services, benefit theassessment area or a broader statewide or regional area encompassing theinstitution's assessment area; and ensure that any services provided byaffiliates of the institution are not claimed by other affiliatedinstitutions. Taking into account the information gathered in theperformance context, the examiners will evaluate the extent of thecommunity development services offered by the institution; theinnovativeness of any such services, including whether they serve low- andmoderate- income customers in new ways or serve groups of customers notpreviously served; and the degree to which they serve low- or moderate-income areas or individuals and their responsiveness to availableopportunities for community development services.RatingsBased on the analysis discussed above, an institution will be ratedOutstanding, High Satisfactory, Low Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, orSubstantial Noncompliance for each of the Lending, Investment, and ServiceTests.26 These rating descriptions are relatively subjective in order toprovide the examiners with the flexibility to accommodate differences ininstitutions and their communities. The Procedures do not provide anyguidance on interpretation of the descriptions. The examiners will totalthe institution's scores on the three tests to assign the institution anoverall composite rating. Under the Procedures, an institution's assignedrating can be no more than three times its score on the Lending Test.27 Inaddition, the examiners must take into account the results of the fairlending component of the institution's most recent compliance examinationand determine whether these findings should lower the institution's overallCRA Rating. In determining whether to downgrade the institution, theexaminer will also take into account the nature and extent of any evidenceof discrimination, the policies the institution has in place to preventdiscriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective actiontaken, and any other relevant information.EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR SMALL INSTITUTIONSGenerallyUnder the new Procedures, the scope of the examination for smallinstitutions is streamlined, with the primary focus on the institution'slending performance. If a small institution has more than one assessmentarea, the examiners will select the assessment areas for on-site reviewbased on the institution's prior CRA performance, its lending activity inthe assessment area, information obtained from community contacts, anddemographic data on each assessment area.   The performance context for small institutions generally includes thesame information that is reviewed in the performance context forexaminations of large, retail institutions. The primary difference is thatthe examination is much more streamlined, and while the examiners willreview financial information and the prior CRA evaluations of institutionsof similar size that serve the same or similar assessment area(s), theywill not consider the same detail of information regarding similarlysituated institutions as will be considered in examining large retailinstitutions. The review of the assessment area of a small institution isthe same as that of a large, retail institution, as is the review of thesmall institution's public files.   The examiners will review small institutions in five areas: (i) theloan-to-deposit analysis; (ii) comparison of credit extended inside andoutside of the assessment area; (iii) distribution of credit within theassessment area; (iv) review of complaints; and (v) investments andservices (at the institution's option to enhance a satisfactory rating.)Performance CriteriaLoan-to-Deposit AnalysisExaminers will use the data contained in Call Reports and TFRs to calculatethe institution's average loan-to-deposit (``LTD'') ratio since theinstitution's last examination by adding the quarterly loan-to-depositratios and dividing by the number of quarters covered by the examination.If the LTD ratio is high, the examiners will only analyze financialinformation. If the ratio is low, the examiners will make a determinationabout the reasonableness of the LTD ratio by reviewing information gatheredin the performance context, including the institution's capacity to lend,the capacity of other similarly situated institutions to lend in theassessment area, demographic and economic factors present in the assessmentarea, and the lending opportunities available in the institution'sassessment area.28 If the examiners determine that the LTD is notreasonable in light of the performance context, they will also consider thenumber and dollar volume of any loans sold by the institution to thesecondary market, the innovativeness or complexity of community developmentloans and qualified investments by the institution, to assess the extent towhich those activities compensate for a low LTD ratio or supplement theinstitution's lending performance as reflected in its LTD ratio.   Comparison of Credit Extended Inside and Outside of the AssessmentArea(s)The examiners will review HMDA data, automated loan reports or otherreports generated by the institution to analyze the extent of lending bythe institution both inside and outside the assessment area. If such datais not available or cannot be verified, the examiners will use samplingguidelines to select a sample of loans originated, purchased, committed tocalculate the percentage of loans located within the assessment area. Onlyif the percentage of loans or other activities inside the assessment areaconstitute majority of the institution's lending and other activities willthe institution meet the standards for a Satisfactory rating under thiscategory. If such activities are less than a majority, the examiners willconsider information from the performance context with respect to economicconditions, loan demand, and the institution's size, financial condition,branching network, and business strategies.29 If an institution has asignificant amount of lending outside of its assessment area, it may wantto provide the examiners with a geocoded lending analysis since samplingmay not accurately reflect the institution's lending activity.Distribution of Credit within the Assessment AreaThe Procedures direct the examiners to determine first whether the numberand income distribution of geographies in the assessment area aresufficient for a meaningful analysis of the geographic distribution of theinstitution's loans in its assessment area. If such an analysis would bemeaningful and the necessary geographic information is collected by theinstitution in the ordinary course of business, the examiners willdetermine the distribution of the institution's loans in its assessmentarea within the four geographies. While the Procedures state that theabsence of loans in any particular geography should not be a concern, theexaminers are directed to identify groups of geographies by incomecategories in which there is little or no loan penetration.30 If theinstitution collects information about borrower income or revenue, theexaminers will review such information to determine the distribution of theinstitution's loans in the assessment area by borrower income and businessrevenue, and to identify categories of borrowers for which there is littleto no penetration of loans.   If an analysis of the distribution of loans would not be meaningful orcould not be performed, the examiners may analyze the geographicdistribution by street address rather than geography (if such data isavailable and the analysis would be reasonable), or they may analyze thedistribution by loan size as a proxy for income or revenue of the borrower.If the analysis shows that the institution is not penetrating some areas orhas low penetration in some areas, the examiners are directed to form aconclusion about the reasons for the loan penetration using informationgathered in the performance context. If the institution is found to havelow penetration of some areas, it may be useful for the institution toprovide the examiners with data to justify its loan distribution.Review of ComplaintsThe examiners will review all complaints received by the institutionregarding the institution's CRA performance and the institution's actionwith respect thereto as well as any complaints regarding the institutionreceived by the Agencies.Investments and ServicesThese areas will only be reviewed by the examiners at the institution'soption to enhance a Satisfactory rating. If the institution chooses to havethese areas reviewed, the examiners will consider the dollar amount ofqualified investments, the impact of those investments on the institution'sassessment area, and the innovativeness or complexity of the investments.31With respect to services provided by the institution, the examiners willtake into account the same general information considered under the ServiceTest for large retail institutions.RatingsA small institution will be assigned a Satisfactory rating if it meets eachof the standards set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations for that ratingor if it has exceptionally strong performance with respect to some of thestandards that compensates for weak performance in other standards.32 If aninstitution fails to qualify for a Satisfactory rating, the examiners willassign a Needs to Improve or a Substantial Noncompliance Rating dependingon the degree to which the institution's performance falls short of aSatisfactory rating. The Procedures also direct the examiners to review theresults of the fair lending component of the institution's most recentcompliance examination to determine whether those findings should lower theinstitution's overall CRA Rating.PROCEDURES FOR LIMITED PURPOSE AND WHOLESALE INSTITUTIONSGenerallyUnder the Revised CRA Regulations, limited purpose and wholesaleinstitutions are evaluated under separate examination procedures on thebasis of the community development test.33 The scope of the examination forlimited purpose and wholesale institutions will focus on communitydevelopment lending, qualified investments, and community developmentservices. In defining the performance context for the examination, theexaminers will review the same types of information reviewed under theperformance context for large, retail institutions except that the analysiswill focus on the information as it relates to community development. Thus,to the extent the institution collects data to analyze the types ofcommunity development opportunities in its assessment area, it shouldconsider providing such information to the examiners for their use inestablishing the performance context. The evaluation of the assessment areais generally the same as for large, retail institutions.Performance CriteriaUnder the Community Development Test, the examiners will review theinstitution's performance with regard to community development lending,qualified investments, and community development services. The examinerswill review the number and dollar amount of community development loansmade by the institution and will test a sample of the institution'scommunity development loan files to verify that such loans qualify ascommunity development loans. The examiners also will review qualifiedinvestments and other community development services provided by theinstitution and, at the institution's option, will include activities byaffiliates and community development lending by consortia or third parties.In reaching a conclusion about the institution's community developmentperformance, the examiners will take into account the degree of innovationin community development lending activities and the responsiveness of theinstitution to the opportunities for community development activities.34 Tothe extent the institution is collecting information regarding communitydevelopment loans and qualified investments, the institution should providethe examiners with such information, as well as information on thebeneficiaries of such loans and investments.RatingsThe institution will be rated based on the examiner's analysis of theinstitution's performance under the Community Development Test inaccordance with the criteria set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations.35While the rating descriptions set forth in the Revised CRA Regulation arehighly subjective, the Procedures are fairly straightforward.PROCEDURES FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH STRATEGIC PLANSGenerallyThe examination scope for institutions with strategic plans will focus onwhether or not the institution has met the goals stated within itsstrategic plan.36 In order to make such a determination, the examiners mayalso consider the level of the institution's lending, investment andservice activity in the different assessment areas, particularly in low-and moderate- income areas, the importance of the institution in meetingthe credit needs in its assessment area, information provided by communitycontacts and the institution's prior performance evaluations.37As part of the performance context, the examiners will consider anyinformation that the institution provides on its record of meeting thegoals of the strategic plan and will contact local community, governmentaland other representatives to update or supplement information about theinstitution's record of meeting the plan goals. Since the institution islikely to be gathering data to show its progress toward meeting its goalsunder the plan, the institution should consider providing that informationto the examiners. The review of the institution's assessment area willoccur when the strategic plan is submitted.Performance CriteriaThe examiners will review the institution's performance to evaluate theinstitution's record of meeting the performance goals set forth in itsplan. If the goals were not met, the examiners will determine whether theplan goals were ``substantially met'' by considering the number of unmetgoals, the degree to which the goals were not met, the importance of thosegoals and the reasons why the goals were not met.RatingsA rating will be assigned to the institution based on the goals and ratingobjectives established by the plan. If the institution has not``substantially met'' its goals, it can elect to be evaluated under thesmall institution, large or retail institution, or wholesale or limitedpurpose institution test, as appropriate.38 The examiners will also reviewan institution's fair lending performance based on its most recentcompliance examination to determine whether evidence of discriminationexists that should lower the institution's overall CRA Rating.CONCLUSIONThe Procedures are designed to reduce the burden associated with the CRAexamination process while at the same time ensure consistency in theexamination process. While the Revised CRA Regulations and the Proceduresshift the focus of the examination process from documentation to communityreinvestment results, examiners will continue to exercise a fair amount ofdiscretion in interpreting the CRA standards. For example, under theProcedures, examiners will still be required to make subjectivedeterminations with regard to the ``innovativeness'' of loans andinvestments and they will be required to differentiate between ``adequate''responsiveness and ``poor'' responsiveness or ``excellent'' and``reasonable'' dispersion of loans. In the past, the attempts by thefederal banking regulators to ensure certainty and consistency in theexamination process by revising their examination guidance and trainingprograms did not achieve the intended results. The success of the mostrecent attempt by the regulators will be determined over time asexaminations are conducted pursuant to the Procedures. In the meantime,institutions would be well advised to continue to maintain data to supporttheir CRA performance.About the Author(s):*CHRISTINA M.

Even though the Revised CRA Regulations are not effective for otherthan small institutions until July 1, 1997, according to an official of theOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC''), between now and thatdate, examiners will focus on five of the twelve assessment factors setforth in the prior CRA Regulations -- geographic distribution of loans,number of home mortgage and small business loans, participation ingovernment loans programs, participation in community developmentactivities and the bank's record of opening and closing branches.

An institution's fair lending program is no longer rated under theRevised CRA Regulations. However, the Procedures provide that an examinermay decrease an institution's CRA Rating if instances of illegaldiscrimination are discovered in the institution's credit practices. See,e.g., Large Institution Examination Procedures at 145. The Procedures eliminate 50 steps, some of them multi-part, from theold examination procedures under the prior CRA regulations. See Letter fromthe Agencies to The Honorable Joseph P. Kennedy II, dated Jan. 3, 1996.6. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.22 (b). For small institutions, the examinerswill look at objective factors such as an institution's loan to depositratio; the percentage of loans located in the institution's assessmentarea; and the geographic distribution of the institution's loans. See 12C.F.R. Section25.26(a).7. The Agencies are in the process of drafting an ``Official StaffCommentary'' to the Revised CRA Regulations which will be published fornotice and comment in the Federal Register and which is intended to providethe public and examiners with a consistent interpretation of the RevisedCRA Regulations.8. The Revised CRA Regulations require large institutions to collect andreport certain data that will be used by the examiners to evaluate CRAperformance. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.42. The data will be reported to theAgencies electronically in standardized format which will enable theexaminers to conduct much of the necessary analysis prior to the on-siteexamination.9. The Revised CRA Regulations and the Procedures address the means bywhich an institution's performance will be reviewed if it has multipleassessment areas. For purposes of this article, an institution's assessmentarea is referred to in the singular.10. The Agencies have devised standardized worksheets for use by theexaminers in determining community profile, economic patterns, and lendingdistribution.11. The examiners will conduct interviews with local community, civic, orgovernment leaders to help learn about the community, its economic base,and local community development initiatives. These interviews may beconducted prior to the examination or as part of the examination.12. While an institution is not required to provide such information tothe examiners or to create such information, it may still be advisable tomaintain the data necessary to respond to any issues that may be raised inthe examination. To the extent an institution maintains such information,it should provide it to the examiners to assist them in establishing theperformance context for the examination.13. The examiners will look to institutions that are similarly situated interms of size, financial condition, product offerings, and businessstrategy.14. 60 Fed. Reg. at 22171.15. However, if the assessment area reflects illegal discrimination,examiners will take into account problems with the designation of theassessment area when assigning a rating to the institution.

This will be accomplished by reviewing the institution's most recentHMDA and CRA Disclosure Statement, interim HMDA Loan Application Register(``LAR''), and any interim CRA data collected by the institution; a sampleof consumer loans if consumer lending represents a substantial majority ofthe institution's business and any other information the institutionchooses to provide regarding its lending activities. The institution mayalso provide information on small business loans secured by non-farmresidential real estate, home equity loans not reported for HMDA, unfundedcommitments, and information on loans outstanding and loan distributionanalysis conducted by and for the institution, including any explanationsfor identified concerns or actions taken to address such concerns. LargeInstitution Examination Procedures at 419. Examiners will accomplish this by requesting the institution toidentify how loans are attributed and how it ensures that all loans withina given lending category (e.g., small business loans, home equity loans,and other types of loans ) in a particular assessment area are reported forall of the institution's affiliates if the institution elects to count anyaffiliate loans.

A Company That Meaningfully Investigates Alleged Misconduct,Ensures That It Will Not Be Repeated, and Appropriately Sanctions theWrongdoer Will Be Judged More Leniently than the Errant Employee.By:John K. Carroll*Traditionally, the government has exercised its discretion over whether topunish a public company for the misconduct of its officers or employeesbased upon several factors: the seniority of the officer or employeeinvolved; the degree to which the company benefited from the misconduct,the vulnerability of the victims; the extent of harm inflicted; and, to alesser degree, the foreseeability of the misconduct. The consequence ofbasing prosecutorial discretion on this mix of factors has been to leavecompanies -- and their innocent shareholders -- at the mercy of errantemployees. By the time a company learns of the misconduct, it may alreadybe too late to avoid governmental punishment.In recent actions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'') hasindicated strongly that a new factor should be added to this mix. The SEChas made clear that it will calibrate corporate punishment based on thesteps taken by a company, through its board and senior management, onlearning of alleged employee misconduct. In so doing, the SEC hasdelineated a ``duty to respond,'' i.e., the responsibility of seniormanagement to investigate, deter, and punish employee and managementmisconduct. This duty to respond imposes new obligations on companiesconfronted with employee misconduct. In a realistic sense, it promises thata company's punishment, if any, will depend on the knowing and intentionalconduct of its managers.   In two reports, one issued at the end of last year, the SEC specificallyaddressed the duty to respond to employee misconduct.1 A public companywhose management meets this duty can argue compellingly that it should bejudged separately from its errant employees and should be treatedleniently.2 Managers who fail to respond will be criticized and sanctioned.Indeed, a lackadaisical management response may amplify a company'sexposure and even jeopardize its viability. This article will review theCooper and Gutfreund reports and examine the three steps required tofulfill the duty to respond articulated in those reports.THE COOPER COMPANIESBackgroundIn November 1992, a grand jury in the Southern District of New Yorkreturned a 24-count indictment against the Cooper Companies, Inc. and GarySinger, Cooper's chief executive officer.3 In substance, the indictmentcharged Singer in two fraudulent schemes relating to his position as CEO ofCooper. The first scheme, which involved front-running, benefited bothSinger and Cooper. As set forth in the indictment, Singer was tipped by themanager of a high-yield mutual fund with information regarding thesecurities the manager intended to purchase for the portfolio. Singerprofited by going into the market ahead of the fund, purchasing bonds foraccounts he controlled, including Cooper accounts, and reselling the bondsto the fund at a profit. In return, Singer caused payments to be made byCooper to the manager.   Singer's second scheme directly victimized Cooper. Singer caused Cooperto sell high-yield bonds at below-market prices from Cooper's position toSinger and his family. Singer and his family then resold these bonds in themarket at a profit. Singer failed to disclose these related-partytransactions on internal Cooper questionnaires circulated among thecompany's management.   Cooper Company itself was indicted as a participant in Singer's firstscheme, even though the company was the direct victim of Singer's secondscheme and its shareholders were the direct or indirect victims of all ofSinger's misconduct. Simultaneous with the filing of the indictment, theSEC filed a civil action against Cooper, Singer, and his brother StevenSinger arising out of the same series of transactions.4   On January 13, 1994, following a jury trial, Singer was found guilty inconnection with each of the schemes.5 The company was also convicted inconnection with the front-running scheme. Eleven months later, on December12, 1994, the SEC settled its civil charges against Cooper. As a part ofthat settlement, the company agreed to be permanently enjoined from furtherviolations of specified sections of the securities laws, and from anyfurther employment of Gary or Steven Singer. In addition, Cooper wasordered to disgorge $1.4 million plus interest, and to pay a civil penaltyof $1.15 million. The settlement permitted Cooper to offset these paymentsagainst fines and restitution and interest payments made in connection withthe criminal conviction.6The Board's Failure to RespondThe charges against Cooper in both the indictment and the SEC complaintrepresent starkly the inherent paradox when a fraud charge is broughtagainst not only an employee but a public company itself. Why shouldinnocent shareholders suffer the financial consequences of their company'sindictment for the misconduct of an employee, albeit the chief executiveofficer? This issue is especially germane to the Cooper case because thecompany and its shareholders were the direct and intended victims of muchof Singer's misconduct. In its recent report, the SEC answered thatquestion by sharply criticizing Cooper's board for failing to respond toits knowledge of Singer's misconduct. The board's failure is worthdiscussing at length.   As discussed in the report, Cooper's directors were first notified ofalleged misconduct by Singer in January 1992, when the SEC issued a FormalOrder of Investigation of the Cooper Company.7 The board responded to theSEC notice by disclosing the pendency of the investigation in the company'sform 10-K filed at the end of January. There is no indication that theboard took any other action in response to the subpoena.   In early February 1992, the gap between the interests of the company andthose of the Singers widened. In response to SEC questioning, both Singersasserted their Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to testify. At thetime he invoked his privilege, Gary Singer was Cooper's CEO and StevenSinger was acting chief operating officer. Gary Singer had the authority totrade in the company's securities accounts. Steven Singer was formallyelected COO just days following his refusal to testify.   In March, after being formally advised that the company was beinginvestigated by the U.S. Attorney's office, the board authorized aninternal investigation by independent counsel. The board was subsequentlyinformed that independent counsel was unable to interview either Singerbrother. The investigation did reveal, however, that Gary Singer haddiverted $600,000 in trading profits from the company to personal andfamily accounts.8   The government investigation continued, and in May charges were filedagainst the two men who participated in the front-running scheme with Garyand Steven Singer. In connection with his guilty plea, one of these menidentified Gary Singer as a co-conspirator. Although the board was aware ofthese developments, it took no action in response. Subsequently, StevenSinger caused the company to issue a press release in which the companydenied knowledge of any wrongdoing on the part of management. Although thiswas clearly false, the board took no action.   Until the end of May when he agreed to take a leave of absence, GarySinger continued in his capacity as CEO. Even after his departure, theboard approved the continuation of his pay and benefits and authorized therelocation of his offices. The company issued a press release about hisleave of absence that included a denial by Singer that he had participatedin any illegal activity. This press release was also the first publicdisclosure of Gary and Steven Singer's refusal to testify before the SEC orto cooperate in the Company's internal investigation.   During the late summer and fall of 1992, Gary and Steven Singercontinued to participate in the business of the company. Gary Singerattended board meetings, was present at the company's headquarters, andcontinued to have contact with the company's securities brokers. StevenSinger was re-elected as COO in late July. It was not until November 1992that the board finally determined that additional supervision of StevenSinger was needed in light of his assertion of the Fifth Amendment in hisJanuary testimony.   The 21(a) ReportThe SEC unsparingly criticized the board's failure to respond to theallegations of the Singers' misconduct. As the Commission reported,Cooper's board had an affirmative obligation to act; by not acting, itfailed to meet its duties. The Commission explained that it is[e]ssential for board members to move aggressively to fulfill theirresponsibilities to oversee the conduct and performance of management andto ensure that the company's public statements are candid and complete.   In this case, Cooper's Board failed to satisfy its obligations whenconfronted with serious indications of management fraud. After the Boardlearned that a member of senior management had concealed fraudulentself-dealing transactions and thereby caused the company's outstandingreports to be inaccurate, the Board failed to take immediate and effectiveaction to protect the interests of the company's investors. The Board'sinaction allowed a second corporate officer, who himself was allegedlyinvolved in the fraudulent front-running scheme, to direct the issuance ofa press release on behalf of the company falsely denying any knowledge ofwrongdoing. By failing to take immediate and decisive corrective action onthese matters, the Cooper Board appeared to prefer management's interest inkeeping the facts secret over the investors' interest in full, fair, andaccurate disclosure under the federal securities laws.9   The consequence of the board's inaction was dramatic. By aligningCooper's interests with the Singers' fate, the board nullified its chancesof receiving lenient treatment from the government. Indeed, the indictmentof Cooper, in spite of its status as victim in one of Gary Singer'sschemes, can be traced directly to the board's failure to respondappropriately to the allegations of employee misconduct.GUTFREUNDThe Failure to RespondThe facts relating to misconduct on the government trading desk at SalomonBrothers in 1991 have been rehearsed thoroughly.10 The details ofmanagement's failure to respond to that misconduct are particularlyinstructive when considered along with the Cooper matter.   In late April 1991, John H. Gutfreund, Thomas W. Strauss, and John W.Meriwether, three members of Salomon's most senior management, learned thatPaul Mozer, the head of the firm's government trading desk, had submitted afalse bid in an auction of Treasury securities. Promptly upon learning ofthe false bid, these three senior managers and Donald M. Feuerstein,Salomon's chief legal officer, convened and discussed Mozer's misconduct.They concluded that Mozer's misconduct should be reported to thegovernment. Nevertheless, they did not even discuss ``investigating whatMozer had done disciplining him, or placing limits on hisactivities.''11   Salomon's supervisors compounded this failure by not acting on theirdecision to self-report for more than three months. In the interim, Mozercommitted additional violations of the securities laws. In early July 1991,Salomon retained outside counsel to investigate a separate allegation ofmisconduct relating to the government trading desk. In the course of thatinvestigation, Feuerstein disclosed Mozer's earlier misconduct to counsel.Thereafter, counsel widened its inquiry and uncovered additionalauction-related misconduct.   In August 1991, four months after concluding that Mozer had engaged insubstantial misconduct, Salomon finally suspended Mozer and three othersand publicly disclosed that it had uncovered irregularities on itsgovernment trading desk. Within days, Gutfreund, Strauss, Meriwether, andFeuerstein resigned their positions.The Commission's CriticismThe Securities Exchange Act imposes upon broker-dealers a specific duty tosupervise that does not explicitly apply to other public companies.12Failure to meet supervisory obligations can serve as a basis forsanctioning individuals as well as the broker-dealer itself. Gutfreund,Strauss, and Meriwether each were sternly punished for their failure tosupervise.13Although section 15 reaches only broker-dealers and the employees ofbroker-dealers, it would be naive for any public company to ignore theclear duty to respond set forth in Gutfreund:14   The supervisory obligations imposed by the federal securities lawsrequire a vigorous response even to indications of wrongdoing. Many of theCommission's cases involving a failure to supervise arise from situationswhere supervisors were aware only of ``red flags'' or ``suggestions'' ofirregularity, rather than situations where, as here, supervisors wereexplicitly informed of an illegal act.   Even where the knowledge of supervisors is limited to ``red flags'' or``suggestions'' of irregularity, they cannot discharge their supervisoryobligations simply by relying on the unverified representations ofemployees. Instead, as the Commission has repeatedly emphasized, [t]heremust be adequate follow-up and review when a firm's own procedures detectirregularities or unusual trading activity.'' Moreover, if more than onesupervisor is involved in considering the actions to be taken in responseto possible misconduct, there must be clear definition of the efforts to betaken and a clear assignment of those responsibilities to specificindividuals within the firm.   In Gutfreund, the Commission upbraided Salomon's managers for theirfailure to investigate responsibly ``what had occurred and whether therehad been other instances of unreported misconduct.'' Until that inquiry wascomplete, Salomon should have increased supervision of Mozer andappropriately limited his activities.   Another precedent, In the Matter of the Boston Company, Inc., provides astark and encouraging contrast to the results in Gutfreund. There theCommission lightly sanctioned Boston Co.'s management because, in theCommission's view, it had met its obligations under the duty to respond. Asset forth in the Commission's report, Boston Co. used improper accountingpractices and, as a result, overstated its income by $44 million for thefirst three quarters of 1988. As a result, Boston Co.'s parent, ShearsonLehman Brothers, overstated its income for the same period.15A portion of the overstatement resulted from the improper characterizationof certain income and expenses, done at the direction of ``certain''company officers. Citing the exemplary response of management from bothcompanies, including the firing of Boston Co.'s CEO, the institution ofinternal controls, and cooperation with the SEC, the Commission issued asimple ``cease and desist'' order against Boston Co. and took no actionagainst Shearson.16 According to one news report of the settlement, theCommission chose leniency over the stiffer sanctions recommended by itsenforcement staff because of management's response upon the discovery ofmisconduct.THE DUTY TO RESPONDWith the Cooper and Gutfreund cases, the Commission has imposed upon thesenior managers of public companies the obligation to ``take immediate anddecisive corrective action'' when ``confronted with serious indications ofmanagement fraud.'' In practice, this duty to respond requires that, uponlearning of allegations of misconduct, management and the board (i)investigate the allegations to determine whether they are substantial, (ii)take steps to deter repetition of any misconduct, and (iii) if warranted,sanction the employees involved.   This duty does not necessarily require that a company report itsfindings to the government,17 although such a duty may arise from anothersource.18 Alternatively, the company may also determine that the benefitsof self-reporting exceed the almost certain costs.19In sum, Cooper and Gutfreund should be read to impose a duty to act ratherthan wait for government reaction. The company is obligated to investigate,make a determination, and act based on that determination. It is importantto note that the duty to respond is not an obligation to accede to everygovernment allegation of misconduct. Rather, the duty is met whenmanagement can answer a regulator's questions by stating, ``We responsiblyinvestigated the alleged misconduct and took the actions that we deemedappropriate based upon that responsible investigation.''20Meaningful InvestigationWhen management reasonably suspects that an employee has engaged inmisconduct that has brought a benefit to the company, the company shouldconduct a meaningful investigation of the misconduct. The scope of ameaningful investigation differs with the situation, but it always includestwo steps. The company must first review relevant company documents andthen interview current employees with access to relevant information. Ifthese two steps are not completed, company management will have failed inits duty to respond and both management and the company will face increasedjeopardy of being charged.   A meaningful investigation can be completed by internal counsel,accounting, business, or compliance personnel. Conducting a reviewinternally does raise certain risks, however. A review conducted bynon-legal personnel will not be protected from discovery by theattorney-client privilege.21 Similarly, review should never be conducted bypersonnel who had even tangential connection to the conduct under review.Where an employee is both a fact witness and an investigator, thelikelihood that the results of the internal investigation will be disclosedincreases greatly.22 At the same time, internal counsel may not havesufficient perspective to conduct an arm's-length review and the frictiongenerated by an internal inquiry can limit the ability of internal counselto conduct his or her day-to-day advisory duties.   No hard and fast rule governs whether and when employees should beinvited to retain their own counsel.23 Typically, independent employeecounsel is not used at the beginning of an investigation. At such an earlystage, the company does not know whether the employee's interests havediverged from the company's. The employee must be fully informed, however,that counsel is representing the company, not him or her personally.24 Theinvestigating counsel should specifically advise the employee that theresults of his or her interview will be used in the company's bestinterests and that the company controls the use of interview notes ormemoranda. Such use may include disclosure to the government if the companylater determines to waive its own privilege.   Separate representation is advisable when and if the employee'sinterests are no longer co-extensive with the company's. A strong employeedefense benefits the company since the company may be vicariously liablefor the employee's wrongful conduct.25 By retaining separate employeecounsel, a company can present a separate face to an investigatingregulator or prosecutor. For example, if the company chooses to adopt aconciliatory posture, employee counsel will be able to defend aggressivelya position that company counsel could not advocate. Finally, internalinquiries strain company morale. Some of that strain may be mitigated ifemployees perceive that the company will support their separate defense.   Regardless of whether the company provides employee defense,management's primary obligation is to ensure that employees central to theinquiry are interviewed. The employee, no matter what his or her level ofmanagement, cannot be permitted to refuse to speak with the company'sinvestigators. As the Cooper matter makes clear, failure to interview thecentral subjects in an internal inquiry results in the unification ofinterests -- and outcomes -- for the company and the individual.26 Wherethe employee did not act wrongfully, such an identity of interests isappropriate; where the employee did act wrongfully, the company mustseparate its interests from the individual's. The only way a company canmake that evaluation is by learning the facts. A company that must concedeto a regulator or prosecutor that it failed to interview the centralsubject has forfeited its ability to argue compellingly that it should beviewed differently from an errant employee.   Ultimately, the company's obligation is to inquire into a situationthoroughly enough to determine whether wrongful conduct occurred. Cooperstands for the proposition that a company is obliged to reach its ownindependent conclusions and act based upon those conclusions rather thanpostpone that responsibility by waiting for a regulator, prosecutor, orcourt to reach judgment.27 A regulator expects the company to accept theresponsibility of supervising employee conduct rather than demurring andrelying upon government action.28Ensuring That It Will Not Happen AgainThe Gutfreund matter likely would have been more containable had managementpromptly inquired into Mozer's prior conduct upon first learning of thefalse bid. Instead, the company's exposure increased dramatically whenmisconduct on the treasury desk repeated itself after management's initialdiscovery. In effect, Salomon lost its ability to argue convincingly thatit had been deceived by its own employee. By failing to take correctivesteps, management allowed misconduct to happen on management's watch.29A company discovering employee misconduct must act to ensure that suchmisconduct will not happen again. Often corrective steps may involve nomore than increased supervision. Pre-clearing employee activity by animmediate supervisor frequently fulfills this need.   On occasion, more is required. Counsel may recommend that new businessor compliance policies be adopted. The company may determine during thecourse of its investigation that it wants to change the way it pursues aparticular business or exit that business entirely. Particularly whereclass action or shareholder suits loom a company may determine thatbusiness practices should change.Internal SanctionsThe internal review may reveal that the employee has acted wrongfully. Thecompany must act on this information. In the most extreme circumstances, anemployee may have to be terminated and/or reported to a regulator. Moreoften, the appropriate sanction will be a change in job responsibilities ortitle or a reduction in bonus or some other economic penalty.   By acting decisively, the company not only strengthens its argument thatit should be judged separately from the employee, it also gains credibilityin the government's investigative process. By appropriately sanctioning anemployee who has acted wrongfully, the company bolsters its ability toargue that another employee acted correctly. The company in effectvalidates its vote on the conduct of the employees it will aggressivelydefend.   Companies in a regulated industry engage in a constant dialogue withtheir regulators. How a company acts in one circumstance will condition theregulator's expectation in the next. A company that is not perceived asaccepting the responsibility of self-regulation will have difficultyconvincing the government that its fate should be considered separatelyfrom the fate of the employee in trouble.About the Author(s):*JOHN K.

Indeed, it may be argued thatthe availability of a Section 15 remedy in the broker-dealer contextalleviates the pressure to seek vicarious punishment of the institutionpredicated upon the misconduct of the employee. Inevitably, the Section 15remedy separates the conduct of the institution and its supervisors fromthat of errant employees. Where a separate remedy is unavailable, thedistinction between the interests of the institution and the interests ofthe errant employee may become muddied.15.

OF SEC. & COMMODITIES REGS. via NewsNetJanuary 24, 1996   Vol. 29, NASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUES IN REAL ESTATE SECURITIZATIONSBy:Karsten P. Giesecke and Michael Ready Treanor, Jr.*The volume of new issuances of commercial (including multifamily)mortgage-backed securities (``CMBSs'') has grown at a tremendous pace since1991, and significantly more CMBSs are likely to be issued in the future.For example, only two percent of non-multifamily commercial mortgage loanshave been securitized.1 Much of this increased CMBS volume has been in theform of registered public offerings, even though public offerings of CMBSsimplicate co-registration and disclosure issues not present in traditionalmortgage or asset-backed transactions. Disclosure issues arise in a CMBStransaction largely due to the economic significance of individual mortgageloans that back a CMBS. In particular, where individual mortgage loans or agroup of related mortgage loans constitute a significant portion of theassets underlying a CMBS offering, borrowers or other parties may berequired to sign the registration statement as ``co-issuers,'' or the usermay be required to provide financial disclosure regarding the borrowers orthe properties backing such a CMBS. This article will discuss the currentrules governing co-issuer registration and financial disclosure applicableto registered CMBS offerings.COMMERCIAL OR MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIESMortgage-backed securities are securities backed by one or more mortgageloans in a structure designed to protect investors from credit risks (otherthan those associated with the underlying mortgage loans), particularlyagainst claims by creditors of the issuer or sponsor of the transaction.Such securities can therefore be rated based on anticipated cash flowsfrom, and credit risks associated with, such mortgage loans.   Registration of public mortgage-backed securities may be accomplishedunder the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), by filinga registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the``Commission''), usually using either form S-11 or form S-3. Form S-11 maybe used for the registration of securities of certain real estate companiesand is available for the issuance of either (i) securities issued by realestate investment trusts, or (ii) securities issued by issuers whoseprimary business is that of acquiring, and holding for investment, realestate or interests in real estate or interests in other issuers whosebusiness is investing in real estate.2 Since amendments made to form S-3 asannounced in the Commission's Rel. No. 33-6964 (1992) (the ``Asset-BackedShelf Release''), form S-3 is available to, among others, issuers of``asset-backed securities'' that are offered for cash and which are``investment grade.''3 Unlike form S-11, form S-3 permits the issuer toincorporate by reference reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of1934, as amended (the ``1934 Act''). Only issuers using form S-3 have theadditional benefit of the no-action position of the staff of theCommission's Division of Corporation Finance (the ``Staff''), which permitsdelivery of certain computational materials and collateral informationbefore delivery of a final prospectus.4 Registrants using both form S-3and form S-11 may also be able to offer securities on a delayed basispursuant to the Commission's 1933 Act rule 415.5   Mortgage loans backing traditional single-family residentialmortgage-backed securities generally contain large numbers of homogeneousmortgage loans, thereby rendering each individual mortgage loanstatistically insignificant and allowing rating agencies to rate atransaction based on a statistical analysis of the pool as a whole. TheCommission similarly has concluded that, for traditional single-familyresidential mortgage-backed securities, financial information concerningthe related borrowers is unimportant to the investment decision.6 Incontrast, because the initial principal balance of a typical commercial ormultifamily mortgage loan is much higher than the principal balance of theindividual obligations backing other securitizations of pooled assets, CMBSpools often include fewer mortgage loans, with each individual assetrepresenting a larger percentage of the pool (an ``assetconcentration'').7   The Commission has identified two principal consequences of assetconcentration. First, the Commission has indicated that ``asset-backedofferings with significant asset concentration may involve one or moreco-issuers under Securities Act Rule 140.'' In addition, the Commission hasindicated that ``if a significant amount of the asset pool represents theobligations of a single obligor or related obligors, financial informationand other disclosure about the obligor(s) may be required.''   In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release the staff declined expressly toidentify asset concentration limits, indicating instead that existingdisclosure rules would continue to apply. The Staff has since settled onthree key concentration levels as being important. A mortgage loanrepresenting 45 percent of a pool triggers co-issuer requirements, amortgage loan representing over 20 percent of a pool triggers requirementsto file full audited property-level financial statements, and a mortgageloan representing over 10 percent of a pool triggers requirements forcondensed unaudited property-level financial statements.CO-REGISTRATION AND RULE 140The Asset-Backed Shelf Release stated that securities backed by the assetsof a single obligor or group of related obligors are not ``asset-backedsecurities'' for purposes of the new form S-3 rules.8 As a result, anissuer relying on characterization of its securities as ``asset-backedsecurities'' to make such securities eligible for form S-3 and shelfregistration under rule 4159 must involve at least two obligors or groupsof related obligors.10Of greater significance than the prohibition against shelf registration forsingle obligor pools is the requirement that, where significant assetconcentration exists, one or more borrowers with respect to the underlyingmortgage loans may be required to co-register the issuance of thesecurities.11 Rule 140 of the 1933 Act provides that:[a] person, the chief part of whose business consists of the purchase ofthe securities of one issuer, or of two or more affiliated issuers, and thesale of its own securities ... is to be regarded as engaged in thedistribution of the securities of such issuer or affiliated issuers withinthe meaning of Section 2(11) of the [1933 Act]. [emphasis added]   In simpler terms, rule 140 provides that when an issuer of a security(the ``Delivered Security'') uses the proceeds of the sale of the DeliveredSecurity to acquire securities of another issuer (the ``UnderlyingSecurity'') from such issuer, the issuer of the Delivered Security is alsodeemed to be engaged in a distribution of the Underlying Security.Accordingly, the Underlying Security is also being publicly offered and the``issuer'' of the Delivered Security, who is deemed to be directlyaccessing the capital markets, must sign the related registration statementas a registrant in the public offering of the Delivered Security. The viewof the Staff that rule 140 is applicable in the context of a commercialmortgage loan-backed securitization suggests that the Staff views mortgageloans (including those providing for recourse only against the mortgagedproperty) as securities requiring registration if sold in a publicoffering.12   In order to determine the applicability of rule 140 to a particularsecuritization, it is necessary to determine whether the ``chief part'' ofthe business of the issuer of the Delivered Security is the purchase ofUnderlying Securities of a single obligor or related obligors. The Staffhas taken the position that where obligations backing securities includethe obligations of a single obligor or related obligors constituting atleast 45 percent of the mortgage loan pool backing such securities, rule140 is implicated and such obligor or related obligors must co-register.   Rule 140 has generally been viewed as applying only where a personpurchases securities from an issuer, and therefore, would not apply wheremortgage loans made to a non-affiliate are acquired in the secondary marketand not from the borrower. In addition, there have been indications fromthe Staff that it is reconsidering the inapplicability of rule 140 to suchsecondary market purchases and may expand its breadth.13 In the context ofcommercial mortgage securitization, the Staff has taken a broader position,to the effect that rule 140 applies if the issuer of the UnderlyingSecurity financially benefits from the securitization (as a result of whichthe issuer of the Delivered Security may have leverage to require theinvolvement of the issuer of the Underlying Security in the offering of theDelivered Security). In such cases, it is appropriate to determine whether``significant involvement'' exists based on the individual facts andcircumstances presented.   Where co-registration is required, securities which might have beeneligible for issuance under rule 415 of the 1933 Act on a delayed orcontinuous basis (i.e., a shelf registration) will now, as a practicalmatter, be required to be registered on a separate registration statement(i.e., on a one-off basis) because of the need to include the relatedobligor as a co-registrant.14 This has the effect of increasing the costsassociated with a CMBS transaction by requiring the preparation of a fullregistration statement for each new issue. In addition to the time andexpense of issuing securities on a one-off basis, forcing an obligor toco-register means that the obligor will be liable as an issuer under the1933 Act and the 1934 Act and may become subject to the reportingrequirements of the 1934 Act.15   In addition, the co-registration concentration levels trigger issuerfinancial statement disclosure requirements with respect to the obligor ofthe Underlying Security. Under regulation S-X, sections 3-01 and 3-02, theborrower's financial statements must be included in the disclosure topotential securityholders. Regulation S-X, section 3-01 requires eachregistrant to file a consolidated audited balance sheet as of the end ofeach of the two most recent fiscal years or, if the registrant has been inexistence for less than one fiscal year, as of a date within 135 days ofthe date of filing the registration statement.16 Furthermore, section 3-02requires the registrant to file a consolidated audited statement ``ofincome and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years preceding the dateof the most recent audited balance sheet being filed or such shorter periodas the registrant (including predecessors) has been in existence.''17 Forfilings made more than 134 days after the end of the fiscal year, anunaudited interim balance sheet and a corresponding statement of income andcash flows must be provided.18   In a typical CMBS securitization, the mortgagor is often a newly-createdspecial purpose entity which has as its sole asset the ownership of theunderlying real property, and, accordingly, it might be expected that themortgagor's financial statements only cover a short period of time. Therequirement of section 3-02 that the registrant's statement of income andcash flows include predecessor businesses may, however, create significantdifficulty if mortgage loan borrower financial statements are required.Since the special purpose vehicle may be considered a successor to theearlier business from which it acquired the property, financial statementsof such predecessor business may be required. Such predecessor financialstatements may not be readily obtainable. Section 3-05 of regulation S-Xaddresses predecessor business financial disclosure and indicates that adetermination of whether a business has been acquired is to be made withreference to the guidance set forth in regulations S-X, section 11-01(d).Under section 11-01(d), an acquisition of a business occurs when, in lightof the facts and circumstances involved, ``there is sufficient continuityof the acquired entity's operations prior to and after the transactions sothat disclosure of prior financial information is material to anunderstanding of future operations.''19 Such continuity is more likely tobe viewed as present if the special purpose vehicle is related to the priorobligor. To resolve predecessor business issues, it is likely that adiscussion with the Chief Accountant's Office of the Commission would beappropriate.PROPERTY-LEVEL FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAs previously indicated, in instances where sufficient asset concentrationexists, the Commission requires disclosure of financial informationconcerning the specific assets constituting the pool.   The Staff has taken the position that, in the event that a singlemortgage loan exceeds 20 percent of the pool, audited financial statementswith respect to the property, as described in sections 3-01 and 3-02 ofregulation S-X, are required. As described above, sections 3-01 and 3-02generally require audited balance sheets for the two most recent fiscalyears and audited income statements and statements of cash flows for thethree fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balancesheet being filed. In addition, for filings made after 134 days subsequentto the most recent fiscal year, a balance sheet as of an interim datewithin 135 days of the date of filing together with a related interimstatement of income and cash flows, which in each case may be unaudited,must be provided. Staff Accounting Bulletins 71 and 71A (``SAB 71/71A'')state that where ``the amount of a loan exceeds 20 percent of the amount ingood faith expected to be raised in the offering, disclosure would beexpected to consist of financial statements for the underlying operatingproperties for the periods contemplated by rule 3-14,''20 which indicatesthat, for acquired properties, financial statements are for shorterperiods. Rule 3-14 does not apply in the case of acquired businesses,however, as to which rule 3-01 and 3-02 financials (including as requiredfor predecessor businesses) must be included. In many cases (including inparticular where the acquired assets are in the form of a business, such ashotel or nursing home loans), the Staff has viewed acquired mortgage loansas acquired businesses.   The Staff has taken the position that ``condensed'' financialinformation should be provided as to assets that constitute more than 10percent but not more than 20 percent of the entire pool.21 Condensedfinancial information is financial information generally presented inaccordance with article X of regulation S-X and generally consists ofconsolidated unaudited statements similar to those required in a form 10-Qfiling under the 1934 Act.ADDITIONAL ASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUESWhile the Staff's position with respect to asset concentration providesguidance to CMBS issuers, it leaves unresolved many issues regardingexactly what constitutes asset concentration. In particular, in whatinstances do the relationships between borrowers, cross-collateralization,common tenants, or other common features between mortgage loans result insuch mortgage loans being treated as a single mortgage loan for theforegoing analysis, or result in the underlying borrowers being treated asa single borrower? The analysis is a factual one resolved on a case-by-casebasis, generally after prior consultation with the Staff. Nevertheless,certain guidelines are available.   In the instance of a pool consisting of fully cross-collateralized andcross-defaulted mortgage loans securing the debt of unrelated obligors, theStaff has indicated that such a pool would be treated as a single loansubject to the 10 percent or 20 percent financial reporting standards, asappropriate, even though the individual obligors may be completelyunrelated.22 In addition, the underlying borrowers are generally regardedby the Staff as a single borrower under the assumption that they are actingin concert. This may not be the case where it can be proven that theunrelated obligors have voluntarily cross-collateralized andcross-defaulted without the expectation of a pecuniary or other benefit,which would seem to be an exceedingly rare situation.   In addition to obligor-based asset concentration, other types ofconcentration may trigger the need for additional financial disclosure. Inthe event that there is a concentration of tenants, financial statementsfor such tenants may be required,23 although it is unclear at what level ofconcentration such financial statements will be required, and, if required,the nature of such financial statements (i.e., audited or condensed).24Furthermore, in the event of a concentration of managers, the Staff hasindicated that it may require financial statements for such managersbecause of a perception that the bankruptcy of a significant manager couldaffect securityholders.25About the Author(s):*KARSTEN P.

Watterson, Commercial Mortgage Securitizations, Rev. of Sec. and Comm.Reg. (Sept. 14, 1994.)2. See General Instructions to form S-11.3. ``Asset-backed securities'' include qualifying mortgage-backedsecurities (including commercial mortgage-backed securities). ``Investmentgrade'' means that at the time of the sale to the public, the securitiesare rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical ratingorganization in one of its generic rating categories signifying investmentgrade (typically one of the four highest categories). Form S-3 is alsogenerically available to large, widely-held issuers, to subsidiaries ofsuch companies, and for securities guaranteed by such companies. SeeGeneral Instructions to form S-3.4. Because mortgage-backed securities are frequently not structured (andtherefore a final prospectus cannot be printed) until after certaininstitutional investors have decided on their particular requirements afterreceipt of certain information, the Staff has permitted delivery byregistrants of asset-backed securities on form S-3 of certain computationalmaterials and collateral information prior to the delivery of a finalprospectus. See Kidder, Peabody Acceptance Corporation I (avail. May 20,1994); Public Securities Association (avail. May 27, 1994).5. Rule 415 or, as it is commonly referred to, the ``shelf rule'', permitscertain securities to be offered on a delayed or continuous basis, therebyavoiding the necessity of preparing a new registration statement for eachoffering, and thus greatly speeding up the time required to issue newsecurities and reducing related costs. Rule 415 is available to offeringswhich ``qualify'' for form S-3 and, therefore, in the event an offering``qualifies'' for form S-3, the offering may be registered under anotherform (such as form S-1 or form S-11) and still offer securities ``off theshelf''. Rule 415 is also available for ``mortgage-related securities,''which include certain securities rated in one of the two highest ratingcategories by a nationally recognized statistical rating agency and whichare backed by qualifying residential mortgage loans.6. The Commission indicated in the Asset-Backed Shelf Release that in asituation where asset-backed securities are secured ``by a pool offinancial assets representing obligations of a large number of obligors ...the information about the financial condition of any one obligor is notimportant to an investment decision.''7. Larger pools of commercial or multifamily mortgage loans may avoidasset concentration issues. This is particularly true for ``conduit''programs providing for acquisition of mortgage loans from multiple sourceswhich, as part of the program parameters, limit the size of mortgage loansspecifically to avoid asset concentration concerns.8. Id. at page 22 ``... the definition does not encompass securitiesissued in structured financings for one obligor or related group ofobligors''. See also Rel. No. 33-6943 (notice of proposed rulemaking) at 25(``Structured financings would not be considered asset-backed securitiesfor the purposes of the proposed revisions to form S-3 where a substantialportion of the underlying assets are originated by one obligor (includingaffiliated entities).'')9. Single-loan multifamily mortgage-backed securities may still beeligible for shelf registration if they constitute ``mortgage-relatedsecurities'' as used in rule 415.10. As described below, unless the underlying mortgage loans were acquiredin secondary market purchases so that rule 140 would not apply, orco-registrants are already included in the shelf registration statement, asa practical matter at least three obligors or groups of obligors would berequired.11. In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release, the Staff stated that, in instanceswhere there is significant asset concentration, such an asset-backedoffering ``may involve one or more co-issuers under rule 140.''12. But see Bob Reves, et al. v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56 (1990).13. Although open-market purchases of commercial mortgage loans may nottrigger rule 140 (assuming no involvement at all by the obligors under suchloans in the new offering and regardless of the existence of assetconcentration with respect to the mortgage loans), they could potentiallytrigger the requirement for property-level financial statements in theevent that mortgage loans of a single obligor or group of related obligorsexceed the 10% or 20% thresholds described below.14. The Staff has taken the position that the amendment of a shelfregistration statement so as to add or change a co-registrant is notpermissible.15. But see Linpro Income Fund I Partnership (avail.

SAB 71, interpretive response to Question 1.21. Comments of Linda Quinn, Director of the Division of CorporateFinance, at the ABA Annual Meeting on August 9-10, 1994. The requirement toprovide condensed financial information is not based on any publishedposition of the Commission. Indeed there is some authority indicating thataudited financial statements would be required, at least with respect toinvestment-type arrangements. In the Staff Accounting Bulletins, Topic 1 --Financial Statements, I. Financial Statements of Properties SecuringMortgage Loans, the Staff indicated that ``separate audited financialstatements should be provided for any investment-type arrangement thatconstitutes 10% or more of the greater of (i) the amount of minimumproceeds, or (ii) the total assets of the registrant, including the amountof proceeds raised'' and this language has been cited by the Staff insupport of its asset concentration thresholds. Of course, the Commissionbases its standards only in part on the Staff Accounting Bulletins, as theinterpretive responses in Topic 1 were not specifically drafted for CMBStransactions.22. Such an analysis would create the result that audited property levelfinancial statements should be included on an aggregate basis. Suchfinancial statements, however, are not always available and the exactnature of financial disclosure must generally be resolved in discussionswith the Staff.23. Unlike the requirement for obligor financials which, in a non-recoursetransaction, is of nominal investor interest, financial informationconcerning major tenants appears to be of significant investor interest asthe availability of funds to pay securityholders will depend on thetimeliness of the lease payments by major tenants.24. The Staff has indicated that, in cases where there is tenantconcentration but the tenant is not involved in the offering (and,accordingly, audited financial statements, and related auditors' consents,cannot be obtained), the transaction may still proceed as a registeredpublic offering provided that the tenant is a publicly reporting companyand its public filings (including audited financial statements) can bereferenced in the prospectus.25. This view is mitigated by provisions in the relevant documents whichprovide for replacement of the manager and the use of a lockbox or othermechanism to protect the cash flow from creditors of the manager.Information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable.However, accuracy, adequacy, or completeness is not guaranteed.Copyright 1996 The McGraw-Hill CompaniesBack to Headline List WT02-B39-34IA074-000493-B043-240http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi73.html 205.156.212.5 19970122012013 text/html 32637HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:18:19 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:13 GMTContent-length: 32450Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi73.html Sample Issue Copyright THRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNet June 15, 1992 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REPEAL OF KEY AUDITING REQUIREMENTS IBAA Pushes Reforms (537 words) IRS DEBT RESERVE PROPOSAL SETS OFF THRIFT OBJECTIONS (581 words) FASBS NEW UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES PROJECT DEALS WITH ISSUE OF JOINT VENTURE FINANCING (539 words) INCIDENTS OF FRAUD BY INDUSTRY ACCOUNTANTS SHOW DISTURBING UPWARD TREND, FBI SAYS (723 words) THRIFT ACCOUNTING LEDGER OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION (395 words) FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (199 words) FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL (158 words) GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE (105 words) FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (449 words) AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPAS (64 words) THE OPINION PAGE PROPOSED IRS LOAN LOSS RECAPTURE RULE FOR S&LS HEAVILY CRITICIZED BY TAX LAWYER (692 words) CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REPEAL OF KEY AUDITING REQUIREMENTSIBAA Pushes ReformsIn response to banking industry pressure, the Bushadministration is drafting legislation that would undo several keyauditing and regulatory requirements contained in the 1991 FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).     If submitted, the bill could set the stage for aheated fight pitting the administration against congressionalDemocrats and Republicans who feel the requirements are necessary toprotect federal deposit insurance funds.     The proposal, requested by the Independent BankersAssociation of America (IBAA), would repeal a FDICIA provisionrequiring outside ratios of market value to book value for publiclytraded bank and thrift stocks.      Permit rural financial institutions with less than$100 million in assets to self-certify their compliance with theCommunity Reinvestment Act.      Allow regulators to grant all institutions CRAcredit for making loans to depressed areas that are outside aninstitutions delineated community.      Clarify that the standards for safety and soundnessmandated by the FDICIA do not require micro-management ofinstitutions management and operations.      Repeal the small business and small farm reportingrequirements imposed by the FDICIA.      Postpone for a year the truth-in-savings provisionof the FDICIA.      Specify that the FDICIAs aggregate lending limitexceptions for insider loans would also apply to loans secured byTreasury obligations.      Repeal a FDICIA provision requiring regulatoryagencies to establish detailed compensation standards for officers,directors and employees of healthy institutions.      Require regulators to demonstrate immediate andirreparable harm before seizing or freezing assets in advance of anadministrative law judge hearing of accused institution officers,directors and outside professionals.     According to the IBAA, the above amendments actuallyconstitute a scaled-back list of regulatory reforms theadministration feels it can implement this year if a majority in thebanking and insurance industries agree to a broader legislativepackage on interstate banking liberalization. That package includessubstantial home office protection for banks and thrifts in smallercommunities, reauthorization of insurance sales by community banks intowns of less than 5,000 people and limitations on court-sanctionedinsurance underwriting and sales by the nations largest banks.     Interestingly enough, a bill that would mandate someof the FDICIA reforms sought by the administration and the IBAA hasbeen introduced by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.     Doles legislation would exempt institutions withunder $100 million in assets from CRA requirements if they arelocated in towns with populations of 20,000 or less. It also wouldprovide a CRA safe harbor for institutions with assets of $300million or less, if they have satisfactory CRA ratings.     The bill would require banking regulators tocoordinate their actions to ensure consistency and uniformity ofstandards.     It would clarify that regulators are empowered to setlevels below which certified or licensed appraisers are not requiredto perform appraisals.     Moreover, the measure would require regulators toperform an economic impact analysis on any rule that affects morethan 20% of all small institutions.     In addition to the reforms, Doles legislation wouldimpose a 15-month moratorium on Office of Thrift Supervision approvalof any interstate branching applications by federal associationssubmitted under a rule that became effective last month.     The IBAA opposes the regulation, fearing that itcould prompt large banks to seek interstate branching equity in thefederal courts.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992IRS DEBT RESERVE PROPOSAL SETS OFF THRIFT OBJECTIONSAn Internal Revenue Service proposal to tighten thetax requirements on bad debt reserves of savings and loanassociations has triggered loud protests from the thrift industry.     The tempest was ignited by an IRS plan to requireS&Ls immediately to recapture into income their bad debt reserveswhen they change to a commercial bank charter or when they diversifyand their home mortgage-related assets decline below 60% of theirtotal assets.     In other words, the entire amount of bad debtreserves would have to be included immediately in an institutionstaxable income instead of being capitalized over the life of thetroubled debt portfolio involved.     Under the IRS revision, thrifts that switch chartersor flunk the IRS version of the thrift lender test would beconfronted with a much harsher tax schedule than commercial banks,one that would place them at a competitive disadvantage, the S&Lindustry argues.     Moreover, it would prevent thrifts from expandingtheir services more fully to meet the needs of their customers,contends the Savings & Community Bankers of America (SCBA), a newtrade group formed by the merger of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions and the National Council of Community Bankers. The SCBAcontends that the IRS regulation would thwart the TreasuryDepartments broader efforts to modernize the banking industry andpermit savings institutions to offer a wider array of products andservices. Asserting that there is no statutory language authorizingIRS to alter the existing bad debt reserve formula, the SCBArecommends that the agency withdraw its proposed rule.     IRS set procedures for bad debt reserve recaptureafter commercial banks were compelled to recapture their reserves inaccordance with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The new procedures permittedbanks to pay the tax over the life of the loan portfolio to which thereserve applied.     For thrifts, however, the agency is proposing, ineffect, a more rapid bad debt reserve repayment schedule if theychange charters or fail the IRS version of the thrift lender test.     During a hearing before IRS this week, Abraham Ossip,an SCBA representative, warned that the proposal would generate asevere problem for institutions with large reserves built up between1950 and 1980, when Congress gave thrifts an incentive for acommitment to home mortgage lending by authorizing large additions tothe bad debt reserve.     Ossip, corporate tax director for the Dime SavingsBank in New York, maintained that existing IRS regulations stronglyindicate that savings institutions should be allowed to switchcommercial bank charters without tax penalty as long as they remaincommitted to residential lending.     In a lengthy supporting document filed with IRS, SCBAanalysts point out that a distinguishing difference between thereserves of banks and thrifts is that thrifts historically werepermitted much larger reserve additions with respect to theirqualifying loansprincipally residential mortgage loans.     The reserve additions to the qualifying reserve boreno relationship to any anticipation of actual loan losses whencomputed as a percentage of taxable income, the trade groupemphasizes. This percentage, which could have been as high as 100% oftaxable income at the inception of thrift taxability, was graduallyphased down until the 1986 Tax Reform Act set the current percentageat 8% of taxable income.     This statutory requirement, designed to safeguard thecapital levels of thrifts, created a standard of qualifying levelsfor historically profitable S&ls that was far in excess of that whichwould have been established using the bank reserve method, the SCBAnotes.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992FASBS NEW UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES PROJECT DEALS WITH ISSUE OFJOINT VENTURE FINANCINGThe Financial Accounting Standards Board is studyingwhether to require companies that enter into a joint venture to bookdebt used to finance part of the venture.     The FASB proposal would change current practice,which requires that such debt be treated as an off-balance-sheetfinancing.     The proposed change would be in line with the viewsof regulators, who think this item should appear on companies books.Failure to disclose the liability could mislead users regarding thetrue financial condition of the company, banking regulators argue.     The project is part of a broader attempt by FASB todevelop accounting and reporting standards for affiliated entities,an area that is being watched closely by bank regulators.     The Board will discuss the diverse accounting methodsused by various industries,including international accountingstandards, for joint ventures on June 16, according to FASB ProjectManager Ron Lott. In addition, FASB staff will present case studiesthat show current inconsistencies and the problems they spawn, hesays.     Banks and thrifts that establish joint ventures withother entitiesa real estate developer, for examplewould be includedin the scope of the project. Some banks have joint ventures in dataprocessing.     But initially, the Board will avoid using the termjoint venture because it means different things to different people,says Lott. The Board will try first to develop a uniform standardwithout making distinctions between types of joint ventures. If thatdoesnt work, then the Board may be forced to come up with a formaldefinition of joint venture.     Commonly, people think of joint venture as being aninvestment by two people, each owning an equal amount and exercisingjoint control over the investment, Lott says. This is typical in asituation involving real estate.     According to Lott, the absence of any clear standardfor reporting joint ventures has led industries to use varyingmethods. For instance, one company used three methodsequity method,proportionate consolidation and costin accounting for various jointventures.     And those are just three methods I could name off thetop of my head. There may be other methods without names, Lott says.     Current rules for consolidation require a 50%ownership of a subsidiarys common stock. The equity method is used byan investor who owns between 20% and 50% of the companys commonstock, although there are situations when an investor may use thismethod even though more than 50% is owned. The cost method is used ifownership is 20% or lessa stock investment that is required to bemarked to lower of cost or market.     According to Lott, entities that fall between the 20%to 50% range will fall within the scope of the joint venture project.It affects anything not covered by either the consolidation standardor the stock investment standard, says Lott.     Other projects focusing on other aspects of theconsolidation issue also are under way. Two discussion memoranda areout for comment: New Basis Accounting and Consolidation Policy andProcedures. The Board decided to consider the need for and timing ofpublic hearings on both documents after comments, due by July 15,1992, are received.     The Board also has commissioned a research study ondisaggregated disclosures, which is expected to be completed laterthis year.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992INCIDENTS OF FRAUD BY INDUSTRY ACCOUNTANTS SHOW DISTURBING UPWARDTREND, FBI SAYSGeorge BrooksFraud is on the rise at financial institutionsnationwide and the perpetrators are no longer from within the teller-to-middle-management range, according to an FBI expert on fraud.     Accounting staff committed 13% of about 150embezzlements over $250,000 in institutions across California, forexample, Special Agent Robert DeMaria told accountants attending arecent meeting of the Financial Managers Society in San Francisco. Atleast 13% of the total dollar losses in the 350 cases of fraudreported last year in the state wound up in accountants pockets.     The FBIs profile of an embezzler is a person 33 yearsof age who has been with a company at least five and a half years,and with an average time on the job of more than three years. Theembezzlers work performance rating usually ranges from good toexcellent or outstanding.     The potential embezzler is a highly desirableemployee, reliable, bright, motivated, and trustworthy, says DeMaria.He or she is an achiever with high self-esteem, an independent workerwho is self-sufficient and has good self-control.     The embezzler is married with children, optimistic,empathetic, well-educated and has never been arrested. His or hergreatest fear is being found out by family and friends, DeMariaconcludes.     Leading DeMarias list is collusion between insidersand outsiders (39% of incidents, resulting in 32% of total losses),followed by electronic data processing and support staff (19% ofincidents, resulting in 22% of total losses). Warehouse personnelequalled accountants notoriety by committing 13% of reported fraudbut ended with less cash in their pockets7% of total losses.Dishonest treasurers admitted to 7% of the incidents but walked awaywith only 6% of the fraud-related losses in their pockets.     Although the percentage of fraud being committed atthe executive level may appear small (9% of some 350 cases handled bythe FBI last year), the culprits accounted for 20% of the totallosses.     Half of the fraud reported in California wasdiscovered by accidentthrough called-in tips, for exampleaccording toDeMaria. Only 19% was uncovered by internal auditors, whilemanagement controls snared only 10% of the perpetrators.     DeMaria cites three reasons people commit fraud:situational pressure, opportunities that create an environment forfraud and personal characteristics that may drive a person to commitfraud.     Situational pressure could push somebody to embezzleagainst or in behalf of a company, for example, falsely boosting acompanys revenues to impress stockholders and artificially inflatestock prices, he says. We have several pending investigations in thatarea.     Other reasons include high personal debt, financialloss, inadequate income, extravagant lifestyle, excessive gambling,job frustration or inequity whether imagined or real and undue familyor community expectations.     However, weak or dishonest management, or simply onecorporate manager calling the shots, also ranks as one of the majorcauses of institutional fraud, DeMaria notes.     In one case, DeMaria and his team arrested a 54-year-old accountant for embezzling some $3.2 million from the bank whereshe worked. During that time, the bank was under investigation by theFBI for certain questionable deals that put it on the brink offailure. Despite the presence of the agents, the accountant continuedto carry out her scam under their noses for nine months until herarrest.     Asked why she did it, she replied, For years, I havewatched (the owner) and his cronies go into his little office tofigure out how to plunder this institution. Very simply, I decided toget my share before this thing collapsed.     Like any good accountant, she kept records of everyillegal transaction management ever made. Her books led to the arrestand conviction of 18 top management officials. For cooperating withauthorities, her jail time was reduced to 67 days.     Some embezzlers do it for bizarre reasons, too. Oneaccountant was arrested by the FBI for embezzling $4,312.16. Puzzledby the exactness of the amount, DeMaria asked the felon why he tookthat specific amount.     Attending conferences and speaking to colleagues whowere employed in companies similar to mine, I found out I was beingunderpaid, he said. So I netted it all out and figured how much thecompany owed me. Thats how much I took.     Insiders who commit fraud are mostly first-timeoffenders, 90% of whom are motivated by greed, says DeMaria.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT ACCOUNTANT via NewsNetJune 15, 1992OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISIONCore Capital to Total Adjusted Assets Ratio (or leverage ratio).

First of twoexcerpts.     The IRS has taken the position in the proposedregulations that the large bank reserve recapture timing rules of the1986 Tax Reform Act apply to some large banks, but not to all largebanks. Large banks that were formerly thrifts are not eligible, inthe IRS view.     As many others commentators have noted, this positiondirectly contradicts the position previously taken by the TreasuryDepartment in public testimony to the Congress on Oct. 26, 1989, andalso directly contradicts the interpretation given in the JointCommittees General Explanation of the 1986 act.     There is nothing wrong, of course, in a governmentagency changing its position when it discovers that it has made amistake in interpreting the law.     Where there is such a complete change from aconsistently held position, the IRS would appear to owe the public aconvincing explanation of the statutory basis for its change inposition. These regulations purport to interpret a statute. They arenot legislative regulations.     The preamble skips over problems of statutorylanguage and construction, and goes directly to the IRS policyconcerns.     Policy concerns alone, no matter how valid, areirrelevant to the issue of statutory interpretation unless theService can first articulate a convincing case that the statuteitself is ambiguous. This has not yet been attempted.     Even if ambiguity were subsequently demonstrated, theServices stated policy concerns would not support its proposedstatutory interpretation. In addition, the IRS can actually addressits stated policy concerns much more effectively than the wayoutlined in the proposed regulations.     The core policy issue in this area seem to be Section593(e).     Under that provision, thrifts are subject to partialrecapture to the extent they distribute untaxed earnings accumulatedin their reserve balances.     Once a large thrift becomes a large bankand beginsrecapturing all of its reserves over a multi-year periodit isapparently no longer subject to the partial recapture rules ofSection 593(e).     The IRS does not like this result, and apparentlywould have preferred that Congress maintain a continuing role forSection 593(e).     This policy argument is historically quite relevantto the issue of congressional intent, since one of the options beforethe Congress in 1985 was an approach to recapture that would havesimilarly stressed the policy concerns underlying Section 593(e).   The Joint Committee staff recommended an option underwhich thrifts changing to the specific charge-off method wouldautomatically recapture only the bank portion of their reserves,while the remainder would be subject to the continued application ofSection 593(e).     The IRS apparently would have preferred thisapproachsince it would have treated the bank portion the same waybank reserves are treatedand it would treat the thrift or subsidyportion in the way thrifts reasonably expected those reserves wouldalways be treatedi.e., recaptured if, and only if, they liquidated orattempted to distribute untaxed amounts in their reserves toshareholders.     There is much to be said for this approach as apolicy matter. I suspect that many in the thrift industry might agreethat it would have been wiser had the Congress adopted this JointCommittee approach to the timing of recapture, rather than theelective cut-off method.     But the IRS is purporting to make a statutoryconstruction argument, not a pure policy argument. In that regard,there is a world of difference between Congress making an unwisepolicy decision, and making an unreasonable or insupportable policydecision.     It is not enough for the IRS to say, or even prove,that choosing the cut-off method, over the Joint Committee option,would have been unwise.     To make its statutory argument, the IRS must argue,and must demonstrate, that it would have been so insupportable orunreasonable that no one can rationally conclude that Congress couldhave made that choice.Back to Headline List WT02-B39-35IA074-000493-B043-269http://telnet.newsnet.com:80/libiss/fi74.html 205.156.212.5 19970122012032 text/html 37570HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 01:18:33 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 20-Jan-97 17:40:13 GMTContent-length: 37383Content-type: text/html /data/webdev/libiss/fi74.html Sample Issue Copyright THRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNet June 22, 1992 SAMPLE ISSUE HEADLINES STATE BANK INVESTMENT LIMITS CALLED INCONSISTENT WITH LAW (469 words) ADC LOANS FOR HOUSING ARE NOW REGARDED AS THRIFT INVESTMENTS UNDER THE QTL TEST (768 words) OTS, CBO DISAGREE STRONGLY ON THE INDUSTRYS CONDITION 700 More S&Ls At Risk?

Paul Schosberg, president of the Savings & CommunityBankers of America, contends that the FDIC proposal takes a muchnarrower view of those powers than Congress intended when it enactedthem in  the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ImprovementAct.     The FDIC interpretation, which the FDIC says wouldput state banks insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund ona par with those insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, unjustlyrestricts the amount a savings bank can invest in equities and mutualfunds, Schosberg maintains. He is urging the FDIC to reconsider.     In an amendment to the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation Act, the FDICIA generally limits the activities andequity investments of a all state-chartered banks insured by the SAIFand the BIF to those permissible for national banks.     The dispute between the FDIC and the industry centersaround the agencys interpretation of a grandfather clause in theprovision, which became effective last Dec. 19.     Specifically, the provision creates a limitedgrandfather for investments in common or preferred stock or shares ofinvestment companies.     This grandfather exception pertains to savings bankslocated in states that, as of Sept. 30, 1991, permitted them toinvest in such stock listed on a national securities exchange or inshares of an investment company registered under the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940. These banks must have made or maintainedinvestments in listed stock and registered shares during the periodfrom Sept. 30, 1990, to Nov. 26, 1991 (the window period).     Under the FDICIA amendment, those institutions couldacquire or retain, with FDIC approval, listed stock or registeredshares to the same extent that they did during the above period, upto 100% of their capital.     But Schosberg claims the FDIC is ignoring the spiritand letter of the provision in its proposed rule. He argues that theproposal defines equity security authority using restrictions that gofar beyond the discussions that led up to the FDICIA and far beyondits language.     The proposal divides equity powers into two groups:mutual fund holdings and holdings of common and preferred stock.     Under the proposed rule, an institution that hadmutual fund and equity holdings during the window period couldcontinue to invest in the holdings, but only up to the highest levelinvested during that period. The total of all such investments couldnot exceed 100% of capital.     We will suggest that the FDIC return to what webelieve was the intent of Congress, Schosberg says. State banksholding either mutual funds or stocks during the window period shouldbe permitted to invest in either type of security in the future, upto 100% of capital.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992ADC LOANS FOR HOUSING ARE NOW REGARDED AS THRIFT INVESTMENTS UNDERTHE QTL TESTIn an effort to help ease the nations credit crunchand stimulate the housing market, the Office of Thrift Supervision isnow permitting some acquisition, development and construction (ADC)loans to be treated as qualified investments under the qualifiedthrift lender (QTL) test.     To be eligible, the ADC transactions must involveresidential housing projects and bear little risk, according to newThrift Bulletin 20-2, which also offers guidance on QTL testrequirements regarding starter homes and credit-needy areas.     ADC loans for development of commercial structureswill continue to be ineligible for qualified thrift investment (QTI)status.     OTS move is consistent with a Bush administrationdirective asking regulators to moderate tough regulatory requirementsthat discourage insured lenders from making real estate-relatedloans, as long as the action does not pose a threat to the safety andsoundness of the institutions involved.     ADC transactions received a bad reputation during the1980s when government studies implicated them in the savings and loanindustry debacle. As a result, Congress and federal regulatorsimposed restrictions on such transactions, most of which wereconsidered high-risk.     For an ADC transaction to qualify as an investmentunder the QTL test, it must meet the following criteria:      Both stages of an acquisition and development loanmust be funded in a single combination. The financing must be a loan,not an investment.      The S&L involved must demonstrate that the propertyis reasonably certain to be developed as domestic residentialhousing;      The property must be zoned exclusively forresidential use;      The property must be zoned to permit residentialuse, and the deed must have legally enforceable covenants thatrestrict its use to sites for structures designed primarily forhomes; or      The property must be zoned to allow residential use,and the borrower must certify that he or she intends to constructdwelling structures immediately on almost all of the property.     S&Ls must have at least 65% of their assets inhousing and housing-related assets in order to pass the QTL test. Ifthey fail it, they could be compelled to convert to commercial bankcharters.     QTL test provisions allow thrifts to include in theirqualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans andinvestments used to buy, build or develop starter homes or starterhome developments.     To be classified as a starter home loan for QTL testpurposes, TB 20-2 says, a loan must be:      Secured by a one-to-four family home, condominium orcooperative, or by a development where 75% or more of thedevelopments value consists of such homes;      Located in the associations Community ReinvestmentAct community; and      Valued when the loan is made at an appraised valueof 60% or less than the median value of newly constructed one-to-fourfamily homes in the thrifts CRA community.     If no median value figures are available for theassociations CRA community, OTS explains, the institution mayestimate the value by relying on data provided by the Federal HousingFinance Board, the National Association of Home Builders or privatefirms.     Federal laws and rules also let thrifts include intheir qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loansmade to small businesses or for construction, development orimprovement of residential housing or community service facilitieswithin credit-needy areas.     The term credit-needy area includes areas within thethrifts delineated CRA community that meet one or more of thesecriteria:      Census tracts, counties or areas in a MetropolitanStatistical Area with median household income that is 80% or less ofthe MSA median.      Census tracts where loans by all institutions, asreported by the most recent available Home Mortgage Disclosure Actdata, total 50% or less of the average loan volume for all censustracts in the MSA, and the median household income is 120% of the MSAmedian.      Areas that have been designated as credit-needy byfederal, state or local government and that receive some form ofcredit-related targeted assistance from such governments.     If none of the above data are available for theassociations community, credit-needy areas may be identified afterconsultation with local government and community representatives, TB20-2 says.      In addition, it says, if the loan is for a smallbusiness or a community service facility,  it may be classified asbeing for a credit-needy area for QTL purposes if it is made to asmall firm owned by a person whose home address is within the credit-needy area, or if it is made to a community service facility thatprimarily serves people whose homes are in the credit-needy area.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992OTS, CBO DISAGREE STRONGLY ON THE INDUSTRYS CONDITION700 More S&Ls At Risk?Bob DukeAre the shadows of misfortune that have stalked thesavings and loan industry for more than a decade fading or growinglarger and darker?     Like beauty, the answer lies in the eyes of thebeholder. This was evident last week when a favorable report on theindustrys condition issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision wasshot down by Robert D. Reischauer, director of the CongressionalBudget Office.     Although the industrys net income for the firstquarter of this year totaled $1.6 billion, a figure nearly equal tothat for all of 1991, Reischauer contended that the industrys futureremains bleak.     He told the Senate Banking Committee that anadditional 500 to 700 savings institutions might fail during the nextthree years, substantially boosting the cost of the taxpayer-financedindustry cleanup.     Reischauer said the only reason that the industryscondition seems  good now is that so many insolvent and troubledinstitutions have been removed from the scenario.     The cost of this effort has been high, and thecleanup of the thrift crisis is not over, he stated.     Reischauers comments chilled the festive atmospherethat had prevailed earlier when OTS Director Timothy Ryan announcedat a briefing that the industrys strong first quarter earnings thisyear, coupled with its solid performance last year, stronglyindicated that the industry was becoming capable of sustainedprofitability and stability.     Ryan emphasized, too, that the industrys capitalposition had improved greatly over the past two years.     Furthermore, he pointed out that the 1992 first-quarter profitmarked the fifth consecutive quarter that the industryhad been profitable. In addition, he said, this was the first timesince 1986 that quarterly net income had exceeded $1.5 billion.     Later, in testimony before the Senate BankingCommittee, Ryan declared that the end of the industry cleanup was insight.     We have closed over 700 failed thrifts with nearly$360 billion in assets since the Financial Institutions Reform,Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 became law, Ryan said. Allcritically undercapitalized institutions that we have identified asbeing nonviable should be resolved, or have active resolutionstrategies in place, this year, if the Resolution Trust Corporationis granted funding and the current real estate markets do not worsen.     Ryan said only 37 nonviable institutions remainunresolved.     Reischauer sees the situation differently, arguingthat when the cleanup is finally over, it will have cost the public$215 billion (in 1990 dollars), and fewer than 1,400 thrifts willremain on the financial services industry landscape. At present,there are 2,064 S&Ls in the private sector, compared with 2,096 atthe end of last year and 4,000 in 1980.     If 500 to 700 more savings institutions go under, asReischauer believes, then there will almost certainly be a merger ofOTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ryanadvocates such a consolidation,  and there is considerablecongressional sentiment favoring it. Proponents argue that there isno logical reason for the perpetuation of a costly federal agency toregulate a shrinking industry.     Whatever the case, OTS-OCC merger legislation is sureto be introduced  in Congress next year by House Banking CommitteeChairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, or some other member of hispanel.     Meanwhile, in his congressional testimony, Reischauerwarned that if the Resolution Trust Corporation stops acceptinginstitutions for resolution by October 1993, as scheduled, andtransfers the remaining case load to the FDIC-administered SavingsAssociation Insurance Fund, the fund will be unable to handle thetask without additional federal resources.     This situation has been worsened by the failure ofthe administration and the Congress to agree on continued funding forthe RTC, and the premature setback of RTC resolution operationsbefore completing its task, he said.     While Reischauer concedes that industry profits haveimproved, he thinks the situation could change quickly if the presentfavorable interest-rate environment took a negative turn.     But Ryan maintained that capital was the best measureof the thrift industrys safety, since it provides a buffer betweenthe institution and the SAIF, and between it and American taxpayers.     Today, the industrys tangible capital is over 5% oftotal assets, Ryan told the Senate Banking Committee. In the secondquarter of 1989, the industry reported tangible capital of only 3%.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992REVISED FEE SCHEDULEThe following list illustrates the reduction ofapplication fees now applicable to well-capitalized thrifts under OTSexpedited processing program:     Expedited interstate and intrastate branch filings:$650; standard applications submitted by undercapitalizedinstitutions: $1,900.

This authority is outlined in two interpretive letters issued bythe OCC Office of Chief Counsel.     Robert B. Serino, OCC deputy chief counsel, says Section 704 ofthe 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Actclearly authorizes national banks to join the FHLBank System and to ownstock in it if they meet the stipulated housing and safety and soundnessrequirements.     The section repealed a provision in the Federal HomeLoan Bank Act that expressly barred national banks from becomingmembers and stockholders in an FHLBank, he says.     Serino cautions that if a national bank decides toapply for FHLBank System membership, it should make sure it complieswith the OCCs general rules relating to prudence and appropriatebanking practices.     For example, he says, if a national bank ownedFHLBank stock exceeding the amount required by federal law for systemmembers, it could create concern at the OCC.     Serinos interpretive letter is expected to eliminateany lingering doubts by national banks as to their authority to jointhe FHLBank System as members and shareholders. Some national bankshave been reluctant to seek system membership because of thosedoubts, the OCC says.     Serino notes that the FIRREA conference reportemphasizes that Section 704s purpose is to expand system membershipto include commercial banks and credit unions that engage in mortgagelending.     The report says a bank or credit union would qualifyfor system membership if its financial condition were sound and itsmanagement and home-financing policy consistent with sound economicfinancing.     This expansion of Federal Home Loan Bank membership is intendedto promote and sustain housing finance and the Banks, the reportcontinues. The [Joint Conference] Committee believes that theextension of membership to insured commercial banks and credit unionsthat engage in mortgage lending will strengthen the Banks and theirability to support the mortgage market.     Serino stresses that the OCC neither encourages nordiscourages national bank membership and investment in the FHLBanks.Such decisions, he points out, are the responsibility of the nationalbanks management and boards of directors.     Meanwhile, in regard to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation(Freddie Mac) preferred stock, OCC Chief Counsel WilliamP. Bowden Jr. says in an interpretive letter that it is permissiblefor national banks to purchase the stock as long as they observe safeand sound banking practices and proper accounting in undertaking thetransactions.     While the statutes permit unlimited investment, as with any equityissue, there are market risks, and share prices may decline due tochanges in market interest rates, the issuers financial standing orgovernment tax policies, Bowden warns. Therefore, the OCC believes thatprudential limits of this sort typically are an element of safe and soundbanking practice.     The chief counsel says Freddie Mac plans to issue itspreferred stock under Section 306(f) of the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation Act, with the stock carrying an investment graderating from a national rating agency.     Congress, Bowden explains, has exempted Freddie Macinstruments of that type from the statutory underwriting and stockinvestment restrictions normally imposed on national banks.Back to Headline List CopyrightTHRIFT REGULATOR via NewsNetJune 22, 1992APPLICATION FEES ASSESSED HEALTHY INSTITUTIONS WILL DECREASE UNDEROTS MODIFIED SCHEDULEBeginning June 30, processing fees assessed healthy savings and loanassociations in connection with certain significant applications willbe considerably lower.     For other thrifts, the Office of Thrift Supervisionfees essentially will remain as they are under the present scheduleapplicable to all institutions.     Healthy institutions are eligible for lower application fees underan expedited processing program authorized by the OTS new applicationsregulation.     To qualify for the expedited program, a thrift mustmeet or exceed its minimum regulatory capital standards and havecomposite MACRO examination ratings of one or two, as well as havesatisfactory regulatory compliance ratings.     The revised fee structure for applications isoutlined in new Thrift Bulletin 48-8.     Although healthy institution managers are delightedwith the modified fee formula, managers for undercapitalized onesnaturally are upset at the change.     Harold L. Levi, a former Federal Home Loan Bank Boardattorney who represents several undercapitalized institutions,contends that the new formula is unfair and that lower fees forcertain applications should be  determined on a case-by-case basis.     Levi, managing partner in Harold L. Levi Associatesin Washington, says the formula is inconsistent with OTS generalpolicy of adopting rules applying to the industry as a whole.     In any event, classification as being healthy willmean much lower applications processing fees in some instances.     For example, expedited interstate and intrastatebranch applications will cost $650 for healthy institutions, comparedwith $1,900 for standard or unexpedited applications. For anexpedited change-of-location application, the fee will be $250,compared with $900 for a standard application.     While undercapitalized institutions will have to pay$1,400 for bylaw amendment applications, healthy institutions wonthave to pay anything, since their submissions will be regarded byauthorities as preapproved.     Well-capitalized thrifts wont be assessed any processing fee forcharter amendment applications, but undercapitalized ones will have topay $1,400.     Ailing S&Ls will have to pay $5,300 for applicationsinvolving the inclusion of subordinated debt and mandatorilyredeemable preferred stock in capital. In contrast, healthyinstitutions will be assessed only $1,700.     For a finance subsidiary application, the processingfee will be $6,650 for a standard one and $2,000 for an expeditedfiling. An application for an exemption from the loans-to-one-borrower requirements will cost a healthy S&L $825, compared with$2,500 for an undercapitalized one.     For other applications, the present fee schedule generally willprevail for all savings associations.     Because the new applications restructuring regulationwill replace certain applications with simple notices, OTS expectsthe time and cost associated with processing such transactions todecrease.     Accordingly, the fees relating to transactions andactivities that formerly required applications have been reduced, TB48-8 says. The new fees are based on the existing fees imposed onapplications estimated to have similar processing times.     The bulletin notes that the assessment schedule nolonger contains fees for applications for agency offices, temporarychanges of location, investments in office buildings, brokereddeposits, liquidity penalty and affiliated transactions.

The new parallel-processing supercomputer, whichwas unveiled at the World Trade Center on Jan. 8, utilizes up to128 of Intel's high-performance, 64-bit i860 microprocessors andcan deliver up to 7.6 billion floating point operations persecond (GFlops).  About a dozen of Pru-Bache's 400 traders and salesmen currentlyhave access to applications running on an iPSC/2, a precursor ofthe new iPSC/860. "Over the next six to 12 months, allparallelizable, cpu-consumptive applications will beparallelized, and a large number of our traders and salesmen willbe using them," says Vincent Pica, managing director of Pru-Bache's financial strategies group.  The IPSC/2, an 80386-based supercomputer, was installed at theinvestment firm's New York office in mid-1989. In April, theIPSC/2 will be upgraded to performance levels of the newiPSC/860. The upgrade will result in a iPSC/2-860 hybrid, onethat uses eight i860s and 24 386 chips.  In parallel processing computers, problems are divided intomany parts and executed simultaneously, resulting in executiontimes that far surpass serial or batch processing methods.  Pru-Bache claims it is the first securities firm to use the newgeneration of supercomputers from Intel. The new machines are thefirst commercial products resulting from the joint Intel-DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) Touchstone project.Seeking to set new standards for supercomputer performance,Touchstone hopes to develop a 2000 processor, 150-GFlop machineby 1992.  The air-cooled iPSC/860 machine, with anywhere from eight to128 microprocessors, ranges in price from $265,000 to $3.5million. Intel claims that the new machine out-price-performs acomparable Y-MP supercomputer from Cray Research Inc. by a factorof 10.  Pru-Bache has been using the iPSC/2 machine as a server on itsethernet network which also links IBM mainframes, DigitalEquipment Corp. VAX minicomputers and Sun Microsystems Inc.workstations. The initial applications fitted to thesupercomputer have been geared toward the firm's mortgage-backedsecurities trading business, but future developments will addressgovernment and corporate bond analysis needs.  Current applications running on the iPSC/2 include the creationof collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and predictiveperformance analysis. "There is an evolving need on the part ofsophisticated clients to know how these securities will act overa wider range of interest-rate scenarios, requiring more firepower," says Pica. Last year Pru-Bache created over $13 billionworth of "engineered" securities, he says.  The high-speed capability of the Intel machine has promptedPru-Bache to take on more arcane and computationally intensivefunctions, such as the tax arbitrage associated with CMOresiduals. "Without the arbitrage values, while [an issue] mayhave a high yield before tax, it may have a very low yield aftertax," Pica says.  After-tax residual calculations that once took 20 minutes toexecute on the firm's DEC VAX now take 90 seconds on the InteliPSC/2. And converting the residual program to run in thesupercomputer's parallel processing environment required only 40lines of code.  The supercomputer is also being used to speed programs used inthe analysis of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. Allthe required software conversion -- including the development ofparallel scheduling algorithms that allow multiple users tointeract with the iPSC/2 simultaneously -- has been performedcollectively by Pru-Bache and Intel.  Along with its low price, Intel hopes to win customers bycovering all the compatibility bases. The iPSC/860 purportedlycan be linked to DEC VAX, IBM and/or UNIX-based environments.TCP/IP and ethernet standards are also supported. The iPSC/860 isavailable with up to 2 gigabytes of RAM. Disk storage in excessof 100 gigabytes can be linked to the machine.  "With any parallel computer that's new, regardless of who thevendor is, you have the potential of being left high and dry withthe technology," says William Anderson, executive vice presidentof information systems at Pru-Bache. He adds: "With Intel, atleast from a chip point of view, they control the chip that makesit all happen. "  "We were familiar with [Intel's] management through previousassociations," adds Pica. "We were impressed by their involvementwith DARPA...and Intel had a natural advantage being themanufacturer of the both the 386 and 860 chip."Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990REUTERS TRADING SYSTEMS EXECDEPARTS AFTER TRIARCH FIASCO  Reuters Holdings PLC and Mario Rosi, its global product groupleader for trading room systems, have gone their separate ways.The break comes in the wake of the recent collapse of Reuters'bid to install its TRIARCH 2000 digital data distribution systemat National Westminster Bank (TST, Oct. 9, 1989).  Rosi's departure was expected for some time -- the final strawbeing the Nat West fiasco, sources say. Revenues at Reuters' Richsubsidiary are said to have gone from about $150 million in 1987to $50 million in 1989. The 1989 total is said to includecontinuing service contract revenues of about $25 million, butnot PRISM revenue because it isn't a U.S.-developed product.  Rosi was replaced by David Morgan, formerly Reuters'international marketing manager for trading room systems andRosi's subordinate. Morgan could not be reached for comment.  Morgan's ascendance is said by insiders at Reuters to be a blowfor Rich president Peter Leger. Like Rosi, Morgan will be basedin London and report to David Ure, managing director of ReutersEurope, Middle East and Africa Ltd. As a product group leader,Morgan will also report to Andre Villeneuve, who chairsReuters'international product planning committee in addition tohis regional management responsibilities.  Sources say part of the reason Leger was passed over was thatUre wasn't willing to let North American management gain controlof another product group. John Hull is product group leader fortransactional services, and Buford Smith is product group leaderfor real time information.                       An Amicable Parting  A spokesman in Reuters' London office stated last week thatRosi "had resigned, effective immediately, for personal reasons."Sources at Reuters say the senior executive was offered theposition of director of operations in Italy, an offer he flatlyrefused.  Reached by phone at his London home, Rosi corroborated Reuters'statement, saying that circumstances surrounding his departurewere "totally" amicable. Asked if the failure of Triarch 2000 inany way contributed to his motives for leaving, he said "not atall....I decided the time was right to take on something new,different and more challenging." Rosi says he is looking into"several options" for employment in the industry, including"setting up my own company."  Though Reuters would not elaborate on the details of Rosi'sdeparture, his Reuters stock holdings are likely to have beenconsiderable. Executives were given shares of Reuters stockbefore the company went public; stock options have subsequentlybeen offered over the past few years. Rosi had been with Reutersfor 16 years.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990SEC SAYS RMJ'S OPTIONSSYSTEM IS NO EXCHANGE  The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that RMJ'sOver-the-Counter Options Trading System is not an exchange andthat Delta Government Options Corp., the system's clearingagency, can operate as such.  Last summer, the commission was ordered to define an exchangeby a Chicago federal appeals court which heard a case the Chicagofutures exchanges brought against the SEC (TST, Sept. 11, 1989).The court opinion was a key event in the futures exchanges'sustained legal campaign against the RMJ system, which theyviewed as a competitive market.  A spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange says theexchange "will review the SEC rule and consult with the ChicagoBoard of Trade on future action we would take, if any." A CBOTofficial says the exchange won't decide what to do until the SECissues an official order, expected this week.  The uninterrupted operation of RMJ's system hinged on thecommission's ruling. Had the commission ruled that the system wasan exchange subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,operation of RMJ and Delta might have been temporarily stoppedwhile appropriate registration was sought.  The ruling also paves the way for action on the SEC's proposedrule on proprietary trading systems (TST, Aug. 14, 1989), whichthe commission had shelved while pondering the RMJ case. Thedecision is likely to help sponsors of proprietary systemsunderstand what innovations they can and can't make.  TST learned about key points discussed at the commissionhearing, held on Jan. 5, although SEC officials won't discusswhat was said until the commission issues an official order. TheChicago court order requires the commission to issue its order byJan. 18, SEC officials say.  The key to the SEC's decision is that RMJ's system functions asa so-called billboard without intermediary market makers whocontinuously make a two-sided market, according to StephenLynner, president of RMJ Options Trading Corp., who attended thecommission hearing. Says Lynner: "In the SEC's mind, what mostclearly delineates an exchange in the rules and proceduresimposed by its sponsors is a requirement that a subgroup ofparticipants in the system make bids and offers on the securitiesin the system on a continuous basis. We don't have anything inour procedures that requires anybody to do that."  Instead, RMJ's billboard system "displays indications ofinterest of the price at which someone wants to buy or sell, butthere is no requirement that anybody put up an offer." Indeed,many days have gone by, especially since the Chicago court issuedits order last summer, when no participants have put up bids oroffers, Lynner says.  The RMJ system advertises indications of interest to buy orsell, but executions are done by telephone. In the RMJ system, apotential buyer calls an RMJ broker to enter a bid into thesystem, which other system participants will see on dumbterminals. A potential seller calls the broker to indicate hisinterest. By phone, the broker confirms the deal with bothparties and consummates the transaction with a keystroke.                       What's an Exchange?  During the commission hearing, which lasted over an hour, staffin the SEC's division of market regulation presented arguments tothe commissioners about what constitutes an exchange, accordingto Lynner. He says that among the features the staff saiddistinguish RMJ's system from an exchange are the following: theabsence of a physical trading floor; no concept of members whobuy a seat; and the idea that the system's sponsor selects whatsecurities will be traded.  But, says Lynner, the staff indicated that even "the presenceof any of those things with a billboard doesn't turn the systeminto an exchange." Rather, he says, the SEC staff suggested that"the expectation of a two-sided market may draw the system intomore of an exchange than a billboard."  Last summer's Chicago court order created a "dearth ofinterest" from the 23 participants in RMJ's market, Lynner says.Now that the SEC has ruled in RMJ's favor, Lynner expectstransaction volume to pick up shortly. He says the system'sscreens are already "filling up with bids and offers," thatspreads are tighter and that in general "people are spending moretime with the system."Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990KAPITI AND AREGON JOIN FORCESIN MOVE SEEN AS CONSOLIDATION  U.K. financial software firms Aregon International Ltd. andKapiti Ltd. have merged in what appears to be a shotgun weddingarranged by venture capital companies Advent Ltd. and ElectraInvestment Trust, which have stakes in both companies.  The combined company will operate under Kapiti's name. BarryRoberts, Aregon's managing director, becomes executive chairmanof the combined company. Dick Willott remains as Kapiti'smanaging director. Sources say Aregon has been up for sale forsome time.  Kapiti and Aregon have not crossed paths before at clientinstallations, despite Kapiti's customer list of 500 institutionsworldwide. Previous cooperative ventures thus didn't play a rolein bringing the two parties together.  Sources at the newly combined company attribute the move toproduct synergies. But sources say it's more likely thatinvestors Advent and Electra saw the merger as a means ofmaintaining product lines while reducing costs.  The move makes sense for Kapiti, which last year launched afront-office deal-capture module to its Equation back-officepackage. Customers balked at the module's primitive functionalityand high price, sources say. Aregon's FIST, a digital feedhandler and development toolkit, and its new TS-STAR decisionsupport software could enhance Kapiti's credibility in the frontoffice.                     Picture of Aregon Gray  But for Aregon, the picture is different. Aregon has been goingthrough a bad patch lately, sources say, although the emergenceof TS-STAR has sparked some market interest. Some of thecompany's problems are said to spring from its relationship withDEC.  Aregon, which has traditionally based its products on theVAX/VMS platform, has looked to DEC and in particular thecompany's DECtrade initiative as a vehicle to carry it into themarket for large trading-room systems.  DEC, however, recently acquired the PriceWatch package fromSecurity Pacific Corp.'s Sequor Group subsidiary. Both FIST andPriceWatch perform a similar function within DECtrade; they bothmanage incoming data feeds and deliver real-time market data touser positions. DEC's purchase of PriceWatch suggests it will befavored by DEC over FIST. Observers say Aregon regarded itsinvolvement in DECtrade as "vital" to the company's future.  Aregon has attempted to widen its possible market through amarketing agreement with IBM (TST, Feb. 27, 1989). But thataccord has yet to bear fruit.  The new Kapiti will post 1989 sales of more than 21 millionpounds sterling and pretax profit of 3.5 million pounds sterling.The company's products will include Aregon's FIST and TS-STARpackages and Kapiti's Equation. The complementarity of theproducts, according to Jeremy Wood, executive director at Aregon,is "obvious."  Aregon says the merger gives it access to an internationalsales and marketing infrastructure that will improve distributionchannels for its products. Aregon's two offices, in London andNew York, will be merged with those of Kapiti. Kapiti, a supplierof back-office processing software primarily to foreign branchesof major banks, will gain access to Aregon's client list of morethan 20 trading institutions.                     It Couldn't Not Happen  Aregon's products cater to the front-office tradingenvironment. FIST is a digital feed handler that features anapplications development toolkit. U.S.-based users of the systeminclude J.P. Morgan & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Bankers TrustCo. and Citicorp, Wood says. TS-STAR is a recently launchedanalytics package that delivers easy-to-digest graphicalrepresentations of financial data relationships (TST, Nov. 6,1989).  Kapiti's Equation is a back-office processing system thatcovers all functions of a bank's international department orforeign branch office, including money markets and capitalmarkets trade processing. According to Peter Nizich, senior vicepresident at Kapiti Inc. in New York, Equation "serves as themainframe for the branch office." The package runs on an IBMAS/400 computer with user access via IBM PCs on a local areanetwork. Users in the U.S. include First Interstate Bank andNational Australia Bank.  Both Wood and Nizich agree that the merger is almost certain toresult in the development of a front-to-back-office package. "Icouldn't see how it couldn't," says Wood. Nizich is certain aninterface between FIST and Equation is technologically possibleand will be forthcoming.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TGB SEEKS CAPITAL AFTERASSETRONICS DEAL COLLAPSES  The purported acquisition of interdealer bond broker TGB Corp.by Assetronics is off, according to Henry Wattson, head of TGB.The deal was to have given Assetronics a 20% interest in thebrokerage innovator. TGB's regulatory capital has dipped belowrequisite levels, resulting in a suspension of trading.  Reported in the trade press as a fait accompli, the acquisitionfailed because Assetronics and its founder Jerry Kaplan renegedon their buyout intentions, according to Wattson. Commenting onthe reasons behind the aborted acquisition, Wattson saysAssetronics' Kaplan "got cold feet."  A letter of intent had been signed by Assetronics, according toa source close to the deal, stating that the companies wouldeffectively combine their resources. The agreement was terminatedwhen "contingent conditions in the letter were not met", thesource says.  Founded in 1988, TGB hoped to gain market share by slashingcommissions and using technology to redefine the broker-traderrelationship (TST, July 5, 1988). TGB brokers enter orders intoan automatic order matching system, rather than executing tradesby voice. TGB was partially capitalized by primary dealers andplanned to generate income by selling transaction information.  Assetronics has no business or holdings except cash, and islooking for acquisitions and/or mergers, a source says.  With Wattson's proven track record in interdealer bondbrokerage, TGB was widely regarded as a company to watch.Although TGB still is planning for the future, it is now mired infinancial troubles. "As of yesterday we were $40,000 under-capitalized," Wattson said last week. "We ran out of regulatorycapital."  "What we're trying to do right now is refinance," Wattson says."TGB is close to finalizing a deal with another source ofcapital....we've got other irons in the fire." Details were notavailable. Until it comes up with the requisite funds, TGB is notpermitted to function as an interdealer broker for any securitiestransactions.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990CBOE-AMEX STUDY REJECTSPHLX-PSE-NYSE FINDINGS  A new study on multiple listing of options strongly opposes therecommendations of an earlier study sponsored by the Pacific,Philadelphia and New York stock exchanges' task force. The study,commissioned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and theAmerican Stock Exchange, rejects the earlier study's proposedOptions Market Integration System (OMINTS) (TST, Oct. 23, 1989)for multiple trading of options.  The exchanges' lack of cooperation has prompted RichardBreeden, chairman of the SEC, to force them to the negotiatingtable.  In a letter to exchange officials this week, Breeden hasamended the planned rule change set to take place on Jan. 22(TST, June 5, 1989). The lottery system for newly-traded issueswill be phased out as planned, but Breeden has decided to extendthe ban on multiple listing of existing issues until the fiveexchanges sit down and discuss a plan for linking the exchanges.  The CBOE-AMEX study says OMINTS, a proposed intermarket order-routing system similar to the Intermarket Trading System (ITS)that has linked U.S. stock exchanges since 1978, is redundant,outdated and would not serve the best interests of investors.  The CBOE and AMEX are the largest U.S. options exchanges interms of trading volume, with 44% and 30% of the marketrespectively. Philadelphia has 13%, the Pacific exchange 11% andthe NYSE a 2% share.                       Staying Competitive  While Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia StockExchange defends OMINTS as "a logical first step," the authors ofthe CBOE-AMEX study say the system would "lock the market into anold concept that will significantly impair the ability to developnew and more advanced solutions later."  The new study questions the OMINTS feature which allowsspecialists to choose between meeting the best inter-exchange bidor offer, and thereby executing the order, and re-routing acustomer order. The study says this reduces the immediacy ofexecution, and that the broker initiating the trade from hisoffice should decide the final destination of a customer order.  This, the authors believe, will compel each market maker tomaintain a competitive bid or offer, and thus help to keep themarkets competitive and allow the investor to execute quickly andcost-effectively. Both studies claim to propose measures thatwill prevent market fragmentation -- the task forces's byimplementing an integrated order-routing system and the CBOE-AMEX's by preserving competition.  The new study, jointly authored by Yakov Amihud, professor offinance at New York University's Stern School of Business andHaim Mendelson, professor of decision sciences and informationsystems at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, wasprepared in response to the SEC's white paper calling forcomments on multiple listing of options. The Pacific-Philadelphia-New York study was executed by Tellefsen ConsultingGroup Inc.                         Looking Forward  In keeping with the CBOE and AMEX's desire to take a moreforward-looking approach, the professors have released only aninterim study. They will not release their final recommendationsfor a market integration system until after multiple tradingcommences, allowing the impact of multiple listing to beassessed.  In a letter to Chairman Breeden, Nicholas Giordano, presidentof the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, says the CBOE-AMEX studyoffers no "concrete alternatives to or legitimate criticisms ofOMINTS" and therefore the members of the task force are convincedOMINTS is the best alternative.  Although the exchanges continue to argue over how to integratethe options markets, they all consider development of new pricingsystems for their specialists a top priority.  Options specialists at the AMEX have started using The OptionsPricing System (TOPS), a computerized options pricing model thatupdates prices as the underlying stock prices change. TOPS wasjointly developed by the AMEX and David Bruce & Co., a Chicagofinancial software developer, and the Securities IndustryAutomation Corp.                        Faster is Better  Selected CBOE market makers have had an online analyticalsystem installed. PC Auto Quote uses different pricing models toquickly calculate option prices (TST, Oct. 23, 1989). The pilotsystem uses IBM PS/2 terminals with touch sensitive screens andhas been installed at three booths covering four equity optionsseries. The exchange's floor procedure committee approved theinstallation of the pilot as a test to see if online systems helpto increase order flow.  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is also developing an auto-quote system for options specialists. The auto-quote system hasbeen in use for a few years on the exchange's currency floor.Officials say the exchange hopes to have the entire options flooroperational by April. The auto-quote system updates optionsprices as the underlying security moves. The exchange is alsousing software developed by David Bruce, but because the softwarewill run on a high-powered workstation, exchange officials claimPhilly market makers can update prices six times faster thanusers of Amex's TOPS system.  The Pacific Stock Exchange will have an auto-quote system tiedto its online Pacific Options Exchange Trading System (POETS) toallow specialists to quickly update options prices.  The NYSE is in the process of installing an online automaticquote system for its specialists. The system will carry quotesfor all issues traded on the NYSE.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TELERATE PLANS BROKER VERSIONOF TTS TO RIVAL REUTERS SYSTEM  In response to Reuters Holdings PLC's planned launch of itsDealing 2000-2 foreign exchange order-matching system, TelerateInc. is developing a rival system that will preserve the role ofthe broker in the interbank market. Telerate has traditionallymaintained close relationships with brokers, particularly withCantor Fitzgerald & Co., which provides Telerate with U.S.government securities prices under an exclusive arrangement.  The proposed system will display executable, two-way pricescontributed by foreign exchange brokers. Subscribers toTelerate's Trading Service (TTS) will be able to view and hitfirm broker prices through their TTS slates instead of having totrade over the telephone. Telerate says it is talking to brokersabout participating in the system but has yet to conclude a firmagreement.  The system will use the same worldwide network Telerate builtto support TTS. Telerate says development of the system -- dubbedthe Broker Version -- is 85% completed. The only upgrade requiredto access the new system will be installation of a color versionof the monochrome TTS dealer slate. TTS is a conversationalinterbank trading service that competes with Reuters' MonitorDealing and Dealing 2000 systems.  Dealing 2000-2, which is slated for rollout before the thirdquarter of this year, will make Reuters the sole intermediary forits own screen-based market. The system is expected to take somebusiness away from the telephone-based forex broker market.  Telerate says its Broker Version will retain the existingbroker structure of the over-the-counter foreign exchange market.In that structure, banks telephone brokers to get two-way priceson any currency combination. The brokers match sellers andbuyers, taking a cut in the process.                      Black Boxes Premature  In more direct competition to Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 is RADAR,a black-box order-matching system under development by RADARFinancial L.P., a joint venture comprising MAI PLC, Euro BrokersInc. and a number of as yet undisclosed partners (TST, Oct. 23,1989). But according to Jim Wiseman, chief designer of TTS,Telerate doesn't believe the foreign exchange market is ready foran anonymous black-box trading system.  A TTS user would access the Broker Version by hitting a fieldon his slate marked with the letter B. This would change theformat of both the slate and the screen in front of the trader.The Broker Version slate shows the same function fields along thelower edge of the slate.  Above the function fields, the slate is divided horizontallyinto two segments. The lower segment contains the bank's ownrates for selected currency pairs. The upper segment shows thebest three broker bid and offer rates for the currency pair thetrader is dealing in. The bids and offers are arranged in apyramid formation, with the best bid and offer side by side atthe top-center of the slate.                          Hit the Field  To hit a broker at a particular bid or offer, the tradertouches the relevant field on his slate. At this point, thetransaction is immediately executed, with the systemautomatically exchanging settlement details between the twoparties. If the trader hit the best bid or offer on the slate,the previous second-best bid or offer moves to the top of thepyramid and the new third-best bid or offer joins the pyramid atthe bottom. If the trader hits the second- or third-best bid oroffer, the system automatically hits the best bid or offer at thesame time and calculates the average rate for the transaction.  At the center of the pyramid is a field that displays detailsof the most recent three transactions the trader has completedthat day. Included in the data are the identities of thecounterparties with which the deals were struck. The trader isable to scroll up and down in this field, giving him access totransactions made earlier in the day.  Meanwhile, a fifth quadrant superimposed onto the center of thetrader's screen displays the best three broker bids and offers inthe system, plus the bank's own rates. An incoming call from acounterparty on the TTS network would automatically takeprecedence on the screen over the broker quadrant.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990STRATUS TOUTS JAPANESEDEAL STRUCK LAST SPRING  Security must be pretty tight in Japan these days, becauseYamaichi Securities has only just allowed Stratus Computer Inc.to announce a $1.9 million deal the computer manufacturer strucklast spring with Toshiba Engineering Co. Two of the three XA2000s Yamaichi acquired in the deal have actually been up andrunning since last summer.  A Stratus Computer Inc. press release dated Jan. 2 and sent toTST offices via Federal Express, fax and ordinary mail boldlyclaims: "Stratus wins $1.9 million contract to supply YamaichiSecurities with online trading system."  The third Stratus XA 2000, which was also delivered lastsummer, will support a trading system to be developed by systemsintegrator Toshiba for Yamaichi. Stratus' contract is actuallywith the systems integrator, which is developing the futures andoptions trading system that will run on Stratus computers atYamaichi offices in Japan.                     Economic with the Facts  The release also says that "the Stratus-based system...isalready online," distributing "real-time futures and optionsprices listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to Sun Workstations" onYamaichi's trading floor and at branch offices.  A long discussion starting on page 2 of the press releasedescribes in detail what seems to be a ticker plant, not atrading system. There is no further mention of the futures andoptions trading system in development.  A little investigation helped sort out the situation. Yes,Stratus assures us, the release does describe a ticker plant thatuses Stratus technology, and that system has been in operationsince the summer. A Stratus XA 2000 model 120 receives theprices, and a model 110 distributes the data to brokerworkstations, Stratus says. Yamaichi wanted a second machine toperform the ticker plant function usually performed by onebecause the firm plans to run other, as yet undisclosedapplications on it, Stratus explains.  Now that the ticker plant is up and running, a trading systemis being developed, Stratus says. The third Stratus, anothermodel 120 Yamaichi got in last spring's deal, is being used byToshiba Engineering to develop a new application for futures andoptions trading, Stratus says.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TECHNOLOGY FORECASTING ANDHUMAN FACTORS AT HP SEMINAR  Hewlett-Packard's recent seminar on Technological ChallengesFacing the Securities Industry might well have been subtitledTrue Confessions of Trading Systems Design. Two speakers, ScottAbbey, managing director and head of worldwide operations forMorgan Stanley & Co., and George Kenney, senior vice president ofO'Connor & Associates, offered unusually candid and informativepresentations. The meeting was co-sponsored by Business Week.  Morgan Stanley does its share of strategic technologyforecasting, striving to identify the shape of trading systems tocome. Before airing his latest prognosis, Abbey turned the clockback five years to review Morgan Stanley's then-current vision oftrading systems of the future.                    "What hasn't happened..."  * The attempt to satisfy all the trader's needs -- market data,position management, analytics etc. -- with a single device was"one of the driving forces" of Morgan Stanley's developmenteffort in the early-to-mid 1980s. But it met with "tremendousresistance."  Not only was it difficult to create a single system as good atmultiple applications as separate systems would be, but tradersinsisted on being able to see all their data all the time.  * Morgan Stanley had expected to see a reduction in the averagenumber of devices per trader. Instead, the "tower of power" atmany traders' desks is actually getting higher.  * Large screen devices with partitions -- like the IBM 3290plasma display -- were a hot prospect until Abbey & company foundout that traders didn't like not being able to see over theirterminals.  * Abbey and his team also looked into windowing systems onnormal-sized displays, but traders were adamant about being ableto see "all the information," so overlapped windows werediscarded.  * He had expected much of the analytic workload to migrate frommainframes to workstations. Instead, "a lot of the MIPS on thedesk" are being applied to the user interface.  Meanwhile, "a tremendous number of Lotus spreadsheets" havepopped up on PCs. But PC power hasn't replaced any mainframes. Infact, there are even more mainframes, due to increased demand forlocal data collection, storage, processing and retrieval.                     "What Has Happened..."  * Five years ago, Abbey decided to pay the small incrementalprice of making his firm's terminals "graphics-capable." Today, alot more graphics are being used at Morgan Stanley -- forspreads, trends and graphical user interfaces.  * There's been a significant increase in the use of internaldata. Five or 10 years ago, capital markets traders used external(market) data almost exclusively. Today, more traders have accessto position data, internal research and customer data.  * More interactive software is allowing traders greaterflexibility in configuring and passing data among applications.                           What's Next  Undaunted by his spotty forecasting track record, Abbey went onto share his predictions for the next five years.  * The availability of high resolution intermediate-sized (12"-15") monitors will result in increased use of windowinginterfaces and mice. The higher resolution and larger size willsatisfy traders' need to see all their data, while the shape ofthe monitors won't obstruct vision.  * Mainframe applications developed for the batch environmentwill continue to be grandfathered -- partly because of theinvestment in new applications that talk to the old ones, andpartly because of the need to amortize the old applicationsthemselves. Systems designers, Abbey seems to say, will continueto be held hostage by financial inertia.  This prediction may hold more meaning for Morgan Stanley -- asdevelopers and users of the omnipurpose, mainframe-based Tradeprotrade processing behemoth -- than for other firms.  * Workstations will be the focal point for integration of datafrom heterogeneous in-house mainframes as well as outside datasources. Morgan Stanley has devoted a lot of resources to developconnectivity software that will allow workstations to runapplications that crunch data from remote, mainframe databases.  * Some of the incremental power of new workstations willsupport more sophisticated graphical user interfaces. For a 15 or25 MIP machine, says Abbey, one to three MIPS of windowmanagement is insignificant.  * A lot of money will be wasted on workstations simply becausethey're sexy and the salesman does a good job, and because buyerslook at the one-off cost rather than quantity.  * Another dumpster load of money will be wasted because peopledon't understand how to build distributed systems. "Despite whatanybody says," says Abbey, "I don't believe that that technologyexists and is widely understood."  Abbey believes it will take a lot of blood, sweat and tears,thousands of programming hours and "not a lot of profits" to makea distributed system work. But he believes the investment isnecessary. "There's no way around it; we have to fail and we haveto stand up to our management and say, this is why we have to doit."                     The Facts of Half-Life  Now with O'Connor, George Kenney came from the American StockExchange where he guided the development of a theoretical optionspricing system (TOPS). The system was developed, Kenney says,because specialists on the floor of the Chicago Board OptionsExchange were consistently out-quoting the AMEX specialists.Kenney's AMEX experience left him with a healthy respect for thehuman and political factors of systems design.  The first duty of a trading systems designer, according toKenney, is to survive long enough to complete a project.Unfortunately, "the time it takes to implement and design anarchitecture greatly exceeds the half-life of MIS directors."  At the AMEX, Kenney lasted two years. His successor, saysKenney, must decide whether to complete the project Kenneystarted or throw it away or do something that will have his nameon it. Kenney advises systems architects to make a "soberassessment of the political climate, both yours personally andthat of the firm."Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990TECHNOLOGY FORCASTINGPART TWO                     Consider the Lowly User  But the biggest challenge facing the systems designer, saysKenney, is making "the impedance match between these greatsystems you're spending all this money to design and this pooruser who has to use it."  Kenney had just come from visiting the New York offices of hisnew employer. And while praising O'Connor's "tremendoustechnology," he also points out that "a lot of the users reallydon't know how to turn the systems on, so 95% of the sparkle thatsystem can deliver is really lost."  Systems designers, says Kenney, are the least qualified peopleto make the match between systems and users because they thinkdifferently from users. Designers, for example, are comfortablewith "hidden information," while users are not.  Kenney told of a brief encounter with one AMEX specialistduring tests of an electronic display book. The specialistremarked, You see this ticket? I can touch it. I can smell it,and I trust it. And I don't trust this electronic book. You'llsneak orders into it and I'll never know about them.'                       Eggheads Under Fire  Systems designers, according to Kenney, don't like talking tousers. Instead, they like to deal with system specifications."They get the specs and then go hide behind them and design theirsystem and then they sort of throw it over the wall," saidKenney.  Talking to users is "very painful" for systems designers,according to Kenney. "It takes time -- time away from valuabledesign." Kenney likens the state of computer systems design toautomotive engineering in the 1940s.  Apropos of systems design, Kenney acknowledges his intellectualdebt to John D. Gould, a human factors scientist at IBM'sHawthorne, New York research center. Gould's paper, "How toDesign Usable Systems," will appear as a chapter in the "Handbookof Human-Computer Interaction" edited by Martin Helander and tobe published by North-Holland Press.  The Gould paper describes "good computer systems" as "easy tolearn, easy to use, contain[ing] the... functions that allowpeople to do the things they want to do, and that are well-liked." To meet these goals, Gould says designers should learn topay more attention to users and the user interface throughout thedesign process.                  How to Design Usable Systems  Several clever tactics for increasing user orientation -- bothin the conceptual and testing phases -- are advocated by Gould,including:  * Begin writing the user manual before any code is written --in some cases the draft user manual can become the definitivedesign document;  * Define explicit behavioral targets (not MIPS or I/O rates)for systems performance and test for them. A behavioral goalmight be, after an hour's unsupervised exposure to the system, atrader must be able to execute 10 trades, accurately enter thetrade data, and check his position, in two minutes';  * Eliminate intermediaries, such as marketing research people,between systems designers and users;  * While observing users, ask them to think aloud about whatthey are doing as they are doing it;  * Schedule design meetings in users' work areas;  * Observe and videotape users in their work environment --videotapes "are often much more convincing than charts and oralreports;  * Include users on the design team -- participative designimproves the probability of user acceptance;  * Sketch user scenarios and show them to the design team toprovoke arguments about the user interface;  * Create mock-ups and simulations -- one group simulated a"listening typewriter" by having a concealed typist enter whatusers said.                   Living in a "Sea of Change"  Like Kenney, Gould accuses systems designers of avoidingcontact with users whenever possible. As a result, designers tendto design systems to satisfy themselves, not users. "Smartsystems designers like to build projects that have highintellectual content," says Kenney.  Gould also thinks designers must learn to embrace failure inorder to succeed. Since nobody, no matter how gifted, gets itright the first time, designers must commit to an iterativeprocess, says Gould, and be willing to work in the midst of a"sea of change."  Of course, an iterative design process is only possible withthe right tools. Gould acknowledges the need for a user interfacemanagement system (UIMS).  The UIMS, says Gould, "provides for a well defined interfacebetween that portion of the code that contains the user interfaceand that portion of the code that implements the functions of theuser interface." Gould cites "Apollo Computer's ADM" and"Cosmic's (NASA software) TAE" as examples of commerciallyavailable UIMSs.                      Off the Drawing Board  Kenney actually used some of Gould's techniques whiledeveloping AMEX's TOPS. He hired two industrial psychologists whospent three months gaining the confidence of the specialists anddeveloping a model of the user interface. He formed a userscommittee and developed story boards depicting user scenarios. Hedesigned a mock-up of a custom keyboard, and prototyped asimulator for users on a PC.  "The users were becoming authors; they became invested in thesystem," says Kenney. "And user satisfaction is key to thesurvivability of the MIS director." Key, but no guarantee.Back to Headline List CopyrightTRADING SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY via NewsNetJanuary 15, 1990  Jan. 18 -- Introduction to Real-Time Financial Market Data presented  Jan. 18 -- Introduction to Real-Time Financial Market Data presentedby Waters Information Services; New York.

The SEC wantsexecutives to evaluate and disclose the market risks their companiesface and how they use derivatives as a hedge.  While the action isintended to give investors a better understanding of the risksinvolved with hedging, a new survey suggests many corporate financeprofessionals don't fully understand the risks themselves.     While there has been a dramatic effort in the last year or two toestablish or update corporate investment policies, "where we get intoa little bit of a problem is in the risk measurement and controlelement of those policies," says Robert Baldoni, managing director  ofIrvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting.Stumped by Value-at-Risk     Emcor polled treasury executives recently at multinationalcorporations and found that two-thirds of the more than 80 respondentsbelieved they did not have an adequate understanding of value-at-risk(VAR).       Widely endorsed, VAR is considered an essential component of thenew SEC proposals.  The VAR approach looks at the entire corporaterisk profile, not just the individual transaction -- which is wherecorporations tend to focus, says Baldoni.  "Many people are gettinginvolved in complex transactions and are not necessarily aware of theramifications," he says.       The SEC action comes exactly a year after the bankruptcy filingof Orange County, Calif.  The municipality lost more than $1.5 billionin ill-advised derivatives trades.  Similar recent disasters led theSEC to review the annual reports of some 500 public companies to gaugehow well market risk was being evaluated and reported to investors.     As a result of that investigation, the SEC is calling for newquantitative and qualitative disclosures of hedging activity.  Theaccounting policy for derivatives will have to be detailed within thecorporate financial statements. And the agency wants to see "anarrative discussion" of the company's primary market risk exposuresand how those exposures are managed.  TREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT,January 19, 1996                                                           To the extent that derivatives or other financial instruments areused to hedge a company's primary market risk, the SEC proposes threealternatives to disclose the associated risks:     * The first option is to present a table with "common inputs tomarket risk measurement methods," so that investors and analysts canplug the data into their own models and do their own risk analysis;       * Alternatively, corporate financial executives may choose topresent a  "sensitivity analysis," illustrating the potential impactof certain hypothetical market moves.  The SEC cautions that adetailed explanation of the modeling techniques and parameters must beincluded so that investors understand the analysis;     * The third option is a VAR model which calculates the net effectof all of the hedges used entity-wide.  The risk projection isexpressed as the most that could be lost over a specific period -- aday, a week, a month -- with a statistically-derived confidence level. In other words, a typical VAR expression would be that over the nextquarter there is a 90 percent confidence level that the loss potentialdue to market activity will be no more than x dollars.  To have thatkind of overarching measure of market risk requires some sophisticatednumber crunching.Why VAR, Why Now?     Little about the VAR concept is new, except the need to apply itin a corporate environment.  Financial institutions with dynamictrading operations long have used the approach.  And while mostcorporations have fairly simple and stable hedging positions, Baldonisays that's changing:  "As we have gotten into more complexinstruments the risk profile has changed.  And unfortunately, theinstruments that are being offered are way ahead of the controlsystems in most of these institutions."      The basic statistical concepts of standard deviation, varianceand covariance are at the heart of the so-called "analytic approach,"to VAR, but various simulation methods can also produce VARmeasurements.  However, even the most vigilant risk manager may bestumped by where to get the numbers.       Until New York-based J.P. Morgan introduced its RiskMetricsdatabase in the fall of 1994, there wasn't a reliable, consistentsource of data, says Mike Salzberg, partner with Price Waterhouse inNew York.       "One of our goals is to demystify derivatives," explains JacquesLongerstaey, head of the Market Risk Research unit at Morgan.  Thefirm provides free access to data on commodity futures, fixed-income,equity and currency markets, as well as volatility measures andcorrelations.  The RiskMetrics data is available via the Internet(http://www.jpmorgan.com), and such information services as Bloomberg,Reuters and Dow Jones Telerate.       Access to data has not been the only barrier to widespread use ofVAR.  In fact, 84 percent of the respondents in the Emcor surveyindicated they have not used the RiskMetrics database.       A majority indicated they simply don't have the software to makeuse of the data, which is probably not surprising considering a baselevel VAR package runs from $100,000 to $200,000 a year, according toBaldoni.  He adds that cheaper packages on the market are not verygood.       "To pay for the software and get your people trained you've gotto have the deal flow to justify it," he says.  Most corporationsdon't, and will choose to outsource the analysis. Who Is Responsible for VAR?     Under the new SEC proposals, a corporation will be heldaccountable for the risk quantification that is put before the public. "I think it's beginning to open up a very interesting issue," saysSalzberg of Price Waterhouse.  "Once it starts getting into the areaof actually disclosing numbers, who's responsible for that number?  Isit the risk manager?  The capital markets guy?  The CFO who signs hisname on the report?"       Baldoni says his goal with the VAR concept is to make the numbersunderstandable to the highest levels of the corporation, "so, 10 or 12months later when something goes wrong people aren't saying, 'Oh, Ididn't know.'"     The SEC's stated goal is to make risk quantificationunderstandable to investors, and that, Salzberg says, will haverepercussions in the market.       "Suppose I divide VAR into revenue?What I wind up with is a risk-adjusted value," allowing investors togauge how much they're putting at risk to make that return, heexplained.       "That's how we choose between investments," adds Salzberg, and "right now we can't do that."  But he cautions that VARs should beconsidered directional measures, and not absolute numbers.     "Establishing an historic pattern of risk-adjusted numbers willallow investors to look back and see how accurate the company has beenin determining its risk profile," he says.

Sutton, SEC, 202-942-4400.)CORPORATE-VALUE-AT-RISK        The value-at-risk (VAR) approach was developed by and for thetrading operations of financial institutions, but has been endorsedfor corporate use by the Group of Thirty, the International Swaps andDerivatives Association, the Financial Executives Institute and nowthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.        Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consultingdeveloped a proprietary risk measurement system which they callCorporate-Value-At-Risk (CVAR).  The concept embodies four distinctmeasures, each of which can employ the full range of statisticalanalysis -- variance, covariance, historic scenario analysis, MonteCarlo analysis, etc.:* Operating ExposureThis measures the underlying risk exposure that results from thecompany's operating activities to determine if there is enough risk towarrant the time spent managing it.* Financial Instrument ExposureThis step applies the same analysis specifically to the financialinstruments chosen to manage the company's underlying risk.  Thesetools include such things as securities, debt and hedge instruments.* Operating Exposure and HedgesStep three is to overlay measures one and two and run the same riskanalysis a third time.  This measure, when compared with the company'sinitial operating exposure, should indicate a lower overall level ofrisk.* Counterparty ExposureThis analysis focuses on the company's risk exposure to each financialinstitution that serves as a counterparty.  It provides a measure ofthe upside potential of the hedging portfolio, so that the companystays below its counterparty credit limit.

All of which, it is expected, will significantly raise the cost ofplan administration.          The measure was introduced in the midst of the holidayseason, betwixt government shutdowns and before the east coastdisappeared under a blizzard.  Because of the timing, reaction against the bill has been muted, "butmy guess is you're going to see mobilization," says Paul Doxsee, vicepresident of St. Paul, Minn.-based Pension Solutions Inc., themarketing arm of MSI Insurance Group which specializes in 401(k) planadministration for firms with fewer than 500 employees. When Is An Audit Not An Audit?        Plan administrators, under current law, can exclude certainpension plan assets from the annual audit as long as those assets areinvested with a regulated institution such as a bank or insurancecompany.  The assumption has been that those assets are being auditedelsewhere.  About half of the required audits under the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) contain a "limited scopedisclaimer."         "Potentially, the majority of the assets in a plan aren'taudited, and then you're not getting the full benefit of an audit,"says Sue Hicks with the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants (AICPA) in Washington, D.C.              Since 1987 the U. S. General Accounting Office and the U.S.Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General have issued separatereports questioning the suitability of limited scope audits.          To further dramatize the situation, U.S. Secretary of LaborRobert B. Reich announced in November that Department of Labor (DOL)investigators had more than 300 civil- and criminal inquiries underwayagainst companies accused of improperly diverting 401(k) funds. Doxsee acknowledges DOL has found some bad apples, but says, "I thinkthey've already heightened the awareness ... why do they need theaudit requirement on top of it?"     Although the independent Washington, D.C.-based, Employee BenefitResearch Institute (EBRI) has not taken an official position on thebill, organization president Dallas Salisbury says the bill's reformscome at a relatively high price "with the principal beneficiariesbeing the nation's accounting firms."    Whatever the cost, it's outweighed by the benefits, says theAICPA's Hicks.  The benefits, however, may be in the eye of thebeholder.  While DOL  traditionally has found most 401(k) problems insmall firms, plans with fewer than 100 employees are exempt fromaudits altogether.  "This would be a further cost and discouragementfor large plans while not doing anything to get at the problemsrelated to small plans," says Salisbury.         According to Hicks, AICPA committees have estimated thelegislation would push up the cost of a pension plan audit by 10percent-to-40 percent.  "I would say that for some of our clients whoare marginally profitable, that increase may force a decision todiscontinue the plan.  That's very real.  To a small employer, $500 to$1000 matters a great deal," says Doxee.

Back to Headline List CopyrightTREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996RESOURCEIQ OPENS WINDOW TO EUROPE   Privately-held ADS Associates Inc. is considering conquering theworld, again.  The Calabasas, Calif.-based software developer hasestablished sales and service outposts throughout the world to supportGlobal Trader, a leading broker-dealer work station used by centralbanks and global financial institutions.  But the company's treasurymanagement workstation, Resource, has barely ventured outside NorthAmerica.  That may change this year.   "Our new Windows product was designed with an eye towardinternational applications," says Harvey Holman, vice president forsales.  "The DOS-based Resource product was very much North America-oriented," he adds.   The Windows release, ResourceIQ, is due out in June and isexpected to introduce several unique features.  Among them, a "dragand drop" capability that allows figures and graphs to be moved tooutside applications without the intermediary step of going to anASCII flat file.   Similarly, a spreadsheet figure showing an account surplus can bemoved and dropped on a wire transfer icon and automatically moved intoan overnight investment.  "Through an application programminginterface, all the appropriate wire transfer information moves alongwith the figure," says Holman.   In addition to the new gee-whiz functionality, ResourceIQ hasgained derivatives, sensitivity analysis and risk analysisfunctionality from Global Trader -- "all the things that corporateswant, but have traditionally not been able to afford," says Holman.  Whereas a Global Trader workstation runs between $1 million and $3million, the average Resource installation costs $30,000-to-$80,000.   Annette Sneckenberg, financial operations manager for a $3 billionOmaha-based conglomerate, settled on the ADS Resource workstation ayear ago after grilling three vendors.  "Overall, they had the betterpackage, and the people who came to do the demo were so knowledgeablewe couldn't stump them on anything," Sneckenberg says.  Her firm,privately-held Peter Kiewit Sons, has more than 250 subsidiaries.  "Wewere looking for an investment system that could run the gamut," shesays.

With neither economic indicators nor a federal budget to guideforecasts, corporate credit issuers are on the sidelines.     Beyond Wall Street, the federal government shutdown has blackedout more than data.  Billions of dollars in civilian and militaryexport licenses are held up at the Commerce Department; Small BusinessAdministration loans have dried up; and government contractors havebeen idled.       At the same time, the East Coast blizzard silenced majorretailing centers from Boston to Richmond.  Wall Street's manicreaction to the federal budget talks sank the stock and bond marketslast week when political differences appeared to put off any hope of abalanced budget pact.     The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down over 2.5 percent for theyear to date.  Similarly, the bond market has given back its lateDecember gains, pushing the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond over the 6percent mark.  The Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meetsagain Jan. 30, but most market analysts expect the Fed is as much inthe dark as they are and so will put off any interest rate action.       What little information the market has comes from the Fed thisweek with its report on December industrial production and capacityutilization.  The U.S. Labor and Commerce Departments are expected tobe catching up this week on overdue reports covering gross nationalproduct, employment, retail sales and producer and consumer prices.   Back to Headline List CopyrightTREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996FIRMS WORRY ABOUT BUDGET FIGHT   A poll conducted last month by the Morristown, N.J.-basedFinancial Executives Institute (FEI), found that senior financialexecutives in the United States are concerned about the failure ofPresident Clinton and the U.S. Congress to reach a balanced- budgetagreement.  Asked how a budget impasse would directly affect theircompanies, 68 percent predicted higher interest rates; 56 percentexpected reduced sales; 40 percent believed it would negatively affectemployment; and 50 percent said it would decrease their companies'stock prices.  An earlier FEI membership poll, conducted in earlyNovember, found most of the respondents in favor of Congress' toughtactics -- two-thirds of the respondents said they favored tying anextension of the federal debt ceiling to passage of the budgetreconciliation package.

Back to Headline List CopyrightTREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT via NewsNetJanuary 19, 1996STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING WORRIES HIGH TECH FIRMS    Corporate financial officers may have won a round with theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), but now many are findingthey still have a lot to lose.  After facing years of opposition, theFASB agreed in October to back down from its plan to require thatcorporate financial statements reflect the value of stock optionsgranted as compensation.   The FASB wanted corporations to fix a cost to those options andcharge it against earnings.  While that won't happen, effectiveJanuary 1 the FASB is requiring that the same valuation be included incorporate financial footnotes.  "This is one footnote I hope thereaders of our financial statements don't read," says Chris Paisley,chief financial officer for 3Com Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif.-basedhigh technology firm.   It's not that Paisley has anything to hide, other than a profoundbefuddlement over how to value the thousands of options his companygrants each year.  All 4,600 of 3Com's employees receive options aspart of the company's bonus and incentive program.  "We were obviouslynone too thrilled with this pronouncement," says Paisley.  Start-uphigh tech firms like 3Com routinely use stock options in lieu ofscarce cash to attract top talent.   FASB Provides Questionable Model     The FASB's Statement 123 explains that for stock options "fairvalue is determined using an option-pricing model that takes intoaccount the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, theexpected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stockand the expected dividends on it, and the risk-free interest rate overthe expected life of the option."    "When CFOs realize the complexity of what they're going to haveto do, they're going to be in shell shock because it's not going to bean easy compliance by any stretch," says Cheryl Breetwor, president ofSunnyvale, Calif.-based ShareData, which provides software for stockoption accounting to some 2000 customers throughout the United States. To date, ShareData has produced software that merely tracks acompany's stock options, keeping up with who's vested, and how manyoptions have been exercised.  Putting a value on those options issomething else.   "It's not nearly as simple as the FASB has made it sound.  It'sgoing to be very costly," she says.  Not only will the software willbe expensive, but so will the consulting help Breetwor assumescompanies will need in making projections about stock price,dividends, length of employee service and interest rates, all of whichare needed to feed the FASB model.
