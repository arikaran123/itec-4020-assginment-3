The nations of Melanesia are unparalleled for the diversityof their cultures. Ethnic groups number into the hundreds, andon the island of New Guinea alone, nearly 900 languages are spoken. One critical tradition guiding CI's conservation strategy inmany of these island cultures is a long-standing system of forestownership through tradition clans. CI's strategy aims to cultivateconservation by reinforcing the strong ties that exist betweenthe island people and their land. Papua New Guinea The easternhalf of the island of New Guinea, PNG's biodiversity can onlybe described in superlatives. It harbors over 10,000 floweringplant species, 90 percent of which are endemic, and also boaststhe world's largest dove, grasshopper, and butterfly, and thelongest lizard. CI is working in the Lakekamu Basin, one of PNG'slast intact expanses of lowland rainforest, with four local indigenousgroups and two NGOs to develop facilities for scientific researchand adventure ecotourism. On the island of New Britain, a regionthreatened by intense forestry development, CI, indigenous landowners,and the East New Britain Social Action Committee are creatingconservation areas supported by economic alternatives to logging. Makira Island, the Solomon Islands In partnership with theMaruia Society, the Solomon Islands Development Trust, and 35local Makira Island communities, CI's Conservation-in-Developmentprogram has established a conservation area of 63,000 hectaresof forest. The partners also operate a community-based enterprisethat exports ngali-nut oil. Preferring CI's conservation-baseddevelopment over forest destruction, Makira Island residents rejectedlogging company bids to harvest timber. One of CI's greatestmoments in 1995 came when the 35 villages of Makira Island rejectedlogging contract offers from a major corporation operating inthe region. Armed with information on communities' experiencein other parts of the world, the Makira people didn't go for thequick cash. Instead, they weighed the prospect of logging versusalternative enterprises in partnership with CI, the Maruia Society,and the Solomon Islands Development Trust--and decided in favorof their culture and their land. Their decision is all the moreimpressive since it came before the alternatives, which includea ngali-nut oil export business and ecotourism -- have producedlong-term economic benefits. Fiji In 1995 CI and the MaruiaSociety completed a detailed plan for conserving Sovi Basin, Fiji'slast pristine lowland rain forest. New Caledonia. CI has supportedthe review of the protected area network that will contributeto a major rapid assessment of key forest ecosystems of New Caledoniain 1996.

The Sea of Cortez once supporteda thriving fishing fleet that provided 60 percent of Mexico'stotal fish catch. Recently, though, overfishing, pollution, andadverse climatic conditions have sharply reduced the haul. Marinediversity is threatened, and many local fishermen are idle. CIis working with those who know the seacoast the best--local fishers--toexplore economic alternatives to destructive fishing practices. Focusing on communities bordering the new Upper Gulf of CaliforniaBiosphere Reserve, in 1995, CI helped a number of groups--includingone women's group--set up Mexico's first scallop farms. Otherinitiatives, like fishing techniques that target desired speciesand let others go, are being tested. Bringing years of researchto bear, CI's staff is also designing a conservation action planfor the entire Sea of Cortez, including the Colorado River, MidriffIslands, wetlands, and coastal zones. CI's public awarenesscampaign promotes marine conservation in communities all alongthe gulf, using innovative means like environmental comic booksand theater performances. Threats: Overfishing and inappropriate fishing techniques; water contamination from urban areas, industry, and agriculture. The Sea of Cortez in northwest Mexico ranks among the biologically richest one percent of all the world's ocean areas. CI's conservation solutions in the Sea of Cortez include: developing a participatory management plan for the newly declared Upper Gulf of California/Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve; implementing an environmental education program in local schools, communities, and with the fishing industry; studying the effects of diminished fresh water flow from the Colorado River; and, developing aquaculture projects as an economic alternative for fishermen. For more information about the Sea of Cortez, please visit The Sacramento Bee. Selva Lacandona The 385,000 hectare Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve protects thelargest remaining block of lowland tropical forest in Mexico. Though it covers a mere 0.16 percent of the nation's territory,the reserve contains nearly 50 percent of all known species inMexico. Since the Zapatista Revolution of early 1994, politicalunrest in Chiapas has prompted land-hungry farmers to surge intothe Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve and the forested lands ofthe Lacandon community. CI's biological stations in the reservehave established a conservation presence in the region, and CIis working with all parties--indigenous groups, settlers, andgovernment representatives -- to mediate land disputes. CI staffare also helping to create economic opportunities -- such as butterflyranching and new food crops -- that offer alternatives to slash-and-burnagriculture and cattle-ranching. Threats: Colonization; inappropriate agricultural techniques; conversion of forests for ranching and agriculture; illegal logging. The Selva Lacandona, in Mexico's southernmost state, is North America's last major expanse of tropical wet forest. CI's conservation solutions in the Selva Lacandona include: selecting and analyzing natural products for market potential; working with the Lacandon Indians to demarcate the Lacandon Community Forest; conducting an inventory of the flora and fauna, planning land-use classification, and building a visitor's field station in the Lagunas de Ocotal region; and, continuing the development of a geographic information system, and providing technical support for tracking land tenure, forest cover, and population patterns.

Tambopata In 1995 CI launched a comprehensive, three-year program to bolsterthe Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a 1.5 million hectare reservein the Peruvian Amazon. Called "Conservation Based Developmentin Tambopata," or PRODESCOT, this effort comprises 16 projectsand has received funding from USAID, the Peruvian government,and several foundations. PRODESCOT projects underway include: Land Titling and Mapping CI used five socioeconomic surveysin different areas to provide baseline data, point up potentialland conflicts, and establish a working relationship with localcommunities. CI financed the field work that enabled the PukirieriIndians to officially title their land with the Peruvian government,so they will be better able to fend off incursions from colonistsand miners. And CI has been helping FADEMAD, the Madre de DioFarmer's Union, to collect data on soil, topography and vegetationin more than 28 communities in and around Tambopata. CI is organizingthe data through its computer software, CISIG, and is generatingsophisticated maps to help farmers choose economically attractiveand ecologically benign farming practices. Monitoring and SustainableUse of Natural Resources CI has trained local inhabitants andpark guards in seven areas in Tambopata in natural resource monitoring. This effort is the first in Tambopata to collect long-term dataneeded for making informed decisions about natural resource management. Conservation Enterprise In the 18 months since CI financedthe purchase of a Brazil nut processing plant in Tambopata, wehave developed marketing arrangements that will ensure collectorsa source of income. With orders from nationally known restaurantslike Subway -- the world's largest cold-sandwich chain -- andHard Rock Cafe, millions of Brazil nuts are now exported fromPuerto Maldonado to outlets in the United States.

Withnearly 90 percent -- or 15 million hectares -- of its originalforest cover intact, Suriname harbors rich biodiversity, including674 species of birds, 200 species of mammals, 130 reptiles, 99amphibians, and roughly 5,000 plants. CI Suriname is committedto protecting this country's remarkable stretches of pristinerain forest, while identifying initiatives that will yield incomefor its inhabitants. By presenting options like bioprospectingand ecotourism, CI is helping policymakers realize that they haveeconomic alternatives to wholesale environmental destruction. As a first step, CI prepared an in-depth economic analysis ofthe logging companies' proposals, "Backs to the Wall in Suriname." From this report, government and private forest experts haveconcluded that Suriname would actually see only a small fractionof anticipated revenue. CI also sponsored a visit to Costa Ricafor the first group of Suriname Paliament members to gather informationon development options -- notably ecotourism and bioprospecting-- that offer two potentially profitable alternatives to logging. The Suriname program is now helping design environmentally sustainablenational policies through the development of the CI-Suriname PolicyGroup. This nonpartisan group is currently exploring how to implementEarth Summit's Agenda 21 and Biodiversity Conventions, includinghow to make sure that intellectual and genetic property rightsbenefit local people. Policy decisions on these questions willhave long-term impact on Suriname's economic development and ecosystems.CI is also active in the villages, forging conservation-basedeconomic development programs to benefit local communities. Bioprospecting Recognizing the possibilities for economic returnfrom native plant products, CI is guiding a major bioprospectinginitiative that has already begun to produce some income for Suriname. Partners to the bioprospecting agreement include CI, the U.S.National Institutes of Health (NIH), pharmaceutical company Bristol-MyersSquibb, Surinamese government agencies, NGOs, and the indigenousSaramakaner tribe. Launched in 1994, the project has been collectingflowering plants from rain forests in southern Suriname and screeningthem for biological activity against HIV and cancer. By theend of 1995, 650 specimens had been collected. Of these, 61 showpromising chemical activity, and 20 have been selected for furtherpharmaceutical testing. Royalties from even one new plant-derivedmedication could dwarf logging revenues--and leave the trees standing. The Forest Peoples Fund was established by CI to channel fundsfrom the bioprospecting agreement into conservation initiativesin indigenous communities in southern Suriname. This year, theForest Peoples Fund helped organize a community center in Asindopovillage to house ecotourists, promote arts and crafts development,and provide equipment and training to traditional woodcarvers. The Fund also financed a delegation of Amerindian and Maroonvillage chiefs to visit EMBRAPA, a Brazilian community organizationworking on agroforestry and alternative forest products, to exchangeideas on conservation-based development. The Shaman's ApprenticeProgram The healers, or shamans, of the tropical forests holda world of knowledge about medicinal plants--most of the themyet unknown to Western science. To help preserve this knowledge,foster pride in indigenous traditions, and create an incentiveto protect the forests, CI began the Shaman's Apprentice Programin 1992 in the Amerindian village of Kwamalasamoetoe. This programsupports young Tirio men and women in learning about the usesof rain forest plants from shamans, thus ensuring the knowledgewill be passed on. Following a visit to the CI project, the neighboringWayana people invited CI to start up a similar project in theirvillage of Tepu, which got underway in 1995.

The Tagua Initiative is designed to help protect the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, one of the world's most diverse rain forest "hot spots," while demonstrating the viability of a new model for conservation. In this model, international businesses form partnerships with local producer groups. In doing so, they create the incentives that local people need to save forests, rather than cutting them down. Accomplishments of the Tagua Initiative Creation of a local enterprise in Comuna Rio Santiago Cayapas, Ecuador, to sell tagua nuts directly to Ecuadorian factories that process them into button blanks and jewelry components for export around the world. Training of 20 community members in accounting, management, and product sales to run this local enterprise. Participation of 350 local families - over 1,300 people in the Initiative in Ecuador. Sales of more than 2,000 tons of tagua nuts to Ecuadoran factories. The amount of tagua sold in 1994 increased by 50% over 1993. Creation of a cottage industry to produce hand-carved buttons. This community enterprise has sold over 45,000 hand-carved buttons internationally, and forecasts its production for this year to produce and sell 20,000 additional units in the U.S. and Japan. Sales of over 36 million buttons by 4 TI-licensed international button distributors. In the past year, button sales totaled more than 10 million units. Expansion of the Tagua Initiative from one product (buttons) in one country (Ecuador) in October 1990 to more than 20 products in 8 countries today. Over the next year, the TI will be formalizing several new marketing partnerships with wholesalers and retailers in Japan and Europe. Creation of strategic alliances between the TI and the Keidanren and JAIDO of Japan. This unique partnership has been crucial in laying the groundwork for solid expansion and advancement of the TI. Design and implementation of scientific and socio-economic studies to monitor the effect and success of the Initiative in terms of biodiversity protection and local benefit. Development of environmental education programs for local communities. Over the past year, the TI has received special recognition for its unique work: Partnerships for Change: An international conference hosted by the government of England, as a follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit of 1992, highlighted the TI as a premier example of sustainable development. A key publicity event which gave the TI international recognition, the conference was attended by over 350 participants from over 80 countries. The TI was one of eight case studies chosen to promote successful experiences in sustainable development. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): UNEP launched a major initiative for worldwide publication of sustainability case studies. The paper was distributed at the UNEP conference in June of 1994, and the resulting publication was sent to over 7,000 individuals and groups worldwide. During the last six months, special emphasis has been placed on building facilities to increase local processing capacity, and therefore added value locally. The community enterprise workers have built five production centers that will allow them to process more nuts, which will lead to increased revenues locally. The Tagua Initiative has had great success in the marketing of its message. At present, TI tagua buttons are used by over 30 well-known garment manufacturers. Tagua jewelry and carvings are available internationally by retail and mail order. Furthermore, the project has benefited greatly from coverage by The New York Times, USA Today, National Geographic, ABC News, CNN, BBC, and Radio France, as well as dozens of other media outlets.

It markets products such as buttons and jewelry made from the ivory-like tagua palm nut. People from communities in northwest Ecuador and the Colombian Chocó harvest tagua from their rich forests without disrupting the forest ecology. In less than four years, the Initiative has sold more than 2,000 tons of raw materials and 36 million finished buttons, creating over 1,300 part-time jobs in the community site, including high-quality artisan jobs manufacturing hand-carved buttons for export. In addition to the community enterprise, the Initiative works with four major button manufacturers, two manufacturers of tagua carvings, a major jewelry manufacturer, and a button distributor to the retail market. Dozens of garment manufacturers have joined the Initiative, including such companies as The Gap, Esprit, Timberland, and Smith & Hawken. More important, the Initiative has been an example of alternative land use, and a focal point in local debates over forest stewardship. It played a role in persuading local people to reject a proposed 12,000 hectare banana plantation, and gained a voice for CI in the development of a regional land-use plan.

This CD-ROM brings to conclusion the Madagascar Biodiversity Priority-Setting Process and the Workshop held in Antananarivo in April 1995. The workshop was organized by CI in partnership with DEF, FTM and CNRE and was sponsored by UNDP/GEF. This workshop gathered over a hundred of the foremost authorities on the biodiversity of Madagascar, and generated a ground-breaking set of biodiversity conservation and research priorities which formed the basis for a series of regional workshops for policy action. The CD-ROM includes the most comprehensive set of maps, text, and digital media ever assembled on Madagascar's biodiversity. This information is organized and presented using PRISMA, a software designed for presenting and publishing complex databases using multimedia technology. For the general public, PRISMA offers an easy-to-use browsing capability to view the data and interpretations of that data. It allows the technical user to export data, to complement the database, and to develop additional and new interpretations of the data. Maps and tables can be exported into the users' GIS and database systems for further analysis and interpretations. The CD-ROM includes the following: 150 page Final Comprehensive Report of the workshop coordinators All workshop maps, documentation, visual and sound images Executive Summary of the workshop and PPDOP Biodiversity database (including species distribution, survey sites) compiled by over 100 scientists preceding the workshop Physical, land-use and demographic database Priority sites database including information about their importance for conservation and research The CD-ROM will be available for $ 45.00 (excl. shipping and handling).

Local people clear forests to grow crops, raise cattle, cut timber, or pursue industrial development. Conservation International's Conservation Enterprise Department helps create an alternative to deforestation by developing enterprises based upon sustainable use of natural resources. These sustainable enterprises market "biodiversity products" such as tree oils, plant fibers, nuts, and latexes harvested in an ecologically sound manner from key biological areas. In doing so, they demonstrate that sustainable enterprise can help local people earn their living by managing and harvesting biologically rich forests instead of destroying them for short-term economic gain. Highlights The Croda-CI Renewable Rain Forest Resources line was launched and expanded to Europe and Australia. The Tagua Initiative sold over 36 million tagua buttons to major U.S. fashion designers, including The Gap, Esprit, J. Crew, and Timberland. "Gatherings," CI's new line of rain forest potpourri, is produced by people in the community of El Cruce, Guatemala, and marketed throughout the United States.

Conservationist Norman Myers was the first to identify these most endangered ecosystems. Although rain forest hotspots cover 0.64 percent of earth's land area, scientists think they contain among 30 to 40 percent of the world's biological diversity. But without dramatic changes, much of these habitats could be destroyed by the year 2000. The top ten hotspots on Myers' list encompass just 0.2 percent of the Earth's land surface and about 3.5 percent of the remaining primary rain forest, but contain more than a quarter and perhaps as much as a third of all plant species found in tropical forests, and thus at least 13 percent of all flowering plants on Earth. Hotspot areas are in red on the map, while tropical wilderness areas are green. The key endangered hotspots include: Madagascar the Atlantic forest region of eastern Brazil the lowland forest zone of western Ecuador the forested coastal plain of northern Colombia's Chocó region the eastern slopes of the Andes bordering Amazonia in the countries of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia the Philippine archipelago the island of New Caledonia the remnent forests of Peninsular Malaysia the remaining forests of northern Borneo in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak and the country of Brunei the island of New Guinea (shared by the Papua New Guinea and Irain Jaya province of Indonesia) the eastern Himalayan foothills Many other areas, though not among this list of ten, have paramount regional significance as well. They include: the cloud forest and lowland rain forsets of southern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and Belize the forest of the easten Arc mountains in Tanzania the upper Guinean forest in Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa the Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka the tropical forests of Queensland the Hawaiian Islands Such "second-tier hotspots" will not be neglected; they should be the centerpieces of national conservation programs and CI will be active in many of them as well. Much has changed since the original list of hotspots was first published. CI is helping to produce an updated list for early 1997. Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

Studies have shown that, while new drugs can be found by random screening of plants, plants identified by indigenous people are up to 60 percent more likely to have pharmaceutical potential. For the indigenous people, plants also provide food, oils, latexes, and fibers. By creating incentives for young members of Suriname's Tirío tribe to learn the traditional uses of plants from their elder medicine men, or shamans, the program helps keep critical indigenous knowledge within the tribe. The Shaman's Apprentice Program helps protect the Tirío's forests by reestablishing the value of tropical plants and instilling community pride among the tribal youths--youths who will face difficult decisions about the use of their forests in the years to come. Currently, one of the apprentices is also playing a key role in developing a cottage industry based on traditional use of non-medical products as a means of generating alternative income.

While new drugs can be found through the process of random screening, studies show that plants already identified by indigenous people are up to 60 percent more likely to have pharmaceutical potential than randomly collected plant samples. For indigenous people, the forest serves as a source not only of medicines, but a myriad of other everyday products, including foods, oils, latexes, and fibers. Many of these products can be harvested without destroying a single plant, much less an entire ecosystem. The Problem Unfortunately, the cultures that know and use their forests so well are vanishing today. While many species of rain forest plants face certain extinction, the knowledge of how to use these plants is disappearing even faster. With a number of deadly diseases still left to conquer, society cannot afford to lose this indigenous knowledge of the medical uses of plants. Already, one in every twelve prescription drugs sold in U.S. pharmacies is derived from tropical plants, and the value of these drugs is estimated to be about $3 billion per year. Moreover, one-third of all plant-derived prescription drugs come from rain forest species. After decades of focusing almost exclusively on synthetics, the pharmaceutical industry is again showing interest in developing medicines from tropical plants. Yet these investigations, while unquestionably valuable for the industrialized world, do not always benefit the indigenous peoples themselves. A Solution Conservation International has established the Shaman's Apprentice Program. By providing grants to Shaman's Apprentices -- young men and women within forest societies who work with and learn from tribal medicine men and midwives -- the program encourages the transfer of traditional knowledge to the next generation. Other program efforts include: supporting the collection of plant specimens for herbaria and recording scientific descriptions in computerized ethnobotanical archives; convening workshops for shamans from different tribal and cultural groups; sponsoring the establishment of medicinal plant gardens for both educational and medical purposes within forest and rural communities. The main goal of the Shaman's Apprentice Program is to preserve and perpetuate indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants and other rain forest products. Additionally, the program seeks to create mechanisms through which indigenous people can obtain direct benefits from their knowledge about the forest, to promote viable health alternatives where Western medicine is unavailable or inaccessible, and to integrate indigenous and other rural communities into protected areamanagement.

Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 NEC And Intel Announce Partnership For Global Biodiversity Conservation Jakarta � Computer giants NEC and Intel announced a partnership for conservation of the world's biological diversity today, with joint support of a project to bring computer technology to 25 biosphere reserves in Asia, Latin America and Africa. The partnership was announced during the opening ceremony of a two week training workshop for biosphere reserve managers from the Asia region, with representatives from China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia and Thailand. Conservation International, a U.S. environmental group and a leader in applying computer technologies to conservation will conduct the training. The project is in cooperation with the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which created the concept of biosphere reserves in 1971 and today coordinates a network of 334 reserves in 84 countries. "This project demonstrates how NEC's commitment to Computers and Communications can increase the human potential to maintain the health of our planet's ecosystems. It extends our long-standing support of environmental initiatives by making the most of technology for nature conservation at a global level," said Mr. Ono, Senior Vice President of NEC Corp. "Bringing the power of the personal computer into these biosphere reserves allows researchers to collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world. Strengthening this capacity will have a multiplying effect throughout the regions in which they work," said Intel Chairman Dr. Gordon E. Moore. Indonesia's Ministry of Forestry is hosting the training at the Cibodas reserve near Jakarta. Indonesia is among the world's megadiversity countries, with an extremely high number of plant and animals species. It is also experiencing rapid development, which puts pressure on natural ecosystems necessary to support biological diversity. The main goals of the project are to strengthen institutional capacity and provide sophisticated computer equipment to allow for the transfer of technology and networking among biosphere reserves. Conservation International, which has projects in several biosphere reserves, will provide training and software for its Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), biological databases and Internet communications. "This project illustrates the power of partnerships. NEC and Intel are providing support and technology. Conservation International is providing on the ground expertise and UNESCO is providing global coordination for the network of biosphere reserves," said Peter A. Seligmann, CI Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Together we're bringing the most sophisticated technology to bear on conservation while ensuring economic health." Designed to offer local conservationists in developing countries access to critical technology, GIS is particularly useful in biosphere reserves, because it integrates geographical, biological and ecological data with social and economic factors, displaying them as visual images. Among its many applications are assessing the environmental impact of development projects and evaluating trends in deforestation and human disturbances. Access to the Internet is critically important for scientists who can use electronic networks to access data, exchange information, and communicate with their colleagues in other countries. "This is conservation at work in today's high-tech world. Getting the right kind of equipment and technology to people in developing nations is a tremendous help in confronting a multitude of rapidly changing environmental challenges . . . " said Silvio T. Olivieri, CI's Vice President for Conservation Planning and Technical Cooperation. "This kind of commitment from corporate leaders is essential in keeping up the necessary momentum to balance the ever increasing pace of environmental destruction throughout the world." Biosphere reserves are dedicated to the conservation of critical ecosystems, scientific research on biological diversity, and the establishment of sustainable alternatives for the management of natural resources. However, despite their international recognition, biosphere reserves often face critical shortages in the technology needed to manage natural resources and establish electronic communication links to the outside world. This lack of technical capacity is greatest in developing countries, which frequently claim the highest concentration of biological diversity under the greatest threats. ### WT02-B18-16IA083-000589-B019-97http://www.conservation.org:80/web/news/nff2-2/nff2-2.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216022044 text/html 16565HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:25:40 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 12-Dec-96 19:31:42 GMTContent-length: 16379Content-type: text/html News from the Front Volume 2, Number 2 Volume 2 Number 2 October - November 1996 IN THIS ISSUE More Animals Could Face Extinction Perilous Hours in the Sky for Conservation AquaRAP Races to Explore Scientists Stumble on Ancient Mayan City World Cheetah Population at All Time Low More Animals Could Face Extinction Washington, DC: Fully a quarter of all known mammal species are at risk of extinction, according to the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals � the most comprehensive scientific assessment of threatened species yet produced. Habitat destruction and other threats are pushing the entire spectrum of Earth�s biodiversity alarmingly close to the brink. Published by the Species Survival Commission (SSC) and CI, the 1996 Red List is the first assessment to mark the conservation status of all known mammals. But the report also contains equally grim estimates on other animals: 11 percent of all known bird species are threatened; 20 percent of reptiles, 25 percent of amphibians, and 34 percent of fish, mostly freshwater species. �This scientific assessment is indisputable proof that warnings about global biological diversity loss haven�t been exaggerated � if anything we�ve been too optimistic,� said Russell A. Mittermeier, CI president and chair of the SSC�s Primate Specialist Group. �Furthermore, the 1996 List is the first study to use rigorous criteria for assessing the conservation status of species, making these grim findings more defensible than ever before.� To produce the 1996 list, 500 scientists, including those from SSC partners BirdLife International, CI, The Nature Conservancy, and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, provided data and carried out assessments. For the first time, the List has added a �critical� category representing the most endangered of the endangered species�those animals on the edge of extinction. �The Red List is actually a red flag, warning us about the perilous state of animals and drawing attention to threats such as habitat destruction, pollution, over-harvesting, and the introduction of non-native species,� said Jorgen Thomsen, CI's Senior Director for Conservation Biology. The Red List originated in 1960 as a set of index cards containing information on 34 mammals on file at the SSC Secretariat in London. In more than three decades, the job of monitoring the status of the world�s biodiversity has drawn together the SSC volunteer network including more than 7,000 scientists, field researchers, government officials and conservation leaders from 179 countries. Logging Thousands of Perilous Hours in the Sky for Conservation Tucson, Arizona: Pilot Sandy Lanham may have one of the most dangerous jobs in conservation. Lanham flies more than 30 partners in Mexico, helping them gather data for wetlands and migratory bird research, mountain range and desert surveys, and inventories of marine mammals and other endangered wildlife. �These flights can be fatiguing, and sometimes dangerous,� said Lanham. �Because we often fly for hours at less than 200 feet above ground or sea level, a momentary lapse of concentration could send us into the cacti of the Sonoran desert.� Aviation�an essential conservation tool in remote areas�is usually too costly for researchers in developing countries. But in Mexico, Lanham is making overflights affordable through her Tucson-based company, Environmental Flying Services (EFS). Supported by CI and other institutions, Lanham has logged 3000 hours of flying time since 1991 for Mexican wildlife managers and researchers. Lanham, a Michigan native, has been flying for 16 years. She came up with the idea to start EFS when she was living in Sonora, Mexico in the 1980s. �I knew the need was great because researchers kept asking for my time,� Lanham said. In the Gulf of California, Lanham is assisting Silvia Manvanilla from the Independent University of Mexico to track the position and movements of the vaquita � a rare and elusive porpoise. Their findings will help determine key threats and the areas most critical for the vaquita�s survival. Last July, Lanham and Manvanilla made the first-ever vaquita sightings in the Colorado River where it joins the Gulf of California. Conservationists hope to leverage this finding with policymakers to expand protection for the vaquita. Lanham is also helping CI�s Gulf of California program conduct a survey of small fishing boats and fishing camps along 2,000 kilometers of coastline in the gulf�considered one of the richest fisheries in the western hemisphere. So far, CI has tallied over 10,000 vessels in a series of overflights. CI will use the census results to pinpoint where the gulf�s resources are most exploited and to determine where to target sustainable use programs. AquaRAP Races to Explore, Conserve Depths of Aquatic Biodiversity Cobija, Bolivia: Our current understanding of aquatic life barely skims the surface of the vast biodiversity believed to exist underwater. While many terrestrial ecosystems have been studied extensively by biologists, most tropical aquatic ecosystems are still essentially unknown to science. Despite this lack of information, major decisions threatening rivers and watersheds�such as the construction of hydroelectric dams�are being made throughout the tropics. To address the critical gap in tropical freshwater biology, CI and Chicago�s Field Museum of Natural History, with support from W. Alton Jones Foundation, have launched the Aquatic Rapid Assessment Program (AquaRAP). Like the legendary terrestrial RAP team, the AquaRAP team was set up to conduct fast, but thorough, surveys of freshwater ecosystems throughout the tropics and to recommend to policymakers key areas for protection and management alternatives. �Rivers depend on one another as well as on the surrounding forest for ecological health,� said Barry Chernoff, a world-renowned ichthyologist with the Field Museum and AquaRAP team leader. �If one river crashes, or if we cut down the forest, many other rivers can die, too. The loss of a river will also hurt the forest because many species of plants depend on fishes for seed dispersal and germination.� In September, the AquaRAP team made its pilot expedition to Bolivia to look at the basins of the Tahuamanu and Manuripi Rivers. For four weeks, the team�s 22 scientists from Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Paraguay, and the United States worked in the rivers and nearby stream, marsh, and swamp habitats with nets and other collection tools to document the area�s fish, aquatic invertebrates, and vegetation and to assess its conservation value. �In just four weeks, our team found approximately 250 fish species, which is incredible when we realize that only 400 species have been documented from the entire country,� said Chernoff. �Clearly, there is wealth of diversity underneath the water surface that we know very little about.� The scientists also found at least three species never documented before in Bolivia and five species new to science, including a dinosaur-like armored catfish covered in bony plates. �These findings confirm that the Tahuamanu and Manuripi Rivers are a significant priority for biodiversity conservation,� said Chernoff. �We will provide policymakers with information on these discoveries, and suggestions for how to protect and manage the river basins. We hope they will take our advice into consideration as they evaluate potentially damaging road-building plans for this area.� �Recommendations from this and future AquaRAP surveys will impact rural communities and indigenous groups across the tropics who depend on fish as their sole source of protein,� said Jorgen Thomsen, CI�s Senior Director for Conservation Biology. �Right now, fish populations in many areas are falling rapidly because of pollution and overfishing, and local people are without food.� As part of the pilot mission to Bolivia, AquaRAP scientists developed a standard methodology to assess the biological and conservation value of complex river systems on a continental scale. Because important watersheds often span more than one country, conservation recommendations from AquaRAP expeditions could help catalyze international cooperation on conservation issues. CI and NASA Scientists Stumble on Ancient Mayan City The recent discovery of the ruins of �Lo Veremos� in Guatemala�s Laguna del Tigre National Park underscores how unexplored the depths of the rain forest remain. Jim Nations, CI�s Vice President of MesoAmerican Programs, and his colleague Tom Sever from NASA, were analyzing data from satellite images of northern Guatemala. Their goal was to measure the impact of human activities on the region�s habitat over the past ten years. Instead, they were struck by changes that had occurred at least 1,200 years earlier. �Down in the forest, you can�t see the road for the trees,� said Nations. �But if you�re looking at satellite photos � the ruins of ancient Maya cities and the roads that connected them can be traced like a secret code under the forest cover.� That�s why Nations and Sever are calling this major archaeological site, �Lo Veremos,� (�we will see it�). Mayan burial mounds and small ruins are sprinkled through the lowland tropical forests of northern Guatemala and southern Mexico. �The legacy of Maya culture is evident throughout the region,� Nations said. �But Lo Veremos could be an especially significant link in Maya archaeological studies. Intriguing findings here of ancient Maya glyphs, the remains of walls and water reservoirs�even boat docks�all could shed light on some of the mysteries of Maya culture.� CI staff have registered the site with Guatemala�s Ministry of Archeology, although it may be years before archaeologists excavate the ruins. For the people of nearby Carmelita, Lo Veremos is a potential attraction for ecotourists who are drawn to the region to see the world-famous ruins of Tikal and the scenic beauty of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. Communities in and around the reserve are especially eager to develop sites because ecotourism has brought money into their communities. �Through projects like CI�s Scarlet Macaw Trail, people here have seen that preserving their cultural heritage and local habitats can alter the economy without altering the landscape,� said Nations. �We need more incentives like Lo Veremos to encourage local conservation.� World Cheetah Population at All Time Low Washington, DC: The cheetah�the fastest animal on four legs�is also one of Earth�s most endangered mammals. According to Namibia�s Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), Africa�s cheetah population is currently less than 15,000, down from about 100,000 in 1900. Less than 200 cheetahs remain in Iran, representing the last of the Asian cheetahs. About 10,000 years ago, the species went through a population �bottleneck��an extreme population reduction and subsequent rebound through inbreeding. This event dramatically reduced the amount of genetic variation in the species, making the cheetah highly susceptible to ecological and environmental changes today. Recent actions of humans have worsened the cheetah�s vulnerable condition. The most significant human threat to the cheetah�s survival is habitat destruction, which has reduced the amount of available prey and caused fatal conflicts with domestic livestock and livestock farmers. In Namibia alone, humans have killed or removed nearly 7,000 cheetahs between 1980 and 1991 because of perceived attacks on livestock. Research to better understand ecological threats is integral to maintaining endangered species like the cheetah. As part of our research efforts, CI has supported studies by the CCF to determine the distribution of and risks to cheetahs in Botswana. Guatemalan Community Reaches Milestone with EcoEscuela San Andres, Guatemala: More than 50 teachers and house mothers working with the EcoEscuela stood proudly in front of hundreds of community members and invited guests for a press event this fall to mark a major milestone in the social and economic development of the town�independence of the EcoEscuela. The EcoEscuela is a school in San Andres offering Spanish language and environmental education to foreigners. In 1993 CI and the community launched this school as an economic alternative to destructive land uses in the neighboring Maya Biosphere Reserve. Since then, EcoEscuela has boosted commitment to conservation in San Andres by providing the project�s anfitriones�house mothers that host students�and teachers with reliable family income dependent on standing forest. Now the staff�following three years of hard work�have formed a corporation to take over EcoEscuela as an independent, locally managed organization. �We are proud of EcoEscuela and what it has done for our community,� said one house mother. �It is helping us preserve a healthy environment and economy for our children. This is why we have taken EcoEscuela into our own hands.� The house mothers and teachers, while not legal owners of EcoEscuela until now, have demonstrated a strong spirit of ownership in the school since its inception. Meanwhile CI provided training in a range of skills from language instruction to business management to writing marketing plans. The local environmental commitment fostered by EcoEscuela has had a critical ripple effect on regional political attitudes. For example, when cattle owned by a local rancher encroached upon the school�s ecological preserve, house mothers�concerned about potential impacts on the community and the environment�organized a group to alert the municipal government of the situation. The result was an official order to the rancher to remove his cattle from the area. The work ethic of the community members was instrumental in the school�s transformation into an economically viable, self-sufficient institution. Between 1993 and 1996 annual student attendance grew from about 100 to over 500, and the staff launched several community conservation programs�including a reforestation project and an interpretive nature trail. By providing employment for 60 families and stimulating business for local restaurants, stores, and ecotourism, the school�s success has helped convince the municipal government of San Andres that conservation makes economic sense. .

The school offers students a unique educational experience through its combination of intensive language instruction and hands-on environmental education. The mission of the school is to immerse students in the language, culture, and ecology of the Petén region of Guatemala, an area renowned for its tropical forest and ancient Maya ruins. Spanish Instruction One-on-one Spanish classes are tailored to meet the needs of every student - beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Highly qualified local teachers work with each student at her or his own pace to develop and strengthen both conversational and written skills. Ecological issues are integrated into daily class discussions and activities. Homestays Living with a local family is an essential part of the Eco-Escuela experience. In addition to daily language interaction outside the classroom, homestays also provide a unique opportunity to participate in the lives and customs of the people of San Andrés. Accommodations are simple but comfortable. San Andrés, Guatemala The school is situated in the community of San Andrés, on beautiful Lake Petén Itzá. Just adjacent is the Maya Biosphere Reserve, a four million acre protected area spanning northern Guatemala's Petén region - the largest protected tropical forest reserve in Central America. This lowland tropical forest is home to a wealth of plant and animal diversity including species such as jaguars, tapirs, monkeys and hundreds of exotic birds. Ecological Activities Students who participate in the Eco-Escuela's ecological activities - in and outside of the classroom - learn firsthand about tropical forest ecology, conservation practices, community development activities, and sustainable development of forest products. Activities include interpretive walks through the forest, volunteer work, fieldtrips, and weekend excursions. Weekly lectures are given by scientists, field researchers, community foresters, and ProPet&eactue;n-Conservation International Staff working in Petén. Volunteer Opportunities Interested students can participate in conservation and community development projects during their stay in San Andrés. These include developing an interpretive trail, environmental education, and reforestation efforts. Excursions Weekend trips to the field complement the ecological component of the program.

The landscape here is utterly different from that of Guatemala's cool mountainous highlands or its steamy Pacific Slope. The monumental Mayan ceremonial centre at Tikal is a major stop on La Ruta Maya. The ruins of Uaxact&uacuten and Ceibal, though not so easily accessible, are perhaps more exciting to visit for that reason. Several dozen other great cities lie hidden in El Pet&eacuten's jungles, accessible only to archaeologists with aircraft or to artifact poachers with stonecutting tools. The battle for El Pet&eacuten is raging even as you read this. Will it be left alone and preserved as one vast natural and archaeological zone? Will its forests be cut and cut by farmers and cattle ranchers until the lush green carpet of trees and vines all but disappears, as has happened just across the border in Mexico? Or will the idea of La Ruta Maya--careful environmental and archaeological preservation through managed development with economic benefits for all--triumph. . . In 1990 the Guatemalan government established the one million-hectare Maya Biosphere Reserve, including most of northern El Pet&eacuten. The Guatemalan reserve adjoins vast Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and the Rio Bravo Conservation Area in Belize, forming a huge multinational reserve of over two million hectares. There are three reasons to penetrate the forests of El Pet&eacuten: firstly to visit Tikal, the greatest Mayan religious center yet discovered; secondly to enjoy the great variety of birdlife, including the rare, shy quetzal; and thirdly, to see a different Guatemala, one of small farming villages and jungle hamlets, without paved roads or colonial architecture.

At the end of my trip to Guatemala my plan was to study Spanish fortwo weeks at the Eco-Escuela de Espa�ol, which someone told me about whenI was in Belize. I had finished a week of language school in Antigua, wheremy Spanish practice ended after the four hours of instruction; thus, Iwas eager for an experience less riddled with foreigners. I found it inthe tranquil, lakeside town of San Andr�s, and I ended up studying forthree weeks, and extending my stay in San Andr�s for a total of two anda half months. This was a common trend among students. Although I could barely communicate in Spanish when I arrived, I couldfeel that this was a special place where people treated me as a guest ratherthan as a walking dollar sign. By the time I left, I owed thanks to manynew friends for both the improvement in my Spanish and in my understandingof an amazing culture. Even after four hours of intensive one-on-one classes,I was motivated to study and practice so that I could communicate withthe people who were eager to share their legends, customs, and knowledgeof the forest. When the secretary of the school walked me to the house of my family,I opened the window to be greeted with a spectacular view of Lake Pet�nItz�, a feature in which most houses in San Andr�s share. Shortly after,several pairs of curious eyes peered in, and minutes later I had four additionalSpanish teachers all under the age of twelve. I felt more a part of thiscommunity than anywhere else I have ever lived. People often feel overwhelmed by the problems of the world. As a result,they are led to inaction by their feelings of inadequacy to make a significantimprovement. However, during my stay in San Andr�s, I could see the directimpact of my presence and the presence of other students. Financially,many people benefited including the teachers, the tienda (store)owners, the host families, and the tour guides for the excursions. Every day held unlimited opportunities to learn something new whetherit was a new Spanish word, a new medicinal use of a plant, or a culturaldifference. You can read about different cultures, but only by total immersioncan you really understand. As much as I was learning about their culture, San Andrese�os were learningabout mine, which is important especially since their perception of theStates is often based on Baywatch reruns. The exchange and sharingof experiences is invaluable. The mother of my family always asked me aboutmy house, my hometown, and how they compare to hers in San Andr�s. Sheremembered the names of the parents and siblings of every student she hadhosted. That many people of all ages from all over the world fall in lovewith San Andr�s relays an important message to the local people. It strengthensthe pride in their town. I also learned about the interrelationship of cultural and environmentalissues. Many families are dependent on the livelihood of the surroundingforest, and the livelihood of the forest depends on its conservation andmanagement. They say that if you drink the water of Lake Pet�n Itz&a, you willreturn someday. I can attest to its truth. Even before I left, I was alreadymaking plans for my return. It is nice to know thaacute;t whenever I returnI will always have a place to stay and many friends to visit in San Andr�s. -written by Jennifer Ito Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

The Eco-Escuela was officially opened in March of 1993 and has receivedover 500 students. Who typically attends the Eco-Escuela program? There is no "typical" Eco-Escuela student. The school hasreceived students ranging in age from 18-73, the majority of whom fallbetween the ages of 22 and 35. Individuals come from many different backgroundsand parts of the world. Does the program focus more on language instruction or environmentalissues? The Eco-Escuela is first and foremost a Spanish language school. Educationabout the environmental issues and ecology of the Pet�n is integrated intothe structure of the daily classes (i.e. interpretive forest walks, classfield trips, teacher-student conversation), and activities outside of class(such as evening lectures, volunteering, and weekend excursions). Studentsare invited, but not required, to become involved in the ecological aspectsof the program. How long should I stay? Because classes are held in weekly increments, the program is flexibleaccording to each student's needs and travel schedule. Your length of staywill depend on: the amount of time you have available, your learning capacity(whether you are a quick learner or need that extra time), and what youwant to get out of the program. In the past, students have stayed fromone week to four months. Can I stay in the same house with my spouse or travel companion? There are several homestay families that can provide housing for couplesand/or friends. Although these accommodations cannot be guaranteed at thetime of making reservations, the Eco-Escuela will make every effort toaccommodate such requests. Please keep in mind that students tend to learnSpanish faster when they are not in constant contact with friends theymay be tempted to speak to in their native language. It may be to youradvantage to avoid these situations by living in separate households, (keepingin mind that all homestays are within walking distance). Is it safe in San Andr�s, Guatemala? The Eco-Escuela is unaware of any occurances of threats to the personalsafety of past students while living in San Andr�s. Tourism is a foundationof the Petenero economy, and the local people recognize the importanceof accepting foreigners. However, individuals should always take necessarysafety precautions when travelling in a foreign country. For recorded travelinformation about the country of Guatemala call the U.S. Department ofState at (202)647-5225. What options do I have if I choose not to stay with a host family? The Eco-Escuela strongly recommends that students take advantage ofthe opportunity to share in the lives, customs, and language of a San Andr�sfamily. Most students identify their homestay as the most rewarding partof their Eco-Escuela experience. Also, by staying with a family, you aresupporting the school's mission of creating alternative forms of incomefor local people. It is rare that a student opts not to stay with a family,but if you should, there is one small inn in San Andr�s and many othersin nearby Flores and Santa Elena. We advise that students stay in San Andr�sin order to avoid inconvenient differences in transportation and classschedules. Can I receive college credit? Although the Eco-Escuela does not offer college credit, many studentsare able to make special arrangements through their schools to receivecredit for their studies and experience at the Eco-Escuela. How far in advance do I need to register? The Eco-Escuela prefers students to register at least 3 weeks in advance,although we do accept last minute reservations according to space availability.The school has a limit of 24 students at one time. To guarantee your space,early registration is recommended. What qualifications do Eco-Escuela teachers hold? Eco-Escuela teachers have been certified under the Guatemala educationsystem as teachers and have been specially trained in teaching Spanishto non-native speakers. What books are used at the school? Should I bring my own? The Eco-Escuela has no specific book that it uses in class. Differentmaterials are used for different students. If you have a certain book orworkbook that you use or would like to use in class, please feel free tobring it. What is acceptable dress in San Andr�s? Classes are casual. Most clothes are acceptable in San Andr�s, althoughwe would recommend that students avoid wearing short shorts or skirts,or halter tops. Use your own discretion while maintaining cultural sensitivity. How much money should I bring? If you choose to live with a host family, all of your lodging and foodare paid for while you are enrolled in the Eco-Escuela. These expenseswould normally be the majority of your spending while traveling. Addedexpenses may include: optional weekend excursions (ranging from $10-30),personal travel to sights such as Tikal, soda/beer/bottled water and snacks,souvenirs and crafts. In general, travel, food, and lodging are very cheapin Guatemala. Travelers cheques are accepted in most banks and hotels.Access/Mastercard, American Express, Visa/Barclycard are accepted in somehotels and few restaurants. Cash advances are available from a limitednumber of banks. If you will be staying for several months, you may wishto consider opening a bank account. Should I bring my homestay family a gift? It is always nice to give your family a little something as a sign ofyour appreciation, but by no means are you obligated to do so. Gifts inthe past have included children's toys, frisbees, crayons, markers, flashlights,picture books of your home state/country, something native of your state/country,t-shirts, and mugs. Be creative, yet conservative. Bring pictures of yourfamily to share with your host family. What kind of volunteer opportunities can students become involvedin? Interested students are encouraged to participate in volunteer activitiestwice a week in the afternoons. Activities change according to what projectsin the area are looking for assistance and what projects the school itselfis working on. In the past students have worked to: create a garbage pick-up within the community that has markedly decreasedthe level of litter and increased community awareness about pollution; create an "Interpretive Trail" used by students of the Eco-Escuelaand all San Andr�s public schools as an educational tool where studentscan learn about the forest's plants and their traditional uses; build bungalows at the public beach where students and community memberscan relax or study in the shade after taking a dip in Lake Pet�n Itz�; ensure the growth of saplings in a reforestation project by clearingareas of menacing overgrowth; and create a better learning environment for the children of San Andr�sby helping to build, repair, and clean classrooms, chairs, desks, etc.in local schools. Do I need a visa to enter Guatemala? To travel to Guatemala U.S. citizens must have a passport and eithera tourist card or a visa. Tourist cards or visas are valid for at leastthirty days and can allow you to stay in the country for up to ninety days.Both can be extended at the immigration department in Guatemala City orrenewed by leaving and reentering the country. U.S. citizens must carryidentification with them at all times. Tourist cards cost US$5.00 and canbe purchased upon arrival at the airport in Guatemala, at the Guatemalanborder, or at the airport departure gate for flights from the U.S. to Guatemala.If you are a British, US, or Canadian citizen, you need only a touristcard and passport to enter the country if entering by air. Visas are available from the Embassy of Guatemala at 2220 R Street,N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, tel: (202) 745-4952, or Guatemalan Consulatesin Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Houston orChicago. Non-U.S. citizens should contact a Guatemalan Consulate in theircountry for information on entry requirements. Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

CI crosses finish line on Ford-Moore challenge grant. New Primate Species Discovered in Brazil Washington, D.C.: The Amazonian rain forest has revealed a new biological treasure: The newest marmoset species, Callithrix saterei, a squirrel-sized primate, was discovered in the Brazilian Amazon in 1993. Named for an indigenous group living near the site of the discovery, the Satere marmoset is distinguished from its close relatives by such features as unpigmented skin on its face and ears, and burnt-orange color fur on its body. "Finding a new beetle in the rain forest may not be surprising, but a new primate species is extraordinary," said Russell A. Mittermeier, CI President and Chairman of the Primate Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC). "This discovery attests to the vast diversity of life on earth that remains unknown to us and shows how ignorant we still are of our fellow species -- even a well-studied group such as primates." The Satere marmoset is the sixth new monkey species found in Brazil since 1990, raising the count of Brazil�s primate species to 75 -- more than double the number found in Indonesia, Madagascar, or Zaire. These four nations account for 66 percent of the 275 nonhuman primate species found in 92 countries worldwide. Brazil alone accounts for 27 percent of the total. "As scientists continue to explore undisturbed tracts of Amazonian forest, I wouldn�t be surprised if we found another five monkeys by the year 2000," said Dr. Mittermeier. The scientifc description of the marmoset, supported by CI, appeared in the Brazilian journal Goeldiana. CD Players in the Rain Forest Washington, DC: The late Ted Parker attained legendary stature among birders for his ability to identify the calls of more than 4,000 species of birds. As part of the ornithological surveys he conducted in his years of Neotropical research, Parker would pre-record tapes -- and then play back the calls to attract individual birds in his vicinity. Using this technique, he was able to census the majority of bird species inhabiting a targeted geographic range. To make these resources available to field biologists, CI and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology�s Library of Natural Sounds are collaborating on a compact-disc set of 300 recorded bird calls from the lowland region of southeastern Peru. Over half the recordings were made by Parker, whose collection of nearly 10,000 bird calls is housed at Cornell. "This tool is still in the testing stage, but we hope it will dramatically speed up the process of cataloging the world�s uncharted bird diversity," said Tom Schulenberg, leader of CI�s Rapid Assessment Program and ornithologist with the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. "The CD will place the hard-won knowledge of brilliant ornithologists like Parker at the fingertips of the new generation of field scientists." Water Pipeline Poses New Threat to Okavango Delta Maun, Botswana: Namibia is in the grip of a severe drought, threatening the country�s water supply. To avert a water crisis in the capital city of Windhoek, the Namibian govern-ment is proposing to run a pipeline from the Okavango River, as soon as funding can be secured from international donors. Conservationists say that large-scale extractions via this pipeline will upset the delicate water cycle of Botswana�s Okavango Delta, which is already at its lowest level in decades. "Water development schemes -- in Namibia, Angola, and Botswana -- pose one of the greatest threats to the future of the Okavango Delta," said Lee Hannah, CI�s Director for Africa. Over the past ten months, conservationists have confronted several new threats to the delta, including a series of veterinary fences erected to prevent the spread of a contagious disease among cattle, and Namibia�s proposal for water withdrawal, which is being planned at a greatly accelerated rate. "Any shift in the region�s water-use patterns will have an impact on the delta�s fragile ecology," said Karen Ross, Director of CI�s Okavango Delta Program. "It�s critical for the nations of the region to agree to significant limits on water withdrawal from the Okavango River to ensure the natural functioning of the delta ecosystem." The Okavango Delta, one of Africa�s greatest wetlands regions, is replenished each year by the food tide of the Okavango River. This food peak sustains the flora and fauna of the Okavango wetlands, and ultimately provides a livelihood to indigenous peoples. But the foods have been small for the past five years. This year, they have yet to reach the town of Maun, whose river has been dry for ten months. "CI�s chief concern is to ensure the integrity of the Okavango Delta at the same time that its benefts are equitably shared," said Hannah. Hannah suggested that Namibia could explore options such as intensifed water recycling, water desalinization, and use of underground water. Botswana, Namibia, and Angola took a major step toward coordinated planning of the Okavango with the signing of the Okavango River Basin Water Commission Agreement in September 1994. The trinational commission (OKACOM) created by this agreement will recommend developments and investigate the impacts of surface and subsurface water development of the greater Okavango watershed. "The problem with Namibia�s new proposal is that it preempts the work of OKACOM," said Ross. "Not until OKACOM conducts a thorough river basin management study can the three countries agree on how to regulate water use." Pulsar Pledges $10 Million To Selva Lacandona Conservation Monterrey, Mexico: Pulsar Internacional, S.A. de C.V., one of Mexico�s largest companies, has committed $10 million to CI for conservation activities in the Selva Lacandona region over the next five years. The pledge made by Alfonso Romo, Pulsar�s chairman and CI board member, is the largest private gift ever for conservation efforts in Latin America. The Selva Lacandona --one of the last remaining North American rain forests and Mexico�s highest conservation priority -- is under siege. The region has become the scene of intense disputes over access to land, where vying indigenous communities have already come to blows over dwindling resources. With increased competition for land, farmers are rapidly clear-cutting forests for crops and cattle-ranching. According to a study by the Mexican university ECOSUR, there will be no forest left in the state of Chiapas in 48 years if deforestation continues at its current rate. The combined effects of economic pressures, ecological destruction, and population growth could threaten the stability of the entire region. Through Romo�s grant, CI, Pulsar, and local communities have formed a partnership to defuse the situation. A team of Pulsar engineers and scientists and CI staff will spear-head a new initiative to address the ecological and economic problems confronting the region and develop forest-friendly alternative activities in the Selva Lacandona. Pulsar�s research and development institution, the Center for Agricultural Studies, will establish experimental stations to identify improved agricultural techniques for local farmers. In the buffer zone surrounding the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, farmers will learn to cultivate new, marketable crops. And the grant will reinforce CI�s current projects through environmental education, construction of biological stations, policy initiatives, and microenterprise development. "At Pulsar, we feel that the conservation of Mexico�s natural resources is of the utmost importance, and we continually seek opportunities to improve our environment as well as our country�s prosperity," said Romo. Pulsar provides literacy and training programs for workers at its Chiapas operations, reflecting the company�s commitment to cultivating the region�s social, economic, and environmental resources. Pulsar�s program will help to stabilize the region and relieve the pressures on the already strained ecosystems of the Selva Lacandona. Biosphere Reserves Forge Links Through Internet and Powerful New Technologies Chiapas, Mexico: The first Biosphere Reserve Training Workshop in Central America was sponsored by CI, Intel Corporation and the United Nations Educational, Scientifc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in July 1996. The three-week workshop equipped institutions in six biosphere reserves with Internet access, computers, and CI�s conser-vation planning software, and provided intensive training to 13 experts in the use of these systems. The participating reserves included La Amistad in Panama, La Amistad in Costa Rica, Maya in Guatemala, Sierra del Rosario in Cuba, and Alto Golfo and Montes Azules in Mexico. The program will allow park managers and researchers to exchange information on the Internet and integrate conservation activities with partners on the local, regional, and global levels. "With these technologies, researchers can collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world," said Intel Chairman Gordon Moore. CI will also continue to provide technical support to the biosphere reserve network. The CI-Intel-UNESCO partnership will sponsor a series of biosphere reserve work-shops in Latin America, Asia, and Africa over the next year, including one in South America in September. The world�s 334 biosphere reserves, coordinated by UNESCO since 1976, are protected areas surrounded by buffer zones where scientific research and sustainable development activities are promoted. Peru Declares National Park in Tambopata Heath Region Lima, Peru: The government of Peru established the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes in July 1996, granting permanent protection to some of the most biologically important territory on the planet. The 802,750 acre park includes the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary and a part of Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a tract of Amazonian rain forest harboring extremely high species diversity. The declaration follows over a half-decade of intense work in the region. In 1990, CI�s Rapid Assessment Program documented the rich habitats of Tambopata and identified the area as a top global conservation priority. Since then, CI-Peru has helped bring together local communities, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations on an array of socioeconomic studies and sustainable enterprise projects -- including a successful Brazil nut industry -- to gain their commitment to a protected area. "We see the park as the focus for a social contract between the local people who support this park, conservationists, and the government," said Avecita Chicch�n, director of CI�s Peru Program. When CI first began work-ing in this region, local conservationists gained community support for the park proposal in exchange for economic alternatives to destructive land-use practices. There is still much work to be done. "Creating Bahuaja-Sonene National Park is an important first step in setting aside the entire Tambopata Candamo area," said Rod Mast, CI Vice President for the Andes Region. "We are committed to continuing efforts to ensure that the entire 5,600 square-mile area eventually achieves national park status." CI Meets Challenge Grant Goal Washington, DC: CI raised $1 million in just three months to complete a challenge grant launched by actor Harrison Ford and Intel Chairman Gordon Moore, both CI board members. In March, Ford and Moore pledged to match dollar-for-dollar all unrestricted contributions made to CI by June 30. A total of 1,767 individuals and 30 organizations contributed $1,085,000. "This exceptional display of commitment to the CI family will be instrumental in forging conservation partnerships across the globe," said CI Vice President of Development and Communications Karen Ziffer. "We would like to offer our sincerest thanks to Harrison, Gordon, and everyone who joined in this challenge." Conservation Leader Joins CI Papua New Guinea Staff Port Moresby, PNG: Gai Kula, one of the foremost conservationists in Papua New Guinea, has become CI�s new program director based in that country. Since 1992, Kula has been First Assistant Secretary for Nature Conservation in PNG�s Department of Environment and Conservation, where he was responsible for all govern-ment biodiversity programs. "Gai is a visionary," said CI President Russell A. Mittermeier. "He was one of the first officials in PNG to recognize biodiversity conservation as an essential ingredient in his country�s overall development strategy." With more than 21 years in PNG�s wildlife management program, Kula has become one of the chief architects of the region�s biodiversity policy. In the last few years, he has led IUCN�s Regional Council for the Pacific and chaired the Global Environment Facility Consultative Working Group. PNG is the most biologically diverse country in the Pacific region and one of the world�s top 15 megadiversity countries, housing some of the world�s greatest expanses of tropical rain forest and coral reefs. These riches are being squandered as logging activ-ities spread: Between 1980 and 1993 annual wood exports from PNG quadrupled from 642,000 cubic meters of logs to 2.7 million cubic meters -- equal to about three million trees.

Biosphere Reserves Forge Links Through Internet and Powerful New Technologies Chiapas, Mexico: The first Biosphere Reserve Training Workshop in Central America was sponsored by CI, Intel Corporation and the United Nations Educational, Scientifc and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in July 1996. The three-week workshop equipped institutions in six biosphere reserves with Internet access, computers, and CI�s conser-vation planning software, and provided intensive training to 13 experts in the use of these systems. The participating reserves included La Amistad in Panama, La Amistad in Costa Rica, Maya in Guatemala, Sierra del Rosario in Cuba, and Alto Golfo and Montes Azules in Mexico. The program will allow park managers and researchers to exchange information on the Internet and integrate conservation activities with partners on the local, regional, and global levels. "With these technologies, researchers can collect and process vast amounts of data and quickly share crucial information with colleagues around the world," said Intel Chairman Gordon Moore. CI will also continue to provide technical support to the biosphere reserve network. The CI-Intel-UNESCO partnership will sponsor a series of biosphere reserve work-shops in Latin America, Asia, and Africa over the next year, including one in South America in September. The world�s 334 biosphere reserves, coordinated by UNESCO since 1976, are protected areas surrounded by buffer zones where scientific research and sustainable development activities are promoted. Peru Declares National Park in Tambopata Heath Region Lima, Peru: The government of Peru established the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes in July 1996, granting permanent protection to some of the most biologically important territory on the planet. The 802,750 acre park includes the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary and a part of Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a tract of Amazonian rain forest harboring extremely high species diversity. The declaration follows over a half-decade of intense work in the region. In 1990, CI�s Rapid Assessment Program documented the rich habitats of Tambopata and identified the area as a top global conservation priority. Since then, CI-Peru has helped bring together local communities, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations on an array of socioeconomic studies and sustainable enterprise projects -- including a successful Brazil nut industry -- to gain their commitment to a protected area. "We see the park as the focus for a social contract between the local people who support this park, conservationists, and the government," said Avecita Chicch�n, director of CI�s Peru Program. When CI first began work-ing in this region, local conservationists gained community support for the park proposal in exchange for economic alternatives to destructive land-use practices. There is still much work to be done. "Creating Bahuaja-Sonene National Park is an important first step in setting aside the entire Tambopata Candamo area," said Rod Mast, CI Vice President for the Andes Region. "We are committed to continuing efforts to ensure that the entire 5,600 square-mile area eventually achieves national park status." CI Meets Challenge Grant Goal Washington, DC: CI raised $1 million in just three months to complete a challenge grant launched by actor Harrison Ford and Intel Chairman Gordon Moore, both CI board members. In March, Ford and Moore pledged to match dollar-for-dollar all unrestricted contributions made to CI by June 30. A total of 1,767 individuals and 30 organizations contributed $1,085,000. "This exceptional display of commitment to the CI family will be instrumental in forging conservation partnerships across the globe," said CI Vice President of Development and Communications Karen Ziffer. "We would like to offer our sincerest thanks to Harrison, Gordon, and everyone who joined in this challenge." Conservation Leader Joins CI Papua New Guinea Staff Port Moresby, PNG: Gai Kula, one of the foremost conservationists in Papua New Guinea, has become CI�s new program director based in that country. Since 1992, Kula has been First Assistant Secretary for Nature Conservation in PNG�s Department of Environment and Conservation, where he was responsible for all govern-ment biodiversity programs. "Gai is a visionary," said CI President Russell A. Mittermeier. "He was one of the first officials in PNG to recognize biodiversity conservation as an essential ingredient in his country�s overall development strategy." With more than 21 years in PNG�s wildlife management program, Kula has become one of the chief architects of the region�s biodiversity policy. In the last few years, he has led IUCN�s Regional Council for the Pacific and chaired the Global Environment Facility Consultative Working Group. PNG is the most biologically diverse country in the Pacific region and one of the world�s top 15 megadiversity countries, housing some of the world�s greatest expanses of tropical rain forest and coral reefs. These riches are being squandered as logging activ-ities spread: Between 1980 and 1993 annual wood exports from PNG quadrupled from 642,000 cubic meters of logs to 2.7 million cubic meters -- equal to about three million trees.

Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 NEW PRIMATE SPECIES DISCOVERED IN BRAZIL Marmoset More Proof Of Tropics' Biological Riches Washington, D.C. -- The discovery of a new species of marmoset in South America's tropical rain forest was announced recently by the scientific community in Brazil. "Finding a new beetle in the rain forest may not be surprising, but a new primate species is extraordinary," said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International and chairman of the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission, Primate Specialist Group. "This discovery attests to the vast diversity of life on earth that remains unknown to us and shows how ignorant we still are of our fellow species -- even a well-studied group such as our closest relatives, the primates." The new species is named Callithrix saterei, for a group of Indians indigenous to the central Brazilian Amazon area where the marmoset was discovered. The small, squirrel-sized primate is distinct from its closest relatives, with physical traits such as unpigmented skin on the face and ears, and golden orange color. Its description, written by Jos� de Sousa Silva J�nior and Maur�cio de Almeida Noronha, will soon be published in the Brazilian scientific journal Goeldiana. Six new species of primates have been discovered in Brazil since 1990, bringing the total number of primate species in Brazil to 75, the highest in the world, more than double Indonesia, Madagascar or Zaire. Although wild primates occur in 92 countries, these four countries account for nearly 70 percent of all 250 primates species worldwide, with Brazil alone accounting for almost 30 percent. Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to protect global biodiversity, focusing on ecological hotspots in more than 21 countries on four continents. ### (Photos/slides available upon request.)

Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 Using Economics to SaveEndangered Ecosystems Conservation International Presentation Highlights Frederik Meijer Gardens Event GRANDRAPIDS, MI -- How can butterflies help save endangered rain forests? Conservationist and scientist Roderic B. Mast, a nativeof South Haven, Mich., will share experiences of a leading internationalenvironmental group to answer that question in a talk at FrederikMeijer Gardens March 15. Mast is vice president of theAndes Regional Program with Conservation International (CI), aWashington, D.C.-based environmental group that works to protectglobal biological diversity. Mast's remarks will be part of aspecial event marking the opening of the botanic gardens' "Butterfliesare Free" exhibit, which will run March 16 through March31. Just as economics drive much of the environmentaldestruction the world faces today, economics must play a key rolein turning the tide," Mast says. "Butterflies happento offer one example of how this approach can work." Byfocusing on the world's biological diversity "hotspots,"CI targets regions with the highest numbers of animals and plantsspecies that also face the greatest risk of habitat destruction. A field based group, CI has projects in more than 20 countrieson four continents. Conservation Internationalintegrates economics, science, policy work and community developmentto build lasting solutions to the global ecological devastationtaking place today," says Peter Seligmann, CI Chairman andChief Executive Officer, who also is attending the event. "Withtropical deforestation taking place at 40 million acres a year,and species extinctions at an estimated rate of 27,000 per year,the challenge is critically urgent. One exampleof creating economic alternatives to rain forest destruction isin Mexico's Chajul region, where CI helped start a 120 acre butterflyreserve that today is run by the local community and providesemployment to some 35 people. The project includes collection,identification for research and sales to collectors in the UnitedStates and Japan. Artisans in the region also use the butterfliesin mobiles and glass containers for sale as souvenirs. Byhelping develop small enterprises that become self-sustaining,CI gives local communities an incentive to protect the rain forest,which might otherwise be sold off to loggers or cut down for temporaryfarming plots or as fuel wood," Mast explains. CIhas established several conservation enterprises linking rainforest communities to international markets, including a Brazilnut project in Peru, bioprospecting for potential medicinal sourcesin Suriname, and the harvest of personal care product ingredientsfrom the rain forests of Guatemala. CI's Tagua InitiativeÔproject in Ecuador markets buttons and jewelry made from the ivory-liketagua nut in Ecuador's rich rain forests. The project has generated1,800 local jobs, including high-quality artisans who craft hand-carvedbuttons and jewelry for export. The project has provided incomefor local transportation equipment and training for local peoplein accounting and business management. U.S. manufacturers thatpurchase buttons through the initiative include the Gap, Esprit,Timberland, and Smith and Hawken. Grand Rapids attorneyRichard F. Vander Veen, III, of the firm Miller, Johnson, Snelland Cummiskey, underscored the importance for the West Michiganarea to learn more about Conservation International's philosophyand principles. "West Michigan can greatly benefitby embracing this philosophy of integrating science, economics,policy and community development," Vander Veen said. "Theseare essential elements toward achieving sustainable development,and this is just as important to our local and the Great Lakeseconomic growth concerns as it is for the conservation of internationalecological hotspots," Vander Veen said. Mast willspeak at two presentations, one at 7:30 p.m. and the other at8:30 p.m., during an event entitled, "Where Have all theMonarchs Gone," which previews the opening of the TropicalButterfly Release beginning March 16 at the botanic gardens. Other speakers will include Patricia Steijn Hopkinson, Chief OperatingOfficer, Federik Meijer Gardens; Rick Sullivan, Executive Director,Center for Environmental Studies; and Sr. Alvaro Umana, formerSecretary of Agriculture for Costa Rica.

Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 New World Record For Tree Diversity ESPIRITO SANTO, BRAZIL � Brazilian scientists from the state of Espirito Santo announced this week a new world record for tree diversity. Dr. Sergio Lucena Mendes, Director of the Museu de Biologia Professor Mello Leitao in Santa Teresa, Espirito Santo, reported the results of a study by Luciana Dias Thomaz of the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) that found 476 tree species in a one hectare (2.5 acre) plot in Santa Teresa. This astounding discovery breaks the previous records of 458 found in the southern part of the state of Bahia immediately to the north of Espirito Santo along the Brazilian coast in March 1993 and 473 found in Cuyabeno, northeast Amazonian Ecuador in June 1993. Prior to the Bahian study, no one had ever found more than 400 species per hectare. Not only did Ms. Thomaz discover this incredibly high number of species, she also found 104 species that had never before been found in the Atlantic forest region of Brazil, five species entirely new to science and possibly a genus new to science as well. By comparison, the average hectare plot of temperate forest may have between two and 20 tree species. The criteria used in the Espirito Santo study were more rigourous than those used in Bahia and Cuyabeno. In the Bahia and Cuyabeno study, the cutoff criterion for inclusion in the count was 5 centimeters diameter breast height, a standard measure used in botanical studies. In the Espirito Santo study, the criterion was 20 centimeter circumference at breast height, or 6.4 centimeter diameter breast height. The Espirito Santo site is located in the municipality of Santa Teresa at an altitude of 600-800 meters, compared to 100-200 meters at the Bahian site and 260 meters at the Cuyabeno site. The site is within the Atlantic forest region of eastern Brazil, one of the world's top threatened hotspots for terrestrial biodiversity. The Atlantic forest once occupied about 1.2 million square kilometers, or an area about three times the size of the state of California, but is now down to 2-5% of its original extent. Estimates of total plant diversity for the Atlantic forest as a whole run as high as 20,000 species, half of which are endemic to Brazil. The area is also rich in fauna as well, with 261 species of mammals, 620 species of birds, and 260 amphibians, of which 73 mammals, 160 birds and 128 amphibians are endemic. The Espirito Santo findings were announced at a meeting in Porto Seguro, Bahia, where scientists are developing a plan for major corridors between protected areas in the Atlantic forest. This innovative program is funded by the Pilot Program of the G7, currently being designed by scientists from Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Brazilian Institute of the Environment (IBAMA), in collaboration with many local partners. Dr. Russell Mittermeier, President of Conservation International, which has a large program in Brazil, said that this finding once again shows how incredible the biodiversity of a megadiversity country like Brazil actually is, and how little we still know about its diversity. Fortunately, Brazil has become one the world's leaders in biodiversity research and conservation at both the governmental and non-governmental levels. Dr. Sergio Lucena Mendes, who supervised the plant diversity project, said that this discovery stimulated his institution to develop a more detailed action plan for biodiversity inventory of other groups in addition to plants. An excellent example of one of the most active scientifically-based conservation NGO's in Brazil, the Museu de Biologia Professosr Mello Leitao gives much reason for optimism for the future of biodiversity conservation in Brazil. ### WT02-B18-27IA083-000589-B019-77http://www.conservation.org:80/web/news/pressrel/corrid.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216022035 text/html 7071HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:25:31 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 11-Dec-96 18:52:28 GMTContent-length: 6885Content-type: text/html  Press Release December9, 1996 Contact: Lisa S. Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 Corridors For Conservation Brazil Launches New Approach To Protect Rain Forests MANAUS, Brazil � An innovative rain forest conservation approach that focuses on large corridors of forest could ultimately protect more than 75 percent of Brazil's tropical biodiversity in just 20 percent of its land area. In two recent meetings, Brazilian scientists and conservationists, along with a number of international experts and donor agencies, designed two major conservation corridors for the Central Brazilian Amazon and Brazil's central Atlantic forest. "Corridor conservation solves the dilemma of habitat fragmentation, and its critical, adverse impact on evolution and ultimately on species survival," said Dr. Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, who attended the meetings in Brazil. "The reality is that many parks and other protected areas have become isolated islands in an ocean of agricultural land or entirely degraded areas." "This approach targets investments to priority areas, or corridors, instead of spreading relatively small amounts of money in the hundreds of areas decreed as protected areas," noted Dr. Gustavo Fonseca, vice president for Conservation International's Brazil Program. "The continuity aspect of the corridors is extremely important, allowing gene flow between the parks and reserves, increasing the likelihood of survival of the most extinction-prone species." In a preliminary study, seven major corridors were identified, five in the Brazilian Amazon and two in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, totaling 500,000 kilometers, or an area equivalent in size to Spain. Combined, the conservation of these corridors would ensure protection of more than 75 percent of Brazil's tropical forest biodiversity in 20 percent of the country's land area. Some $36 million is designated for the project through a World Bank pilot program, with Germany and the European Union the principle financial supporters. The Atlantic Forest site focuses on that region's highest level of biodiversity in a corridor which covers 64,000 kilometers and includes eight federal Environment Protection Areas, 12 federal parks and reserves, four agricultural field stations, four major forest tracts belonging to cellulose production companies, 11 indigenous reserves and several privately protected areas, known in Brazil as Natural Heritage Private Reserves. The total area occupied by these protected forests totals 4,000 kilometers, or close to 60 percent of the remaining continuous habitat in this highly devastated region of the Atlantic forest. Brazil's Atlantic forest region is generally considered one of the four or five highest priority threatened "hotspots" for terrestrial biodiversity on Earth, along with Madagascar, the Philippines and the Tropical Andes. It once covered about 2 million kilometers, or an area about three times the size of the state of California. However, it was the first region of Brazil to be colonized, and was developed into the agriculture and industrial center of the country. Today it has among the highest human populations in the Western Hemisphere, including both Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the second largest city in the world. Only about 2 to 5 percent of the original habitat remains intact. The Atlantic forest claims 620 species of birds and 20,000 species of plants (half of them endemic) � numbers that rival the total diversity of the United States. The region has a high concentration of endangered species, including the colorful lion tamarins and the largest of the New World primates, the muriqui. Brazil is home to the highest totals of terrestrial and freshwater diversity on Earth as well as more than one third of all tropical rain forests. It holds several biodiversity world records, including 55,000 plant species, 524 mammal species, 76 primate species and 70 parrot and macaw species. Conservation of Brazil's magnificent and globally important biodiversity, particularly in the Amazon rain forest, has been a global concern for decades. Brazil's high profile has catalyzed worldwide concern for tropical forests. Implementation of the corridor concept will involve Brazil's federal and state government, local and international non-governmental groups, indigenous groups and the private sector. A management body currently being discussed to oversee the corridors is a non-governmental foundation that would include stakeholders from all sectors. The role of the private sector will be particularly important, since it holds some of the largest remaining tracts of land in the Atlantic forest corridors. There is an increasing common interest between the conservation community and some of the most important industries in this region of Brazil, in particular the rapidly growing ecotourism industry. "The central corridor of the Atlantic forest combines tropical reef, rain forest and beach in a way that few places in the world can match," noted Mittermeier. "Another example of such reef-rain forest interface and its great appeal is Australia's north Queensland, where the ecotourism industry is well developed." ### WT02-B18-28IA083-000589-B022-163http://www.conservation.org:80/web/news/pressrel/school.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216023144 text/html 6066HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:36:37 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 11-Dec-96 18:54:22 GMTContent-length: 5880Content-type: text/html  Ecoescuela Becomes First Community-owned Enterprise October 25, 1996 Contact: Lisa S. Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 Ecoescuela Becomes First Community-owned Enterprise Teachers and House Mothers Assume Management Role SAN ANDRES, GUATEMALA -- The first community-owned enterprise that promotes conservation in the Maya Biosphere Reserve is now established in Guatemala. The EcoEscuela de Espanol, which offers Spanish language classes and environmental education to foreign students will be turned over to an independent corporation of teachers and house mothers this weekend. In 1993, Conservation International (CI), the U.S. Agency for International Development and the San Andres community opened the EcoEscuela as an environmentally friendly economic alternative for unemployed teachers and householders in town. The school was designed to promote political support for conservation in the municipality of San Andres as it provides a unique opportunity for students to learn the Spanish language and about Mayan culture and history as well as Guatemala's incredible biological diversity. The EcoEscuela is the first enterprise to spin-off from Conservation International. Other enterprises are expected to result from CI's current work in Guatemala , assisting local communities to successfully manage their own small businesses. Located in the San Andres municipality, a gateway community to the Maya Biosphere Reserve and the county seat for the largest municipality in Guatemala, the EcoEscuela offers a high profile for successful integration between community members and local authorities. For example, when cattle owned by a local rancher encroached upon the school's ecological preserve, house mothers organized a group to alert the municipal government. The result was an official order to the rancher to remove his cattle from the area. "The ambitious work of the house mothers reflects a growing conservation awareness in San Andres," said Carlos Soza, CI's Guatemala Director. "The house mothers recognized that EcoEscuela is an economic alternative promoting positive change, and took the steps to transform the school into a permanent institution." The EcoEscuela generates income directly for 60 families and indirectly for dozens more, employing more people than the existing saw mill in San Andres. This income allows families to continue their participation in the EcoEscuela and to ensure its success. Staff members have been taught accounting and business management in order to run the school efficiently. Over the past three years, student enrollment has increased from 100 to more than 600, and the staff have launched several community conservation programs, including a reforestation project and an interpretive nature trail. "The teachers have demonstrated strong ownership to EcoEscuela and through their hard work have successfully helped this school become an independent, well-managed organization," said Alex Cano, Director of EcoEscuela. As a former students, Jennifer Ito states, "Everyday held unlimited opportunities to learn something new; whether it was a new Spanish word, a new medicinal use of a plant, or a cultural difference." "We are proud of the EcoEscuela and what is has done for our community," said Dalia de Puga, one house mother. "It is helping us preserve a healthy environment and economy for our children. This is why we have taken the EcoEscuela into our own hands." Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to conserve global biological diversity in ecological hotspots � those areas of the world with the highest numbers of species at greatest risk. CI has projects in more than 20 countries on four continents. ### WT02-B18-29IA083-000589-B023-42http://www.conservation.org:80/web/news/pressrel/adrian.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216023309 text/html 3526HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:38:06 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 11-Dec-96 18:54:22 GMTContent-length: 3340Content-type: text/html How Monkeys Make Chocolate April 8, 1996 Contact: Lisa S.

"While the world keeps hearing scientific predictions of species extinction crises, we're saying it's time to put aside the gloom and doom and get down to the business at hand. This new map makes the biodiversity crisis much more manageable," said Dr. Russell A. Mittermeier, CI President and an expert on primates and reptiles. Based on an analysis carried out over the past year, CI's Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map lists 17 priority areas, occupying a total of less than 2 percent of the Earth's land surface. Almost 40 percent of all terrestrial plants and 25 percent of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these areas (i.e. found nowhere else). When considering total species diversity in these areas, they claim more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity. British ecologist Norman Myers created the biodiversity hotspots concept in two scientific papers published in 1988 and 1990. Myers recognized that a modest number of hotspot ecosystems covering a small total land area, most often in tropical forest areas, accounted for a high percentage of global biodiversity. CI slightly revised the concept and adopted it as the organization's conservation strategy. The same year, the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation, a major private supporter of conservation initiatives, adopted the hotspots approach as its principal strategy for biodiversity investment. "I wanted to know how we could get ahead of the game and determine which are the real priorities areas in the world," Myers said. "I can think of no other biodiversity initiative that could achieve so much at such comparatively small cost, as the hotspots strategy." Two criteria were used to determine which areas qualify as a global biodiversity hotspot: number of endemic species and degree of threat. Each of the priority hotspots claims at least 1 percent of the total diversity of vascular plants (those with roots and stems) as endemic, that is at least 2,500 species. Degree of threat was determined by the percentage of remaining habitat within a region, with each hotspot retaining less than 25 percent of its original natural habitat. The top priority global biodiversity hotspots are: the Tropical Andes (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) the island of Madagascar Cape and Western Cape floristic region (South Africa) the Antilles Western Sunda region (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei) Eastern Sunda region (Indonesia) the Philippines the Atlantic forest (Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina) Brazil's Cerrado the Darién (Panama), the Chocó (Colombia-Ecuador), and Western Ecuador Meso-American forests Polynesia and Micronesian Island complex, including Hawaii and Fiji Southwestern Australia the Eastern Mediterranean region the Western Ghats (India) and the island of Sri Lanka New Caledonia the Guinean forests of West Africa (under final study) Another list of second-tier biodiversity hotspots is under preparation. This list currently includes, in the United States, the California Floristic Province, which extends from southern Oregon to the Baja Peninsula. "We are not saying focus only on these hotspots and ignore every thing else," said Mittermeier. "Every nation's biodiversity is critically important to its future, and must be the most fundamental component of any national development strategy. However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed on the planet, and some areas, particularly the tropics, harbor far greater concentrations of biodiversity. We recommend that these threatened hotspots receive international attention." As part of its conservation strategy, CI also recognizes the importance of major tropical wilderness areas, such as Amazon. The primary difference between hotspots and wilderness areas is the degree of threat. Whereas less than 25 percent of natural vegetation remains in the hotspots (some have less than 10 percent of their original habitat), wilderness areas claim at least 75 percent undisturbed natural vegetation, with a human population density of no more than five persons per square kilometer. "The Global Biodiversity Hotspots Map is powerful tool to help chart the course for biodiversity conservation, said Peter A. Seligmann, CI Board Chairman. "It can help guide investments through this critical era for life on Earth. By demonstrating that something can actually be accomplished, we should be able to stimulate further investment, and encourage much greater involvement by the private sector, international aid agencies and development banks." ### WT02-B18-31IA083-000589-B023-29http://www.conservation.org:80/web/news/pressrel/pulsar.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216023301 text/html 6174HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:37:57 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 11-Dec-96 18:54:22 GMTContent-length: 5988Content-type: text/html Rain Forest Buttons Get Wider Distribution June 17, 1996 Contact: Lisa S.

The money donated by Pulsar will support the preservation of Mexican forests in the Selva Lacandona region of the Mexican state of Chiapas. This donation represents one of the largest private gifts ever for conservation efforts. Considered by the Mexican government to be the highest conservation priority in the country, the Selva Lacandona has been increasingly threatened by destructive practices such as clear cutting and over-grazing. The region is exceeded only by Brazil, Colombia and Indonesia in its biological richness and represents an important conservation opportunity to preserve Mexico's natural resources. "At Pulsar, we feel that the conservation of Mexico's natural resources is of the utmost importance, and we continually seek opportunities to improve our environment as well as our country's prosperity," said Alfonso Romo, Chairman and CEO of Pulsar Internacional. "As Mexican citizens, it is our responsibility to find solutions to the environmental issues that face the communities in which we operate." A team of engineers and scientists from Pulsar and Conservation International will spearhead the conservation projects focused on the Selva Lacandona region. Pulsar's research and development center, Centro Internacional de Investigaci�n Agropecuaria (CIICA), will establish experimental areas within the Selva Lacandona to identify agricultural techniques that will improve the quality and yields of trees and crops cultivated by the local farmers. Pulsar's contribution will fund CI's programs that teach Selva Lacandona farmers how to support themselves through means that are conservation friendly. Farmers will learn to work the land in a buffer zone surrounding the forest with a particular focus on cultivating bamboo, or "hule," African palms and ornamental plants. "We are delighted that Pulsar recognizes the Selva Lacandona as one of the world's most vital areas in need of natural resource conservation," said Peter Seligmann, Chairman and CEO of Conservation International. "Pulsar's contribution will greatly expand CI's programs that involve local residents with our ongoing efforts to protect the environment." Pulsar's donation extends the company's ongoing commitment to the protection of the world's natural resources and wildlife. Pulsar currently plants Guadua angustifolia trees in Tabasco to protect the endangered Mangle tree. The new trees have a greater yield and are used to supply housing in the region. And Pulsar's organization, Aquilla and Ara, is devoted to the protection of endangered species of birds, including the Mexican eagle, the macaw and the parrot. CI is an international organization dedicated to conserving the world's biological diversity. In more than 20 countries in which it works, CI brings together all stakeholders -- scientists, local and indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations, government officials -- to create realistic conservation strategies, including economic development projects that sustain the local environment. Created by Alfonso Romo in 1981, the Pulsar family of companies thrives on an entrepreneurial spirit that fosters a global strategic vision and commitment to dynamic leadership and growth. With its roots in Monterrey, Mexico, Pulsar's companies generate sales in more than 110 countries around the world, with laboratory and production facilities in over 36 countries. Pulsar employs 25,000 corporate employees and 66,000 workers indirectly through its agricultural business. Its businesses include financial services, agriculture, agrobiotechnology, packaging, consumer goods distribution and new ventures. In 1996, Pulsar's global sales will exceed $2 billion. ### Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 More Animals at Risk of Extinction New Scientific Assessment Reveals Global Biodiversity At Greater Risk Than Previous Data Revealed Washington, D.C. -- Fully a quarter of all known mammal species are at risk of extinction, according to the most comprehensive scientific assessment of threatened species ever produced -- the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. (The Red List is available for $40 from Island Press.) For the first time, all known mammals were assessed for their conservation status, revealing a much greater number threatened with extinction than previously believed. Until this assessment, the status of birds was used to estimate other species' levels of endangerment, because birds were the only species fully assessed. The Red List classifies 11 percent of all known bird species as threatened with extinction. The finding that mammals are even more seriously threatened with extinction increases the urgency of global conservation measures. Of the reptiles, amphibians and fish assessed, estimates of those threatened with extinction are: 20 percent of reptiles, 25 percent of amphibians, and 34 percent of fish, mostly freshwater species. The Species Survival Commission (SSC) and its co-publishing partner Conservation International (CI) announced these findings in Washington, D.C. today. The document will be available on the World Wide Web as of Oct. 7 at http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/index.html. "The Red List is actually a red flag, warning us about the perilous status of animals and drawing attention to threats such as habitat destruction, pollution, over-harvesting and the introduction of non-native species," said George Rabb, chair of the SSC, a volunteer global network of scientists. "This scientific assessment is indisputable proof that warnings about global biological diversity loss haven't been exaggerated -- if anything we've been too optimistic," said Russell A. Mittermeier, Conservation International president and chair of the SSC's Primate Specialist Group. More rigorous criteria were used to assess the conservation status of species for the 1996 List, which includes for the first time information about threats. The new system provides alternative approaches to assessing threat, such as population decline, fragmentation of populations or low population numbers. More than 500 scientists provided data and carried out the List assessments, with SSC partners BirdLife International, The Nature Conservancy and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre being major contributors as well. The List identifies 5,205 species as threatened with extinction. Different objective approaches were used to assess levels of endangerment, including rate of population decline over a ten-year period. Using this criterion, critically endangered species have experienced an 80 percent decline; endangered, 50 percent; and vulnerable, 20 percent decline. Of the 26 orders of mammals, 24 include threatened species, and the six largest orders have more than 50 threatened species each. The highest proportion of threatened species are in the orders that include monkeys and apes, 46 percent; shrews and moles, 36 percent; pigs, antelope and cattle, 33 percent; bats, 26 percent; wild dogs, bears and cats, 26 percent; and rodents, 17 percent. Other, smaller orders are also highly threatened, including the order with horses, tapirs and rhinos, with 22 percent critically endangered. Of the 27 orders of birds, 23 contain threatened species. The five orders with the highest percent of threatened species are those that include rails and cranes, 26 percent; pheasants and partridges, 25 percent; parrots, 25 percent; pigeons and doves, 17 percent; and kingfishers and bee-eaters, 12 percent. Among reptiles, of the 23 species of crocodilians (crocodiles, alligators, caimans), 44 percent are threatened. While this figure is high, crocodilians are one of the few orders that have improved in status due to conservation measures. In 1971, all 23 species of crocodilians were endangered. Today, seven species are abundant enough to allow sustainable use for the skins trade, and five species have stable or increasing populations. More than 100 species of marine fishes were added to the 1996 Red List, including sharks, tuna, coral reef fish and seahorses. While the status of the remaining 14,000 marine species have yet to be assessed, the recent additions indicate that many marine species could be at higher risk than previously thought. All species of sturgeons and paddlefish were found to be threatened or near threatened. Many freshwater species from other groups are also classified as threatened because land use changes have led to the deterioration of freshwater habitats worldwide. While most animal species are invertebrates, the Red List points out that very few have been assessed relative to their total numbers. Those that have received the most attention are crustaceans, insects and molluscs, with more threatened molluscs included in the Red List than any other invertebrate group. Out of 70,000 documented mollusc species, some 2,049 species were assessed, of which 920 were identified as threatened. The United States is among the top 20 countries with the most threatened species of mammals, and among the top 10 with the most threatened species of birds. The top five countries with the most threatened number of mammals include Indonesia, China, India, Brazil and Mexico. The top five with the most threatened species of birds are Indonesia, Brazil, China, the Philippines, and India. The most significant threat to the majority of species at risk of extinction was found to be habitat reduction, fragmentation and degradation, reflecting human population growth combined with economic development. A surprisingly important factor was introduction of non-native species, along with exploitation, pollution and climate change. The Red List originated in 1960 as a set of index cards containing information on 34 mammals on file at the SSC Secretariat in London. The 1996 Red List marks three decades of international efforts for the conservation of the world's biodiversity, and its publication coincides with the World Conservation Congress of IUCN-The World Conservation Union, to be held in Montreal, Canada, October 13-23, 1996. The SSC is one of six commissions within the IUCN (the International Union for the Conservation of Nature). The SSC works to conserve biological diversity with programs to study, save, restore and manage wisely species and their habitats. The SSC volunteer network includes more than 7,000 scientists, field researchers, government officials and conservation leaders from 179 countries. The 1996 Red List was made possible, in part, due to a generous grant from the Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation. ### WT02-B18-33IA083-000589-B022-122http://www.conservation.org:80/web/news/pressrel/holiday.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216023119 text/html 5239HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:36:15 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 11-Dec-96 18:52:28 GMTContent-length: 5053Content-type: text/html  Press Release December 5, 1996 Contact: Lisa S. Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 Holiday Gifts Can Help Save Rain Forests Holiday shoppers can help protect endangered rain forests by purchasing items made available by Conservation International (CI). Ingredients used to create Forest Pure� personal care products and Enchanted Gold� holiday ornaments come from the rain forests of Central and South America and directly benefit the local people of rain forest communities by creating economic alternatives to deforestation. Forest Pure�, a line of personal care products containing ingredients from CI's conservation project sites, is manufactured by Nature's Gate Natural Products. Proceeds from the sales support CI's Renewable Rain Forest Resources program. Nature's Gate has created Forest Pure� hair shampoo, hair conditioner, body lotion, body shampoo, soap and foaming bath products, all containing natural components found in Guatemala and Peru. Forest Pure� hair shampoo, foaming bath, and body shampoo contain jaboncillo, a natural sudsing ingredient used centuries ago by the Maya Indians of the Pet�n region of Guatemala. Today local people still occasionally use the berries to wash their clothes. Allspice extract, Brazil nut and cohune palm oils are used in Forest Pure� hair conditioner, lotions and foaming baths. Allspice extract is derived from the oil found in the leaves and berries of an evergreen species native to Central America. Its softening and conditioning properties make it a good source as an ingredient for conditioners, creams and lip balms. Cohune palm oil, also found in the Pet�n region of Guatemala, is extracted from a nut which grows on the wild and abundant cohune palm throughout the Pet�n. Local people harvest the nuts and remove the woody outer shell that encloses the seed containing the oil. This oil is very emollient and can be used as a replacement for coconut or mineral oil. Brazil nut oil is obtained from the nuts of Brazil nut trees in Peru's Madre de Dios region. The high-quality oil is processed from nuts gathered in the wild by local people. The oil's properties help maintain the protective barrier function of the skin and can improve the aesthetics of creams and lotions. Production of gold-dipped rain forest leaves for holiday ornaments, created by Enchanted Gold�, contributes to the conservation of the Maya Biosphere Reserve, the largest tract of rain forest remaining in Central America. These striking and unusual leaves are hand-picked by rain forest dwellers in Guatemala's Pet�n region. The leaves are strengthened with copper, and beautifully finished in 18 carat recycled gold. A generous contribution is made by Nature's Gate and Enchanted Gold� to Conservation International from sales of any Forest Pure� hair shampoo, hair conditioner, lotion, soap, foaming bath or Enchanted Gold� holiday ornament. The proceeds will in turn be used to support CI's enterprise development programs. Forest Pure� and Enchanted Gold� products can be ordered through The Rain Forest Marketplace, located on CI's web site. Forest Pure� products are also available at Fresh Fields organic supermarkets or in your local natural health food store carrying Nature's Gate personal care products. Enchanted Gold� holiday ornaments are available at Nature Company stores throughout the United States. ### WT02-B18-34IA083-000589-B022-210http://www.conservation.org:80/web/news/pressrel/bahuaja.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216023230 text/html 5272HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:37:24 GMTLast-modified: Wednesday, 11-Dec-96 18:54:22 GMTContent-length: 5086Content-type: text/html Bahuaja-Sonene Par Created in Peru July 25, 1996 Contact: Lisa S. Bowen Email: L.Bowen@conservation.org (202) 973-2204 Biological Hotspot Gains Partial Protection Conservationists Welcome Peru's Creation of Bahuaja -Sonene Park As Important Step in Protecting Outstanding Biological Treasure Washington, D.C. -- Some of the most biologically important territory on the planet gained permanent protection recently when the Peruvian government created the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Conservationists welcomed the park declaration as an important first step in a long-term goal to ensure that a major part of Peru's southeastern tropical forests receive permanent protection status. The 325,000 hectare (approximately 802,750 acre) park is located on the fringe of an area that holds extremely high single-site species diversity for woody plants, birds, mammals, butterflies, and dragonflies. As many as 550 bird species and more than 1,200 butterfly species have been recorded at a single locality within the region, which ranks among the richest in species diversity on Earth. "This is an important step not only for conservation in Peru, but for the entire world because of the uniqueness and biological richness of this area, " said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, a Washington, D.C.-based conservation group with offices in Lima, Peru. "Bahuaja-Sonene is a critical link in the chain of protected areas in this region, and we commend the Peruvian government for its leadership in global conservation by taking this step." Being adjacent to Bolivia's Madidi National Park, the new park declaration means that some 2.25 million hectares of tropical forest in this region are given permanent protection. The new park covers about a third of the original park proposal of 968,587 hectares, as well as an area already protected as part of the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary. "Conservation International considers this park declaration part of a process that will lead to eventual protection of nearly one million acres of tropical forest on the Peruvian side. When this ultimate goal is achieved, the combined area with Madidi will rank this among the top three or four largest tropical forest protected areas in the world," Mittermeier added. Since 1990, CI has worked to protect Peru's southeastern tropical forests, focusing specifically on the Tambopata region where the park is located. Partnering with local conservationists, CI's baseline research contributed ground-breaking evidence of the region's biological importance. CI's Peru Program also helped bring together local community groups, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations to discuss the area's future. The coalition strongly supported creation of the park as part of a sustainable development strategy to include ecologically sound economic activities for the local rural population. "For the past six years Conservation International and its local partners have worked for permanent protection for Tambopata and we are now closer to that goal. Conservation International will continue to work toward the permanent protection that the rest of this unique, biologically rich region deserves," said Avecita Chicchon, director of CI's office in Peru. Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to protect global biodiversity, focusing on ecological hotspots in more than 21 countries on four continents. ### WT02-B18-35IA083-000589-B020-64http://www.conservation.org:80/web/fieldact/c-c_prog/eco1.htm 38.253.200.3 19970216022416 text/html 2857HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.13Date: Sunday, 16-Feb-97 02:29:11 GMTLast-modified: Thursday, 09-Jan-97 15:21:40 GMTContent-length: 2672Content-type: text/html Ecotourism Ecotourism Ecotourism is one of the fastest-growing segments of the world tourism industry, and for a growing number of countries, tourism based on natural attractions is a top earner of foreign exchange. Given its economic power, tourism provides powerful incentives to government policy-makers and local people to conserve natural resources which attract outside visitors. The immensity of the tourism industry, however, and the possibility of its explosive growth in a region, can overwhelm natural resources and community infrastructure. Ecotourism Highlights New support positioned CI to manage a community development and ecotourism project in communities neighboring Madidi National Park in Bolivia. In Brazil, CI successfully launched a training program on ecotourism both in strategic planning and product development. With the U.S. Forest Service, the department used innovative research techniques to help evaluate the economic potential of ecotourism in Bahia, Brazil.

This strategy stresses sound policy and assists in long-term regional planning, provides training, and sponsors model site development. To support these initiatives, CI develops alliances with key partners in the public and private sectors, provides technical assistance to regional program staff and local partners, and seeks project funding. Ecotourism initiatives are now a significant component of the majority of CI's regional programs in 22 countries worldwide. Examples of current activities include the following: Bolivia: CI is helping to develop indigenously owned, managed, and operated ecotourism and other small enterprises in the village of San José and neighboring towns in and around the buffer zone of the Madidi National Park. Enterprise development is based on the sound use and management of the area's resource base through ecotourism, agroforestry, indigenous handicraft production, and non-timber forest products extraction. Brazil: CI is sponsoring ecotourism workshops which train participants in ecotourism planning and product development. The workshops are bringing together the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, interdisciplinary teams of planners, architects, environmental experts, market analysts, and members of the international conservation community. The trainees then instruct other Brazilians at regional workshops. The workshop format will be replicated for other CI in-country programs. Another CI initiative is helping to provide the Kayapó Indian communities of Brazilian Amazon with sustainable economic alternatives to mining, and seeks to carefully redesign the current unsustainable timber harvesting practices in the region. CI facilitated the creation of a permanent research station, the Kayapó Center for Ecological Studies, which will aid the development of a forest management strategy and non-timber forest products, and act as an ecotourism base for the area. Guatemala: CI is developing three alternative tourist routes to draw visitors into the spectacular, but rarely seen areas of the Maya Biosphere Reserve. The route development involves several local communities and tour operators and benefits local villages and businesses. CI is offering training so that local people may become tourism professionals. The Eco-Escuela, a school located in the San Andrés community, offers a unique combination of Spanish language instruction with an environmental curriculum. Villagers receive income from teaching and housing students. The school also serves as a means of drawing individuals to an area that might otherwise be bypassed and helps direct tourists to other nearby ecotourism sites. Ghana: As part of the USAID-sponsored project to develop tourism around Ghana's Kakum Nature Park, CI opened a canopy walkway last Earth Day (April 23, 1995). The site has attracted more than 6,000 tourists to date. Questions or comments, contact webmaster@conservation.org.

The first ever debt-for-nature exchange was initiated by Conservation International (CI) and the government of Bolivia in July 1987. Since that ground-breaking transaction, CI has negotiated debt-for-nature swaps in Mexico, Costa Rica, Bolivia, and Madagascar. Similar exchanges have been facilitated by the Dutch and Swedish governments, as well as a number of nonprofit organizations, including The Nature Conservancy and World Wildlife Fund.

In 1995, CI's International CommunicationsDepartment has given ample proof of how effective its communicationsstrategies are in garnering national support for conservation. International Communications focuses on reaching local communitiesand national leaders facing decisions that will affect the futureof their nation's natural resources. Expanding people's awareness,defining the terms of public debate, and inspiring communitieswith a sense of appreciation and "ownership" of biodiversityare just some of this program's impact. To capture the attentionand affect the attitudes of national audiences, InternationalCommunication strategies are built with media campaigns, videodocumentaries, radio and television, printed materials, grassrootseducation campaigns, and workshops. These intensive campaignsprovide information about environmental decisions and create arenasfor national discussions. Ultimately, these efforts are alsodesigned to influence national policymakers who make the crucialdecisions on protecting endangered ecosystems. The Pantanal, Brazil The Pantanal is the setting for a controversial river developmentproject called "Hidrovia" that could bring significantchanges to the ecology and economy of the world's largest wetland. Because the region's residents were by-and-large unaware of theprobable consequences of Hidrovia, International Communicationsand CI-Brazil created an informational video. Filmed interviewswith more than 50 scientists, conservationists, ranchers, politicians,businesspeople and residents were edited down to a 18-minute documentarypresenting the residents' and officials' viewpoints. A key segmentrecorded a high government official's statement that the Braziliangovernment has made a commitment to "leave the river as itis." In December 1995, CI released "Voices of the Pantanal--The Hydrovia Story" in Campo Grande, capital of the stateof Mato Grosso do Sul, and Cuiabá, capital of the Stateof Mato Grosso. Some 300 people, including many journalists andlocal officials, attended both debuts. The documentary attractedattention throughout the Pantanal region, resulting in four full-pagestories, as well as shorter articles, in regional newspapers,and coverage by all ten TV stations in the two cities. Universities,schools, and NGOs are now showing the video, geometrically increasingits reach. CI's documentary has significantly contributed to thedebate over Hidrovia, and the wider publicity triggered by thevideo will make any change from the "leave the river as itis" policy much more difficult. Madagascar At the beginningof 1995, CI launched the documentary video, "Fanamby: GreenChallenge for the Red Island," in Madagascar. Attendedby 120 guests including three ministers representing government,media, and the conservation community, the release was widelycovered by Malagasy TV and newspapers. The video aired on television,and videotapes were distributed for showings at cultural centersand other arenas throughout the nation. To maximize viewership,InterCom produced "Fanamby" in French, Malagasy, andEnglish versions. In 1995 "Fanamby" won an award fromthe Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival--widely considered oneof the two most important nature film festivals in the world. The Best Resourceful Production Award, which "Fanamby"received, honors the best film produced for less than $50,000. The award also acknowledges CI's communications philosophy ofproducing videos for national audiences -- rather than the internationalentertainment market. "Fanamby" aims to help Madagascarresidents appreciate the richness of their natural heritage andunderstand the importance of protecting their ecosystems. CIis the only international conservation organization producingeducational documentaries for in-country use. Following the releaseof "Fanamby" to the Malagasy public, International Communicationsand CI-Madagascar will create a regional communications strategyto support conservation efforts in Ankarafantsika. Greater CartagenaBay, Colombia On Colombia's Caribbean Coast, the city of Cartagenais a World Heritage Site, and a source of great pride and inspirationto all Colombians. Its beautiful colonial architecture and baycontaining mangrove forest, coral reefs, freshwater estuaries,and dry forests have attracted visitors from all over the world. But the area is deteriorating, besieged by rampant pollution,uncontrolled building and tourism, and population growth. Onlya concerted effort will save what is left of the Bay's naturalsurroundings. In May 1995, encouraged and supported by CI boardmember, Julio Mario Santo Domingo, International Communicationsand CI-Colombia convened a creative workshop to stimulate thinkingon zoning and to design an education campaign for Greater CartagenaBay. Thirty influential participants attended, including a formermayor of Cartagena, the city's Secretary for the Environment,the current Colombian Minister for the Environment, advertisingprofessionals, and conservationists. For six days, the team brainstormedabout how communications could inspire environmental solutions. This workshop resulted in the formation of Cartagena Convida,a new group that will guide a five-year communications campaignto catalyze efforts to protect the Bay. Cartagena Convida,now an independent NGO, is poised to launch its action plan fora multifaceted campaign, including social and biological sciences,theater and other nontraditional communications tools, informationand press, and advertising.

It is estimated that an area of tropical forest the size of Florida is lost to timber, mining, grazing, and other destructive forces every year. In total, an area larger than the size of France has been deforested in the Amazon region alone, over 12% of the world's most diverse ecosystem. This exponential rate of destruction leads to the marginalization and decline of indigenous cultures and the irreversible loss of genetic resources, two valuable national resources. CI's Response In an effort to turn the tide of this destruction, Conservation International is attempting to transform today's search for wild plants and organisms holding chemical and genetic building blocks for important new medicines and crops into a powerful conservation tool. This search, known as bioprospecting, has a tremendous potential for conservation and stewardship over biodiversity resources. To this end, CI has designed a bioprospecting program to foster incentives for conservation in tropical countries, illustrating to governments and forest peoples alike the economic potential of their genetic resources and the traditional knowledge. The stakes are high. The annual world market for plant-derived drugs is estimated at $200 billion. Activities CI has moved aggressively into the bioprospecting field. We now have experience in initiating a major bioprospecting agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Suriname, and the National Institutes of Health. We have also broken new ground by assisting the governments of Madagascar and Indonesia in developing legislation governing access to genetic resources.

RAP was designed to be fast and inexpensive way to accurately define conservation priorities. RAP works by assembling teams of experienced, internationally recognized field biologists who work closely with host-country scientists to generate fast, on-the-ground assessments of areas suspected to be important biodiversity conservation sites. To assess its biological importance, team members examine the area's biological diversity, degree of endemism, ecological uniqueness, and risk of extinction. As a conservation tool, RAP precedes - but does not preclude - long-term scientific study. Highlights The Rapid Assessment Program's expedition to Peru recorded 6 undescribed species of butterflies, 20 new butterfly records for Peru, a completely new vegetation type, at least 18 undescribed orchid species, 2 new genera of beetles, 5 records of bird species new to Peru, and 2 new herpetological records for Peru. The Conservation Biology Department contributed funds from the Parker-Gentry MemorialFund toward the creation of Bilsa Reserve, a new biological reserve and station in Ecuadormanaged by the local organization Fundacíon Jatun Sacha. A RAP expedition to the dry forest in eastern Bolivia was recorded on film by KurtisProductions as part of the PBS series "New Explorers." The first ever Aqua RAP expedition took place in September, 1996 near Cobija, Bolivia. An International RAP Team with scientists from Bolivia, Peru, Brazil and the United States spent three weeks surveying the systems of the Tahuamanu and Manuripi rivers.

The state of knowledge about aquatic tropical ecosystems is weak in comparison with terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this lack of information, major decisions affecting aquatic ecosystems are being made throughout the tropics. AquaRAP assesses the conservation significance and status of key aquatic ecosystems. A primary goal is to identify important regions for policy and decision makers and to make conservation recommendations that are locally appropriate and globally significant. AquaRAP expeditions will analyze biological communities found in rivers, streams, lakes, springs or marshes, and adjacent environments that fall under aquatic influence such as floodplains and gallery forests. The interface between aqua and terra and a hydrological overview will be principal to this broader context of the aquatic community, and is essential for conservation purposes. In spite of contamination and depletion of fish populations, aquatic communities receive little conservation attention. Fish provide the major source of protein for the majority of rural people throughout the wet tropics. People who rely upon this source are severely impacted by deforestation, mercury pollution from gold mining, overfishing and elimination of large keystone predators such as giant otter and caiman. Opportunities exist to facilitate change because many tropical countries such as Peru and Brazil are beginning to place a high priority on improving aquatic ecosystem conservation and belated science. Collaboration with government agencies can now have a significant impact on the fate of these ecosystems. AquaRAP has four important analysis levels: Biodiversity and biogeographic significance There is much uncertainty concerning the diversity of tropical fish faunas. The Amazon Basin, the world's epicenter for freshwater fish has some 1500-1700 species described. Recently it has been suggested that the actual species count might be as high as 9000 species. Landscape ecology Working beyond the body of water is crucial to this approach. Maintaining the riparian corridor, as most indigenous cultures on blackwaters do, is crucial to human sustenance. There are many associations between fish and trees in flooded forests. Seasonal flooding is related to soil replenishment. These interrelationships are critical for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms as well as the local economy. Physio-chemical analysis The relationship between water chemistry, endemism and fish distribution is complex. Such basics as how fish faunas differ between blackwater and whitewater systems are poorly known. Human ecology Human activities such as farming forestry, mining and fisheries are often major determinants of aquatic ecosystem health. Indigenous societies have developed a number of adaptive systems that conserve aquatic fertility. Recording this type of information is vital both for better scientific understanding and for documenting the human dependence on the resources and appropriate management. The first ever AquaRAP expedition took place in September, 1996 near Cobija, Bolivia. An International RAP Team with scientists from Bolivia, Peru, Brazil and the United States spent three weeks surveying the systems of the Tahuamanu and Manuripi rivers. The founding and initiation of AquaRAP has been substantially funded by the W. Alton Jones Foundation. With further support AquaRAP could be implemented to fill information needs and help set conservation priorities around the world. AquaRAP is a collaboration between Conservation International and The Field Museum of Chicago.

With new funds being made available for conservation, our challenge is to promote appropriate projects and lessen the impact of poorly designed international initiatives. CI's Policy Program reinforces the work of our field programs through policy, legal and economic analysis. The department also works to create new approaches to conservation that cover finance mechanisms and bioprospecting, models for understanding the economic forces behind biodiversity loss, and improving the environmental performance of development institutions. Forces affecting conservation, including macroeconomic policy, land-use dynamics, and large-scale development assistance form the framework for our conservation actions. CI's Conservation Policy program is working to ensure that these forces support, not undermine, conservation efforts. This means taking the lessons learned by CI's on-the-ground programs to world capitals and international forums; breaking new ground in fields like natural resource economics; and pioneering new approaches to funding conservation such as debt-for-nature swaps and bioprospecting. In Washington, our challenge is to help maximize the potential for U.S. leadership on global environmental issues through international forums like the Biodiversity Convention, trade agreements like NAFTA, and major international initiatives like the 1994 Western Hemisphere Summit. Conservation Finance Since creating the world's first debt-for-nature swap in 1987, CI has pioneered innovative financial mechanisms to fund conservation. CI is assisting the governments of Indonesia and Madagascar to create new laws governing the use of biological and genetic resources for pharmaceutical applications (commonly known as "bioprospecting.") CI is assessing the legal and financial aspects of creating an investment fund for conservation enterprise projects. Legislative Policy Since 1991, the Policy Program has helped to focus international agreements and institutions to work for biodiversity conservation on the ground. In Madagascar, CI is working with the United National's Development Programme to set up the country's top priorities for conservation investment as well as an environmental action plan for the country. In cooperation with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, CI is analyzing the impacts of infrasturcture--particularly road-building--on biodiversity in South America. In a study released in 1995, CI is proposing innovative legal tools and economic incentives that may break new ground for private sector participation in conservation. Resource Economics Understanding the economic forces that drive biodiversity loss is essential to making the most conservation investments effective. CI has targeted several strategically important ecosystems for economic assessments and conservation recommendations. In Bolivia's tropical forests, CI is evaluating the economic context for and environmental consequences of different forest management approaches in order to influence international and Bilivian forestry policy. To protect the remnants of the threatened Atlantic Forest in Southern Bahia, Brazil, CI is surveying the economic value of the forest, biodiversity, watersheds, and the forces at play on local landowners to help them to derive sustainable incomes from environmentally benign land uses. In Papua New Guinea and Guatemala, CI is reviewing proposed industrial timber concessions--both in terms of revenue distribution and conservation impacts. Highlights CI's policy work with USAID focused its efforts on biodiversity hotspots and major wilderness areas. CI also helped modify the Global Environment Facility's funding structure to accommodate small-to-medium-sized grant opportunities for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In Suriname, CI is coordinating with the U.S. State Department and international institutions to provide technical assistance on timber concessions and development alternatives to the Surinamese government. CI debt-for-nature swaps have converted more than $4.6 million in debt for conservation in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Madagascar, and Mexico over the past year and a half.

Recently, CI researchers took a highly significant step toward identifying habitats at greatest risk: They have for the first time charted data showing the distribution of human disturbance of ecosystems throughout the world. The data are broken down into various levels of disturbance: predominantly natural ecosystems (green), partially disturbed areas (yellow), and human-dominated ecosystems (red) such as farms and cities. Often, human disturbance creates an environmental "hotspot." One of the most striking features of this map is how much of the planet has been completely and irrevocably changed from its natural state--most of the United States and Europe, for example. In contrast, there still are some large swaths of relatively undisturbed land, and some of them are in the tro../resource/icons. These tropical wilderness areas--shown in green on the map--are an encouraging sign that there is still time to protect these ecosystems and their biological richness.

For this search option you type the words you want to search oninto one or both of the text boxes and click on the Search button. Words typed into the same box are assumed to be separated by the boolean operator OR so typing analysis study into the first text box would retrieve citations that have the word analysis or the word study. You can choose the boolean operator {AND OR ANDNOT} with which to separate the words in the two text boxes. Typing analysis study into the first text box, selecting the AND operator, and typingrecreation into the second text box would retrieve citations that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study and recreation. The searches are literal so if you wanted the last search to pick up citations with the words studies and recreation you would have needed to type analysis study studies into the first text box. You can also use the wildcard character * so typing stud* would pick up study, studies, studied, among other words.

By default the words are assumed to be separated by the boolean operator AND so typing analysis recreation is the same as typing analysis and recreation and would retrieve citations that have both the words analysis and recreation. The boolean operators available are {AND OR NOT}. Typing analysis not recreation would retrieve citations that have the word analysis but don't have the word recreation. Operator order is from left to right so typing analysis or study and recreation would retrieve documents that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study and recreation.

For data recorded in 1/4" tapes, the format of the physical data recording differs slightly.In this document the format differences between 1/2" and the 1/4" are pointed out.       BLOCKS AND RECORDS This document uses the terminology "blocks" and "records",wich are defined below.BLOCK is set of data recorded in a tape using a single tranfer. The blocks, in the tapes, are separeted by "blank" spaces (IRG: inter-record gaps). A block may contain one or more RECORDS. RECORD is a logic set of data, for instance, a header or an image line.The manuals describing the LTWG and Fast-Format do not make any distinction between blocks and records : in the 1/2" tapes, each block contains just one record and, hence, the definitions get mixed up.In the 1/4" tapes, however, this distinction is important to understand the recording format.         1/4" TAPES FORMAT The records in the 1/4" tapes are exactly the same as those in the 1/2" tapes, as described in their manuals. However, in the 1/4" tapes, the records concentrate in blocks. The method of concatenation, and the size of the blocks, are decribed below : Blocks size The blocks always have the same physical size, multiple of 512 bytes, and never exceed 16 kbytes. Concatenation of records in blocks The logical records are concatenated within the tape's physical blocks. Each logical record is completely contained within a single physical block, that is, a logical block is never recorded in 2 (or more) physical blocks.Each logical record is preceeded by a field of 4 bytes wich contains the size of the record (in bytes), as shown below :                ----------------------------/\/---------------------------|a| RL1            |b| RL2      |n| RLn          |O|  p  |---------------------------/\/----------------------------       <----------------------<=16 KBytes----------------------->               field a : 4 bytes containing a binary numerical value, of size (in bytes) equals to the logical record 1.(RL1) field RL 1 : logical record 1, of size (in bytes) described in field a. field b : 4 bytes containing a binary numerical value, of size (in bytes) equals to the logical record 2. (RL2) field RL 2 : logical record 2, of size (in bytes) described in field b. field n : 4 bytes containing a binary numerical value, of size (in bytes) equals to the logical record n.(RLn) field RL n : logical record n, of size (in bytes) described in field n. field 0 : 4 bytes of value 0, wich indicate the end of the records within the block. field p : null data, with no information, necessary to complete the size of the physical block, so that it is a multiple of 512 bytes. End of file marks The end of file marks are mentionated (EOF) in the format manuals. Whenever 1/4" tapes are used for recording, the marks are kept in the same position described in the manuals. EXAMPLE : An example of a routine (FORTRAN type), wich returns a tape logical record every time it is called, is given below. The routine presumes that there is another one available for use, (called LE_BLOCO), wich alocates the next physical block in the tape in a vector called BLOCO; the size of the physical block (in bytes) in a variable called TAMANHO_FISICO, and the reading error code (or an EOF reading code or zero, if no reading error occurs) in a variable called STATUS.          SUBROUTINE LE_REGISTRO ( REGISTRO, TAMANHO_REGISTRO, STATUS )  C---------------------------------------------------------------------CC Purpose :CC  Read the 1/4" tapes distributed by INPE, containing C  image data.CC  Every time this routine is called it returns a tape record.C  The records are described on the format manuals distributedC  by INPE.CC Arguments :CC REGISTRO : Vector that contains a logical record.CC TAMANHO_REGISTRO : An integer (4 bytes), that contains C the size of the record to be transferred.C    C STATUS : An integer that returns the reading condition.C Possible values are :CC  0 : reading error C -1 : end of file mark foundC other value : reading error codeCC---------------------------------------------------------------------CC     Not every compiler allows the definition ofC     an unsigned variable.C     In this case, remove the instruction that computeC     the variable TAMANHO_REGISTRO and remove theC     subsequent comment lines.

Este equipamento eraconstituido de um computador PDP11-45 com 256 Kbytes de memória e 13discos removíveis de 80 Mbytes cada e o processador propriamente dito,composto de 5 planos de imagens (memória) de tamanho de 512 linhas por512 pixels cada e ficava instalado em uma sala do prédio Beta. Em 1981foi construido um local para a instalação deste equipamentoanexo ao prédio do Sensoriamento Remoto, o qual também abrigavatodo o pessoal de desenvolvimento de software. Com a vigência da lei de informática, tornou-se impossívela atualização desse equipamento, bem como aimportação de novos, obrigando o INPE a desenvolver seupróprio sistema de processamento de imagens, o SITIM, sendo instaladosno LTID, 3 unidades desse equipamento, interligados por uma rede local de baixavelocidade. Com o final da lei de informática em 1989, pode-se repensar aconfiguração do hardware do laboratório. O sistemaImage-100, já totalmente obsoleto, foi desativado e um servidor de redefoi adquirido da Sun Microsystems e mais 8 estações SITIMversão 150. Todo esse equipamento foi interligado em rede Ethernet,possibilitando a troca de dados entre a servidora e os sistemas deprocessamento de imagens. Em 1991 mais 4 estações de trabalhoforam adquiridas, softwares para o sistema operacional Unix e todo olaboratório foi interligado à rede Internet, possibilitando oacesso a dados em todo o mundo. O LTID NOS DIAS DE HOJE Após sucessivas atualizações de hardware e umagrande expansão da rede local, o LTID é sem dúvida um doslaboratórios mais bem equipados do hemisfério sul. Suaconfiguração atual é de uma servidora Sun sparc 1000 com128 Mbytes de RAM, 2 CPU's, 20 Gbytes de disco, 3 saidas Ethernet(subdivisão da rede local em sub-redes), todos os tipos de leitoras defitas e cd rom. A rede local (domínio ltid.inpe.br) se espalha ao longodos prédios da área de Sensoriamento Remoto, conectandovárias estações de trabalho de diversos fabricantes, bemcomo microcomputadores. Ao longo de cada "tentáculo" dessa rede foram ainda definidassub-redes, com servidores escravos, com a finalidade de diminuir otráfego pela servidora. Quanto aos softwares instalados, pode-se citar: - Arc Info : sistema de informaçoes geográficas - PCI : sistema de processamento de imagens (inclui radar) - Spring : sistema de processamento de imagens e informaçõesgeográficas - ER Mapper : sistema de processamento de imagens - SITIM - sistema de processamento de imagens em microcomputadores - SGI : sistema de informações geográficas emmicrocomputadores - Grads : sistema de processamento de imagens meteorológicas - IDL : linguagem de programação para processamento de imagens - Compiladores C, C++,Fortran,gcc e g++ - Vários utilitários de domínio público. O LTID PARA O FUTURO Dentre as previsões já consolidadas para olaboratório, prevê-se para meados do próximo ano asubstituição da atual rede de 10 Mbits por uma rede de 100 Mbitsbaseada em fibra ótica interligando as máquinas principais econcentradores Ethernet (HUB's) e subredes baseadas em par trançado(fast ethernet). Também já está aprovado aatualização das máquinas mais antigas para Sun-Sparc-20,ampliando a capacidade total instalada de disco no LTID para mais de 50Gbytes. É filosofia do laboratório permitir aos pesquisadores e alunosda pós-graduação em Sensoriamento Remoto, o acesso aomaior número possível de sistemas de processamento de imagens einformações geográficas, provendo interfacesamigáveis entre máquinas e usuários.

The world'slargest postal union, APWU is also the fifteenth largest union inthe AFL-CIO. History Postal unions, dating back to the nineteenth century, havegone through a number of transitions paralleling the growth ofthe former Post Office Department and its transformation into theU.S. Postal Service under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970.Under the PRA, postal unions first won the right to bargaincollectively over wages, hours and working conditions. APWU was founded on July 1, 1971, the result of a merger offive postal unions: the United Federation of Postal Clerks, theNational Postal Union, the National Association of Post Officeand General Service Maintenance Employees, the NationalFederation of Motor Vehicle Employees and the NationalAssociation of Special Delivery Messengers. Structure APWU's top officers are the president, Moe Biller; theexecutive vice president, William Burrus; and thesecretary-treasurer, Douglas Holbrook. The union's organizational structure reflects its separatecraft origins. There are five craft divisions: clerk,maintenance, motor vehicle, special delivery and mail handler,and a support services department. Other headquarters departmentsare industrial relations, legislative, research and education,organization, and human relations. Craft divisons and departmentsare each headed by a director. The three top officers, the directors of the departments anddivisions, other craft division and department officers, fiveregional coordinators and 60 national business agents are allelected by mail ballot referendum of the membership every threeyears. The next election of officers will be in 1998. The APWU has more than 2000 locals located in every state andterritory of the United States. Its top governing body is thebiennial national convention, the next to be held in August,1998. Between conventions, a 13-person national executive boardsets union policy. Members of the NEB are the top three officers,the five craft division directors, the director of industrialrelations and the five regional coordinators.

We have a separate division for each craft -- Clerk,Maintenance, Motor Vehicle Service, Special Delivery Messenger,Support Services, and Mail Handler -- concerned with the specialproblems of the workers in the craft. In addition to nationalofficers, each division, except the Mail Handler Division, hasrepresentatives in the field called national business agents. Forthe Mail Handler Division, the APWU Constitution calls for theapppointment of five regional mail handler representatives, to beutilized on an as-needed basis. We also have departments responsible for handling specificadministrative functions and providing special services to themembership -- Legislative, Industrial Relations, Organization,Research and Education, Human Relations, and Health Plan. Regional coordinators maintain an office in each of fiveregions: Central, Eastern, Northeast, Southern, and Western. 7. How are officers elected? National union officers are elected by mail ballot of themembership every three years. The officers and national businessagents for each craft division are elected by the members in thatdivision. Additionally, regional coordinators are elected by themembers in each region. Any member may become a candidate fornational office by filing a petition in accordance with therequirements spelled out in the APWU Constitution. 8. How much are dues? Dues are very reasonable and vary from local to local. Theyinclude national dues established by the National Convention andlocal dues determined by your local union. After you've joined APWU by completing Form 1187, dues areautomatically deducted from your pay check. Your steward or localofficer can tell you the cost of dues; or, if you are a member,you can check your pay stub. 9. How are my dues spent? National dues pay for all the operating expenses of the union,including contract negotiations, grievance handling above thelocal level, and the cost for arbitration at the regional andnational levels. Members' dues also cover the cost ofpublications, legal fees, legislative activities, education andtraining, and community service programs. 10. How does the union negotiate the National Agreement? The APWU has a National Negotiating Team composed of thepresident, the executive vice president, the director ofIndustrial Relations, and the directors of the crafts werepresent. This team meets with Postal Service management severalmonths before a current contract expires. The team proposescontract language, the Postal Service responds, and through thegive and take of negotiation they try to reach agreement. 11. Do I get to vote on the contract? Yes. A negotiated National Agreement becomes valid only onapproval by the membership through a mail ballot. After theNational Negotiating Team reaches agreement with the PostalService, a Rank and File Bargaining Advisory Committee reviewsthe proposed contract. If they approve it, the contract is sentto the entire APWU membership for ratification. If the committeeis not satisfied, it can return the contract to the NationalNegotiating Team to reopen negotiations. 12. What about strikes? The APWU believes that the right to strike is an inalienableright of all American workers. However, federal law prohibitsstrikes by postal and federal employees and requires that ifcontract negotiations do not result in agreement, unresolveddisputes are to be submitted to arbitration -- to an impartialthird party -- for resolution. While our position is 'no contract, no work,' the 1982 APWUNational Convention authorized our national leadership tocontinue negotiations past the contract deadline if they feelthis is necessary to reach agreement, as long as postal workerscontinue to be covered under the previous contract. Thus, theAPWU views the strike as a weapon of last resort to be used onlywhen all other means of reaching agreement have been exhausted. 13. Suppose I have a grievance? If you have a grievance -- you believe that management hasviolated your rights or subjected you to harassment ordiscrimination -- you should immediately talk to your stewardabout the problem. The steward, who is your union representativeon the work floor, will determine whether a violation hasoccurred and will try to reach a settlement with your immediatesupervisor. If this effort fails, the union can appealmanagement's action to a higher level. If all these efforts failto result in a satisfactory solution, the union may request thatan impartial arbitrator be called in to settle the grievance. 14. What about job security? As spelled out in our National Agreement, all career postalworkers have a lifetime guarantee of job security after six yearsof service. 15. How is APWU fighting privatization? Privatization is the Postal Service's attempt to contract outpostal work -- your work -- to private companiesthat hire low-wage, nonunion workers. The APWU has beensuccessfully fighting efforts to privatize postal services foryears. The APWU monitors all management attempts to contract outwork that belongs to our bargaining unit and makes sure that theNational Agreement is upheld. In May 1993, APWU won an important privatization dispute atthe national level when an arbitrator ruled that Remote Bar CodeSorting (RBCS) work should have been offered to bargaining-unitworkers. The Postal Service had contracted the work out toseveral companies that hired nonunion workers at sub-postalwages. As a result of subsequent negotiations between the APWUand the USPS, Remote Encoding Centers are now staffed byAPWU-represented postal employees. 16. Is the APWU affiliated with other organizations? Yes. The APWU is affiliated with the American Federation ofLabor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), afederation of 78 national unions with a combined membership of 13million workers. APWU also belongs to the AFL-CIO's PublicEmployee Department and Industrial Union Department. The APWU also is affiliated with the Postal, Telegraph andTelephone International (PTTI), an organization of labor unionsrepresenting workers in the field of communications in nationsthroughout the world. 17. Is the APWU involved in legislation and politics? Because legislation has an important impact on our members,the union is definitely involved in legislative matters. The APWUmaintains a very effective legislative program which monitorslegislation being considered by Congress that will have an impacton postal workers and their families. APWU COPA -- the CommitteeOn Political Action -- raises voluntary contributions to assistthe campaigns of friendly legislators and to defeat those whoconsistently oppose us. COPA also has a Voices inPolitics (VIP) publication which advises postalworkers and their families on legal grassroots political action. 18. How can I find out what's going on in the union? You can stay informed by going to union meetings andparticipating in the activities of your local. Remember that as amember you have an equal voice and vote with all other members.Your steward and local officers can answer questions you may haveabout specific union programs and policies. Additionally, readinglocal and national union publications such as TheAmerican Postal Worker monthly newspaper and theAPWU News Service bulletin will keepyou informed about your union. 19. I'm not a member yet. How do I join? Ask your steward or a local officer for a Form 1187 and fillit out. Part must be completed by you, and part by the local.Your union dues will automatically be deducted from your paycheck. You can get more information from your steward or otherunion officer. If you work in a very small office where you havedifficulty getting information, contact Frank A. Romero, Directorof Organization, at APWU headquarters, 1300 L Street, NW,Washington, DC 20005, 202-842-4227. 20. I'm already a member. What can I do to help the union? It's important to keep in mind that you are theunion; members are the lifeblood of the APWU. The best way toimprove the union is to get involved. In addition to attendingunion meetings, consider joining a committee, working to organizenonmembers, becoming a steward, and volunteering to help in unionactivities. Your union brothers and sisters will appreciate yourparticipation. 21. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

APWU President Moe Biller appeared on nationwide television on Wednesday, December 4, 1996 to lodge the union's objections to a report issued earlier in the day calling for a radical downward adjustment of the government's leading measure of inflation--the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The so-called "Boskin Commission" report, named after a panel of five economists appointed by the Senate Finance Committee and chaired by Bush administration economist Michael Boskin, claimed that the government's inflation index has been overstated by approximately 1.1 percentage points and should be adjusted accordingly. The result would be increased tax payments for all working Americans and reduced cost-of-living adjustments for postal workers, postal/federal annuitants, people on Social Security and families receiving food stamps. "I think that it appears to me to be a political ploy with cover by economists who are selected on a biased basis," Biller said. "The entire thing is a political ploy to reduce benefits to a quarter of the American population--43 million Social Security recipients, 3 million federal and postal annuitants and 6 million people on food stamps--and that's a disgrace. I think the politicians involved ought to be ashamed of themselves....It's a bipartisan effort to shaft the people." In the photo above, Biller is shown speaking from Washington with CNBC's Terry Keenan in the network studios outside of New York City. Biller appeared on CNBC's "Market Wrap" report, which airs worldwide at the close of the stock market each weekday. See the January issue of The American Postal Worker for more on the Boskin Commission report and APWU's response. Open Season Continued For APWU Health Plan! USPS personnel offices have been authorized to acceptbelated enrollment in the APWU Health Plan through the close ofbusiness on Friday, December 20, 1996.

After December 20, an employee may stillrequest a belated election, but the personnel office will notautomatically accept the election without determining whether theinability to register was due to circumstances beyond theemployee's control.

Locals Notified of Potential 'Sharps' Hazard On November 21, 1996, APWU national headquartersnotified all local presidents, regional coordinators and NBAs ofa potential serious safety and health problem. TheBecton-Dickinson Company recently offered a rebate to customerswho mail back to the company their used syringes and needles.Some of these customers have been sending improperly packagedsyringes and needles to the company, located in Young America,MN. If not handled appropriately, these improperly packagedmedical devices may injure employees and expose them to bloodinfected with, for example, the hepatitis virus. Although the company is making attempts to contact itscustomers to instruct them not to mail syringes, some of theseimproperly packaged medical sharps may already be in themailstream. Local unions were advised by national headquarters to informworkers and to meet with local management to encourage them tomake all employees, especially window clerks, aware of thepotential problem. Also, USPS headquarters has instructed localmanagers to update their bloodborne disease exposure responseplan, reissue the post-incident protocol, and establishpreventive procedures from acceptance to delivery. APWU headquarters also sent locals a copy of a letter fromUSPS headquarters alerting the union to the potential hazard, anda copy of Management Instruction EL-810-92-4, Bloodborne DiseaseExposure Control Plans. The Management Instruction details theprocedures to prevent exposure to blood and infectious materials,as well as the steps to take if an employee is exposed. Localswere advised to review this policy and determine if localmanagement is abiding by its requirements.

This results from an increase in the CPI-W to 463.2 inOctober. CSRS and FERS CSRS retiree COLA is based on the third quarter (July, August,September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the 1995 thirdquarter average. The 1997 CSRS cost-of-living adjustment will be2.9 percent and will be reflected in January 1997 annuity checks. The formula for FERS retirees is the same as for CSRSretirees, except that if the CPI-W average increases 3 percent ormore, the adjustment will be the CPI-W increase minus 1 percent.If the CPI-W average increases between 2 and 3 percent, then theadjustment will be 2 percent. The 1997 FERS cost-of-livingadjustment will be 2 percent and will be reflected in January1997 annuity checks. FECA COLA COLA increases for FECA recipients are based on the percentageincrease in the December index from year to year. After the tenthmonth of the 1996 adjustment period, the CPI-W has increased 3percent over the December 1995 base index. Penalty Overtime Exclusion Period In accordance with provisions of the NationalAgreement, penalty overtime rates are not paid during the monthof December. It has been the practice to designate fourconsecutive work weeks (which might include some days inNovember) as the December penalty overtime exclusion period. ForDecember 1996, the American Postal Workers Union and the USPostal Service agreed that the exclusion begins November 30, 1996(start of week two of pay period 25-96) and ends December 27,1996 (end of week one of pay period 01-97). Note: The November 7, 1996 PostalBulletin reported the wrong dates. Management will make thenecessary correction. $400 Lump Sum APWU members are reminded that the $400 lump sumpayment due on December 13 will be included in regular pay checksHowever, tax withholding will be calculated separately at theaverage tax rate for each employee for 1996. For moreinformation, refer to the November 8 issue of the NewsService bulletin. Annual Leave Carryover January 3, 1997 marks the end of the leave year for1996.

Michigan State Convention Raises $4,100 for APWU COPA APWU members attending the Michigan State Conventioncombined their political fundraising efforts to contribute $4,100to the APWU COPA--Committee On Political Action--war chest.Members of the San Francisco, CA Local also understand theimportance of raising money for political action. In the weeksleading up to Election Day, local members organized severalfundraising activities that raised $3,614.48 for COPA. Although the November 5 elections are over, the struggle toprotect the future of American workers and their familiescontinues. APWU and auxiliary members should not abandonpolitical action! Despite President Bill Clinton's re-election,Republicans have reclaimed victory in both the House and theSenate. Judging from the vicious attacks working people facedover the past two years, APWU and all of labor will have a roughroad ahead. Legislation on Capitol Hill can have a tremendous impact onpostal/federal workers and retirees. But with every member's COPAcontribution, it will help APWU back supporters in Congress whopledge to vote for postal workers' interests and help defeatthose who aim to cut back jobs, wages, hard-earned benefits, andeliminate workers' rights to collective bargaining and a safeworkplace.

Eligible Workers to Get Lump-sum on December 13, 1996 APWU-represented career and non-probationary employeesare scheduled to receive a $400 lump-sum payment consistent withthe terms of the 1994 National Agreement. (Transitional employeesand Support Services employees not included in the masteragreement are excluded.) Employees will receive payment onDecember 13, 1996, incorporated into their regular pay checks.Efforts to have the payment made prior to Christmas in a separatecheck were unsuccessful; while it may have been possible to makepayment by separate check after Christmas, it was anticipatedthat employees would prefer to have access to the monies for theholiday season. Executive Vice President Bill Burrus has concluded discussionswith the Postal Service and following are the agreed-toconditions of payment. Eligibility: Those non-probationary, career employees on therolls in an APWU craft (Schedules C & P) on November 21, 1996will be eligible for payment if they were in a pay status anytimefrom November 11, 1995 through November 8, 1996, unless in anAWOL status or serving a suspension/discharge for the entire payperiod from October 25, 1996 through November 8. Employees whoare not on the (APWU craft) USPS rolls on November 21, 1996 willnot be eligible for payment under the APWU contract. There willnot be separate payments for eligible employees who were not in apay status during the pay period immediately preceding theeffective date (October 25 through November 8) but were in a paystatus during the preceding year. All eligible employees willreceive payment on the same date. All eligible full-time employees will receive $400. Hourlyrate employees will receive a percentage of that based upon thenumber of hours worked in the preceding year, as follows: 1 and under 500 hours -------- $100 500 and under 1000 hours ----- $200 1000 and under 1500 hours ---- $300 1500 hours and over ---------------- $400 The lump-sum payment will be included in the amount paid inthe December 13, 1996 check covering the period of November 23,1996 through December 6, 1996. Deductions will include federal,state and local taxes at the rate deducted for each employee,Social Security and Medicare taxes. (Employees who have earnedthe maximum $62,700 subject to Social Security deductions byDecember 6, 1996 will not have Social Security deducted.) The taxrate for the lump sum will be the average tax rate for eachemployee for the year 1996; and even though the lump sum will becombined with the regular check, the tax rate for the lump summay differ from that for hours worked. Retirement, healthbenefits and union dues will not be deducted from the amountincluded in the lump-sum payment. Employees who left the covered APWU bargaining unit (SchedulesC & P) prior to November 21, 1996 will not receive paymentunder the APWU lump-sum payment procedures. Those APWU employeeswho transferred to the Letter Carrier or Mail Handler craftsprior to November 21, 1996 and were on the rolls of those craftson the eligibility date for payment will be eligible under thelump sum payment procedures of their respective negotiatedagreements. APWU bargaining-unit employees who transferred tonon-bargaining-unit positions prior to November 21, 1996 will notreceive payment, as non-bargaining-unit employees are notscheduled for a lump-sum payment based on the period covered.Former letter carriers who transferred to an APWU craft prior toNovember 21, 1996 will receive payment under the APWU paymentprocedures, with credit for hours worked as a letter carrier. Transferees from the Mail Handler craft to an APWU craft whotransferred prior to November 21, 1996 will receive payment underthe APWU payment procedures, but the allocation of hours workedin the Mail Handler craft during the previous year has not beenresolved. Discussions are continuing for former mail handlers whohave not been paid under the APWU or Mail Handlers 1995 lump-sumpayment and who will not meet the eligibility requirements forfull 1996 payment. Further information regarding thesediscussions will be provided. Inquiries should not be maderegarding eligibility for former mail handlers as Executive VicePresident Burrus is currently negotiating the resolution of thisissue, and no further information will be available until thesenegotiations are concluded. Employees who are on the OWCP rolls on November 21, 1996 orwho have not received pay from the USPS anytime from November 11,1995 to November 8, 1996 will not be eligible for payment andwill not receive a check. Note: Employees who are on continuationof pay, or whose conversion to OWCP rolls has been delayed, andwho appear on the USPS rolls on November 21, 1996 will beeligible for payment if they meet the other criteria. Former letter carriers who transferred to an APWU craft priorto November 21, 1996 will receive the lump-sum payment onDecember 13 consistent with the payment amounts affordedfull-time and hourly-rate employees. Hourly-rate transferees whoworked hours in the Letter Carrier craft from November 11, 1995through November 8, 1996 shall have their hours computed toinclude time spent in the Letter Carrier and APWU crafts todetermine the amount received. Eligible employees who do not receive payment on December 13,1996 should forward to the local union president a copy of theirDecember 13, 1996 pay stub with time records indicating that theywere on the rolls on November 21, 1996 and were in a pay statusanytime from November 11, 1995 to November 8, 1996. The localpresident should review with the local payroll section the errorof non-payment, and, if the issue is unresolved, forward therecords to: Industrial Relations Department Lump-sum Payment 1300 L Street, NW Washington, DC 20005 Grievances should not be initiated over payment ornon-payment of the lump sum. Reminder: Although the lump-sum payment willbe included in regular pay checks, the payment will not be taxedat a rate as if compounded with regular pay. The tax rate for thelump sum will be the average tax rate for each employee for theyear 1996. Flexible Spending Account Open Season Postal workers have a great opportunity to save moneyduring Flexible Spending Account (FSA) open season, November11-December 9, 1996. Money set aside in FSA accounts is notsubject to federal, Medicare, Social Security, or (in moststates) state taxes. Postal workers can save on out-of-pocketmedical, dental and child/dependent care expenses by paying withthese tax-free dollars. Following is a brief description of the FSA program. Forcomplete information, eligibility requirements and restrictions,see your personnel department or postmaster. Health Care FSA For a Health Care FSA, workers estimate their expectedout-of-pocket medical expenses (for example, copayments,deductibles and medical expenses not covered by your healthinsurance) and commit that amount to the FSA in equalinstallments each pay period. The minimum is $5 per pay period($130/year); the maximum is $100 per pay period ($2,600/year). Beadvised that any funds remaining in the account at the end of theyear must be forfeited. Dependent Care FSA Postal workers can contribute a minimum of $130 a year, up toa maximum of either $5,000 or $2,500 per year, to a DependentCare Flexible Spending Account, depending on their maritaltax-filing status and their spouse's earnings. These funds can beused for nursery school, kindergarten, child care centers, summerday camps, babysitters, dependent care centers and householdservices related to dependent care. Covered dependents includechildren under 13, children physically or mentally unable to carefor themselves, or relatives or household members physically ormentally incapable of self care (if you claim them on your taxreturn and they spend eight hours or more each day in your home). If you have expenses such as these, don't miss this greatmoney-saving opportunity. Enroll in a Health Care or DependentCare FSA as soon as possible. Participating employees must enroll in the FSAs each year. Forcomplete information, see your personnel department orpostmaster.

Saved Grade On Friday, December 6, 1996 the APWU arbitrated for employees'right to both saved grade and protected rate. This would bebeneficial to employees who lose saved grade by failing to bid.This was the first case before new National Arbitrator Shyan Das. National RI 399 Jurisdictional disputes are again moving through the system.The National RI 399 Committee met December 5, 1996. Arbitrationdates are set for February and March. Step 4 Decision; Saved Grade and 90-day Bid Restrictions: The issue in this grievance is whether employees under a 90day bid restriction lose saved grade if the restriction preventsthem from bidding on posted assignments. As full settlement, the Postal Service agrees to establish awaiver from bidding for an employee who is in a restrictiveperiod. Therefore, if an employee is legitimately entitled tosaved grade and is in a bid restriction period as called for inthe collective bargaining agreement, he/she will not lose thesaved grade because of being unable to bid. (Q94C-4Q-C-96042416)(Guffey) Appeal to Arbitration: On January 2, 1997, the American Postal Workers Union,appealed the creation and subcontracting of Corporate CallManagement (CCM) to Arbitration (Q94C-4Q-C-970006472). The Clerk Craft is seeking information in these areas: Finance Clerk-Finance Station--It has been reported that the United States Postal Service is using the Finance Clerk, Level 6, to lead more than three (3) clerks. This is in violation of the Memo Of Understanding that created the position. During the Christmas season, the Postal Service allowed the presort houses to distribute and process mail. If any cities other than Denver, Salt Lake City and Phoenix have experienced this contract violation, please contact Bob Tunstall at (202) 842-4220. Automated Bidding System--Automated Bidding System is strictly optional to the employee. Any attempt by Management to unilaterally implement an Automated Bidding System without options to the manual system has not been agreed to.

Questions and Answers On Establishing AUnion Safety Committee What is the role of the Local Safety Committee? A union Local Safety Committee provides the union with aformal procedure to discuss membership concerns and problems anda means for solving those problems. The committee should also beinvolved in on-site inspections and investigations of accidentsor incidents. How should the union committee be organized to meettheir objectives? The union should fulfill three primary goals in order to havea strong Local Safety Committee: 1) Represent all workers. In order to fullyrepresent the concerns of the membership, the local unionpresident should ask for volunteers to serve as the union'ssafety representatives throughout the facility. These safetyrepresentatives should represent each craft at the facility sothat all safety and health issues can be brought to the attentionof the committee members. 2) Maintain communication with all members.Sometimes the committee members are not the officers or stewardsof the local union. In these cases, the local union should be upto date on the safety committee's activities so that they canfully support the union committee members. The safety committeeshould report on its activities at the local union meetings andget input from the membership. The committee can also communicateto the membership by creating leaflets and passing them out toAPWU members or posting information on the union bulletin board.Include articles or start a column in the local newsletter tocover pressing safety and health issues. 3) Educate committee participants and the generalmembership. An effective local union committee is aninformed union committee. Committee members should stay currentwith new laws, regulations, and policies put out by both OSHA andUSPS. Utilize local resources such as colleges to send members tosafety and health training classes. Participate in COSH(Committee on Occupational Safety and Health) groups. COSH groupsare coalitions of labor and community organizations concernedwith worker safety and health issues. Create a library ofoccupational safety and health resources and publications. Attainaccess to management materials. Ultimately, the committee can puton training programs for the membership to educate them aboutsafety and health issues. What are tactics for strengthening the local safetycommittee? Since the committee's main goal is to improve workingconditions, following these guidelines will help achieve thisobjective. 1) Involve the membership. Talk to fellowworkers about the safety and health problems they think exist inthe workplace. Talk to as many people as possible so that you geta fair representation of the facility. Some members will want toplay a larger role in the committee than others. Keep this inmind when assigning tasks and delegating responsibilities. Thecommittee and the membership participation can grow as it gainsexperience and knowledge. 2) List safety and health problems. Afterdiscussing working conditions with the membership, document theirconcerns so that the committee can get an overview of theproblems they have to deal with. 3) Prioritize issues. Sometimes themembership's concerns do not coincide with the committee's mainissues. For example, the membership may be concerned aboutnuisance dust but the committee may want to focus on enforcingthe procedure for handling hazardous materials spills. Since youare representing the membership, their issues should be dealtwith first. 4) Gain credibility from the membership and management.The committee needs to accomplish its goals before the membershipand management will recognize that the committee means business.This can be accomplished in two ways: (a) Meet the demands of the membership by dealing with their concerns first. Once you earn the support of the membership, then management should take you more seriously. (b) Achieve small victories before tackling larger, more difficult problems. Keeping an aisle that leads to a fire exit continually clear is easier to accomplish than attempting to modify an LSM to eliminate ergonomic hazards. As the committee continues to accomplish small improvements in the workplace, the committee can deal with management more effectively to work on bigger issues. How does the committee solve health and safetyproblems? The first step is to identify the problems or hazardsin the workplace. Small group discussions with committee members,safety stewards, and other members can give the committee insightabout what problems exist. Second, select a problem tosolve or a hazard to abate. Choose the problem from thelist of priority membership concerns. Third, developstrategies for solving the problem and determinepossible solutions. A plan of action could be as simple asbringing management's attention to a hazard. Filing Form 1767"Report of Hazard, Unsafe Condition or Practice" canalert management to a problem. As a last resort, the committeemay need to resort to legal remedies to solve safety or healthproblems. For more complicated problems, keep thoroughdocumentation to support a grievance or OSHA complaint. Sometimesother government agencies, such as local fire departments, publichealth departments, or building code or zoning agencies can behelpful in resolving safety or health problems. Fourth, implementthe strategy and evaluate your activity regularly. Thesafety committee should follow-up on their chosen strategy.Evaluate the progress and choose another strategy if the originalplan is ineffective. The fifth and final step is to communicatethe committee's accomplishment to both management andthe membership. What are activities that a safety committee can do? Communicate with the general membership to get information. Educate themselves and the general membership. Develop and conduct training programs. Review new machines and work procedures and propose changes. Know the USPS documents such as the chapter on safety and health in the ELM and contract language. Keep records. Conduct surveys. Review injury and illness records (Form CA 1 and 2). Maintain a resource center and library. Investigate incidents such as a hazardous materials spill. Conduct inspections using Form 1784-A. Sponsor outside events such as CPR training. Return to Top The American PostalWorker, July 1996 Attention FL, TX, NJ Members HIV Home Test Kit/Mailer to Be Marketed In May 1996, the Food and Drug Administration finally approveda long-awaited home test kit for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.The home test kit will enable consumers to take their own bloodsamples at home and mail them to a medical laboratory in NewJersey. A week later, they will obtain their test results viaphone, confidentially. They will also receive counseling andreferral services. Developed by Direct Access Diagnostics, a subsidiary ofJohnson & Johnson, the home test kit contains a lancet todraw blood, a test card which holds the dried blood sample, apersonal identification number, and non-reusuable packaging andmailing material. The test kit instructions are printed in bothEnglish and Spanish. Packaging Exceeds CDC Requirements The Postal Service requires this home test kit to exceed theminimum packaging required by the Center for Disease Control. Theenvelope that will contain the dried blood sample is lined withwaterproof plastic. This sealed envelope must then be placed in acardboard box that is designed to be non-machineable and sentfirst class. The APWU has reviewed the package in which the driedblood sample will be mailed and is satisfied that postal workerswill not be endangered by it. In order to test the effectiveness of its service. DirectAccess will sell the test kits only in Texas and Florida until1997. There, the $40 test kit will be sold in pharmacies, collegehealth centers, public health clinics and through a toll-freetelephone number. If sales are successful, the kits will beavailable nationwide in 1997. Postal workers who will be handling these packages shouldmonitor the integrity of the mailing containers and report anyproblems, such as breakage, to their local union as well as tomanagement. Local management should develop a procedure foraddressing exposure to damaged packages. Return to Top The American PostalWorker, October 1994 Employers Should Reduce Risk Through Ergonomics NIOSH Questions Effectiveness of Back Belts In 1994, the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH) issued a report on the use of back belts toprevent work-related back injuries. In "Workplace Use ofBack Belts: Review and Recommendations," NIOSH concludedthat the effectiveness of back belts in reducing the risk forback disorder, injuries, or pain "remains unproven."NIOSH formed its conclusions after extensively evaluating backbelt studies documented in scientific literature. Back beltsinclude abdominal supports or aids, spinal braces, supports,corsets, weight-lifting belts, and other devices that are"designed" to support and protect stomach and backmuscles. While manufacturers contend that back belts prevent backinjuries caused by lifting, pushing, pulling, twisting, orbending repetitively, NIOSH did not find any scientific evidenceto support this claim. In fact, NIOSH is concerned that backbelts may give workers a false sense of security regarding howmuch they can safely lift. Workers who wear back belts may be atfurther risk of injury if they attempt to lift bigger weightloads than they would without the back belt. Furthermore, NIOSHdoes not consider back belts to be equipment that effectivelyprotects workers from on-the-job hazards. NIOSH reports that the most effective method to eliminate thehazards associated with lifting is to "redesign the workenvironment and the work tasks." Instead of relying on backbelts to minimize the risk of injury, employers should implementan ergonomics program to: identify jobs that put workers at risk for back injuries; redesign equipment and work tasks to minimize the weight, range of motion, and frequency of lifting; train workers in proper lifting techniques and work practices; and medically monitor workers for signs or symptoms of back pain or injury. Management should not make back belts mandatory equipment, andpostal workers should consider NIOSH's recommendations beforewearing back belts. If you want more information on back belts orergonomic hazards, contact the APWU Safety and Health Departmentor NIOSH (1-800-35-NIOSH). Return to Top The American PostalWorker, March 1994 AIDS: A Union Issue, Part I Dealing With AIDS in the Workplace Note: This is the first in a series of articles on AIDSand how it may affect postal workers. Upcoming articles willfocus on the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard, how to helpunion members with HIV/AIDS, and how to protect yourself and yourfamily. Every day, 92 Americans die because of AIDS. As the crisisgrows, AIDS is affecting more and more of our union brothers andsisters; currently, about 1 million Americans are HIV-infected.Across the country, workers have faced numerous problems on thejob in conjunction with HIV/AIDS. In response, there is a growingmovement in the nation's unions to take action on these problems. What is AIDS? Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by thehuman innumodeficiency virus (HIV). The virus enters the bodythrough the bloodstream and attacks the immune system. The bodyloses its ability to fight diseases that would not normallyaffect a healthy person. The infections and diseases HIV patientscontract because of their weakened immune response are what makethem sick. There is usually a long period between the time a personbecomes infected with HIV and the time they begin to show thesymptoms of AIDS, sometimes up to 10 years or more. Peopleinfected with HIV can suffer extreme weight loss, severe andrecurrent pneumonia, brain tumors, rare skin cancer, blindness,severe nausea, fatigue and other symptoms. Are Postal Workers at Risk? Postal workers may be exposed to bloodbornepathogens--disease-causing agents found in the blood--includingHIV, through medical specimens that go through the mail system.If a spill of such blood or blood-containing materials occurs,the USPS must comply with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard setby OSHA. USPS management instruction, "Bloodborne DiseaseExposure Control Plans" (EL-810-92-4) provides complianceand policy guidelines for all postal facilities. Details on thisstandard are included in part two of this series, "MailDangers: Biological, Infectious Materials." Take note that on-the-job exposure to coworkers who haveHIV/AIDS does not constitute a risk of infection. Youcannot be infected by the HIV virus by working with someone whohas it. Despite this fact, many workers living with HIV/AIDS facediscrimination and harassment in the workplace--not only fromtheir employers, but even from their own union brothers andsisters! Fear of working with someone who has HIV/AIDS isunnecessary--it is impossible to get HIV/AIDS from sharing aphone, a water fountain, machinery, rest rooms or food. There arevery few ways to contract the AIDS virus. How is HIV Transmitted? For HIV to be spread, the infected blood, semen or vaginalsecretions of an infected person must enter the bloodstream ofanother person. Outside the body, the virus is very fragile andis easily killed. There are only three ways a person can become infected by HIV: Sexual contact. The virus is most commonly transmitted through contact with an HIV-infected person's sexual fluids during vaginal and anal intercourse and oral sex. Blood-to-blood contact. The virus can be transmitted by: sharing or reusing contaminated needles and syringes; being accidentally stuck by a contaminated syringe or sharp object; having infected blood come into contact with damaged skin (cuts, etc.); having large quantities of infected blood splashed in the eyes or mouth. Mother to newborn. A mother who is infected with the virus can infect her child during pregnancy or delivery or by breast feeding. HIV cannot be spread by coughing or sneezing, sharingwork equipment and rest rooms, shaking hands or hugging. Researchhas shown that family members of persons with AIDS have not beeninfected with the virus through normal household contact. Who is at Risk? Anyone who has unprotected sex with a person whose healthstatus they don't know about (you can't tell if someone has HIVby the way they look), or who shares needles, may be at risk toAIDS exposure. If you don't have sex or if you only have sex withone mutually faithful partner who you know is not infected, andneither of you "shoots" drugs, then you are not atrisk. Otherwise, you are at risk, regardless of your age, race,gender or sexual orientation. Latex condoms are 98 percenteffective in preventing the transmission of HIV if they are usedproperly and consistently. What Must Locals Do? Unions have a dual responsibility regarding AIDS. They mustboth protect the health and safety of workers who may be exposedto AIDS and other infectious agents on the job, and safeguard therights of members who have HIV/AIDS. Fighting againstdiscrimination has always been central to the union cause. Unionleaders must be ready to reach out to workers with AIDS, and tobattle against possible discrimination. The rights of HIV-positive postal workers are protected underthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973. USPS policy provides for treatingHIV/AIDS the same as any other medical condition in terms of jobassignments and accomodation. The policy also calls foraddressing workplace issues such as misconceptions among workers.Nevertheless, if people do have a problem with unfair treatment,locals may need to file grievances on their behalf. When peoplewith HIV/AIDS face discrimination or harassment, whether bymanagement or by their coworkers, it is the local'sresponsibility to help overcome these difficulties. In addition, AIDS-infected union members may need assistancein non-work-related areas, such as filing medical and/ordisability claims, or getting assistance through communityprograms and other sources of help. More information on howlocals can help members with HIV/AIDS is included in part threeof this series, "Support Union Members Living withHIV/AIDS." Education: Putting Away Fears Workers who are anxious about contracting HIV/AIDS frominfected coworkers should be reassured that they are in nodanger. Many people may have questions about the disease. Localsthat wish to address this need--whether they are experiencing aproblem or want to avoid one--should arrange AIDS education fortheir members. Education can improve the atmosphere at work andbenefit everyone. Locals can contact the United Waycommunity labor liaison in their area for educational materialabout the AIDS virus and coping with AIDS in the workplace.Locals may also ask their labor liaison about conducting an AIDSeducation seminar for the local membership. Education is alsoavailable through your local Red Cross,and there may be other AIDS organizations in your community thatcan provide assistance.

Return to Top The American PostalWorker, April 1994 AIDS: A Union Issue, Part II Mail Dangers: Biological, Infectious Materials In 1992, an improperly prepared, unmarked package containinglive tuberculosis cultures was mailed from a hospital in New YorkCity to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA. En route,the package was damaged and several of the test tubes containingthe cultures were broken, possibly exposing numerous postalworkers to drug-resistant strains of TB. This incident points to a serious situation involvinghazardous materials in the mail. This article will review hazards and procedures related tobloodborne pathogens and other hazardous materials in the mailstream. It is important that workers who handle medical mail andother potentially infectious material, and union representatives,obtain the original documents dealing with these hazards. Thisoverview cannot cover the many important details necessary toprotect workers. Since the National Agreement requires compliance with all OSHAstandards, postal workers who come in contact with biological andinfectious materials in the mail are protected by OSHA'sBloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030). Boodbornepathogens are disease-causing agents found in the blood, andinclude, among others, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and HBV,which causes hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. There is agreater risk of contamination by the HBV virus because it cansurvive for long periods under many environmental conditions. TheAIDS virus is more fragile, but can still be infectious whencontained in blood samples and other blood-containing fluids. There are three types of infectious materials that may be sentthrough the mail; etiologic agents (infectious agents such asviruses); diagnostic specimens (such as blood samples); andbiological products (vaccines). Mailing/Labeling Requirements Public Health Service regulations require that etiologicagents must have a proper label, including the"biohazard" figure. The label is not required ondiagnostic or biological materials, but these should be labeledfor contents. USPS rules require mail containing such materials to bepackaged in a waterproof inner container, nonpermeable to thecontents, surrounded by sufficient absorbent materials to take upthe contents in case of leakage. The inner container andcushioning should be placed in an outer nonpermeable container. (biohazard symbol) Personal Protective Equipment The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard requires that personalprotective equipment--such as gloves, gowns, face shields and eyeprotection--be used when other controls, such as the mailingrequirements noted above, do not eliminate risk. This is the casein the post office, since materials are not always marked orcontained properly. The USPS must also provide hand-washingfacilities for employees who are occupationally exposed tobloodborne pathogens. It is the Postal Service's responsibility to provideprotective equipment and to ensure that it is used properly. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard also requires the USPS tooffer hepatitis B vaccine to employees who face occupationalexposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials. Exposure Control Plan In accordance with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, MIEL-810-92-4 requires each postal facility to develop a writtenexposure control plan. The plan must be accessible to employeesand their representatives. If an exposure incident occurs, an incident report (Form 1770)and an investigation report (Form 1769) must be completed. Theexposed worker must be provided with first aid, medical testing(results kept confidential), counseling and post-exposuretreatment that includes, if the worker hasn't already receivedone, a hepatitis B vaccination. These procedures must be includedin the exposure control plan. Workers Subject to Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens According to Management Instruction EL-810-92-4,"Bloodborne Disease Exposure Control Plans,"occupationally exposed workers include all persons designated toclean up spills and leaks of mailed hazardous materials thatinclude blood and other infectious materials, as well as otheremployees outside APWU's bargaining units. Workers who may bedefined as occupationally exposed, depending on individualcircumstances, are clerks, mail handlers and other personnel ifthey routinely handle mailed blood specimens or other itemspotentially containing bloodborne pathogens, or who handle mailedor internally generated medical wastes, including sharps."Occupational exposure" means reasonably anticipatedcontact with blood, or other potentially infectious materials,that may result from performing one's job. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard requires employers todetermine which workers may be exposed and to give informationand training to all such occupationally exposed workers at thetime of initial assignment, and to repeat and update the trainingyearly. USPS Fails to Protect Workers A recent letter from OSHA to USPS Vice President for EmployeeRelations William Henderson shows that the Postal Service has notbeen complying with the regulation requiring hepatitis Bvaccination. The letter states, in part, "...the statementby the USPS that, 'OSHA's determination that persons handlingmail items which may contain bloodborne pathogens are...[at] lowrisk,' is without merit and clearly not supported by OSHA'spolicy...USPS should identify those workers who must be providedwith a vaccination and make the vaccination available." The APWU has filed a national level grievance against the USPSfor failing to comply with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard,including training requirements and implementing properprocedures for handling hazardous materials and bloodbornepathogens. The case is currently in arbitration. What Can You Do? Postal workers should become familiar with the BloodbornePathogens Standard, your facility's exposure control plan, andManagement Instruction EL-810-92-4. If your job subjects you topotential exposure to biological materials, make sure the PostalService provides you with appropriate training. The key to eliminating or reducing the risk of exposure is totake action before an incident occurs. Work with your local toensure that the OSHA standard is enforced.

Return to Top The American PostalWorker, May 1994 AIDS: A Union Issue, Part III Support Union Members Living With HIV/AIDS Many union members have been affected by the AIDS crisis inAmerica, but even more will be affected in the future. The laborforce is a high-risk group for HIV infection--75 percent of AIDScases are among people between the ages of 25 and 44. Unions mustrespond. One of the most important things a local union can do is to bea source of help and support for union members living with HIV.When people don't know where else to go for help, the local unioncan be an important resource and a good place to start. Most people infected with HIV remain healthy for about 10years. However, they need frequent medical attention to monitorand slow the progression of the disease. Once AIDS-relatedproblems begin, they will need more frequent medical treatmentsand may start using more leave. Their needs in other areas mayincrease as well. What Locals Can Do Following are some of the ways locals can assist with issues,problems and needs facing union members with HIV/AIDS. Assist with health care, disability and retirementpaperwork. Members with HIV may need help with theselection of an appropriate health plan and supplementaldisability insurance, and with filling out claims. Most peopleliving with HIV/AIDS want to work as long as possible. However,eventually they will probably leave on disability. Assistance inplanning that transition would greatly benefit anyone. Locate sources of support and assistance.Identify sources of benefits such as local, state and federalgovernment programs, the religious community, and AIDS and othercommunity organizations. Probably the best place to start is theAFL-CIO Community Services Department. Contact your Central LaborCouncil or UnitedWay Community Services liaison. Protect rights. Be familiar with members'rights under the Rehabilitation Act and the Family and MedicalLeave Act, and assure those rights are observed. Assist with getting reasonable accommodationsimplemented. These may include flexible work schedulesto allow for frequent medical appointments, light duty, and/orextra break periods and a place to rest. Maintain confidentiality. Many workers withHIV/AIDS have faced harassment from employers andcoworkers--hence, many try to keep their medical informationsecret. If coworkers are aware a person is HIV positive, showvisible support--shake hands, ask how they're doing and whetheryou can help. Educate others to combat discrimination. Provide financial assistance. This isespecially needed in the time period immediately after a personstops working and before disability and public assistanceprograms begin. Bureaucracy often creates this gap, and the delaycan be months long. Offer emotional support. Offer support tomembers infected and affected by HIV. Affectedmeans a loved one has the disease; a member may need help copingas well as finding assistance for that person. Other Ways Locals Can Help Some other things a person living with HIV may need include:donations of leave time; legal assistance--for example, forliving wills, wills, power of attorney, insurance disputes, anddiscrimination; low-income housing; and assistance withday-to-day needs such as shopping, cooking and housekeeping.

Return to Top The American PostalWorker, June 1994 AIDS: A Union Issue, Part IV Protect Yourself From HIV Infection In 1989, Stan Baer, a 14-year-old living in a rural area ofCalifornia, had his first sexual encounter. He soon discoveredthat his first experience with sex--unprotected--had a result fewwould have anticipated. He was infected with HIV, the virus thatcauses AIDS. Although AIDS has long struck every segment of our society,many people feel that they are not at risk because of who theyare or where they live. AIDS is not a problem limited tohomosexuals, drug users and inner city residents, and it is notlimited to certain age groups. Many people in their 20s whodiscover they are HIV positive were actually infected asteenagers. In the United States, AIDS is the second leading cause ofdeath among men aged 25 to 44, but the fastest growing groups ofindividuals becoming infected with HIV are heterosexual women andadolescents. AIDS is the sixth leading cause of death amongpeople aged 15 to 24. How HIV is Spread To protect yourself and your family, it is important to learnthe facts about how HIV is spread and how to avoid infection. HIVis transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen andvaginal fluid. However, there are relatively few ways to becomeinfected. Sexual Contact The most frequent transmission of HIV is through sexualcontact, when HIV can enter through cuts or sores. These cuts maybe so small that you are not even aware of them. Because it oftentakes 10 years for an infected person to become sick, many don'tshow any symptoms, and may not even know they are infected. Ifyou have sex with such a person, you can get the virus from themwithout even knowing it. The only sure way to avoid infection from sexual contact is toabstain from sex, or to have sexual contact with only one personwho is not infected and who only has sex with you. Latex condomshelp prevent HIV infection and other diseases when they are usedproperly and consistently, but they are not foolproof. Sharing Needles Sharing needles or syringes is a high-risk factor for HIVinfection. Sharing needles to inject IV drugs is the mostdangerous behavior, but the virus can also be transmitted throughneedles used to inject steroids and those used for tattooing andear piercing. If you plan to get a tattoo or have your earspierced, be sure to go to a qualified person who uses unused orsterile equipment. Ask the person to explain their safetymeasures. Pregnancy A pregnant woman who is infected with HIV can pass the virusto her child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast feeding. Ifyou are planning to become pregnant, and you think your currentor past activities may have put you at risk for AIDS, you shouldget tested before you become pregnant. Blood Transfusions The risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion in theUnited States is extremely small. Since 1985, blood donors havebeen screened for risky behavior, and all donated blood istested. It is not possible to get HIV by giving blood, sincedonation equipment is used only once and then destroyed. Teaching Children Because teenagers are at risk for AIDS, it is important forparents to educate them about the risks of using drugs andbecoming sexually active. Many teens think that young peopledon't get AIDS, and that belief puts them at greater risk. If youare a parent, talk to your children. If you need help, advice orinformation, call the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) AIDShotline at the number listed below. They will provide informationfor addressing children of any age. Ask for their "AIDSPrevention Guide." Evaluate Your Risk Certain behaviors put you at greater risk for HIV infection.Evaluate your risk and seek further information from the CDC orlocal AIDS organizations. The AIDS virus has been in the United States since at least1978. If any of the following have applied to you since then, youmay be at increased risk of infection: Shared needles or syringes to inject drugs or steroids. If you are a male, had sex with other males. Had sex with someone who you believe may have been infected with HIV. Had a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Received a blood transfusion or blood products between 1978 and 1985. Had sex with someone who would answer yes to any of the above questions. If any of these statements apply to you, you should discussyour need for testing with a trained counselor. You should alsoseek testing and counseling if you have had sex with someone andyou didn't know their risk behavior, or if you have had manysexual partners in the last 10 years. Even though symptoms of AIDS usually don't appear for years, atest can reveal HIV infection within six months of infection orsooner. Although there is no cure for AIDS, much research isbeing done, and new treatments help HIV-infected people to livehealthier and longer. If you are infected, early detection canhelp you begin medical treatments that will slow the progress ofthe disease. Seek More Information To ask any questions about AIDS, call the Centers for DiseaseControl National AIDS Hotline at 1-800-342-AIDS; TDD,1-800-AIDS-TTY; Spanish, 1-800-344-SIDA. In addition to confidentially answering any question relatedto HIV infection and AIDS, the hotline's information specialistscan send you written materials, and refer you to organizationsand facilities in your area where you can get information,counseling and testing. You can get more information about HIV/AIDS and relatedcommunity programs at the following sites: Centers for Disease Control, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention U.S. National Library of Medicine, HIV/AIDS Resources AEGIS-AIDS Education Global Information System United Way American Red Cross Return to Top The American PostalWorker, May 1993 Safety and Health Indoor Air Pollution In recent studies, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency has concluded that indoor air pollution isone of the top five environmental health risks to the public.Furthermore, the EPA estimates that indoor air pollution iscosting society billions of dollars each year in the form ofmedical costs, lost productivity due to absences, lost workerefficiency, and damage to equipment and machinery. Poor indoor air quality can be a serious health threat. Postalworkers are at risk from many problems associated with indoor airpollution due to the excessive amounts of dust, heavy machinery,an assortment of chemicals and other factors. These conditions,combined with management's desire to control utility costs bylimiting the use of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioningsystems (HVAC), can cause short- and long-term health effects. Health Effects Complaints of symptoms of certain diseases such as asthma,Legionnaire's disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and allergicdermatitis often can be attributed to a specific indoor airpollutant or contaminant. When the causative agent of adiagnosable illness is identified, it is referred to as abuilding-related illness. Radon, asbestos, environmental(second-hand) tobacco smoke, molds and viruses are often theculprits of building-related illnesses. More often, however, many symptoms cannot be identified with aparticular disease. Complaints of headaches, eye, nose and throatirritation, nausea, fatigue, irritability, sneezing and coughingare more difficult to pinpoint to a specific cause or a singlepollutant. These types of complaints are often linked to sick ortight building syndrome (SBS). Sick Building Syndrome The phenomenon of sick building syndrome emerged as a resultof the energy crisis of the 1970s. In an effort to save money byreducing energy costs, engineers, architects and building ownersdesigned sealed, air-tight buildings that were dependent uponmechanical ventilation systems to maximize energy efficiency andcontrol indoor environmental conditions. The effect on workers'health still requires further research and examination. Factors contributing to sick building syndrome are numerousand are usually a combination of several sources. These factorsrange from inadequate ventilation, indoor pollutants, outsidesources and biological contaminants (bacteria, mold and pollen).Other factors affecting indoor air quality include the number ofbuilding occupants, the type of work performed, and activitiesthat produce dust, emissions or odors. Control Measures When the source of contaminated or poor air quality istargeted, corrective action can include employing industrialhygiene control methods to remedy the building-related illness.For sick building syndrome, the problems are often more difficultto identify and may take thorough investigation to resolve. Return to Top The American PostalWorker, April 1993 Safety and Health Is Asbestos a Problem in Your Facility? In 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimatedthat 700,000 public and commercial buildings contain friable(easily crumbled) "asbestos-containing materials"(ACMs). Furthermore, over two-thirds of these buildings aresuspected to contain damaged asbestos. What is the likelihoodthat your facility contains asbestos that could causeirreversible damage to your health? With active local union involvement, asbestos does not have tobe a problem in your facility. Where It Is; What It Does Asbestos is the name given to six different naturallyoccurring fibrous minerals that are used in building constructionfor many purposes. The most common forms of asbestos used inbuilding materials are chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite. ACMsare usually found in pipe insulation, sprayed-on fireproofing andsound-insulating materials, floor and ceiling tiles and boilerrooms. ACMs are generally located in areas that are notaccessible to the general public, but maintenance and custodialworkers are most likely to come into contact with ACMs and areoften subject to exposure. When disturbed and released into the air, asbestos fibers maybe inhaled into the lungs where they remain forever. The level ofexposure to asbestos affects the risk of developing a respiratorydisease. Although exposure to higher levels of asbestos mayresult in early development of an asbestos-related disease, mostsymptoms do not begin to appear until 10 to 40 years afterexposure. Three diseases have been linked to asbestos exposure:lung cancer, mesothelioma (lung cancer caused by asbestos), andasbestosis (scarring of the lung tissue). Defining the Risks Asbestos becomes problematic when it is disturbed, hasdeteriorated, or has been damaged. If ACM remains intact andundisturbed, it bears no health risk to building occupants. ACMmust be properly maintained and managed to prevent accidental orintentional disturbance. In fact, the postal facility manager isrequired to establish an Operations & Maintenance (O&M)program to identify and control ACMs. The O&M is mandated ina Management Instruction, "Asbestos-Containing BuildingMaterials Control Program." O&M plans are recommended by the EPA to ensure that ACMsare maintained in good condition, cleaned up properly whenreleased, prevented from further release, and monitored forcondition. The O&M plan requires that all postal-owned and -leasedfacility managers comply with the following program elements: Inspection to identify and assess all ACMs. Management and frequent monitoring of ACMs. Abatement of sprayed-on fireproofing and sound-insulating materials. Enforcement of work practices that prevent the release of ACMs. What Locals Can Do To prevent asbestos from becoming a serious health hazard,locals should determine the location and condition of ACMs in thefacilities they represent by requesting from management a copy ofeach facility's Operation & Maintenance Plan and ManagementInstruction, MI EL-810-94-3. Also, the EPA publishes aninformative guide to controlling asbestos entitled,"Managing Asbestos in Place: A Building Owner's Guide toOperations and Maintenance Programs for Asbestos-ContainingMaterials." This reference document can be obtained bycalling the EPA's Toxic Substances Hotline at 202-554-1404; TDD202-554-0551. Individual APWU members should contact their localsfor more information. Return to Top The American PostalWorker, December 1992 Safety and Health Understaffing Causes Backlash Are you suffering from fatigue? Do you feel stressed? Are moreaccidents occuring than usual? Have you had a hazardous materialsspill or incident? Are you working more overtime than usual? Doyou need more help to do your job? Is your facility or officeunderstaffed? Postal Service restructuring and downsizing may have seriousimplications on the safety and health of all postal workers. Asof October 1992, some 33,000 bargaining unit employees had takenadvantage of the USPS' early-out/optional retirement program. This greatly reduced workforce can result in understaffing ina particular area of a facility. When there are not enough peopleto do the required work, workers are forced to rush and topractice unsafe procedures, such as improper lifting techniques,in order to make up for the decrease in staff. Consequently,understaffing is one of the chief causes of accidents and adversehealth effects. Safety Hazards Understaffing that causes an increased workload or work pacemay impact the number and severity of workplace injuries. Forinstance, since workers may be required to lift bags of mail orpush heavy carts without the assistance of a coworker, backinjuries may be more prevalent. Due to a reduction in the numberof sweepers, workers may be apt to perform improper lifting andbending techniques in order to keep up with machine-paced work.An increase in machine-paced work may put clerks at further riskof developing repetitive motion injuries, such as carpal tunnelsyndrome and tendinitis. Furthermore, time constraints may prevent a worker from takingthe necessary steps to prevent injury. For example, maintenancecrews may be particularly susceptible to time pressures andforego safety precautions, such as employing machine guard andlockout procedures before repairing machinery or wearingappropriate personal protective equipment. In addition, a limitedcustodial staff can lead to potential housekeeping hazards suchas blocked aisles, slippery walkways and littered floor areas.Ultimately, the safety of workers may be jeopardized when feweremployees are able to carefully label, handle and sort mailcontaining hazardous materials. All workers should ensure thatthey are provided the required training for handling bothhazardous materials and biological hazards. Health Hazards The health effects associated with understaffing are lessevident than the safety hazards. Understaffing that generatesincreased workloads and work speedups, combined with a lack ofjob control, may increase the risk of stress-related diseases. Ithas been well documented that understaffing exacerbates theeffects of stress-related illnesses, such as heart disease, highblood pressure, digestive disorders, etc. Repercussions? It may require more time to perform a job safely; but do notforego safety for the sake of productivity. Ask for assistancewhen you need to perform onerous tasks. When performing a job,exercise safety precautions and proper procedures. If a hazardoussituation develops in your workplace, contact your safety andhealth representative or APWU steward or other officer. Yourlocal union will bring the hazardous condition to the attentionof the Joint Local Safety Committee or OSHA (Occupational Safetyand Health Administration). A decrease in staff size should be accompanied by anappropriate reduction in workload. As the Postal Service's safetyphilosophy prescribes (ELM, Chapter 8), "It is good businessfrom the standpoint of both efficiency and economy to preventpersonal injuries on and off the job. In addition to humanitarianconsiderations, injuries cost money and reduce efficiency." In the long term, the effects of understaffing may prove to bemore costly in productivity, as well as in injuries, to thePostal Service. Although the USPS warrants conditions that mayjeopardize the health and safety of its employees, workers mustalways consider safety first, as it is a precondition of all workactivity. Return to Top The American PostalWorker, November 1992 Are You at Risk? Alert! All postal workers should be aware of the threat ofoccupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Bloodbornepathogens are disease-causing agents found in the blood thatinclude HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and HBV, the virus thatcauses Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. The Postal Service is responsible for taking measures toprotect workers from the risk of occupational exposure tobiological hazards, since mail containing these biologicalhazards or other infectious materials is shipped through the USPSevery day. Often, it is impossible to tell if a package acceptedfor shipment by the Postal Service contains hazardous materials.Clerks are particularly susceptible to stabs and punctures byhypodermic needles and other medical "sharps" containedin unmarked and improperly packaged shipments. In addition,employees risk exposure from spills of packages containing bloodsamples, medical wastes and other biological specimens. Those whowork in facilities near medical waste disposal companies orhospitals are subject to further risk of exposure because of thelarge mail volume to and from the centers. A New Standard In an effort to reduce or eliminate exposure to bloodbornediseases, the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA) introduced a new standard titledOccupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens. The standardbecame effective March 6, 1992, and all requirements should havebeen operational by July 6, 1992. This standard aims to protectover 5.6 million workers against exposure to bloodbornepathogens. Since the APWU National Agreement requires compliance with allOSHA standards, the Postal Service issued a managmentinstruction, "Bloodborne Disease Exposure ControlPlans," to provide compliance and policy guidelines for allpostal facilities. The standard as outlined in the managementinstruction requires local management to identify exposed andpotentially exposed personnel and to establish an exposurecontrol plan. Exposure Control Plan Each field division facility, managment sectional center, bulkmail center and office must develop and maintain a plan thatidentifies each job and job-task which may expose workers tobiological materials, as well as determine how to minimize oreliminate these exposures. The standard also requires that the Postal Service: follow "univerisal precautions": treat all biological materials as if they are contaminated and potentially infectious; provide personal protective equipment, such as gloves, aprons, face shields and goggles to workers who handle or frequently come into contact with biological materials; implement engineering controls to minimize risk of exposure, including hand-washing facilities, and follow proper packaging procedures (see Postal Bulletin 21820, 7-23-92, pp. 8-10, "Mailability of Sharps and Other Used Medical Devices"); provide training every year to all employees who may be potentially exposed to infectious material. The training must be provided by a person "knowledgeable in the subject matter," such as a physician, nurse or safety and health specialist. The OSHA standard and management instruction specifies the content of the training. When an Incident Occurs Both an incident report (Form 1770) and an investigationreport (Form 1769) must be completed if an injury or exposureinvolving biological materials occurs. The exposed worker must beprovided with first-aid, medical testing (results keptconfidential), counseling and post-exposure treatment thatincludes a Hepatitis B vaccination. These procedures must beincluded in the Exposure Control Plan. What Can You Do? You can: request from managment a copy of your facility's Exposure Control Plan, Management Instruction EL-810-92-4, and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1030 to verify that the plan meets the standard's requirements; ensure that the Postal Service provide you with the required training if you are potentially exposed to biological materials; contact your local union for more information. The key to eliminating or minimizing the risk of exposure tobiological hazardous materials is to take action before anincident occurs by enforcing the OSHA standard and USPS policy. Return to Top The AmericanPostal Worker, September 1992 Do You Handle Hazardous Materials Safely? Are you cautious in your acceptance and handling of hazardousmaterials? Do you know what a "Tag 44" is? What shouldyou do in case of a leak or spill? All clerks should know the answers to these questions fortheir own and their coworkers' protection. All workers arereferred to several postal publications that deal with hazardousmaterials--from acceptance to handling, and from tagging tocleaning up spills. Article 14, Section D of the National Agreement requires thatthe USPS have a safety program for employees who handle hazardousmaterials. Hazardous materials are described in Part 124.3 of theDomestic Mail Manual, and include all clinical specimens andbiological products that are properly mailable (DMM 124.38). A management instruction entitled "Bloodborne DiseaseExposure Control Plans," issued 5/1/92, details whatmanagement should be doing now--identifying employees who may beexposed to bloodborne contaminants. Window clerks, pouch rackclerks, clerks who handle small parcels, rolls or regularparcels--or any clerk concerned that they may be in contact withmail of this nature--should check to see if management hasidentified them for special training. If not, they should requestthis training. Another management instruction, entitled "Responses toHazardous Materials Releases" EL-810-96-1, requires that"every employee who is involved in handling oraccepting hazardous materials" must have Handbook EL812-Hazardous Materials available. This instruction also requiresthat all potentially affected employees must be givenPEDC Course #21511-00, Hazardous Materials Acceptance andHandling. Ask for this training. Don't take chances with yourhealth. Tag 44, Form 1767 Publication 52--Part 227, Tag 44 for Hazardous Matter, states: "Any sack or other consolidation device containinghazardous matter must have a Tag 44, Sack Contents Warning,attached. Remove Tag 44 when the hazardous matter is no longer inthe sack or consolidation device." A window clerk who accepts any hazardous material must place aTag 44 on the consolidation device to let opening unit employeesor the next employee handling the sack, tub or other containerknow that a hazardous material is enclosed. Publication 52 alsostates, "handle all packages carefully. Do not throw, dropor slide packages." Carriers who collect mail from boxeswhich contain hazardous material, such as medical centers, shouldalso receive training and tag sacks. If this is not being done,file a Form 1767 "Report of Hazard, Unsafe Condition orPractice." Opening unit employees, clerks and mail handlers should alsoreceive training in handling pre-identified hazardouspackages/letters and identifying other hazardous packagescarefully. When the mail is placed into the next container, thatcontainer should be properly tagged. Pouch rate clerks whoreceive a container labeled with a Tag 44 then will know to watchfor the hazardous material; they should also place a Tag 44 onthe dispatch container. This procedure is mandatory. Leaks or Spills If a spill or leak occurs, only properly trained individuals,using proper ventilation and protective equipment, should touchthe mail (EL 801, Supervisors Safety Handbook, Appendix A pages13-14; Management Instruction EL-810-96-1, Responses to HazardousMaterials Releases.

Organized throughout thecountry, COSH groups work closely with local unions in trying toimprove workplace safety and health conditions. Volunteers, suchas labor lawyers, health professionals, and labor leaders workwith a small COSH staff to offer many services to local unions,including training, education, technical assistance, and supportin other safety and health and union activities. COSH groups arealso active in lobbying state legislatures to improve safety,health, and workers' compensation laws. Some APWU locals are especially active in theCOSH groups in their cities.

RheothRx®pf CytRx's lead program isRheothRxpf -- a patented intravenoussolution that has the potential to treat a variety of vascularocclusive diseases. Current development focus is on reducing thepain and suffering of acute sickle cell crisis. Subsidiary Portfolio In addition to its human therapeutictechnology, CytRx also has an equity portfolio consisting of three wholly-owned subsidiaries. These subsidiary investmentsbalance risk while providing opportunity to further enhance thevalue of CytRx shares. Subsidiary public offerings areplanned to provide independent funding to further their developmentand to give shareholders the opportunity to participate in �pureplay� investments in each. This will also benefit CytRxshareholders as the markets will provide tangible subsidiary calculationsthat will be reflected in CytRx's stock price. Vaxcel, Inc. Developing vaccine delivery systemsto enhance the effectiveness of human vaccines. Vetlife, Inc. Focused on novel technologiesto enhance productivity and quality in food animals. Vetlife willlaunch a line of cattle growth implants in 1997. Proceutics, Inc. Provides quality preclinical developmentservices to the pharmaceutical industry. CytRx Corporation --Human Critical Care Pharmaceuticals RheothRxpf isa unique, patented surfactant copolymer that significantly reducesblood viscosity and inhibits platelet adhesion. In a Phase IIclinical trial, RheothRxpf showed statisticallysignificant benefits in reducing the severe pain that patientssuffering from acute sickle cell crisis must endure. This trialalso indicated that RheothRxpf may reduce theduration of hospital stays. This is an important market for CytRxas each year there are approximately 100,000 hospital admissionsfor acute sickle cell crisis as well as a large number of patientswho suffer at home. Reducing the duration and severity of crisiscould provide significant health benefits as over time, organsystems deteriorate due to damage caused by each sickle cell crisis.[MORE] Vaxcel, Inc. -- UniqueVaccine Delivery System Vaxcel's Optivax is a novelapproach to improving vaccine effectiveness.

I'm Jim Yahres, CytRx'sVice President of Investor Relations. It is always a pleasureto report good news, and for CytRx 1996 has been a year of goodnews. From the creation of Vetlife's cattle business unit, toVaxcel's initiation of Optivax® clinical trials, tothe decision to move purified RheothRx®pfback into the clinic. Now, we have very special news -- the actualizationof one of CytRx's primary strategic objectives by taking Vaxcelpublic. But the agreement with Zynaxis goes far beyond justenabling Vaxcel to become a public company. This merger willcreate a vaccine delivery company with both oral and injectabletechnologies. I will now turn this over to Jack Luchese, CytRx'sPresident and CEO, to talk about the agreement. ------------------------------------------------------------ It is alwaysa pleasure to report good news, and for CytRx 1996 has been ayear of good news. ------------------------------------------------- Thank you. As Jim said, with this transactionCytRx is executing our previously announced strategy of takingour wholly-owned subsidiaries public. This will provide CytRxshareholders with recognizable subsidiary value as Vaxceltrades in the public markets. So we are very pleased with thisagreement. Briefly, this is a two stage transaction thatwill begin initially with us providing a $2 million bridge loanto Zynaxis. Final closing is expected by early April with a voteby Zynaxis shareholders. CytRx will then provide $4 milliondollars in equity which includes the conversion of the bridgeloan. Vaxcel will be the surviving company and Zynaxis shareholderswill receive 12 1/2 percent of Vaxcel's shares. I'm surethere will be plenty of questions, so I'll hold furtherremarks and ask Zynaxis' Chairman and CEO Martyn Greenacrefor his comments. ------------------------------------------------------------ Now, wehave very special news -- the actualization of one of CytRx'sprimary strategic objectives. . . ------------------------------------------------ Thanks Jack. I'm glad to be able to talk toall of you today. From the Zynaxis point of view this is a veryimportant transaction. And, it is one that we are all very pleasedwith. Zynaxis has two significant technologies for the oral deliveryof vaccines -- PLG microspheres and mucoadhesive polymers. Butwe have lacked the necessary resources to fully develop them. So, through this merger with Vaxcel we believe we will be ableto realize the full potential of these technologies. I wouldlike to have Paul Wilson, Vaxcel's President, describeour technologies and how they fit with Vaxcel's. Thank you, Martin. With this merger we arecreating an exciting company. The past couple of years we havebeen making good progress developing Vaxcel's Optivax®technology. Optivax is primarily focused on improving the effectivenessof injectable vaccines. Our Phase I human clinical trial hasshown excellent interim results and should be completed duringthe first quarter of next year. ------------------------------------------------------------ We are creatinga company with multiple vaccine delivery technologies. ------------------------------------------------- We will now be complementing this technologywith Zynaxis' oral technologies. If you look at the vastarray of vaccines now being developed, there is no question thatcertain of those vaccines are going to be more effective whendelivered by the injectable route and others more effective whengiven orally. Also, immunologists are now exploring combininginitial injectable doses with follow-on oral doses to optimizeeffectiveness. So, we are creating a company with multiple vaccinedelivery technologies. This will increase our opportunities forcorporate collaborations with major vaccine companies. ------------------------------------------------------------ The combined company will be stronger by far than either company alone. ------------------------------------------------- As part of this merger, we will assume Zynaxis'licensing agreement with ALK -- the world leader in allergy immunotherapeuticproducts. So, our good data on Optivax, combined withthe opportunity to create new oral vaccines and the licensingdeal with ALK makes for quite an exciting company. The �new�Vaxcel will be ideally positioned to improve the effectivenessof a variety of vaccines. Now I will turn this over to your questions. How should we evaluate thismerger from a market perspective? Upon closing, Vaxcel will be the survivingcompany. CytRx will be putting $4 million into Zynaxis, whichwill be merged into Vaxcel. Zynaxis has about 14 million shares(including convertible preferred stock). Their closing priceof 28 puts about a $4 million value on the current Zynaxis shares. That portion will represent 1/8 of the combined company, givingthe entire transaction a value of $32 million. Now let'sput that into perspective. A $32 million value for this companywith multiple attractive technologies compares very favorablyto three already public companies -- Virus Institute, Oravax andRibi. The market values of these three companies are eacharound $60 million. So there's plenty of room for shareprice growth here. What do you expect re: burnrate and future cash needs? The $4 million that CytRx is contributing willremain in the company, with some to be used towards closing downZynaxis operations and settlement of some liabilities. Vaxcelis at the point where it's expected to start receiving revenuesas it enters into licenses with vaccine companies. We don't expectVaxcel's burn to be high -- and the Zynaxis burn is eliminated. Next year's burn, even without any licensing revenues,is about $2 million. With expected licensing income, we'repretty comfortable with the cash situation. Also, Zynaxis isdisposing a drug delivery technology which should bring in about$500,000 as well as its Cauldron process chemistry group and pilotchemical plant for which they are currently seeking buyers. When do you expect to beginreceiving licensing revenue? Vaxcel's strategic intent is to completethe Phase I human clinical trial and then begin aggressive licensingefforts. This will ensure that we get good valuations in licensingdeals. We are on track to have the trial results in the firstquarter, and from there we'll be working aggressively toput licenses in place. How are we doing with RheothRx,and what is the status at this point? We are doing very well with RheothRx. It isproceeding according to plan. This year we introduced our purifiedversion of RheothRx to the FDA. We have developed the compound,manufactured it under GMP conditions and after several discussionswith the FDA, we will be going back into the clinic in the firstquarter of next year. We'll be starting with two dose escalationstudies. The first set will be in patients suffering the painfulcrisis of sickle cell disease. The second set of patients willalso be sickle cell patients, but they will be the more seriouspatients with acute chest syndrome. Once the painful crisis studyis complete, it's our intention to go into a pivotal trial --probably about 6 months after we begin the first trial. How many patients do you expectto enroll in the trial? The patient population will be around 300. What is your game plan forgoing after other applications such as stroke or heart attack? Our focus now is on the sickle cell patient. We are not planning to do any heart attack studies in patientsin 1997. We will be doing some additional preclinical studiesto show that the timing of administering RheothRx and tPa is acritical factor in efficacy. We want to complete that study beforewe do any additional work in heart attack patients. If we moveon to heart attack or stroke, or other large claims, most likely we will bring in corporate partners to assist in developmentas well as in funding. I think RheothRxpf ismore attractive than ever, but first we want to get our purifiedcompound in the clinic and focus on getting it moving toward anapproval. Corporate partners are going to want to see the purifiedcompound in the clinic. We want to clean up everything, and putour best foot forward before we begin conversations with them.So, those conversations will probably start in the fourth quarterof 1997. Do you feel Vetlife will sellabout $10 - $11 next year? I think your numbers are within range. We'renot projecting sales right now, but I am confident you will bevery pleased with what you see with Vetlife. Since October, Vetlife'ssales force and technical service people have been doing a terrificjob introducing Elanco's Compudose. We are very excitedabout adding the full line of Ivy products in 1997. It's goingto be a terrific year for Vetlife. When might we expect a publicoffering on Vetlife? Is it within the next year? It is certainly do-able within the next year. Vetlife has an attractive story with an excellent managementteam. The numbers are compelling, so it's something we look forwardto doing -- but no sooner than the second half of 1997 or possibly1998. We'll do it at the right time. Is the Cauldron division ofZynaxis similar to Proceutics? There are similarities. However, there isa location difference, and some of the services are different. We want to keep Proceutics focused on what they do best, andhave the Cauldron facility do what it does best. When we findthe right buyer for Cauldron we'll sell it and provide that cashto Vaxcel. I noticed that Zynaxis 1995cash burn was quite high. Is that being eliminated? Yes. The one piece that remains is the technologydevelopment for the oral technology. Zynaxis has already significantlyreduced its staffing and expenses. Operations are intended tobe closed down by the time of the shareholder vote. Once theCauldron division is sold and the lease assumed by the new owner,the Zynaxis burn should be eliminated. After Vaxcel has completedthis merger, is there a plan to spinout any shares to CytRx holders? It is not our intention to spinout Vaxcel sharesto CytRx shareholders. We plan to hold those shares, and use themto build the CytRx business over time. Please comment on the overallcash position and future cash burn rate of CytRx and it's subsidiaries. Number one, our cash position is well undercontrol. We will end the year with about $17 million in cash. We are projecting both Vetlife and Proceutics to be profitablein 1997. Also, we expect a much smaller loss for Vaxcel in 1997with licensing revenues. CytRx will be spending more because ofthe RheothRxpf restart. I am pleased that our consolidated burn rateis going down -- not up. In 1995 we showed an operating lossof $10 million. In 1996, we will probably show an operating lossaround $5 million. And in 1997, we're projecting an operatingloss that's around $3 million. So were not concerned about cash. And with the prospect of our subsidiaries going public,there is always the possibility of sellingsome of our subsidiary shares on the market. But it's not somethingwe are anticipating and we don't see any fund raising effortsnecessary for CytRx. You have actively been buyingCytRx shares in the market. Is there room to buy more shares? Over the past year, we have purchased over5 percent of our shares. Recently we have not been able to buybecause of this transaction. I'm authorized to buy five milliondollars worth of stock, and to date, we've bought just under twomillion. In closing, I am very comfortable moving into1997. There are many great things happening. This merger isthe best thing that could have happened to both Zynaxis and Vaxcel. The combined company will be stronger by far then either companyalone. Vetlife is going to show us what it can do in 1997. Weare all very excited about the restart of RheothRxpf. It is now a better product and it will be great to get it backinto the clinic. --------------------------------------------------------- We have made several �forward looking�statements in today's conference call. Please keep inmind all these depend on many factors that we do not control.What we plan to do is one thing and how regulatory agencies reactis sometimes another. Also there are obvious risks from trialoutcomes -- but in this business we take risks. What we planto do is manage well that which we can manage and be preparedto act decisively when necessary.

Luchese, President and CEO Good morning. For those of you who are new to CytRx,our mission is to develop and market high value human pharmaceuticalproducts. Our lead product is RheothRxpf, acompound that shows promise in a variety of vaso-occlusive disorders. We plan to begin advanced human clinical trials in sickle cellanemia patients during the first quarter of 1997. RheothRxpf is a purified version of RheothRx that we originally licensedto Burroughs Wellcome (now Glaxo Wellcome). Earlier this yearwe regained all rights to the product and have purified and improvedit. Recently, we were awarded a �composition of matter�patent on RheothRxpf which provides us longpatent protection in the market place. A lot of activity is taking place on RheothRxpf. We have met with the FDA on our proposed program. They were verysupportive and we have since sent them a development proposaland we expect them to respond in the next several weeks. We havea clinical investigator meeting planned for later this year.We have raw material being produced and will soon be manufacturingclinical supplies to have them ready to go by 1997. In additionwe are beginning a number of pre-clinical studies to support thesickle cell clinical activity as well as other future indications. ------------------------ We are excited about RheothRx and are looking forwardto beginning advanced clinical trials next year. ------------------------ Sickle cell is an attractive initial target marketfor CytRx. Its global market size has been estimated to be between$25 - $100 million. There is a very clear medical need. Sicklecell patients are subject to very painful crises. On average,patients require hospitalization about two times a year. It'sa very expensive treatment with painful crisis costing about $6,000per hospital stay and treatment cycle. It is also very damagingto the patients organ systems which is why, on average, theirlife expectancy is about 20 to 25 years shorter than otherwisehealthy people. It is a debilitating disease for which thereis no real treatment. We expect RheothRxpfto be the first treatment for the episode of the crisis itself. It is important to note that already we have oneefficacy study that has been completed with very good results.This is why we are encouraged to do additional studies in sicklecell anemia. Our future plans for RheothRxpf are to expand the clinical program beyond sickle cell and moveinto much larger indications that are much more attractive ingeneral. We would also like to partner this product on an internationalbasis. So we are excited about RheothRxpf andare looking forward to beginning advanced human clinical trialsnext year. ------------------------ It is our plan to take each subsidiary public. ------------------------ At this point I would like to talk about our subsidiaries. As you know, CytRx has a unique structure. We are a human pharmaceuticalcompany but also have three wholly-owned subsidiaries. The reasonfor these subsidiaries is that we have a great deal of technologythat didn't totally fit into our human strategy. We felt it was appropriate to bring in people thatwere experts in these areas and build companies around these technologies. Vetlife is an animal health products company, Vaxcel is a vaccinedelivery company and Proceutics is a pharmaceutical services company. I'll speak to each one separately. Vetlife's mission is toimprove the productivity of food animals for human consumption. They have a very interesting business plan in that they haveboth short and long term opportunities. Beginning in January 1997,Vetlife will be marketing a line of cattle growth implants. Theseproducts are, for the most part, already approved as Vetlife hastaken the distribution rights away from Upjohn. The cattle growthimplant market is centered on the feedlot with approximately $100million in annual sales. We estimate 1997 Vetlife sales to bein the $8 - $10 million range which will generate $1 - $2 millionin profits. So I think it's particularly interesting that wehave a company that will be showing sales and profit nextyear. Also, Vetlife has licensed CytRx technologies for animalhealth use. They have several opportunities in the area of feedefficiency for growth promotion in poultry and swine. They alsohave technology for vaccine adjuvants and anti-infective technologyfor animal health use. These are longer term opportunities. Vetlifemanagement's plan is to develop these to a point where corporatepartners will be interested, then license them in return for licensefees, milestone payments and future royalties on sales. So, Vetlifelooks like a very attractive opportunity for 1997 and beyond. It is our plan to take each subsidiary public atsome point in time. They were set up as wholly-owned subsidiarieswith the intent in mind of taking them public. And each one ofthese subsidiaries is led by management that really understandstheir business. In the case of Vetlife, Rich Shuler was the formerVice President of the Syntex animal health division. He's a veryseasoned and savvy executive. He has been in the animal healthbusiness his entire career, and we have the utmost confidencein his ability to run this business. He will also do a very greatjob in launching an IPO for this company. Vaxcel is our second subsidiary.This is a vaccine delivery company with a focused and simple businessstrategy. Vaxcel has a technology that enhances the effectivenessof vaccines. They plan to provide this technology to vaccine producersto improve their vaccines -- whether they be new or old vaccines.They are currently in a Phase I human clinical safety study whichshould be complete by year-end. This a key study because mostpotential licensing partners want to make sure that Vaxcel'sadjuvant material is safe, and so far the study is meeting expectations.They already have two option agreements, one with Medeva (a UKcompany) and Connaught. Additionally, they have a license agreementwith Corixa which is a biopharmaceutical start-up company workingon cancer vaccines. Vaxcel management is in discussions withjust about every major vaccine player, so we expect more licensesto come based on the performance of this technology. Just likeVetlife, Vaxcel will be planning an IPO and we hope that sometime in 1997 or 1998 that those IPO's will take place. Vaxcelis headed by Paul Wilson who is the former Vice President andgeneral manager of American Cyanamid's Lederle-Praxisvaccine division. Paul's business skills are complementedby Dr. Mark Newman who is one of the leading scientists in thearea of adjuvant technology. Finally, our newest subsidiary is Proceutics,which began operations this past January. Proceutics providespre-clinical pharmaceutical development services such as analyticalchemistry, chemical synthesis and formulations. These servicesare useful to large pharmaceutical companies looking to outsourceprojects during peak work periods or downsizing situations, genericcompanies planning to file ANDA's and small developmentcompanies that do not have the capital to hire the people andbuild the facilities to do the technical work required to developdrugs. Proceutics is enjoying increasing sales revenue each quarterand is now seeing a consistent level of repeat business, whichis where your measure really is. They are looking forward toa profitable 1997 with revenues in the $3 - $4 million range vs.revenues of about $2 - $2 1/2 million this year. So Proceuticsis on the right track. It is currently our intention for Proceuticsto go public sometime in 1998. When these milestones have been achieved, CytRx willenjoy having three publicly-traded subsidiaries with CytRx owninga substantial equity stake in each one. This will provide a greatdeal of flexibility in raising additional cash if needed, andalso in doing future mergers and acquisitions to build our corehuman therapeutic business. ------------------------ We have about a $2 million value being placed onour businesses and technologies which is extremely low. ------------------------ Just to give you a brief financial picture, CytRxand its subsidiaries have cash of approximately $21 million, andphysical assets of $8 million. We have no debt, so we have a netasset value of about $29 million. Compare that with our currentmarket capitalization which stands at around $31 million (7.8million shares outstanding at about $4 per share). We thereforehave about a $2 million value being placed on our businesses andtechnologies which is extremely low. As far as our operatingperformance goes, 1995 total revenues were $2.25 million, we estimate $4 - $5 million for 1996, and looking toward 1997 we are projectingaround $13 - $18 million largely due to the January 1997 launchof Vetlife's cattle implant line. Our cash burn for 1995was about $10 million. This will be reduced in 1996 to $4 - $5million and looking toward 1997 we are looking at $3 million -and possibly break even. ------------------------------------------------------------- �Q & A� SESSION Q. Please tell us more about the new and improvedRheothRx. A. RheothRxpf is a purified versionof the commercial grade of RheothRx that was used in earlier clinicaltrials. What was seen in the earlier trials was that in veryhigh doses in certain patients (over 75 years old with a historyof kidney dysfunction) there were reports of elevated levels ofcreatinine which is a marker of kidney function - indicatinga potential problem. When dosage levels were reduced, the commercialgrade RheothRx did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Thatis why Glaxo Wellcome discontinued the trials and returned fullrights to us. Our scientists analyzed the problem and found minutequantities of an impurity in the commercial grade compound. Wefelt that if we took this impurity out we could have greater dosingflexibility. We then developed chemistry methods to extract it. We are confident that purified RheothRxpf willallow us to dose at required levels without incurring this kidneyconcern seen with the commercial compound. Q. Will you develop this on your own or areyou going to look for a partner? A. Our current plan is to take RheothRxpfinto the clinic on our own and get it approved for sickle cellcrisis. We believe this is the fastest way to get it approvedin the United States. At the same time we will be talking withcorporate partners to develop and commercialize larger indicationssuch as heart attack and stroke. Our plan is to market RheothRxpfdirectly to the sickle cell community which is a very concentratedmarket. Q. What do you think the cost will be to bringthis product through the trials? A. We estimate development costs to be between $6- $8 million. I am very comfortable with the fact that we haveenough cash to do that. Our business is financially under controland our subsidiaries are no longer requiring the cash investmentthat they have in the past so we are comfortable making this investment. I also hope that as we develop RheothRxpf,we will establish corporate partner relationships that will generatelicense fees and milestone payments to offset and perhaps exceedthe development cost for the sickle cell claim. Q. In terms of clinical trials does that referto Phase II or Phase III? A. Getting a drug approved requires several phasesof human clinical trails. Phase I trials are to establish drugsafety. Phase II is for dose ranging in patients with the diseaseto determine optimal dosing. Phase III is the pivotal clinicalstudy and is what approval is based on. Given the excellent resultsof a Phase II trial concluded in 1995, our plans are to convincethe FDA to allow us to directly proceed with a Phase III pivotaltrial in 1997 which would put us on track to file an NDA sometimein 1999. We are anxious to get going on this. There is a greatdeal of data compiled on this drug, and we are pursuing an OrphanDrug indication for a disease that has no effective therapy. Weare currently planning a trial that will take about a year anda half to complete. It really depends on the final discussionswith the FDA, on how many sites are involved and on the enrollmentrate at the sites. But, if all goes according to plan, we willfinish the study in mid-1998. Then, assuming the study achieveseverything we want, we will begin preparing our NDA for submission. Q. Does the orphan drug status designation thatwas given to you by the FDA help? A. Yes, the orphan drug designation puts us in theFDA's �1-A� priority category. The FDA isrequired by law to give it a fast review which doesn't mean it'sgoing to get a fast approval. But, if your NDA is prepared properly,the data is well supported and they quickly review it -- thisshould lead to faster approval which is generally the case withorphan drugs. You also get some tax advantages that are not asimportant to us and you also get seven years market exclusivitywhich frankly we don't need because it overlaps our patents. Q. What is your confidence level after yourtalks with the FDA? A. We had one good meeting with the FDA. They werereceptive to us taking RheothRxpf back intothe clinic for sickle cell. It was a very constructive meeting,and was encouraging for me. They made some comments and suggestionsand we have just recently communicated back to them with preciselywhat we'd like to do. It will be several weeks before they respond.That's just the nature of the agency. Q. From your dialogue do you have a prettygood confidence level they will allow you to use previous data,you're not going to have to start from ground zero? A. We have no indication so far that leads us tobelieve that this is going to be treated as a new compound. Infact, that was the main purpose of the first meeting - to havea good understanding between CytRx an the FDA that this is nota new compound. One of the consultants we worked with had a greatquotation. He said �it's better, not different.� In this business, pharmaceutical companies are always purifyingtheir compounds all the way until they get to Phase III, so thiswould not be an unusual situation where you remove an impuritybefore you go into a Phase III trial. That is precisely what wehave done. We haven't changed the structure of the compound. When you characterize it, it has the same profile as the otherone except we've eliminated impurities that we've determined provideno benefit, and in fact, appear to cause a problem at very highdoses. By eliminating the impurities, we improve the compound,and make it �better, not different.� Q. What leads you to feel it is better? A. What makes it better is that it's a more purifiedcompound that we believe we can dose at higher levels withoutrunning into the same level of renal dysfunction we saw in theearlier trial. We did a study in a very carefully controlled ratmodel that took us months and months to do. We tested three groups. One was the commercial grade of RheothRx, the second was thepurified version, and the third is what we called the extract-- what we removed in the purification process. The rats in thisstudy had only about one-sixth of their normal kidney functionto begin with and then they were given five times the clinicaldose. The purpose of this study was to see how a severely compromisedkidney would react to a high dosage of RheothRx. As you can see,the study was intentionally designed to find problems. What wefound is that the commercial grade group had a very high mortalityrate and the purified group had a very low mortality rate. Sincethe extract amount is so small, the extract group was actuallygiven a �special� mixture that contained approximatelyten times the normal level of impurities. This group had aboutan 82% mortality and the feeling was that if we gave them thepure extract we would have killed all the animals within an hour. So we're very confident that we've removed the problem. Q. If all your dreams were to come true wherewould we be at this time next year? A. By this time next year I would like to see RheothRxpfwell into an acute sickle cell crisis human clinical trial. Iwould like to have initiated a study in acute chest syndrome aswell. I would like to see two excellent sales quarters from Vetlifethat will firmly establish its value to our shareholders. I wouldalso like to see two corporate deals completed by Vaxcel and Proceuticsturning a profit. Q. How about your stock buy-back program? A. We did not do a lot of buying in the first andsecond quarter. Since we have not made a disclosure, all I cantell you today is that we have clearly been more active in thethird quarter. Q. You mentioned that Vaxcel has been talkingwith many major vaccine companies. Are anynegotiations going on with CytRx or other subsidiaries? A. There are, but I can't discuss those until theyare concluded. Q. What would be the earliest that the first subsidiarycould be brought public, and how much of the subsidiary wouldyou sell? A. I'll answer the second question first. I wouldlike to limit our equity sales to no more than 20% of each company. We haven't decided which will be first. That will depend onmarket conditions and subsidiary achievements. I would like tosee one company go public around mid-1997 if the market is cooperative. I think Vaxcel or Vetlife will be the best candidates. Q. Where would you like CytRx stock to bewhen you take a subsidiary public? A. I would like CytRx with a market cap of no lessthan a $100 million which is about $13 a share. Q. What catalysts do you think are necessaryto take it there? A. I think getting RheothRxpf backinto the clinic will be key. Most people have totally discountedRheothRxpf, and, once it's back in human clinicaltrials, people will start paying a lot of attention to it. Ialso think a greater awareness of the value of our subsidiariesis another important element. Seeing substantial first quartersales by Vetlife and licensing deals by Vaxcel should get peopleto take notice and start paying attention to these as truly valuablesubsidiaries. Then, we have to do an excellent job simply communicatingour story and getting in front of people so they can fully understandit. Q. How about Protox? A. Given the emphasis we are placing on RheothRxpf,we have de-emphasized our activities in Protox. The FDA has givenus the go ahead to commence Phase I trials but at this point weare concentrating all our energy and people and financial resourceson RheothRxpf which is where the most opportunityis for our shareholders. It's a focus issue, pure and simple. It takes a lot of time and energy to move a drug through itsdevelopment. Right now, I want to focus totally on RheothRxpf.That's where we can get the biggest bang for our buck. ------------------------------------------------------------ I would like to point out that today we have madeseveral �forward looking� statements. Please keepin mind all these depend on many factors such as FDA reviews thatwe do not control. What we plan to do is one thing and how theregulatory agencies react is sometimes another. Also there arethe obvious risks from trial outcomes -- but in this businesswe take risks. What we plan to do is manage well that which wecan manage and be prepared to act decisively when necessary. So with that, I thank you for calling in.

Luchese Good morning. Over the past week we had the pleasure of making two important announcements. One was the start of Phase I clinical trials for Vaxcel�s Optivax� vaccine delivery system. The second was the signing of Vetlife�s deal with Ivy Laboratories to market cattle growth promotants. Our plan is to have a series of conference calls like this supplemented by visits to our major investors and broker networks throughout 1996. We will be including individual subsidiary presidents on these investor updates to give you the opportunity to become better acquainted with our subs and their leadership. With that said, I would like to turn this over to Rich Shuler, Vetlife�s president and CEO to review the Vetlife / Ivy agreement and respond to your questions about Vetlife. Then, I�ll be happy to answer your questions on CytRx in general. Richard Shuler (RS) Thanks, Jack. I thank all of you for your interest in joining us this morning. You may not be familiar with Vetlife -- I�ve been here about a year and a half. I came here as President and CEO to develop and commercialize technologies that were part of the CytRx family. I also came here with a vision to build a viable animal health company. Last week we took the first major step towards realizing that vision. Before I joined Vetlife, I was responsible for Syntex�s North American Animal Health Products company. We became the dominant market share leader in cattle products, particularly in growth promotants. One of the companies that I competed successfully against was a generic producer named Ivy Laboratories. I became acquainted with their owner and we built a mutual respect for each other, though I must say we really were his nemesis! Last fall, Ivy decided to end their distribution relationship with Upjohn. Their owner contacted me to see if I would be interested in joining him to grow his business. I am pleased to report that the results of my discussions with him is a 10-year agreement to market and distribute Ivy�s line of cattle growth promotant products. Vetlife�s agreement with Ivy has three significant elements. First, on January 1, 1997, we will take over Ivy�s current line of growth promotant products for the US and Canada. Second, Ivy has applications pending with the FDA for new generic growth promotant products which we will market as soon as they are approved. And third, we have rights to other technologies that Ivy will develop for the North American market. I am confident that Vetlife�s Cattle Marketing Group will be successful. Here�s why: You may be aware that since I left Syntex, they were bought by Roche who subsequently sold much of the animal health business to American Home Products. My key Syntex team members elected not to join American Home and are available and excited about joining Vetlife�s new venture. We have done this before and our template is successful. We will be beginning with a proven team that is highly respected. At Syntex, we were ranked number one in large cattle customer service in the US for five consecutive years. My team has a track record of successfully differentiating products to build market share. At Syntex we relied heavily on distributors. We built a high trust bond with them. In the US, three distributors -- all of whom are personal friends -- generate about 85% of the sales for this $100 million market. We also worked closely with the cattle producers. There has been consolidation in the beef industry, just like we�ve seen in other industries, and 25 corporate organizations now feed about 40% of the beef we eat. We just met with them all in San Antonio, and they�re pleased my team is back in this business because we have a reputation for adding valuable services that differentiate us from the others. This agreement is an excellent fit with Vetlife�s other technologies currently in development. We have a non-antibiotic growth promotant that we�re in the process of licensing out. Second, we have two other classes of compounds that we�re evaluating. One is for adjuvants to improve vaccines -- something that is desperately needed in the food animal industry. The other is for potentiators to improve the performance of anti-microbials. The Vetlife Cattle Marketing Group will provide us with the brand name and awareness that will enable us to market direct in North America should these technologies prove efficacious and safe. The bottom line is that I�m excited about having a presence in the beef market no later than January 1. We will be generating sales, profits and cash flow from the sale of established products. And, I am excited about the potential of other growth promotant products that Ivy has in development. Rich, What did you accomplish at the Cattle Show in San Antonio? RS - We wanted to establish three things. One was to let the producers know we will be back in the business, and that the services and value we established at Syntex will be there again. Second, along with Ivy, we met with the three privately owned distributors who control 85% of our target segment, so that they were aware of our strategies and would continue to be supportive of us at launch. I�m pleased that all three gave excellent feedback, and we can expect a high level of cooperation from them. The third was to conduct customer input sessions to explore and test novel differentiation strategies. When do you plan to sell your products nationwide? RS - We will sell nationwide from the start. Please give us some kind of feel of what you�d expect to do in this $100 million dollar marketplace in the first year or two. RS - We anticipate sales in the $6-$8 million dollar range with the current products that are already approved for marketing. New products, when approved, will be in a family of products that have an average selling price about three times higher than the current line. Assuming FDA approvals of these new products, these could add $4 to $6 million to our sales. Are you going to be bringing more people in-house, or are you going to do a "virtual" organization for this? RS - We plan a hybrid. We�re already lean and mean, and because of the consolidation of this industry, we don�t need a large organization. But we�ll be heavy into technical services to provide added value to our line of products. We�ve already hired one of my former tech service managers. And also, my former Global Business Unit Manager, joined me on Monday. We�re in the process now of slowly firing up so by December, we�ll have a full complement of top quality former Syntex tech services professionals, backed by a small group of operations people. We�re going to maintain a lean presence because of two things -- a heavy reliance on distributors, and a consolidating industry that doesn�t require large sales organizations to reach the growth promotant market. Will you have to carry large inventories to supply your customers? RS - These are long-dated products and our distributors are willing to carry full lot runs. It�s pretty much a year-round market. We�ll rely on the major distributors to maintain large levels of inventory and sell direct to market and to smaller distributors. Remarks by Jack J. Luchese I�d like to give you an overall recap of CytRx and where we are today. Keep in mind, when you buy CytRx shares, you�re essentially buying four distinct business units. You�re buying Vetlife, which needless to say, we�re very excited about. Rich Shuler is a first-rate, first-class executive -- and a proven leader. He is well-respected in this industry and has received a number of honors by the cattlemen. With CytRx, the second business unit you buy is Vaxcel. Vaxcel�s strategy is really developing in 1996 as they have entered Phase I human trials with their Optivax vaccine delivery system. This is the first time Optivax has been in man, and we�re excited about that. You�ll hear more about that in a couple of weeks when we plan to have a conference call with Paul Wilson, Vaxcel�s president. Also, we own Proceutics, which is a pharmaceutical development services company. This is a cash business, and we expect it to generate cash flow for CytRx. And, finally you have CytRx�s human therapeutics portfolio of which RheothRx is the most important. There�s a new story on RheothRx, that you�ll be hearing more about over the next several months. I want to also recap some important issues. After the reverse split, we now have about 7.9 million shares outstanding. We are currently selling at a market capitalization of approximately $36 million dollars. Since we have cash and fixed assets of $31 million dollars, the market is assigning a technology value of only $5 million dollars. That is incredibly low -- I think we are one of the most under-valued stocks in the market today, and I think CytRx is a great buy for 1996, and the story will develop very nicely throughout 1997. Looking ahead to 1997, we are comfortable saying that CytRx (including subsidiaries) will generate $10 million in sales from our various businesses. So we�re putting our financial house in order, and we�re building a lot of sustainable value for our shareholders. I�ll be happy to respond to your questions about CytRx I�d like to follow-up on a series of comments that were made immediately following the adverse RheothRx announcement back in October. At that time, I believe it was stated by the company that upon receipt of all of the documentation, you would review those materials and see if there was anything further that could be pursued with regard to RheothRx. What has been the progress so far? About three weeks ago, we received a copy of the 11,000 page IND document from Glaxo Wellcome. We�re poring through that as it contains a lot of good information. The next milestone is when Glaxo Wellcome files its annual report to the FDA. Once they file the annual report, they will officially transfer the IND to CytRx. That is important as CytRx is not permitted to speak directly with the FDA about RheothRx until we have control of the IND. We are looking at the potential of a purified form of RheothRx for an orphan indication sickle cell crisis. We have not made a firm decision to proceed. We plan to meet with the FDA and assess their attitude towards that possibility. Then we will make a business decision as to whether we will continue with RheothRx. I expect that decision to be made sometime in the middle of the year. Do you have any time frame for how long the Optivax Phase I study will take? This Phase I study is expected to take most of 1996. It is a dose escalating study to determine maximum tolerated doses. You start lower, and go progressively higher with different patient groups. The current protocol requires completion of each lower group before starting a higher dose group. It�s possible that could be accelerated, but I wouldn�t want to speculate on that right now. Thank you for your time and your questions. We appreciate your interest in CytRx and look forward to talking to you again in a couple of weeks.
