Proposition 187 is an initiativestatute whose provisions remain state law unless disapproved by a two-thirdsvote of the California Legislature or by another initiative. A federal judge blocked the implementation of virtually all sections of Prop.187 until at least December 14, citing "a balance of hardship that decidedlytips in favor of" continuing to provide services to unauthorized immigrants.Specifically, the judge said that the initiative may not be constitutionalbecause it does not provide due process, or a hearing before an individual isdenied benefits such as schooling or health care. The judge's order preventsCalifornia from announcing regulations implementing Prop. 187. Only thesections that impose penalties for making or using false documents were notblocked. Prop. 187--Major Provisions Prop. 187 has five major sections. First, it bars illegal aliens from thestate's public education systems from kindergarten through university, andrequires public educational institutions to begin verifying the legal status ofboth students (effective January 1, 1995) and their parents (effective January1, 1996). California educational institutions today verify the residence but not thelegal status of pupils and students. There are no tuition charges for K-12education. One of California's three higher education systems--the stateuniversity system--charges resident illegal aliens lower in-state tuition,while community colleges and UC charge them higher out-of state tuition. Second, all providers of publicly-paid, non-emergency health care services mustverify the legal status of persons seeking services in order to be reimbursedby the state of CA. Third, Prop. 187 requires that all persons seeking cash assistance and otherbenefits verify their legal status before receiving benefits. Fourth, allservice providers are required to report suspected illegal aliens toCalifornia's Attorney General and to the INS, and police must determine thelegal status of persons arrested. Fifth, the making and use of false documentsis now a state felony. Prop. 187 is a law whose sections can be implemented individually. On November9, Governor Wilson ordered that health services for prenatal care be stopped assoon as possible, and that no more unauthorized aliens be enrolled instate-reimbursed long-term health care programs (nursing home care). The denial of public education to illegal alien children is likely to be themost controversial section of Prop. 187 to be resolved by the courts. The 1982Plyler v Doe US Supreme Court decision declared that the equal protectionclause of the 14th amendment protects everyone within a state's borders,regardless of immigration status. However, the court split 5-4 on whether"equal protection" for illegal alien children included the same educationavailable to US-citizen children. The majority emphasized that education isespecially needed to prevent the development of an underclass; the minorityargued that the court was making social policy. Public education is the most costly service used by illegal aliens inCalifornia--providing education for the estimated 300,000 to 400,000 illegalalien children in California schools accounts for about half of the estimated$3 billion annual costs of services provided to the estimated 1.7 millionillegal aliens in California [California's state budget is $40 billionannually]. Several school districts joined in suits seeking to have thedenial-of-public-education part of Prop. 187 declared unconstitutional. Thisin turn prompted protests and, in a few instances, threats to initiate recallcampaigns against public officials who vote to spend taxpayer dollars to fightProp. 187. In Los Angeles, where 51 percent of the voters supported Prop. 187,there have been threats of recall campaigns against school board members whovoted to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn Prop. 187's public schoolprovisions. The State Board of Education on November 21 ordered thepreparation of emergency regulations to implement Prop. 187 in the event thatthe courts lift the injunction that currently prevents its implementation. There are several what-next scenarios. Governor Wilson and some Prop. 187supporters argue that unauthorized aliens, unable to receive public services,will leave California. Prop. 187 supporters hope to sponsor similar measuresin other states--Arizona, Texas and Florida, setting off, in a Prop. 13-likefashion, a national effort to restrict the access of unauthorized immigrants topublic services. Others predict that Prop. 187, plus stepped up labor law and borderenforcement, will primarily discourage additional unauthorized immigrants fromentering California. They caution that Prop. 187 should be seen primarily asan eligibility measure, not as a border management or labor market measure. Finally, there is the possibility that Prop. 187 will be largely a symbolicmeasure, as was Prop. 63. In 1986, three-fourths of California voters voted tomake English the state's "official language." Prop. 63 has had little effecton the manner in which public affairs are conducted in California. Ifimmigration slows and California's economy recovers, there are some who predictthat Prop. 187 may be only symbolic. Joan Biskupic, "Courts Walk Fine Line on Immigration Issues Raised byCalifornia Law," A21; Laura Mecoy, "Anti-187 lawsuits in LA bring recallthreats," Sacramento Bee, November 20, 1994, A1; Sally Buzbee, "Many OutsideCA like anti-immigration law," Associated Press, November 28, 1994. Prop. 187--The Campaign The Prop. 187 initiative began with a huge lead in opinion polls--it had a37-point lead in July, and led among likely voters by 62 to 29 percent inmid-September, 1994. However, by early November, polls indicated that as manylikely voters opposed as supported SOS. Most politicians and opinion leadersargued that voters should reject Prop. 187 because it was too blunt aninstrument to deal with the complex issue of illegal immigration. In the week before the election, Governor Wilson, who was re-elected with 55percent of the vote, asserted that if SOS becomes law, he would require stateand local government employees to report suspected illegal aliens as requiredby SOS. California Attorney General Dan Lungren, who was also re-elected,promised to develop emergency regulations to implement the initiativeimmediately, but noted that there was no penalty for persons who do not reportsuspected illegal aliens. Wilson's campaign bought the only pro-SOS TV ads that were aired, while theanti-SOS campaign used contributions from doctors and teachers to run anti-SOSTV ads. Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown ran out of money for TV ads atthe end of her campaign, and toured high school and college campuses, urgingstudents to work to defeat SOS. President Clinton argued against SOS. According to Clinton, "it is not wrongfor you [Californians] to want to reduce illegal immigration. And it is notwrong for you to say it is a national responsibility." Clinton said that "thefederal government should do more to help to stop illegal immigration and tohelp California bear the costs of the illegal immigrants who are there," buturged California voters to reject SOS and allow the federal government to "keepworking on what we're doing -- stiffening the border patrol, stiffening thesanctions on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, stiffening ourability to get illegal immigrants out of the workforce, increasing our abilityto deport people who have committed crimes who are illegal immigrants."Clinton promised that the federal government would do more to "help California,and other states, deal with incarceration, health and education costs ofillegal immigration." Some observers believe that Clinton may have reduced his chances to carryCalifornia in the 1996 presidential race by campaigning so vigorously againstProp. 187. The "white male backlash" against illegal immigration may, theseobservers say, also manifest itself in attacks on affirmative action andsimilar programs. A "California Civil Rights Initiative" that would eliminatestate affirmative action programs is already being prepared. The campaign's final days were marked by large numbers of Hispanic studentswalking out of high school to protest SOS . In the opinion of many Prop. 187opponents, these protests were counterproductive--the Mexican flags they wavedreportedly convinced many undecided voters to support Prop. 187. The closing days of the campaign were also marked by charges of hypocrisybetween US Senate candidates Feinstein and Huffington. Both took tough standsagainst illegal immigration, and both charged that the other employed anillegal alien maid. Feinstein hired an illegal housekeeper in the early1980s--before it was unlawful for a US employer to knowingly hire illegal alienworkers--and Huffington hired an illegal alien nanny in the late 1980s andearly 1990s, when such hiring was unlawful. Some Huffington supporters allegedthat illegal aliens voted for Feinstein, who was narrowly re-elected. Prop. 187--The Vote A majority of voters in 50 of California's 58 counties supported Prop. 187--theexceptions were eight San Francisco Bay Area counties. According to exit polls,64 percent of whites, 57 percent of Asian-Americans, 56 percent ofAfrican-Americans, and 31 percent of Latinos voted in favor of Prop. 187. Ofthose voting in favor of Prop. 187, 78 percent agreed that "it sends a messagethat needs to be sent" and 51 percent agreed that "it will force the federalgovernment to face the issue." Some 40 percent of voters in one exit poll saidthat they voted primarily because Prop. 187 was on the ballot. Of those voting against the measure, 60 percent agreed with the statement thatit "doesn't solve the problem" and about 40 percent agreed that "it wouldthrow children out of school" and that "it is racist/anti-Latino." California's population is 57 percent white, 25 percent Latino, nine percentAsian-American, and seven percent African American. However, voters onNovember 8 were 75 to 80 percent white, eight to 10 percent Latino, four tofive percent Asian-American, and 10 percent African-American. In Texas, only 35 percent of that state's 1.3 million registered Hispanicvoters cast ballots. Hispanic voters supported Democratic gubernatorial candidate AnnRichards three to one over Republican George W. Bush. A study by RhinoInformation Systems concluded that the 1994 election will problably be the lasttime Democrats can count on the Hispanic vote, as Hispanics are becoming moreconservative and more Republican. Hispanic households with incomes over$27,000 per year, for example, are more likely to vote Republican thanDemocratic. Exit polls in Texas found that Hispanics favor increased borderpatrols to halt illegal immigration, but they oppose Prop. 187-like measures. After Prop. 187-- Reactions Prop. 187 was based on the theory that changes in immigrant policy would affectimmigration policy--denying public services to unauthorized aliens woulddiscourage them from coming to the US. Governor Wilson asserted that, sincepublic services were a magnet for at least some unauthorized aliens, denyingthem services would encourage them to leave California. There were conflicting reports after November 8 about the behavior ofunauthorized immigrants. Some hospitals and clinics reported sharply fewerpatients, and there were scattered reports that some of the estimated 300,000to 400,000 unauthorized children in California schools were not going toschool. However, most health facilities and schools reported business as usual. In one widely-reported case, illegal alien parents reportedly did not seekmedical care for their 12-year old son for fear of deportation to Mexico. Hesubsequently died. Many service providers printed up materials in theirclients' language explaining that nothing had changed, and that patients andstudents would not be asked to prove legal status before they receivedservices. There were also numerous workshops on campuses, in churches, and in ethniccommunities in which speakers decried the passage of Prop. 187 and urgedopponents to get politically involved. Some speakers denounced the "racism"that, they asserted, motivated the vote, and some asserted that unauthorizedimmigrants report "feeling hatred" in the streets. Activists in several other states threatened to boycott California inretaliation for the approval of Prop. 187. Denver's mayor urged city residentsto boycott California, and the 110,000 member League of United Latin AmericanCitizens said that most of its December conference would be devoted to planninga California boycott. Several other Hispanic organizations announced that theywould not hold conventions in California, and some Hispanic leaders urged aboycott of Disneyland to send a signal of their dissatisfaction with theCalifornia vote. Denying public services to unauthorized aliens may not be easy because manyCalifornia households include persons with different legal statuses. Inso-called "mixed families," family members include US citizens, legalimmigrants, and unauthorized persons. Some fear that, if a US citizen or legalimmigrant seeks services to which they are entitled, they may expose anunauthorized family member to immigration authorities. To prevent suchdetection, many public employees pledged not to comply with Prop. 187'sverification requirements, which have not yet gone into effect. Prominent Republicans scrapped over immigration. Former cabinet secretariesBill Bennett and Jack Kemp attacked California Governor Wilson for supportingProp. 187. They argued that immigrants are "natural Republicans" who supportlow taxes and family values, and that Wilson risks turning the Republican partyinto a party of protectionism and xenophobia. According to Bennett, "itsassimilation, stupid"--meaning that the major problem is not the number or typeof immigrant entering the US. Instead, Bennett argues that fears thatnewcomers will not integrate into American society result from "too many"programs such as bilingual education that, he argues, promotesmulticulturalism. Governor Wilson responded that the Republicans should hew to a law and orderline, and emphasize the sharp distinction between legal and illegal immigrants.According to Wilson, the U.S. Border Patrol has a "Mission Impossible" tasktrying to keep people from entering the US illegally, but the federalgovernment guarantees services and benefits "to everyone who succeeds inevading the Border Patrol." Incoming House of Representatives Speaker Gingrich assured Wilson that hebelieves the federal government should either fully reimburse states for thecosts they incur to provide services to illegal aliens, or eliminate therequirement that the states provide services to them. The conservative magazine National Review weighed in on the side of Wilson,asserting that the economic benefits of immigration are small, and thatimmigration threatens national identity because it promotes multiculturalismand the welfare state.

"Hispanic Vote Becoming MoreConservative, Study Finds," Houston Post, November 19, 1994. After Prop. 187--Labor Law Enforcement In campaigning against SOS, the Clinton Administration asserted that policyinitiatives already underway would prove more effective at curbing illegalimmigration. For example, on November 2, Labor Secretary Robert Reich assertedthat a Department of Labor crackdown against the employers of illegal alienswould curb illegal immigration by denying them jobs. Reich announced that a Georgia onion grower and the farm labor contractor thatbrought immigrant workers to his farm have been assessed a penalty of $1.2million, including $675,000 in back wages, for paying farmworkers less than theminimum wage and violating other farm labor protection laws. According toReich, if US employers are unable to pay less than minimum wages, US workersare more likely to be attracted to jobs now filled by illegal aliens. According to Reich, employers of illegal aliens also violate other laws, sothat penalizing employers who hire illegal aliens in order to pay below minimumwages will help to curb illegal immigration. In a sweep of 44 southernCalifornia garment shops, 41, or 95 percent, were found to be violating federallabor laws, and 40 percent of the workers in these shops were illegal aliens.In 1993, DOL ordered employers to pay $3.1 million to underpaid workers, up 30percent from 1992. Labor law enforcement has traditionally depended on complaints, because it istoo expensive to randomly check on the six million employers in the US and the750,000 employers in California. Some opponents of Prop. 187 argue that,instead of putting more resources into verifying the legal status of applicantsfor public services, we should put more effort into enforcing labor laws--ifemployers could not "exploit" illegal alien workers, this argument runs,illegal aliens would be less likely to be hired and thus less likely to come tothe US.

RobertScheer, "Instead of 187: Enforcement of Labor Laws," Los Angeles Times,November 20, 1994. After Prop. 187--Hispanic Political Activism Hispanics are about 28 percent of California's 32 million people, but they arejust 15 percent of the state's eligible voters, and they cast only eight tonine percent of the November 8 ballots. Many are too young to vote, manyadults are not US citizens, and many Hispanic US citizens do not vote. About 2.7 million illegal aliens were legalized in 1987-88 and, after a periodof temporary residence, most became legal immigrants after October 1988. Theseimmigrants became eligible to become US citizens in October 1993. As a resultof the Prop. 187 campaign, many school districts that offer citizenship classesexpect enrollment to jump--in the case of the Los Angeles School District, froman average 500 to 25,000 by January 1995. About 90,000 immigrants became UScitizens in Los Angeles in 1994, double the 1993 level--315,000 aliens becamenaturalized US citizens in 1993. Hispanic high school and college students were especially active in opposingSOS, walking out of class frequently in late October and early November.Several commentators predicted that the activism born of opposition to SOSwould be a defining moment for Hispanics, turning them into a political forcein the same way that the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s encouraged Blacksto participate in the political process. After Prop. 187--US-Mexican Relations Many commentators were surprised by the active opposition of the Mexicangovernment to Prop. 187 , and the extensive coverage of the campaign for andagainst Prop. 187 in the Mexican media. In his final state-of-the-nationaddress, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asserted that "Mexicoaffirms rejection of this xenophobic campaign, and will continue to act indefense of the labor and human rights of our migrant workers," although heacknowledged that Mexico could not hope to use economic sanctions against theUS or California to protest the approval of Prop. 187. Ernesto Zedillo, who becomes Mexico's President on December 1, asserted duringhis November trip to Washington, DC that Mexico "cannot object to legitimateenforcement of US laws," but Mexico objects to "enforcement [that] might leadto deprivation or violation of basic human rights.... [including] education andhealth care." The Mexican government promised to contribute attorneys andfunds to fight Proposition 187 in US courts. A week after SOS was enacted, President Salinas called on the US to discuss abilateral agreement that would permit Mexicans to work legally in the US undera guestworker program. According to Salinas, the movement of Mexican workers tothe US "is inevitable, and it is better to order and regulate it than toconfront it with administrative measures that are not going to stop it becausethe force of the economies is greater." Governor Wilson, in a widely reportedNovember 18 speech to the Heritage Foundation, announced his support for aprogram to import Mexican guestworkers. Knowledgeable US observers are skeptical, doubting that the ZedilloAdministration will make the enactment of what would be a controversialguestworker program a top priority. Indeed, some advise the Mexican governmentthat any guestworker proposal in the current US political climate could becounterproductive. The Mexican government does not want to have the US closethe safety valve on which several million of its citizens depend. Mexico seesno significant lessening of emigration pressures during the 1990s. The scenario for Mexico requesting and the US negotiating a guestworker programin 1995 runs something like this. Labor shortages develop, perhaps in the May1995 Oregon strawberry harvest. The INS meanwhile, concludes that OperationGatekeeper has succeeded in reducing the influx of illegal aliens, anddiscusses ways to make legal border crossings easier. US employers argue thatthe current H-2 programs under which foreign workers may be imported to the USin the event of labor shortages is too inflexible, and Mexico asks for abilateral program that recognizes its proximity and the tradition of USemployers hiring Mexican workers. In such a scenario, the discussion could very quickly shift from whether thereshould be a guestworker program with Mexico to what kind of program. GivenProp. 187, it is already clear that any guestworkers would have little accessto US public services while here, and that a significant portion of their wagesare likely to be withheld to encourage their return. Several newspapers have suggested that the guestworker idea proposed by Salinaswould be the best way to engage in "immigration damage control." TheSacramento Bee, for example, editorialized on November 16, 1994 that aguestworker program could protect Mexican workers who are temporarily in the USand prove that California welcomes foreign workers who "play by the rules." A few days before the California election, protesters vandalized a McDonalds'restaurant in Mexico City to protest the passage of Prop. 187. Californiaexports goods and services worth about $7 billion annually to Mexico, andseveral Mexicans urged a boycott of Disneyland to "send a message" toCalifornia. Some businessmen fear that Mexico may shun California firms whenit requests bids for projects to upgrade Mexico's infrastructure. Mexicans continue to be apprehended attempting entry into the US, about 700 pernight in San Diego. Deputy Foreign Minister Rozenthal predicted that, as NorthAmerica integrates economically under NAFTA, "immigration is going to be theNo. 1 issue between the US and Mexico for the next several years." Mexico's economy is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 1994, and US-Mexicotrade is booming, up about 20 percent in 1994. US airlines in 1993 flew morepassengers to Latin America--15.8 million--than to Europe--15.6 million--oracross the Pacific--13.6 million. Between January and October 1994, Mexico deported 60,000 illegal aliens whoentered the country through its southern border. Immigration is likely to be a central issue during December's Summit of theAmericas in Miami. Leaders of several Central American countries are expectedto tell President Clinton that their economies must grow faster in order tostem the flow of illegal immigrants to the north. Central American leadershave begun an intensive lobbying effort to prevent the return of their citizensafter the passage of Prop. 187 and the threat of not renewing temporaryprotected status for El Salvadorans(see related story on El Salvador).

Most observersexpect that immigration legislation will be enacted in 1995, so thatpoliticians running for re-election in 1996 can say that they "did something"about immigration. Most predications are that new efforts will be made toreduce illegal immigration, and that more restrictions will be placed on theavailability of social services to legal and illegal immigrants. Immigration Proposals There were numerous immigration proposals introduced in Congress in 1993, butDemocrats reportedly fearful that "extreme" measures might be approvedallegedly failed to hold hearings or permit votes on them. Among the proposalsbeing discussed are Governor Wilson's call to either eliminate or provide fundsfor federal requirements that services be provided to illegal aliens, morefunds for the Border Patrol, and speedier deportations of especially criminalaliens. There may also be a battle over the number of legal immigrants admitted to theUS. IMMACT in 1990 raised the number of legal immigrants expected annuallyfrom about 500,000 to 800,000. Senator Simpson (R-WY) has introducedlegislation to reduce the number of legal entries, and FAIR has called for a"moratorium" on legal immigration. When Congress reconvenes in January, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) andSenator Alan Simpson (R-WY) are expected to chair the immigrationsubcommittees. Both are expected to introduce legislation aimed at reducingillegal immigration. Welfare Proposals House Republicans on November 21 introduced a proposal to consolidate a numberof federal social service program and cap spending on such programs, so thatthose eligible may not get services if funds run out. Three of the majorprograms to be consolidated are Food Stamps, which spent $24 billion to assist27.3 million people in 1993, WIC, which spent $3.1 billion to assist 6.2million people, and school lunch programs, which spent $4.5 billion to providelunches for 25 million pupils every day. Republicans are also proposing changes in the Aid to Families with DependentChildren (AFDC) program, which denies benefits to unauthorized aliens, but nottheir US-born and thus US-citizen children. About five millionhouseholds--most headed by single mothers--received about $14 billion infederal and $12 billion in state funds in 1994. The Republican proposal, known as the Personal Responsibility Act, would alsodeny most federally-funded assistance to illegal aliens, and introduce newrestrictions on the access of legal aliens to social services. Illegal alienswould be barred from 60 federal programs--most health programs, includingmigrant health center services, and from public housing, job training, andhomeless service programs. Aliens would continue to be eligible for emergency health services regardlessof their legal status, and refugees would continue to be eligible for federalservice programs. However, legal immigrants would in many cases be ineligiblefor services for at least five years after their entry into the US. Like many other federal assistance programs, spending on and participation inthe Food Stamp program exploded over the past two decades--in 1973, $2 billionwas spent to assist 12 million people. About 69 percent of those believedeligible for Food Stamps in 1992 participated--many of the elderly and workingpoor who are eligible do not apply for Food Stamps. To encourage eligible poorpersons to apply for Food Stamps, USDA, which administers the program, has madegrants to community organizations so that they can help people apply. Food Stamps are government coupons that are used like cash to buy groceries.Individuals and families whose monthly incomes are below the povertyline--about $1,600 for a family of four, or $800 for an individual, apply atlocal welfare offices. Applications are 10 to 40 pages long, depending on thestate and, after approval, coupons worth $1, $5, or $10 are distributed formost types of food and drink, including basic foods as well as soft drinks andcandy, but not alcohol or cigarettes. Applicants are fingerprinted, issued anidentification card, and required to file monthly reports on their incomes andassets--having a car worth $4,550 or more disqualifies a person for FoodStamps. Over half of the recipients on whose behalf coupons are issued are children,and another seven percent were persons 60 and older. Food Stamps worth, onaverage, $68 per person per month, or $170 per household, accounted forone-fourth of a typical recipient's income. Most recipients receive Food Stamps for about seven months, but many reapplywithin one year. Some believe that the sharp drop in earnings for high-schooldropouts has contributed to the increased usage of Food Stamps--the realearnings of male high-school dropouts fell from $22,858 in 1967 to $14,439 in1989. Others emphasize the rise in female-headed households. Robert Pear, "GOP Proposal would Overhaul Welfare System," New York Times,November 22, 1994, A1.

The US BorderPatrol has assigned 200 additional agents to guard the 14 miles of US-Mexicoborder south of San Diego, establishing three lines of agents to make it moredifficult for aliens seeking to enter the US illegally to avoid capture. But Gatekeeper had two other side effects--more aliens attempted to enter theUS illegally further east, and more aliens attempted entry with falsedocuments. Apprehensions in inland sectors, such as Brown Field, rose 33percent to 200 daily, and there was almost a 100-percent increase in the numberof aliens attempting to use false documents and enter through the legal port ofentry. After illegal aliens are apprehended, they are fingerprinted and photographed,held for a few hours, and then returned to Mexico. Solo males, the majority ofthose apprehended, are often taken 50 to 100 miles east of San Diego to make itharder for them to return to Tijuana and attempt re-entry. In mid-November, the INS was apprehending about 700 aliens daily, down about 30percent from earlier levels. The recidivist rate--the percentage of aliens whohad been apprehended previously--increased significantly, from less than 10percent in early October to 20 to 30 percent by the end of November. In orderto assess the effectiveness of Gatekeeper, the INS took 200 agents from theborder and re-opened the San Clemente checkpoint, which is 65 miles north ofthe Mexican border. As apprehensions drop in El Paso, Texas and San Diego, more aliens areattempting entry in other areas, especially Arizona, ''California's side door,"in the words of US Attorney General Reno. The Border Patrol plans to launchOperation Safeguard in Arizona, building fences and sending more agents toapprehend aliens attempting entry. In another article critical of the INS, a New York Times reporter took a daycruise from Fort Lauderdale to Bermuda to demonstrate how easy it is forillegal aliens to slip into the US. The INS reportedly knows that such cruisesare being used to smuggle aliens and drugs into the US, but does not change itsinspection procedures for fear that cruise operations would be impeded.

The intent was to discourage Cubans and Haitiansfrom arriving in southern Florida to request asylum. Most of the Haitians by mid-November had returned to Haiti, but 30,000 Cubansremain in Guantanamo. Some want to return to Cuba, but US lawyers in Floridahave sued the federal government to prevent their return until lawyers have anopportunity to advise them of their rights. On November 3, a federal Court ofAppeals overturned a lower court's injunction and allowed the US to beginreturning to Cuba some of the 24,000 Cubans at the US Naval Base in GuantanamoBay. Another 8,000 Cubans are being detained in Panama. In defiance of the ban on coming directly from Guantanamo to the US, a federalcourt in October 1994 permitted unaccompanied children under 18 and familieswith such children to be brought from Guantanamo to the US. On November 15,the administration announced that it was likely to allow the 8,000 Cubans inGuantanamo with children to come directly to the US rather than continue tofight against the judge's order, citing the education needs of the children.Cubans are eligible for 25,000 permanent immigrant visas in FY95; theadditional slots for children may raise the total to 30,000. On November 22, 1994, a federal judge applied this same reasoning to Haitianchildren in Guantanamo, ordering that the 231 unaccompanied Haitian childrenunder 18 in Guantanamo be brought to the US for humanitarian reasons. Thejudge also ruled that legal counsel must be provided to all refugees whorequest it in writing, and the names of all the Haitians still held inGuantanamo must be given to refugee advocates.

The Clinton Administration is considering allowing Temporary Protected Statusto expire for the 187,000 El Salvadorans who left the country for the US duringits 1980s civil war. The TPS status of the Salvadorans was established inIMMACT in 1990, and extended several times since then. It is scheduled toexpire on December 31, 1994. The Salvadoran government and US activists are pressuring the ClintonAdministration to extend TPS again. Experts believe that the passage of Prop.187 may influence the Clinton Administration's decision on another extension. There may be as many as 400,000 Salvadorans in the Los Angeles area, and 1million Salvadorans in the US. Many would not be affected by the expiration ofTPS. Salvadorans in the US remit $1 billion annually to El Salvador, thecountry's number one source of foreign exchange. If TPS is not extended, some Salvadorans are expected to return voluntarily,while others are expected to apply for political asylum. There is a backlog of500,000 political asylum cases, which means that Salvadorans requesting asylumwould probably be given permission to work throughout the application process,which could take several years. Some Salvadorans may apply for permanentresidence status if they have been in the US for seven years and theirdeportation would cause severe hardship to them or to a family member who is apermanent resident or an American citizen.

CanadaReduces Immigration Canada announced on November 1 that it will reduce legal immigration from250,000 in 1994 to between 190,000 and 215,000 from 1995 to 2000. Thisreduction broke a promise made in the 1993 campaign to maintain immigration atone percent of the population, which would mean 290,000 immigrants annually.The impetus behind the immigration policy changes is an effort by thegovernment to encourage immigrants "who (have) the skills and qualities toestablish themselves quickly... While limiting the number of immigrants thatare likely to depend upon government support." Under the new plan, 55 percent of all immigrants will be admitted in economiccategories, and 44 percent in family categories, and knowledge of English orFrench will play a greater role in immigrant selection. The stress on languageskills reportedly reflects governmental concern over the costs of teaching the44 percent of all immigrants who do not speak English or French. Canada is also considering requiring persons who sponsor immigrants to post abond or guarantee that the immigrants will not need public assistance aftertheir arrival. About one in seven immigrants admitted under the familycategories is on welfare, at an annual cost of C$ 700 million. Under theprevious rules, immediate relatives of legal residents gained automaticentrance. The new regulations require that these relatives apply on their ownto gain legal status in Canada--thereby reducing the number of immigrantsadmitted under the family classification. Canada also suspended its investor-immigrant program" under which persons whoinvest at least C$ 250,000 in Canada for five years can become immigrants whilereported abuses--investors withdrawing their money as soon as they receiveimmigrant status--are investigated. Canada has recently increased immigration levels sharply, from 84,300 in 1985to 245,800 in 1993. In a 1993 poll, 47 percent of the respondents thought thatCanada was accepting too many immigrants, and one-third agreed with thestatement that immigrants take "too many" jobs away from Canadians. The ReformParty has called for no more than 150,000 immigrants annually. Members of Vancouver's Chinese community charge that the new immigration policyis unfair. Their concern is primarily with the new asylum/refugeeguidelines--claimants are required to have applied for status and resided inCanada for a minimum of three years, plus present considerable documentation. Currently, 4,000 Chinese have applied for refugee status in Canada-- as many as2,800 may be sent home under the new policy. The chairman of the MainlandChina Refugee Organization in Vancouver reports that of the 4,000, 92 percenthave found jobs and less than five percent receive public assistance, contraryto the common public perception that Chinese refugees place a burden onCanada's social services. The Canadian immigration policy changes were reported extensively in Asia.Hong Kong is the leading country of origin, accounting for 10 to 15 percent ofall Canadian immigrants, followed by India and Taiwan.

According to the INS, Chinese from Fujian in southeast China areflown with many intermediate stops to the Dominican Republic, taken by smallboat across the 100 mile Mona Passage to Puerto Rico, and then flown to NewYork City on domestic or internal US flights. The smuggling of Chinese is qualitatively different from the more commonsmuggling of Mexican aliens into the US. The Chinese are smuggled in groups ofup to 300, and they pay $20,000 to $30,000 each, making each "load" worth up to$1 million. Mexicans, by contrast, are more often smuggled in vans that holdup to 20 people and, at $300 per alien, a van "load" can be worth $6,000. In1993, about 2,500 Chinese were apprehended trying to enter the US illegally. At an International Organization for Migration conference in Geneva this month,70 nations discussed alien smuggling. An INS associate commissioner for theINS reported that cooperation between China and the US in tracking smugglinggangs has meant that since June, not one ship has been detected trying tosmuggle Chinese immigrants to the US.

Almost all--97 percent--lived in theformer West Germany, and about two million were refugees and asylum seekers. About 22 percent of these foreigners are from other EU member nations, 27percent are Turks, and 14 percent are from the ex-Yugoslavia. About 13 percentof the 700,000 births in Germany in 1993 were to foreigners; the children takethe nationality of their parents. Chancellor Kohl's government, which was re-elected on November 15 with one voteto spare, announced a nine-point program to guide the country during the nextfour years. The program was worked out with coalition-member FDP (FreeDemocratic Party). A number of items were shelved during the talks to avoidcontroversy, including dual citizenship for adult foreigners. The program didpledge to work for a new "children's nationality" with full citizenship rightsfor children born in Germany of at least one foreign parent who have lived inGermany for at least 10 years. The head of the Federal Office for Foreigners' Issues, CorneliaSchmalz-Jacobsen, wants children of foreigners born in Germany to have dualcitizenship from birth to age 18, at which time they could choose theirnationality. Schmalz-Jacobsen said that Kohl's proposals for children'snationality would be "impossible to administer," because of the difficulty ofdetermining how long a person had lived in Germany. Germans also elected the first Parliament member of Turkish origin. CemOezdemir, 28, is a social worker and a member of the Green Party born ofTurkish parents in Germany, and naturalized as a German citizen in 1984. Hisparents immigrated to Germany in the 1960s. Oezedemir has said that he willcampaign for the liberalization of Germany's naturalization laws, theintroduction of dual citizenship, and beefed up anti-discrimination laws.

In most European countries, fewer than 10 percent of thoseseeking asylum are recognized as refugees, versus about 20 percent in the US. In a profile of a Bosnian family that was fortunate enough to have relativessettled in Switzerland, the wife and children got safe haven there, but thehusband arrived in the UK, where the British refused to permit the family tounite. The family eventually reunited in Switzerland, where they live ingovernment-supplied housing and have temporary visas. In Britain, about 20 Bosnians secured Croatian passports in order to flee thewar. Though Bosnian by birth, the British Home Office has told them that sincethey hold Croatian passports, they must return to that country. Last year, theCroatian government was providing passports to anyone who could prove that theywere Christian, and many Bosnians obtained Croatian passports to escape thecivil war. There are an estimated 8,000 people from the former Yugoslavia in Britain, and370 of their applications for political asylum have been processed. Fivepersons were awarded refugee status and 255 denied. The rest have been given ayear's leave to remain in Britain. With Bosnia likely to be carved into a mosaic of fiefdoms separated byethnicity and religion, many of the Bosnians currently "tolerated" in WesternEurope will find their homes in "hostile" territory. They will then face thechoice of continuing to live--not always welcomed--in Western Europe, orreturning to perhaps new areas within their former countries to rebuild. The number of refugees worldwide rose from eight million in 1980 to 23 millionin 1993--33 percent in Africa, 26 percent in Europe, 25 percent in Asia, 11percent in the former USSR, and eight percent in North America.

According to one report, there are two million Chineseimmigrants in Russia's Far East, and many have started businesses. OtherRussians dispute the number of illegal Chinese immigrants--putting it at lessthan 50,000--but all acknowledged that Chinese immigration is a problem that islikely to grow. There is some discussion of a Russian guestworker program forChinese workers. Russian General Andrei Nikolayev believes unless there are additional measuresto control the borders, the number of Chinese citizens in Russia will exceedthree million in the next four to five years. According to the Russian Federal Migration Service, there are over two millionmigrants in Russia. The United Nations office in Moscow has registered 70,000asylum seekers from outside the former Soviet Union. The FMS predicts that anestimated two to three million of the 25 million ethnic Russians living outsideRussia will return in the next two years. The head of FMS's external migration department said that Russia's honoring ofthe Geneva Convention has turned the country into a "holding pen" for refugeesfrom around the world. Many enter illegally, and hope to use Russia as astepping-stone to the West, but tightened border controls in western Europehave left potential refugees stranded in Russia. Refugees in Russia receive little assistance from the UNHCR or FMS. The claimsof asylum seekers have not been processed, leaving them without official papersand the right to work. Their lack of papers also limits their access tohousing, schooling, and medical care. British Broadcasting Corporation, November 2, 1994.

Education Minister Bayrou announced at thestart of the 1994-95 school year that "ostentatious" religious symbols would bebanned from French schools. There are between 150,000 to 250,000 Muslim girlsin French schools. At the start of the school year, about 2,000 were wearingheadscarves, compared to only 600 now. In a related story, Copenhagen officials apologized to a 16-year old Muslimgirl who was barred from working at a social center because she wore an Islamicheadscarf. As part of their apology, city officials offered her a job at CityHall. There is no ban on religious headgear in schools or workplaces inDenmark. Moslems account for 4 percent of the Danish population. "French schools bar 31 Muslim girls with scarves," International HeraldTribune, November 10, 1994.

In the year ending June 1,1994, the number of foreign workers hired directly by Japanese manufacturersfell, but the number of manufacturers hiring foreign workers increased 10-fold,from 1,300 to 13,000. The number of foreign workers hired in construction,transport, and services rose. Based on a survey of 14,200 companies with 130,000 foreign workers--of whom 28percent were hired through labor contractors--the ministry reported that thenumber of foreign workers employed legally in manufacturing fell by sevenpercent between June, 1993 and June, 1994. The number of foreign workers hiredby construction firms rose by 17 percent, by transport firms 10 percent, and byservice firms four percent. Large companies shed foreign workers, while small firms added foreign workers.In corporations with more than 1,000 employees, the number of foreign workersdropped 24, but the number of foreign workers rose by 18 percent at companieswith five to 29 employees. Of the 130,000 foreign workers reported by these employers, 60 percent wereCentral and South Americans, many of whom were of Japanese descent. Another 18percent each were East Asians and North Americans. Chinese living illegally in Japan have apparently become sophisticated forgersof the immigration stamps needed for legal ID cards. For 20,000 to 60,000 yen(US$ 200 to $600), false ID cards can be purchased. It is common for forgersto stamp on the alien's tourist visa "Zairyu Kikan Shinseichu" (extension underapplication), which is plausible given the backlog at Japan's ImmigrationBureau. . There is also a lively business of "renting" valid passports, on which picturesare changed. Illegal "boat people" from China's Fujian province who arrivewithout papers are believed to be the main buyers of false documents. Police arrested 13 Peruvians in northern Japan in November for overstayingtheir tourist visas by one-half to almost three years. All were employed byJapanese firms that manufacture electrical equipment. In a new book, Japan's 'Guestworkers:' Issues and Public Policies, published bythe University of Tokyo Press, author Haruo Shimada says that Japan shouldaccept the need for foreign workers and enact labor laws that better protectthem. According to Shimada, " large numbers of foreign workers and theirfamilies are already in the country and have begun to settle on a permanentbasis." Shimada reports that in 1992, 110,000 foreigners entered Japan to work, andthat an average 85,000 were in the Japanese workforce. In addition, there were43,000 trainees, plus 27,000 language students who are allowed to work parttime. About 149,000 Latin Americans of Japanese descent entered Japan. Thereare also about 300,000 foreigners who entered Japan as tourists, overstayedtheir visas, and went to work. Wallace Gagne, "Foreign bodies in the works," The Daily Yomiuri, November 20,1994.

Filipino President Fidel Ramos protested the round up, saying theFilipinos were not criminals. The Philippines also protested the roundup of1,200 maids in Kuala Lumpur on Palm Sunday in April 1994. According to Filipino authorities, employers and agencies often take thepassports of foreign workers for "safekeeping," so that, when the Malaysianpolice ask for papers, foreign workers cannot produce them. In Sabah, in eastern Malaysia, more than 1,000 Filipinos have been jailed forimmigration offenses. There are at least 120,000 Filipinos living in Sabah,and the Philippines and Malaysia have agreed to issue border crossing cards toFilipinos in the area. In the Philippines, it was announced that the government was establishing a newagency to formulate a policy on overseas contract workers (OCWs). PresidentRamos has asked the Departments of Foreign Affairs and labor to develop a plan to reduce the deployment of unskilled workers, such as maids. In Hong Kong, the 20 Filipino churches are being asked to investigate theworking conditions of maids. Maids often pay 35,000 to 40,000 pesos toemployment agencies, who often hold their passports and work permits untiltheir "loan" is paid off. If the maid finds herself in an abusive situation,she is unable to get help from the agency holding the loan, and she may find ithard to obtain a new job within the two-week period allowed by Hong Kongauthorities for aliens to be jobless in the territory. Malaysia's labor shortages are reportedly beginning to affect itscompetitiveness. The labor shortage is attributed to the Malaysiangovernment's slowing the influx of foreign workers. The most severe laborshortages are in the major export and growth industries, such as oleochemicals,machinery and engineering, textiles, electronics and electrical, plastics,information technology, wood and chemicals. A Malaysian government freeze on foreign workers early in 1994 came at a timethat the manufacturing sector was experiencing a shortage of local workers.The government is trying to encourage the private sector to move away fromlabor-intensive production in favor of higher value-added industries.

It should be easy to get more graduates in a region in which there is respectfor education and a belief that education is the ticket to a secure economicfuture produce more graduates. Singapore provides an example of a countrythat, in 1991, spent $322 per person on higher education, and developed severalworld-class research institutes. The key is reportedly not the people, many ofwhom were trained and employed in top research labs in North American andWestern Europe, but rather the infrastructure to support research efforts inAsia. However, there is often a tension between the needs of research and politics.Higher education in China provides an example. China has 124 million primaryschool pupils, but only 40 percent pass the test that enables them to go tojunior high school despite often intense parental efforts to give theirchildren advantages in the competition to move up to the next level ofeducation. About one in eight Chinese pupils goes to high school, and only three or fourpercent pass entrance exams to win one of the 2.5 million places in Chineseuniversities. In 1992, Chinese educational spending was equivalent to aboutthree percent of GDP, half the level of Malaysia. Many Chinese schoolsstrapped for money are imposing tuitions of $100 to $200, equivalent to half anurban worker's annual salary. However, 80 percent of all China's professorsare over 55, suggesting a hiring challenge.

Firms undertaking investment projects worth over NT$200 million are permitted to import foreign workers until 30 percent of theirworkforces on these projects are foreigners. (See Migration News, November,1994.) On October 20, Taiwan's Employment and Service Act was amended to increasefines for illegally hiring foreign workers to up to three years in jail or amaximum NT$ 300,000 fine. Taiwanese employers reported that 850 legitimatelyhired workers ran away from their jobs in January 1994, and 3495 in September.Most of these foreign workers had reached the two year maximum on their workpermits. Current penalties are deportation for runaway workers and fines forthe employers. China Economic News Service November 17, 1994.

It was feared that increasing theemphasis on economic skills and knowledge of English or French would reduce thechances of Hong Kong residents to migrate there. Canada is also considering a separate category and quota for parents andgrandparents, and imposing a legally enforceable bond on persons who sponsorimmigrants. In Hong Kong, the Canadian government has established a bulletin board on theInternet ''misc. immigration. canada'' to provide advice on how to migrate toCanada. Canada granted about 31,000 immigration visas to Hong Kong residentsin 1993, and they were 21 percent of all immigrants to Canada in July 1994.

About 120,000 immigrants becameAustralian citizens in 1993. To become an Australian citizen, persons need to have lived two years of thepast five years in Australia, including 12 months' residence during the 24months before applying. Australia permits dual citizenship only if the countryof birth allows dual citizenship, as in the case of Irish or Italianimmigrants. About 40 percent of all Australians were born abroad or hadparents who were not born in Australia. In early November, Australia administered an English language test to 7,000aliens requesting refugee status in the country; those who pass the test may beable to immigrate under economic categories. On November 1, 1993, Australiagranted permanent residence status to the 19,000 Chinese who were in thecountry when the Beijing massacre occurred on June 4, 1989. Another 9000spouses and children later joined them in Australia. On November 1, 1993, there were 20,000 applicants for asylum in Australia,and Australia created a new category of permanent resident. The intent was todeal with remaining Chinese students and dependents and foreign students whopaid tuition to get to Australia, and then went to work and overstayed theirvisas. Many of those required to take the test protested, but the governmentresponded that they came to Australia in the first place to learn English. There are 147,507 Muslims from 67 countries--led by Lebanon and Turkey--inAustralia. Most are under 25, and one-third were born in Australia. Half livein Sydney, and another one-third live in Melbourne. The number of Muslims inAustralia almost doubled between 1981 and 1991, and Australia now has 57mosques. Almost half of the Muslims interviewed in one study complained ofdiscrimination, especially women wearing the hijab, or head covering, whiletrying to get jobs. A Racial Hatred Bill is expected to be introduced inCanberra to create an agency to hear complaints of public behavior againstpersons because of their race, color or ethnic origin.

On November 2, the Israeli governmentissued 8,000 work permits to be divided evenly between the West Bank and Gaza.Since then, about 24,000 Palestinian day laborers have been given permission tore-enter Israel to work. There were 110,000 Palestinians working in Israel before the uprisings thatbegan in December 1987, and 70,000 Palestinians held work permits before theborder closure in October 1994.

TheAmerican authors and their generally native commentators explore twohypotheses: the convergence hypothesis that the industrial countries that aretoday net immigration areas use increasingly similar policy instrumentsto regulate immigration, and the gap hypothesis, which asserts that thegap between the immigration policy goals and outcomes is growing in allindustrial countries. The goals-outcomes gap helps to explain the commonanti-immigrant mood. While the authors agree that there is a growing gap between immigration goalsand outcomes in each country, they do not necessarily agree on the mostimportant factors that cause it. Several authors emphasize the importance ofdemand-pull factors--the idea that, even in periods of high unemployment, thereare jobs to be filled by unskilled immigrants, and employers are able tofrustrate effective controls meant to keep out such immigrants. Other authorsfocus on supply-push pressures that encourage migrants to leave rural Mexico,Turkey, and other sending countries; they see rising emigration pressures, plusthe networks or bridges that have made it ever easier for migrants to crossborders, obtain jobs, and stay, as the primary determinants of unwantedmigration. There is little disagreement that the industrialized countries that embraced inthe 1950s and 1960s the notion that they could borrow labor temporarily fromtheir poorer neighbors did not appreciate the fact that what was once seen assimple economic transaction has become a complex socio-political issue, raisingfundamental questions, such as who are we and whom do we invite to join ournation-state? The industrial nations generally failed at least once in theirquest for control over illegal immigration, and they now stand on the thresholdof an era in which streams of immigration have the potential to become lessmanageable rivers of people. Politicians are responding to the anti-immigrant moods of most industrialcountries by discussing the importance of dealing with the root causes ofunwanted immigration, and then, in the familiar mode of the man with the hammerwho perceives all problems to be nails, these mostly lawyers who extendedrights to citizens and aliens are beginning to roll them back in an effort toreassert control over immigration. These rights rollbacks are having at leastinitial successes: asylum applications are down sharply in Germany in 1994compared to 1993, and the US "Hold-the-Line" approach of flooding the borderwith border control agents appears to keep out unauthorized short-distancemigrants. However, such control measures have in the past proven to have theirdesired effects for only a short time, so that, viewed over a longer timehorizon, they appear to be only symbolic steps designed to appeaseanti-immigrant sentiment. This book explains how the immigration problem evolved in the variousindustrial countries, how it is defined today, and how migration streams arelikely to evolve. It does not prescribe what the countries studied should do,but the theme running through many of the chapters is that no country issatisfied with its current immigration control policies. More telling,perhaps, is that there seems to be no success story that industrial countriescan adapt to their own situations, as in environmental or urban planning or inlabor market policies. Rather than prescribing the optimal policies, this bookillustrates the consequences of alternative policy paths. US Commission on Immigration Reform. 1994.

In 1993, 904,292 persons became permanent resident aliens (PRAs), and 315,000PRAs became US citizens. Over 21 million non-immigrants were admitted in 1993,and about 4 in 5 were tourists. Some 1.3 million illegal aliens wereapprehended. PRAs in 1993 included 255,000 immediate relatives of US citizens and 227,000family-sponsored preference immigrants subject to numerical limitation.Another 146,000 PRAs were admitted under the employment preferences. Finally,another 160,000 aliens were admitted outside the preference quotas, including24,000 persons who were legalized in 1987-88, 127,000 refugees, and others,including 16,000 parolees from the ex-Soviet Union and Indochina. Fairlie, Robert and Bruce Meyer. 1994. Ethnic and Racial Character ofSelf-Employment. NBER Working Paper 4791. About 10 million Americans are self employed, and about 10 million US workerswere born in another country. Rates of self-employment vary by country oforigin--among immigrant men, almost 29 percent of the Israeli men were selfemployed in 1990, versus only 3 percent for Laotian men. Immigrant men withhigh self-employment rates included Russians (25 percent), Greeks (23 percent),and Cubans (16 percent). Low self-employment rates were reported by PuertoRicans (4 percent) and Filipinos (5 percent). There are also distinct differences in the type of self employment.Self-employed Russians, for example, tended to offer construction, health, orlegal and accounting services, while Chinese immigrants were more likely toown restaurants and Koreans small retail stores.

Its manyassertions/predictions include "globalization causes the worldwide divisions ofhave and have-not countries to be mirrored within the borders of even therichest nations." (p20), since workers who compete in tradable goods will haveto compete directly with the goods and services produced by lower wage workersin stable developing nations, and other workers will have to compete with cheapimmigrant labor. _______________________ Editor: Philip Martin Managing Editor: Cecily Sprouse Associate Editor: Sergio O'Cadiz Department of Agricultural Economics, University of California, Davis, DavisCA 95616 Tel (916) 752-1530 Fax: (916) 752-5614 email: <migrant@primal.ucdavis.edu> Migration News is produced with the support of the University of California,Berkeley Center for German and European Studies WT02-B14-2IA090-000969-B025-64http://migration.ucdavis.edu:80/By-Month/MN-Vol-2-95/MN_January_1995.html 128.120.36.171 19970122204201 text/html 128367HTTP/1.0 200 OKMIME-Version: 1.0Server: WebSTAR/1.3.1 ID/6378Message-ID: Date: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 20:42:50 GMTLast-Modified: Sunday, 16-Apr-95 17:28:53 GMTContent-type: text/htmlContent-length: 128110MIGRATION NEWS Vol. 2, No. 1 January, 1995 Migration News summarizes the most important developments in immigration andintegration issues during the preceding month.

Over 500,000Salvadorans are believed to have come to the US during the 1980s, mostillegally, when civil war killed about 70,000 people and death squads spreadterror. Most Salvadoran applications for political asylum in the US during the1980s were denied. The 1990 IMMACT granted Salvadorans TPS in the US, which was extended byPresident Bush in 1992 and Clinton in 1993. The civil war in El Salvador endedin 1992, and INS Commissioner Meissner said that today the "situation in ElSalvador has improved significantly and no longer serves as a basis forcontinuing 'temporary' asylum." An estimated one million Salvadorans live in the United States in 1994--half inLos Angeles--meaning that one in six Salvadorans lives in the US. About halfare legal immigrants. Between 90,000 and 190,000 Salvadorans are protected bythe TPS which is expiring--the INS does not have more precise data. Salvadorans who currently have work authorization will be granted automaticnine-month extensions, according to a notice published in the Federal Registeron December 6, 1994. Salvadorans who apply for asylum in the US beforeSeptember 1995 will be able to stay longer. Salvadorans' asylum claims today are eligible for special due processconsideration under a 1990 court case that alleged that during the 1980s the USdiscriminated against asylum -seekers from El Salvador and Guatemala. Lessthan five percent of the applications for asylum filed by Salvadorans have beengranted. Some social service agencies are urging Salvadorans to request asylumin order to prolong their US stays and possibly gain permanent residence statusat a future date. Under US law, aliens who have been in the US for at leastseven years, have good moral character, and would face hardship if returned,can remain in the US indefinitely. In a profile of Salvadorans in Long Island, New York, it was noted thatSalvadorans are already discussing ways to stay permanently in the US,including marrying a US citizen or legal immigrant at the going rate of $3,000. Many Salvadorans were attracted to the US by jobs that paid $5 hourly, butthey expected to live at Salvadoran costs in the US. With mainstream US pricestoo high, they have spawned an underground economy in which medical and similarservices are offered by unlicensed providers at less than half the going rates.Such "immigrant economies" are responsible for reviving turn-of-the-centuryinstitutions, such as live poultry markets in New York City. Salvadorans in the US remit an estimated $600 million to $1 billion to theircountry annually, much of it to regions devastated by the civil war. The 5.4million Salvadorans in 1992 had an average annual GNP of $1,200 per capita.Salvadoran exports in 1992 were worth $400 million, and imports were worth $1.1billion; the gap was financed by remittances. Commentators were divided on the whether the end of TPS was desirable. Thosewho favored ending TPS argued that, if TPS were extended once again, the entireconcept would be in danger, since opponents could argue that TPS was simply aside door to permanent immigration. Opponents argued that the Salvadorans weretruly refugees, and that US support for the Salvadoran government prevented theUS from recognizing the Salvadorans in the US as legitimate refugees who shouldhave been allowed to start their lives anew in the US. Many advocates forSalvadorans argued that there would be mass firings of persons whose workpermits would expire September 30, 1995.

Under current rules, asylum applicantscan receive work permits within 90 days of applying for asylum, allegedlyencouraging aliens to file false asylum claims in order obtain permission towork in the US. There are 425,000 pending asylum applications, and about 13,000 more are filedeach month. INS announced plans to add staff and streamline the processing ofasylum applications. The number of asylum officers will be doubled to 334, andthe number of immigration judges will rise by 63 to 179. With these additional staff, the INS hopes to interview each applicant and makean initial decision on all applications within 60 days by April, 1995. Finaldecisions are expected within six months. The INS decided not to chargeapplicants for asylum a proposed $130 filing fee. In recent years, about 120,000 persons have applied each year for asylum,generating 120,000 first-level decisions on whether an individual (anddependents) should be granted refugee status in the US. About 10 percent ofthese decisions are appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and 10percent of them, or 1,200, are appealed to the Federal Courts of Appeal. Thisputs a heavy workload on a system not designed for so many cases--almostone-fourth of the judges in the 9th Circuit, which includes California, spendall their time on asylum cases. This means that the INS must "remove" from the US about 90,000 rejected asylumseekers each year. By all accounts, the removal system is not working well,and the Commission on Immigration reform held a hearing on December 14 todiscuss methods to make the removal system work better. The INS has a three-section enforcement effort-- the so-called front, middle,and back ends of the illegal immigration issue. The front end refers toefforts to keep illegal aliens and asylum seekers out of the US with bordercontrols and safe havens, the middle refers to employer sanctions andeligibility tests for social benefits, and the back end refers to efforts toremoval of illegal aliens from the US. There are estimated to be four million illegal aliens in the US. Every year,about 1.3 million are located just inside the US-Mexican border, and almost allof them agree to "voluntarily" return to their country of origin, Mexico. Inaddition, about 40,000 aliens are deported to a range of countries. The INS targets its limited resources on removing criminal illegal aliens afterthey have served sentences in the US for crimes committed here. Under US law,illegal aliens are provided with lawyers at public expense to defend themselvesin criminal trials, but they are not provided with lawyers when, at the end oftheir sentence, they are asked to show why they should not be deported to theircountry of origin. The 20,000 non-US citizens in federal prison are about one-fourth of allfederal prisoners, and the 30,000 non-US citizens in state prison are aboutfive percent of all state prisoners. Half of the federal non-US citizens arefrom Mexico and Colombia. Most of the federal and many of the state alienprisoners were convicted of smuggling drugs into or within the US. In manycases, those convicted are relatively low-level players, but they often have asufficient quantity of drugs that they commit felonies. If aliens are released from prison, and then told to show up at a hearing sothat it can be determined whether they should remain in the US, virtually noneappear. For this reason, immigration judges are going into federal and stateprisons to hold deportation hearings there, so that aliens can be deported asthey leave prison. Florida and the INS are cooperating on a program under which aliens convictedof non-violent felonies are offered clemency if they agree to be deported. Ifthe alien is later apprehended in the US, he/she must serve the original jailterm, plus up to 20 years for returning to the US after being deported. Inthis manner, more prison beds are made available for violent US citizenoffenders. It is widely agreed that the INS must do more than just remove criminal aliensin order to make its removal policies credible. The issue in most deportationhearings is not whether the person should be deported--in most instances theanswer is yes--the issue is whether the alien who should be deported iseligible for some form of relief from deportation, such as being in the US forseven years, or developing an "equity stake" in the US. There are privateattorneys in most cities with concentrations of aliens to advise aliens facingdeportation, for a fee, how to avoid deportation. Three of the many ideas advanced to speed up and make more credible removalsstand out. First, add resources to INS and the courts so that hearings can beconducted quickly, and removals ordered before aliens develop equity stakes.Second, remove at least some non-criminal aliens to send the message thatremoval is a real possibility e.g., remove with publicity some visitors whooverstay their I-94 tourist visas and aliens whose applications for asylum arerejected. Third, explore the use of incentives, such as refunding the alien'sshare of social security contributions made while employed in the US if thefunds are claimed at the US consulate in the alien's country of origin within30 days of the order to depart. For alien's earning $1,000 per month, thisreturn incentive could amount to almost $1000 per year. FBI Director Freeh, in response to the World Trade Center bombing and otherterrorist incidents involving asylum seekers, endorsed proposals to speed upprocesses for removing aliens from the US. Freeh criticized currentregulations, which involve sending aliens letters asking them to "show cause"why they should not be ordered to leave the US. Most flee underground ratherthan show up for their hearings. Freeh would increase the bond to guaranteethe alien's appearance. According to Freeh, aliens making false asylum claims often enter the US underthe visa waiver program--under which 9.5 million persons arrived in FY 94--andwith student visas and through sham marriages to US citizens. There is reported to be growing illegal immigration by rejected asylum seekersfrom the US to Canada, especially along a six-mile stretch of border south ofVancouver. Many are reported to be Central Americans who crossed through theUS en route to Canada, where they thought their prospects of receiving asylumwere better. For the first time in 1993, more asylum applications were filedin downtown Vancouver than at ports of entry, suggesting that these applicantsentered the country unlawfully. Canada has a generous program for asylum applicants. While waiting one or twoyears for a decision, applicants are entitled to a work permit, housing,welfare, and medical assistance, costing up to $37,000 per alien per year. During the summer of 1993, Canada resumed the deportation of criminal aliens tocountries considered dangerous, so that e.g., an Iranian alien convicted ofbringing heroin into Canada was deported even though drug dealers are sometimeshanged there.

Judge Pfaelzerexpressed concern that enforcement of Prop. 187 could prompt immigrantsentitled to be in the US to leave the country when, e.g., the police questionthose arrested about their immigration status, or when persons entitled toservices under federal law are denied services under Prop. 187 in California.The judge's preliminary injunction blocks enforcement of all but two of theinitiative's provisions. A state judge has prevented the enforcement of that section of Prop. 187 thatrequires verification of legal status in order to obtain lower in-state tuitionat state colleges and universities. Those portions of Prop. 187 that make it astate felony to manufacture or distribute false identification papers have goneinto effect. In Los Angeles, public service announcements are being played on Spanishlanguage TV and radio that advise unauthorized immigrants that Prop. 187 is notbeing enforced, and recommending that pregnant women and children shouldcontinue to seek needed medical care. In Sacramento, regulations to implement187 are being prepared by state agencies, and there is a debate over whatobligation public employees have to report persons "reasonably believed" to beillegal aliens, and what penalties can be levied on those who fail to report. Prop. 187 has slipped from the front pages of California newspapers. Many ofthe Prop. 187 stories in December were profiles of unauthorized immigrants whowere "confused" over which provisions of 187 were being enforced, and oftenangry exchanges in letters to newspapers. A typical profile described how aneight-month pregnant unauthorized alien did not go to the doctor for fear ofdetection and deportation, and her confusion and fears are, according toimmigration advocates, typical. The number of patients at walk-in clinicsfrequented by unauthorized aliens is reportedly down 10 to 20 percent insouthern California. There have been reports that some Californians who supported Prop. 187 havebeen asking Latino employees in restaurants and stores for their "green cards."Prop. 187 does not give customers the right to demand identification fromemployees, although one of Prop. 187's backers says that customers may wantassurance that employees are legal in places they frequent. Newspapers also report that, despite Prop 187's making the sale or use of falsedocuments to circumvent immigration laws a state felony, a provision of Prop.187 that is in effect, fake drivers licenses, social security cards, andimmigrant visas or micas, are still being sold openly in MacArthur andHuntington Parks in Los Angeles for $50 to $75. On January 9, 1995, the firstthree sellers of false documents are scheduled to be sentenced under Prop. 187after pleading guilty to selling false documents. They could receive jailterms and then be deported. In the month since Prop. 187 was enacted, five people have been arrested forselling false IDs. Neither city nor county law enforcement agencies have madearrests for the sale of false immigration documents a priority. Police reportthat false ID sellers are relatively sophisticated--a salesman takes the order,a runner takes the order to the place where the documents are made, and a thirdperson delivers the false IDs. Only at delivery can an arrest be made and,even though all persons in the distribution chain can be prosecuted under Prop.187, it has proven difficult to persuade those arrested to reveal theircollaborators. California's 8 million Hispanics are being urged to boycott companies such asDisney that contributed to the re-election campaign of Governor Wilson.Several groups have asked the nation's 25 million Hispanics to boycottDisneyland, ridiculed as ''Migra Mouse.'' Interviews with the drafters of Prop. 187 reveal that the initiative wasdrafted by a committee of 10, and that the ban on public education forunauthorized alien children was included in order to retain the support of theactivists who circulated the petitions to put Prop. 187 on the November 1994ballot. According to former INS Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell, Prop. 187was tested by a couple looking for business for their campaign firm. A California assemblyman, Richard Mountjoy, quickly convinced the "Committee of10" that the most viable option would be an initiative denying public servicesto illegal immigrants. The fact that different sections have differentdefinitions of who is eligible for services has played a major role in courtorders to block 187's enforcement. The chair of the US Civil Rights Commission, Mary Frances Berry, expressedconcern that Prop. 187 could foster discrimination against Latinos. At aWashington, DC informational hearing on December 16, a co-author of 187, RonPrince, assured the commission that the initiative did not intend to promoteracial discrimination. Instead, its aim is to cure "a present system that addsup to discrimination against US citizens and legal residents of California," bydiverting resources to unauthorized aliens. On December 12, about 200 farm workers who typically earn $100 daily cuttingand packing celery for a Dole subsidiary, Bud of California, walked off theirjobs to protest Prop. 187. The protest was organized by a Spanish-languageradio station in Oxnard to demonstrate the "economic clout" of unauthorizedworkers. In a case not related to Prop. 187, the California Supreme Court upheld a stateregulation that requires persons seeking state-paid emergency health care toprovide a Social Security Number or admit that they are illegal aliens. Allpersons must be provided with care. The Prop 187 movement is spreading to other states. Floridians for ImmigrationControl announced on December 13 that they would mount an effort to enact aProp. 187-style state-run verification of eligibility for public benefits law.Florida has sued the federal government to recoup some costs of providingservices to an estimated 322,000 illegal aliens. Governor Chiles has announcedthat he will oppose the Prop. 187 effort in Florida, saying that it is toocrude an attempt to deal with a complex issue. Backers need 430,000signatures by August, 1996 to put the proposal on the November 1996 ballot. In Suffolk County, New York, a decade of welcoming Salvadoran refugees endedwith the repeal last year of an ordinance that sheltered Salvadoran refugees.This summer the county passed the "America First Welfare Reduction Program."The county's resolution asked the state of New York for permission to denyhealth care and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, and to legal immigrantswho are not yet US citizens. The state refused the request. The seven states with the most illegal immigrants--California, New York, Texas,Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and Arizona-- have two-thirds of theelectoral votes needed to elect a US President. Hispanic activists opposed toProp. 187-type measures have announced that they are working hard on the nextgreat civil rights movement--preserving the rights of legal and unauthorizedaliens. Many publications have run editorials decrying or praising Prop. 187. In atypical pro-187 editorial, US News and World Report called for giving morepreference in legal immigration to professionals, and requiring adult childrensponsoring their elderly parents to immigrate to the US to be responsible fortheir economic well-being for at least 10 years after their arrival. US Newsalso called for a reduction in the number of refugees, who are eligible forwelfare upon arrival. According to estimates done by The Rand Institute, 85 percent of the childrenof illegal aliens in CA aged ten and under were born in the United States, andare therefore US citizens. Of those children who are aged 10 to 15, anestimated 60 per cent were born in the US, and aged 15 to 19, around 50 percent. The GAO on November 30, 1994 estimated that California spends $2.35 billion peryear providing education, health, and justice services to illegalaliens--two-thirds of these costs are incurred to provide education, andone-sixth each to provide health care services and to incarcerate illegalaliens. At a public hearing in mid December in Tijuana, speakers told a newly formed adhoc committee that Mexican consulates must become strong advocates for Mexicancitizens abroad. The committee also discussed increasing its consular corps,introducing dual US-Mexican citizenship, and developing a trilateralimmigration agreement tied to NAFTA. The ad hoc committee, chaired by CarlosReta Martinez, has 20 members drawn from the PRI and three opposition parties.The public hearing was the first of several to be held along the border and inother parts of Mexico that send migrants to the US.

Although there are no "official" data on apprehensionsand expulsions, it is estimated that the number of mostly Central Americansremoved from Mexico during the first 11 months of 1994 averages 5,000 to 6,000per month (Dec. MN). There were reportedly 143,000 illegal aliens removed fromMexico in 1993, and 90,000 in 1990. Mexico's National Migration Institute reported that 3,651 illegal aliens were"deported" between January and November, suggesting that most illegal aliensare removed from Mexico informally rather than after a legal process. Mexico issues about 125,000 work permits to foreign workers each year. Apublic education is guaranteed to all children in Mexico, but most schoolsrequire a birth certificate or a passport and visa to establish the identity ofthe child. This means that the children of illegal aliens are often barredfrom Mexican public schools. There have been roundups at hospitals to whichundocumented Central Americans go to seek medical treatment. Many of the illegal aliens in Mexico are Guatemalans employed in jobs thatrange from picking coffee beans to construction and maids. Violations ofMexico's minimum wage, and of basic human rights standards, are reportedlywidespread where illegal Central Americans are employed. There have been charges that Central Americans suffer rapes, beatings,extortion, and robbery at the hands of Mexican employers and police. Oneadvocate for unauthorized Central Americans in Mexico is Tapachula bishop JorgeArizmendi, who hopes that Prop. 187 will put Mexico's treatment of undocumentedworkers onto Mexico's national agenda. Some immigrants from Central Americasay that they were treated far worse in Mexico than the US. The potential embarrassment from these complaints to President Zedillo afterhis denunciations of Prop. 187 reportedly prompted the Mexican government toundertake a thorough review of its immigration policies and their enforcement.In the past, Mexico has ignored Central Americans passing through to the US,but now that some are apparently staying in relatively wealthier Mexico, thegovernment feels compelled to act. Mexico has increased the number ofroadblocks near its border with Guatemala. Mexican GDP per capita ($3470 in 1992) is 3.5 times the Guatemalan level of$980; picking coffee beans in Mexico pays twice as much as the same job inGuatemala. About 40,000 Guatemalans live in camps for political refugees in the state of Campeche. During his campaign, President Zedillo had promisedmore public spending to help the Mexican poor and to offset the inequality thataccompanied Mexico's boom, and lower interest rates to spur foreign anddomestic investment in Mexican factories, housing, and infrastructure. Mexico was headed for a deficit in its current account trade balance of $30billion in 1994, equivalent to almost eight percent of its $395 billion GDP.Its reserves fell from $30 billion early in 1994 to $6 billion on December 22as Mexico attempted to support the peso at a rate of 3.45 pesos to $1.Nonetheless, Mexico's new Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, confidentlypredicted in mid-December that the economy would grow by four percent in 1995,and that the peso-dollar exchange rate would remain stable. On December 19, Zapatista rebels reported falsely that they had taken over 38towns in Chiapas. On December 20, Mexico devalued the peso, and it eventuallyfell over 40 percent, from 3.4 pesos to $1 to 5.7 pesos to $1, before settlingat 5 pesos to $1 on December 29. Mexican interest rates jumped to 40 percent,credit dried up as banks stopped lending, the Mexican stock market fellsharply, and there were fears that Mexico would not have enough dollars to paythe interest it owes on its foreign debts. According to the estimates of University of California, Davis economist EdTaylor, a 10 percent devaluation of the peso could increase Mexico-to-USmigration by 17 percent (March MN). If this village-based estimate proves tobe correct, there is likely to be a surge in Mexico-to-US migration. The Mexican explanation for the devaluation--to offset the capital flightassociated with Zapatista activity in Chiapas-- was described in the US as anattempt to cover-up fundamental economic problems. Some predicted that thepeso devaluation would be a blow to foreigners' confidence in the Mexicaneconomy. Foreigners have $75 billion invested in Mexican financial markets,and there were fears of a capital flight in 1995.. Mexico plans more privatization and stricter enforcement of rules designed topromote competition in 1995, but it remains dependent on foreign investment forthe job creation needed to absorb one million new workforce entrants each year.Mexican exports and internal savings are not sufficient to pay for thecountry's imports, making Mexico dependent on an inflow of foreigners' savings.As interest rates rose in the US and elsewhere, speculators bet that Mexico toowould have to raise interest rates, and that rising rates would slow economicgrowth in Mexico, forcing Mexico to devalue the peso. Devaluing the peso makes Mexican exports cheaper and more attractive to foreignbuyers, but it also fuels inflation in Mexico. The Mexican government haspromised to cut government spending and allow interest rates to rise to preventan inflationary surge, but this means that the country risks recession that mayalso reduce the attractiveness of the country to foreigners.

Even though it was agreed that therewere far more signs of labor surplus than shortage, it was noted that the twoblades of the scissors could come together quickly to produce a program. Outgoing President Salinas and Governor Wilson in November, 1994 called for aguestworker program that would allow Mexican workers to be employed in the US.Salinas justified a program in terms of protecting the inevitable flow ofMexican workers to the US; Wilson in terms of having workers come legally, andmanaging their access to public services ( Dec. 1994 MN). US employers are currently allowed to recruit unskilled foreign workers to fillvacant US jobs only after they convince the US Department of Labor that, aftera search for US workers at prevailing wages, and the offer of benefits such asfree housing to temporary foreign farmworkers, no US workers are available.Since 1990, there have been 35,000 to 40,000 unskilled foreign workers admittedeach year. About half fill farm jobs, and half fill nonfarm jobs. Temporary alien farm workers are admitted under the H-2A program, and they cutsugar cane in Florida, harvest tobacco in the Carolinas, pick apples in theNortheast, and herd sheep in the West. Many farm employers and most farmworker advocates decry the H-2A program--the farmers because of DOL's role incertifying--and perhaps rejecting--their need for foreign workers on ajob-by-job basis, and the advocates because DOL allegedly does not do enough toassure that farmers truly recruit American workers. If labor shortages develop in Spring, 1995, and INS border controls areperceived to have reduced significantly illegal immigration at the border, thenpressures could mount for a non-H-2A foreign worker program. Farm worker advocates at the meeting discussed the elements of such a programif one should be proposed. One suggestion was to push for more effective laborlaw enforcement to encourage employers to prefer Americans, but it was quicklyagreed that complaint-driven and money-assessment-evaluated enforcement canhave only limited effects on a farm labor market that matches one to twomillion seasonal workers with three to four million seasonal jobs. Some argued that, if there were to be a non-H-2A foreign worker program, itshould be a RAW-type program, under which foreign workers would gradually earnthe right to become immigrants by doing e.g., at least 90 days of farm work fortwo or three years. It was generally agreed that IRCA and IRCA-sponsored research has changed boththe reality and the perception of the farm labor market. The reality is thatmost farmworkers, and virtually all new entrants to the farm work force, areborn abroad--the base "states" for US migrants have switched from Florida,Texas, and California to central and southern Mexico. The only disputed pointwas the share of unauthorized workers in the stable farm work force--the rangeof hard-to-verify estimates is 10 to 50 percent. There is general agreementthat the share of unauthorized workers is rising, but the most credibleevidence available today points to smaller percentages of unauthorized aliens. The seasonal farm labor market is increasingly disorganized. As intermediariessuch as labor contractors assume a greater role in job matching, more workerswind up working only a few hours per day, and a few days each week, even duringpeak periods. Second, the farm labor market has gotten so isolated thatnon-marginal changes in wages and working arrangements would likely be requiredto end the industry's dependence on immigrant workers without other US jobsoptions. However, if there were to be such non-marginal adjustments, thedemand for labor might fall sharply, via e.g., mechanization or trade. _________________________________________ GatekeeperReduces Apprehensions On October 1, 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper, an experiment toflood the westernmost section of the US-Mexican border with three lines ofagents to have a better chance of apprehending aliens attempting entry south ofSan Diego. Apprehensions along the six miles of border between the Highway 5port of entry to the Pacific Ocean fell by half in October and November, from600 to 800 per night to 200 to 300 per night. As apprehensions fall in the most heavily guarded western sections of theborder, they are rising further east. Overall apprehensions are down about 30percent from year-earlier figures, but up sharply--over 100 percent--in whatwere previously quiet mountain and desert areas. There has also been asignificant increase in aliens attempting entry with counterfeit documents. Experts agree that the real test of Gatekeeper's effectiveness will come inSpring, 1995, when aliens who are going home for Christmas attempt to return toseasonal US jobs. There may be more Mexicans attempting entry than usualbecause of the December peso devaluation. In yet another report on "one of the Government's most troubled agencies" (Oct.MN), the New York Times reported that the INS was promoting rather thandisciplining senior managers accused of sexual harassment and assault.

Several Central American leaders denounced Proposition 187, the Californiainitiative approved on November 8 that establishes a state-run verificationsystem to ensure that illegal aliens do not receive state-funded publicservices. Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon called Prop 187 "a flagrantand massive violation of human rights, especially for children." Vice President Gore reminded reporters that the Clinton Administration opposed187, and asserted that the real answer to illegal immigration is to "is tocreate more opportunities for jobs and lives with dignity in the areas fromwhich the immigration is taking place." The 35 Western Hemisphere nations--many are small island nations-- have acombined population of about 875 million and a combined GNP of about $8trillion. The US, with a $6 trillion GNP, accounts for three-fourths of alleconomic activity in the region, followed by Canada ($566 billion), Brazil($425 billion), and Mexico ($295 billion). Clinton cited figures indicatingthat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect January1, 1994, increased U.S. exports to Mexico by 22 percent and created more than100,000 new US jobs. US export-related jobs pay 17 percent more than averageUS wages. Political commentator Robert Novak argued that Mexican President Zedillo openlyasserted that Mexico needs the outlet of the US labor market for its nationals,and that Mexico will push for some type of guestworker program.

Over 200 American soldiers were injured, and hundreds of Cubansescaped into the jungle. By December 9, almost all of the escaped Cubans hadbeen re-captured. Two were found dead in the Panama Canal. Some of the 22,000 Cubans at the US Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba, riotedon September 6. There are also 4900 Haitians in Guantanamo--14, 650 havereturned to Haiti, and 25 were sent to the US for humanitarian reasons. The riots were allegedly sparked by the Clinton Administration's decision onDecember 2 to admit Cuban families with children directly to the US, eventhough, in August 1994, President Clinton asserted forcefully that Cubans couldcome to the US only after being screened in Havana. INS Commissioner Meissnerstressed that only children for whom continued living in the camps wouldconstitute "extreme hardship" would be admitted with their families to the US.Living in tents and not attending school are not considered by the INS to be"extreme hardship." There are about 3,000 children under 17 in the camps, and it is estimated that8,000 or one-fourth of the Cubans being detained could be admitted directly tothe US under this "humanitarian" program. The Clinton Administration maintainsthat the 4,900 Haitians still in Guantanamo, 234 of whom are unaccompaniedchildren, will not be admitted to the US. On December 19, a US appeals courtupheld the government's decision not to admit these children, and reversed alower court ruling that guaranteed refugee advocates access to Cubans andHaitians in Guantanamo, although the government said that lawyers would stillbe permitted in Guantanamo. In October 1994, the Clinton Administration made the first exception to itsonly-visa-Cuba immigration policy when 300 elderly and sick Cuban refugees atGuantanamo and their close family members, as well as 45 children withoutrelatives, were taken directly to the US. So far, almost 700 Cubans have beenmoved from Guantanamo to the US. On December 20, a US Appeals Court lifted at least temporarily all restrictionson returning Cubans from Guantanamo to Cuba. Refugee advocates persuaded ajudge to stop such voluntary returns until it is determined whether personsseeking US asylum at US facilities outside the US have US constitutionalrights.

On December 20, a federal judge threw out the state's lawsuit,saying that the suit presented a "political issue" that he had no authority todecide. Florida's suit contended that the US government encourages illegalimmigration by not effectively controlling US borders and then requiring statesto provide services to them. Florida's governor promised to appeal. Florida estimates that it spent $2.5 billion in 1993 to provide services to alltypes of immigrants, including $884 million to provide services to 345,000unauthorized immigrants. A federal judge in Texas indicated that he too is inclined to dismiss thatstate's suit for reimbursement. However, California's Governor Wilson saidthat the dismissal of Florida's lawsuit does not affect California's pendinglawsuit because California raises different claims. California has three suitspending in federal court in San Diego that seek as much as $10.5 billion infederal reimbursement for the cost of providing services to unauthorizedimmigrants over the past six years. At least six states have filed lawsuits seeking federal reimbursement for thecosts of providing services to aliens--Arizona, California, Florida, New York,Texas, and New Jersey.

About half of the projectedsavings in the Republican proposal to reform welfare--an estimated $21 billionover five years-- would come from denying legal immigrants access to 60federally-funded programs, from housing assistance to food assistance to legalservices, until they became naturalized US citizens. Refugees would be exemptfor their first six years in the US, as would legal immigrants over 75 who havebeen in the US for at least five years. There has been a great deal of discussion of the "quality" or integrationprospects of 1980s immigrants. According to a Wall Street Journal summary,this research casts "doubt on the widely held view that immigration is always anet plus for the economy." A Rand analyst asserted that adult immigrants whoenter the US labor market earning 30 percent less than US workers are likely toleave the labor market still earning 30 percent less. University of California, San Diego Professor George Borjas has releasedanother paper that finds that recent immigrants are less educated and skilledpersons who "assimilate into welfare" in the US. Despite the fact that theCensus includes illegal aliens and newly legalized aliens who are not eligiblefor welfare, Borjas found that in the 1990 Census, 9.1 percent of all immigranthouseholds, but only 7.4 percent of US-born households, reported receivingpayments from welfare programs in 1989. In their first years in the US,foreign-born households (except refugees) are often not eligible for welfare,so the percentage of households reporting welfare payments increases with timein the US. About 5.5 percent of those who immigrated between 1965 and 1970reported receiving welfare in 1969, but 10 percent of this immigrant cohortreported receiving welfare between 1980 and 1990. Borjas points to the immigrants' fewer years of education, and thus lowearnings, as the reason why welfare usage rises over time. An alternativeexplanation may be changes in eligibility. In the 1960s, there were stillresidence requirements in many states that required a person to live for six to12 months in the area before applying for welfare. Similarly, the 1990 Censusasked about welfare usage in 1989, when about one-third of the 1980s immigrantswere newly-legalized aliens who were not eligible for welfare assistance until,in most cases, 1993. Immigrants from Eastern Europe interviewed by a Wall Street Journal reporterrejected the notion that they come to the US to receive federal benefits; somenote that countries such as Canada are far more generous to immigrants. Underthe Republican proposal, legal immigrants already enrolled in assistanceprograms would have one year to transition to US citizenship, if they areeligible. The debate on immigrants and welfare is likely to emphasize that legalimmigration can impose costs on US taxpayers, and thus may lead to efforts toreduce legal immigration, now running at 900,000 per year. Simpson alsoannounced that he would push for the approval of legislation that would cutplanned legal immigration for five years, from 675,000 to 500,000 annually.Simpson believes that such a cut would give the US "breathing space" to absorbthe recent wave of immigrants. Simpson asserted that he would try to repeal the 1966 Cuban American AdjustmentAct, which allows all Cubans who reach US shores to become legal immigrantsafter one year. This may be politically difficult, since many Florida Cubansare ardent Republicans. Finally, Simpson wants to win approval for a counterfeit-resistantidentification system to improve the enforcement of employer sanctions.Simpson also announced his opposition to Prop. 187's denial of education toillegal alien children. In the House, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) has been named chair of theSubcommittee on Immigration and Claims. Smith has promised to "work diligentlyto write a bipartisan solution to the problem of illegal immigration." Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) has been named chair of a special congressional taskforce on immigration reform. The task force, whose membership has yet to bedetermined, will work with the Governors of border states to draft legislationto deal with immigration issues. Court decisions make it clear that Congress, but not the states, can denybenefits to legal and illegal immigrants. However, the US has traditionallytalked of "we the people" rather than "we US citizens." The Bill of Rights, forexample, defines the rights of people, not citizens, because the foundingfathers were citizens of individual states rather than the US. The debate within Republican circles over immigration continues, with Jack Kempand William Bennett arguing that Prop. 187-style efforts to discourage illegalimmigration by denying them services is wrong-headed and will push immigrantsinto the Democratic party, repeating historic party mistakes such as opposingthe civil rights movement. They would admit immigrants, but end bilingualismand affirmative action programs that permit immigrants to get specialpreferences under programs originally created to remedy governmentaldiscrimination against Blacks. Governor Wilson and William Buckley, on the other hand, believe that theRepublican party should embrace efforts to limit immigration.

There were 110,000 H-1B workersadmitted in FY92, and 93,000 in FY93. In 1993, 14 percent came from the UK,and 9 percent were from Japan. The regulations, published in the Dec. 20 Federal Register, require USemployers to meet tougher standards to have their need for H-1B workerscertified, and reduce the validity of the H-1B visas from six to three years.H-1B aliens are persons coming to work temporarily in the United States in"specialty occupations"--generally professional-level positions requiring atleast a bachelor's degree. There is to be an annual limit of 65,000 H-1Bvisas. Most of the disputes over the regulations involved proposals to require laborcontractors who were requesting certification to employ H-1B workers to satisfyadditional steps to certify that there was a genuine shortage of Americanworkers, and that the employment of the aliens would not displace US workers.In its final rule, the Department of Labor decided "at this time" not toestablish special procedures for contractors. The final regulation "is bothless burdensome for employers and more protective of workers" than the originalproposal, the department said. In a related story, several employee and lobbying groups are seeking to changeH-1B program, which they allege allowed a company to eliminate jobs in aLivingston, New Jersey plant and transfer the jobs to immigrant workers inNorth Carolina. The US Department of Labor is investigating NorthCarolina-based Syntel, which allegedly employed H-1B foreign workers in NC.Syntel claimed that American workers did not have the necessary skills forcertain programming language and software tasks. Many H-1B foreign workers arecomputer programmers and physical and occupational therapists. Robert Gebeloff, "Visa Program Under Fire; US Workers Losing Jobs," TheRecord, November 11, 1994.

Au pairs will have to complete at leastsix units of college work while in the US for one year, with host familiespaying up to $500 for tuition. There must be criminal checks of each au pair,and at least 40 hours of training. The original goal was an educational and cultural exchange "with a child-care component". However, there have been complaints of inadequatenannies and unscrupulous employers, justifying the new rules. The largest agency, Au Pair in America, complained that the new rules wouldsharply reduce the 3,500 families who use au pairs. The au pair programevolved from a mother's helper to live-in child care program, and these rulesare intended to reflect that transition.

Themajor conclusion was that the German population, now 81 million, will shrink,and that the foreigners' share of the population, now eight percent, willrise. Two major demographic issues were discussed. First, what will Germany'spopulation be in the 21st century, given that fertility is below replacementlevels and that the country is avowedly not a country of immigration? Second,how will the Germans be distributed between the former east and westernsections of the country? Under all population projections, Germany's population will shrink, butimmigration is the major demographic variable that will determine by how muchGermany's population shrinks. Government projections assume that 225,000ethnic German Aussiedler per year will arrive until the year 2000, and thentheir number will gradually decrease, so that none arrive in 2011. Even thoughGermany is not a country of immigration, it permits Germans and foreignersliving in the country to unify their families, so population projections havethree immigration scenarios: 100,000 net immigrants per year, 200,000, and300,000. Germany does not distinguish between foreigners and natives in its populationprojections. However, assuming that fertility throughout united Germanyconverges to the West German rate of 1.4 by 1996, that mortality converges by2030, that there are 300,000 net new immigrants per year, and that Germany doesnot change its naturalization laws and practices, in 2030 the population wouldshrink to 77 million, and foreigners would be 20 percent of all residents. If a net 400,000 foreigners arrived each year, and naturalizations remain atcurrent levels, foreigners would be 30 percent of the population in 2030. Thismeans that, in some cities, foreigners are likely to be a majority of thepopulation under current naturalization rates and policies. Some assert thatwell before Germany reached Swiss levels of foreigners--about 17percent--naturalization laws and procedures would change. Where will Germany's shrinking population live? At unification in 1990, therewere about 16 million East Germans and 63 million West Germans. Sinceunification, marriage and fertility rates in the East have fallensharply--further than they fell after World War II--and mortality has risensharply. This demographic shock in the east is expected to be short-lived. Much of thefertility decline is due to young women marrying later and postponing children.One reason why marriages and births declined by 65 percent since 1989 isbecause the demographic transition to capitalism was compressed in EastGermany, compared to the more gradual adjustments to the market in Poland andother East European nations. After East German women adjust to the 3 C's ofcareer, consumption, and childbirth, their marriage and fertility behavior isexpected to return to (low) West German levels. East Germany in the 21st century may no longer include one in five Germans. Between 1989 and 1993, some 1.3 million East Germans moved West, and250,000 persons in the West moved East, for a net internal migration of overone million. Even if young East German women who today seem to be delaying childbirth beginhaving children in their late 20s and early 30s, as expected, the fact thatvirtually all immigrants currently go to West Germany means that the EastGerman share of the German population is likely to shrink. If there were nomore internal migration after 2005, and fertility and mortality converge asexpected, East Germany would still shrink from about 16 million in 1990 to 13million by 2010, and older than average East German residents would representabout one in six Germans.

Almost one-fourth of the November 1994applicants were from the ex-Yugoslavia, and one-fifth were from Turkey. Of the 26,343 asylum cases decided in November, 8.3 percent were approved. Sofar in 1994, there have been decisions on 324,682 applications for asylum, andthere are another 119,076 cases awaiting decisions. Beginning December 8,nationals of the Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso require avisa to visit Germany. Germany spent a reported DM 15.5 billion ($10 billion) on the 400,000 personsfrom the former Yugoslavia who are in Germany in 1994, or $25,000 each. Several of Germany's 16 Laender have begun charging asylum seekers whoseapplications have been rejected the costs of their deportation. However, only5 to 10 percent of the failed asylum seekers actually pay. Removing aliens whodo not have the right to stay in Germany is the responsibility of individualLaender. Germany announced that to protest Turkey's sentencing eight Kurdish members ofparliament to prison terms for their alleged involvement with the KurdishWorkers Party (PKK), no Kurds would be returned to Turkey between December 12,1994 and January 20, 1995. The FDP announced that it may try to get the ban ondeportations extended, and the German Green party called for an economicembargo on Turkey and the granting of residence rights to Kurds in Germany.New Turkish Foreign Minister Soysal rejected criticism of Turkey's treatment of"the Kurdish problem." Turkey did not accept the 10 percent of the US's $360million in military aid for FY95 that was tied to Turkey's improvement of itshuman rights record. German Labor Minister Norbert Blum is planning to change rules and enforcementthat have allowed up to 100,000 British construction workers to be employed inGermany and not pay German Social Security taxes. The UK, joined by Portugal,blocked a European Commission plan to provide the same wages and employmentrights for workers "assigned" by their employers in other member states asthose that apply to local workers. This allegedly permitted low wage Britishconstruction workers to displace German construction workers. The Institute of German Business (IW) of Cologne surveyed German businesses andconcluded that foreigners were successfully integrated into schools, training,and jobs. Many foreign workers have been employed by the same companies foryears, and integration in the workplace is marked by tolerance andunderstanding. The language barrier has lessened over time, making forrelatively trouble-free communication. CSU leader Peter Gauweiler in Munich has called for an immigration law thatdistinguishes family, ethnic Germans, and humanitarian immigrants, and limitsoverall immigration in a US quota manner. Gauweiler complained that every yearthe equivalent of a new Dortmund is added to Germany via immigration. Other CSU politicians attacked this proposal. Some termed any immigrationundesirable given Germany's high unemployment rate and housing shortages, whileothers argued that Gauweiler's proposal was meant to obscure his realanti-immigrant position.

The Schengen Agreement, wasdrawn up in 1985, and implementation has been delayed four times. The Schengen Information System (SIS) in Strasbourg already includes data on700,000 criminals and other undesirables. EU General Affairs Council directive COM(94)38 requires member states to permitsettled nationals from within the EU to vote and to run for local office,opening the possibility of, e.g., a non-German Spanish mayor in Germany. EUcitizens already have the right to vote locally for members of the EuropeanParliament. France, Luxembourg and Belgium have been granted exceptionsbecause, e.g., mayors in France have some law enforcement powers, so that onlyFrench citizens may be elected mayor. In Luxembourg and Belgium, EU nationalsmust be residents for six years before they can vote in local elections. The French, who assume the Presidency of the EU effective January 1, 1995, havebeen asked to deal quickly with a long list of difficult immigration issues:the sharing between EU members of the burden resulting from the hosting ofrefugees, the development of common legal guarantees for asylum seekers, theuniform interpretation of the term "refugee," and determining which country isresponsible for each asylum application filed, according to the DublinConvention. In the past, it has proven to be hard to get the required unanimous approval of12 (15 after Jan. 1, 1995) interior and foreign affairs ministers on theseissues. Seven countries have agreed to remove passport controls between them as ofMarch 26, 1995. The Schengen Accord will also introduce a standard visa validin all the member countries and create a single information system for thepolice system. Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain andPortugal will implement the accord in March, while Italy and Greece will joinlater. Freer travel restrictions between the Schengen states will becounterbalanced by tougher identity checks at borders with non-EU nations tocounter crime and illegal immigration. Britain is opposed to an EU directive that would require standard treatment offoreign workers in EU countries. At the European Union summit in Essen, Germany, police detained 500 to 600people marched against EU immigration policies. The EU announced new programsto accelerate development of the EU's Mediterranean rim. Albania provides an example of the challenge. The 3.4 million residents havean average annual GDP of less than $500. The country received about $290million in foreign investment in 1993, only one-third as much as 600,000Albanians abroad sent home in remittances. Some hope to turn Albania into atourist destination for sun-seekers, but many beaches are not reachable byroad, and there are 750,000 concrete bunkers at others built to repelinvaders.

They have created a migrant smuggling business thatgenerates $5 to $7 billion annually, according to papers presented at the 11thseminar on migration held by the International Organization for Migration inGeneva October 26-28, 1994. The lowest fees are paid to smuggle aliens acrossland borders, as with the $300 fee often paid to cross the US-Mexican border,and the highest fees are paid to be smuggled long distances, as from China tothe US via southeast Asia and Latin America. The alien smuggling business requires an alien who is willing to pay to besmuggled across borders and a smuggler or intermediary willing to take thepayment and at least attempt the smuggling. Many alien smugglers also moveother items across borders, including drugs, since they already have falsedocuments, safe houses, and methods of arriving in remote areas of thedestination country. As industrial countries tighten their immigration controls, and pressures toemigrate rise, the cost of migrating illegally and the potential profits ofalien smugglers also increase. Migrants seeking a better life may wind up inthe clutches of often brutal international crime syndicates-- the reputation ofsuch organizations for revenge makes them reluctant witnesses against smugglerseven if they are detected. Some 230 delegates representing 70 governments and 40 internationalorganizations agreed that fighting international alien smuggling syndicatesshould become a higher priority on national and international agendas. Inwaging this fight, it was noted frequently that the rights of migrants shouldbe protected, and that the demand for migrant services should be reduced asmuch as possible by creating other options for migrants to enter industrialcountries. On the international level, governments were urged to see alien smuggling forwhat it is--a growth industry that permits often criminal elements to capturethe 10 or 20 to 1 income gaps between emigration and immigration countries.Freer trade and capital flows eliminated many of the profits to smugglers ofgoods and capital, and governments must realize that, if there is unevendevelopment in an increasingly integrated world in which migration isrestricted, they will have to place a high priority on combating aliensmuggling. Specific steps urged were the international exchange of data on aliensmugglers, agreements between countries on the return of migrants to theircountries of origin, and coordinated law enforcement efforts to deal withinternational aliens smuggling syndicates. Longer term measures to acceleratestay-at-home development were also recommended. A study on transit migration in Hungary released by the InternationalOrganization for Migration reports that up to two million migrants are livingin Central Europe who want to move to the West. Their number is continuing togrow, because of the war in the former Yugoslavia, and immigration regulationsin Western Europe strand migrants in Central Europe. Over 70 percent of the migrants questioned about their future plans wanted tomove West; 60 percent said they would go to any Western nation. Germany andAustria are the favored destinations for people from Eastern Europe; the US ispreferred by those from the former Soviet Union. In Hungary, an estimated70,000 to 100,000 foreigners are working illegally. Most are young single men;60 percent are college educated. The Hungarian government will issue 2,000immigration permits for 1995. IOM is an international organization that helps member states to managemigration, that conducts research on international migration, and thatencourages social and economic development via migration. A summary of theconference papers on alien smuggling will be published in InternationalMigration, Vol. 4 for 1994, and are available from IOM, PO Box 71, CH-1211Geneva 19, Switzerland.

All 26 cantons approved themeasure to deal with the estimated 200,000 illegal aliens in the country. Over80 percent of the voters in Zurich, the scene of recent clashes betweenAlbanian Kosovar and Lebanese drugs gangs, approved the measure. The police will be permitted to detain migrants or asylum- seekers who do not have adequate identity documents--initially for three months, extendible to oneyear if it takes that long to determine their identity and to carry out theirrepatriation. Opponents complained that the campaign convinced many Swiss thatmost foreigners are involved with illegal drug activities.

On December 6, Haider demanded systematicidentity checks, more detention centers and special deportation flights inorder to free Austria of illegal immigrants. There are 600,000 foreigners in Austria, making them about eight percent of thecountry's 7.6 million people. Their unemployment rate is about double thenational 5.5 percent rate. There are alleged to be 250,000 illegal aliens living in Austria, contributingto organized criminal activities in the country. FP leader Haider threatenedto put an "Austria First" initiative on the ballot if Austria's InteriorMinister did not take "definitive action" against illegal immigration,including the immediate deportation of aliens without valid residence permits.In February 1993, 417,000 Austrians signed a petition to hold a referendum on aplan to reduce appeals for persons scheduled for deportation and to establishquotas on the number of aliens in each city.

If approved byParliament, as expected, Belgium hopes to put out of business transportcompanies that deceive aliens into thinking that they can apply for asylum inBelgium after their arrival. According to Belgian authorities, one African airline flew to Brussels threetimes within one month with 20 to 30 illegal alien passengers on each flight.Some 3,000 passengers arrive at Brussels airport without proper paperwork, andhalf are sent home immediately. The authorities say that the new law does notrequire transport operators to be immigration inspectors, but it does requirethem to verify that passengers have the correct documentation.

Of those, 95 percent go toGermany, Israel or the US. More that 40 percent of the emigrants are ethnicGermans, 20 percent Russians, and 15 percent Jews. The majority are fromMoscow and St. Petersburg or from Siberia's Omsk Region and Altay Territory. FMS also reported forced migration from Chechnya in December. The number ofrefugees was 500 to 700 per day at the beginning of the conflict, and increasedto over 2,000 per day on December 23-24. The FMS reports that all refugees whoapplied to the Territorial Migration Service are assisted with accommodations,meals, and stipends. According to authorities in neighboring Ingushetian, Moscow has done little tohelp them with the influx of Chechen refugees. An Ingushetian official saidthat 65,000 refugees crossed the border since Russia sent troops to Chechnya onDecember 11. FMS replied that only one-third of the refugees had soughtassistance from the state since December 8. "Russian population declines as emigration remains high, "BBC, December 16,1994.

For example, over 98 per cent of Tamils were allowedto remain in the UK before July 1993, versus 16 percent since the law went intoeffect. The new law permits the detention of asylum seekers and streamlines theapplication and appeal process. As of September 30, 1994, there were 52,7604 asylum applications pending in the UK, and 600 asylumapplicants were detained as of June 1994.

According to the Labor Ministry, about 15,000 work permits wereissued to foreigners in 1994, while 150,000 foreigners worked illegally. Most of the illegal workers are Russians, Ukrainians and Belarussians. TheInterior Ministry reported that 10 million Russians, 2.3 million Ukrainians and1.5 million Belarussians visited Poland in the first nine months of 1994. Mostengaged in petty trade, but some got seasonal jobs in construction oragriculture. The illegals also include American English teachers. About 2.8 million Poles, or 16 percent of the Polish labor force, areunemployed, and the employment of foreign workers is believed to aggravatePolish unemployment. However, half of the Polish unemployed are believed towork while drawing unemployment benefits. On December 18, 1994, the Hungarian government announced that it would permit2,000 immigrants in 1995. There are estimated to be 200,000 illegal alienworkers in Hungary.

There are about 450,000 registeredforeigners living in Spain, making foreigners about 1.3 percent of thepopulation. Some 55 percent are from African countries, and 28 percent arefrom South America. In addition, there are an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 illegal aliens in Spain.Spanish unions and human rights groups are calling for Spain to develop animmigration policy, and the Socialist government has called for policies topromote the integration of resident foreigners by, inter alia, makingnaturalization easier.

About 79,000 persons are expected to emigrate in 1994, due in part tothe country's high unemployment, about the same level of emigration as in 1993.Net migration is expected to be 25,000 in 1994, versus 44,000 in 1993. Net migration contributed half of the Netherlands population growth in 1993,and 30 percent in 1994. Financieele Dagblad December 3, 1994 _________________________________________ Cubansseek asylum in Sweden Sweden imposed a visa requirement on Cubans effective January 1, 1995,generating a reported "flood" of Cuban asylum seekers in December, 15 to 20each day, most arriving on flights from Madrid. About 1200 Cubans have appliedfor asylum in Sweden, including 350 in December. Since July 1994, 68 Cubanshave been granted asylum, and 196 have been rejected, but virtually all haveappealed. Most Swedish youth favor immigration, according to a poll of 5,000 high schoolstudents. Some 57 percent thought immigration enriched Sweden in 1994, versus44 percent in 1993. Youth from higher income and status families had morepositive attitudes toward immigrants. Most youth, 61 percent, want the number of immigrants reduced.

Nihon is thelargest university in Japan--it has about 5,000 professors and 80,000 studentson 14 campuses--and it differs from other Japanese universities in its concernfor issues throughout Asia. Most of the papers dealt with the challenge of managing migration to Japan. Byall measures, the number of foreigners entering Japan has been rising sharply.The number of foreign arrivals in 1992 was four million, the number offoreigners registered as living in the country was 1.3 million, and the numberof foreigners who overstayed the tourist visas most foreigners use to enterJapan was about 300,000. The focus of most papers was on foreigners who work in Japan. There are onlyabout 100,000 legal foreigners among the country's 62 million workers. Aboutone-fourth of these legal foreign workers are entertainers, one-fourth areengaged in international services, including teaching English, and 10 percentare engineers. Japan does not permit the importation of unskilled foreign workers, but thereare believed to be 300,000 to 500,000 illegal foreign workers in the country,mostly filling so-called 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult. Over60,000 foreign workers were apprehended in 1992 and 1993, and two-thirds werefrom three countries--Malaysia, Iran, and Korea--with each country accountingfor about 14,000 apprehensions. About four-fifths of the illegal foreignworkers were men, and half of them were working in construction,--anotherone-fourth were detected working in factories. One-third of the women detectedwere hostesses, and another one-sixth were working in factories. Japan is well aware of the gap between its policy of no unskilled foreignworkers and the reality that at least several hundred thousand such workers areat work. However, there seems to be little consensus for a large-scaleimmigration solution. If legal immigration to Japan were at British levels of0.1 percent of the population, Japan would accept about 125,000 immigrantsannually. If Japan took as many immigrants as the US, it would accept 500,000immigrants annually, adding about 0.4 percent to the population annually viaimmigration. There also seems to be in Japan little enthusiasm for a German-styleguestworker system, through which about 10 percent of the workforce in Germanyeventually became foreign workers. In the Japanese case, this would implyabout six million foreign workers. The major fear of adopting the Germanprobationary immigrant system--workers who proved to be satisfactory could havetheir work and residence permits renewed, and send for their families--is thesettlement of "incompatible foreigners." Japan has not totally rejected the immigration and guestworker options. Thereare 150,000 mostly Brazilian descendants of turn-of-the-century Japaneseemigrants to South America in Japan, and about 100,000 legal foreign workers.But there is little possibility that these systems will be used to admit morethan perhaps 500,000 foreign workers. Instead of opening the front door to legal immigrants, or the guestworker sidedoor, Japan seems most likely to tolerate unauthorized workers and to acceptforeign workers through trainee and student sidedoors. If backdoor andnon-labor market sidedoors turn out to be the major avenues through whichforeign workers enter Japan, then Japan will be charting a new path to managingmigration, implicitly asserting that the unskilled foreign workers present inthe country are unwanted or that they are simply acquiring skills to be used athome. It is not clear that the Japanese attempt to use trainee, student, andtoleration-of-unauthorized worker policies will prove durable in the 21stcentury. There are fears that these polices, singly or in combination, couldgenerate immigrant settlement in Japan and socio-economic problems There was a great deal of discussion of the trainee program. Since 1954, theJapanese government has had a program under which young Asians could enter thecountry to receive training that would accelerate their country's development.Japanese firms that invested abroad used this program to train future countrymanagers since the 1950s. But over the past five years, small Japanese firms that have never investedabroad have become dependent on foreign trainees. There are 40,000 traineesemployed in Japan in 1994. About 90 percent are Asian, including 40 percentfrom China. Most--83 percent --are employed in manufacturing, usually by smalland medium-sized firms. The trainees are generally very well educated by thestandards of their countries of origin. Many prominent Japanese advocate expanding the trainee system to permit up to500,000 foreigners to enter Japan. To most outside observers, this would meanthat Japan is opening itself to foreign workers, although calling themtrainees. Trainees get paid $400 to $800 monthly, or just one-fourth toone-half as much as Japanese workers. The quality and content of the trainingis left up to each firm, so there is room for abuse in both training and in thehousing that employers are required to provide trainees. Finally, there issupposed to be a one-year limit on how long trainees can stay in Japan,although employers are pushing for a two-year limit. There was general agreement that the problem of managing immigration--whichresults from rapid growth and labor shortages--is far preferable to thealternative of emigration pressures. However, there was widespread criticismof the short-term perspective through which most Asian policy makers evaluatemigration issues, producing many skeptics of the notion that there will be yetanother Asian miracle in finding a mutually beneficial way to manage labormigration and avoid unanticipated results. _________________________________________ Foreigners in Japan A private panel on December 26 recommended to the Justice Ministry that Japanincrease the number of foreign workers with specialized skills, and alsoincrease efforts to detect and deport illegal aliens. The panel noted that1990 revisions to Japan's immigration laws have increased the number offoreigners overstaying their visas. Since a September crackdown, some 2365 illegal foreigners--1,442 men and 923women--have been deported from Japan. Most were apprehended while working inor near Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. One-quarter (509) of those apprehended werefrom South Korea, 363 were Thais, and 292 were Chinese. Four unions in the Tokyo area are expected to call for equal treatment offoreign workers under labor laws in a paper to be released in February 1995.Between April 1993 and March 1994, 404 cases of work-related problems involvingforeign workers were brought to the four unions. Over one-third of thecomplaints involved unpaid wages, and another one-third involved layoffs. In Tokyo, a Chinese illegal alien who sued authorities for injuries shereceived during an October 31, 1994 immigration raid was deported. The JusticeMinistry has ordered an inquiry into allegations that Japanese immigrationofficials frequently use violence against foreign detainees. In late December,two Chinese illegal aliens were given jail sentences for visa violations; onearrived on a two-year student visa six years ago. Thailand's foreign minister personally gave 20,000 baht ($800) to the familiesof two Thai workers who committed suicide in Japan in 1994. Both Thais paid200,000 baht each to job brokers, who then left them to fend for themselves inJapan. The Thai government has launched an educational campaign to help prevent Thaiworkers from being deceived by job brokers about the prospects for work inJapan. There are believed to be 50,000 Thais living illegally in Japan. There are reported to be hundreds of "orphans" in Japan, usually the childrenof illegal alien women and Japanese men. They are non-persons in Japan. According to one summary, the Japanese believe themselves to be descended froma sun goddess, and there is reportedly widespread agreement that the Japanesegene pool must be protected from contamination. In order to be a Japanesecitizen from birth, a Japanese father must acknowledge his paternity before theforeign woman gives birth. In some cases, children of Japanese mother and aforeign father can be considered Japanese. A missionary couple was able to use a 19th century law to persuade the JapaneseSupreme Court to grant citizenship to a baby they adopted after it wasabandoned by a woman believed to be a Filipino prostitute. Local officialsreportedly conducted one -year checks of two and three year olds to determinewhether they had criminal records that might invalidate their naturalizationapplications. Aliens can petition for Japanese citizenship after three years of lawfulresidence, but the Catch 22 is that Japan allegedly does not permit three yearsof lawful residence to persons likely to apply for naturalization.

A. Navamunkundan of the National Union of Plantation Workers(NUPW), one of the world's largest farm worker unions, countered that thesolution to plantation labor shortages in Malaysia is "to uplift the image ofthe plantation industry by providing high wages and good employment benefitsfor the workers." If plantations were considered "industrial agriculture,"they might be expected to pay factory wages and attract workers now pouringinto electronics and other factories. One official criticized the rubber industry for not adopting the labor-savingtools developed by the Rubber Research Institute. Semi-automatic tappingknives, for example, are cheap, but are not widely used, in part becauseforeign workers have been readily available. According to one official,Malaysian plantations will have to continue to rely on foreign workers, butforeign workers should not be considered a long-term solution to laborshortages. It was estimated that Malaysia has lost over 6,000 bus and truck drivers toSingapore because of higher wages there. A political and economic risk servicepredicted recently that Malaysia's current labor shortage will affect thecountry's competitiveness seriously and prove a real threat to economic growthin 1995. As a result of abuses, Malaysian employers may no longer be allowed to directlyrecruit foreign workers, according to the Home Ministry. After the firstmeeting ever held between the Home Ministry and recruitment agencies, it wasannounced that there have been cases of Malaysian employers extorting moneyfrom foreign workers coming into the country. Since January 1, 1994, Malaysia has banned the recruitment of unskilled andsemi-skilled foreign workers, but permitted exceptions in some cases foremployers who recruit foreign workers directly. Malaysia requires 70 local forevery 30 foreign workers in most Malaysian workplaces, but grants exceptions tosectors such as plantations. The Human Resources Ministry's Prospective Employment in Manufacturing survey predicts that, despite current shortages of unskilled workers, by 2000there will be surpluses of unskilled workers, and shortages of skilled andprofessional workers. Malaysia has one of Asia's highest percentage of foreignworkers, 4 to 10 percent, depending on the estimate, much higher than theestimated one percent in Taiwan and 0.6 percent in Japan. Most foreign workersin Malaysia are unskilled workers in the plantation and construction sectors. "Employers May Not Be Allowed To Hire Foreign Workers Directly," BusinessTimes, December 17, 1994.

The changes take effect on April 1,1995. Employers of foreign workers must pay a monthly levy or tax to the government,making Singapore one of the few countries to take advantage of wage gapsbetween countries to increase its general tax revenues. Most observers believethat the wages paid to foreign workers are lower because of the levy. Singapore's Labor Minister told builders that "You must be able to steer awayfrom the mind-set of going for low-cost and low-skilled labor and low-techmethods." In November 1992, the construction sector was allowed to use fiveforeign workers for each local worker, up from the previous three to one ratio,but construction productivity did not improve. Therefore, the levy onunskilled construction workers will go up by 10 per cent from $S 400 ($275) to$ 440 a month, while the levy on skilled workers will go down by 20 per centfrom $S 250 to $ 200. Local observers expect subcontractors to be hit hardest by the higher levies.Many general contractors turn over work at piece-rates to "kepalas" or laborsub-contractors who hire their own workers--many kepala worker are believed tobe illegal aliens. Between January and September 1994, Singapore courts levied fines totaling S$4.1 million on 278 employers of illegal foreign workers. In 1993, 415employers were fined S$ 4.3 million; Singapore expects fines to be higher in1994. Employers of illegal alien workers can be fined up to 24 months of thelevy due on them. With levies running S$ 300 to S$ 450 per month, this makesfines S$ 7,200 ($4900) and S$ 9,600 per illegal worker. Employers of illegalaliens can also be jailed for six months to two years and, if they hired morethan five illegal workers at the same time, caned. In early December, courts levied some of the heaviest ever fines, S$16,000 perillegal alien worker hired at a construction site; S$ 25,200 for hiring twoMalaysians as hairdressers(42 months' levy), S$ 9,600 or 32 months' levy forhiring a Malaysian illegal worker as a stall assistant, $ 10,500 or 35 months'levy for employing a food service worker, and S$ 10,500 or 35 months' levy foremploying an illegal Malaysian as a welder.. The Labor Ministry has promised to monitor closely pick-up points whereemployers look for illegal foreign workers. In one account of a 2 am police raid on a construction site, 16 of 200 foreignworkers were determined to be illegal aliens. At another site, 19 illegalaliens were arrested after the police were called in to break up a fight. An illegal Chinese immigrant who entered Singapore in 1943, and married aSingaporean in 1983, was jailed for three months and one week when it wasdiscovered that, for several years, he was using a friend's identity card. Hemay not be repatriated, but the Immigration Department stressed that "illegalimmigrants cannot be allowed to settle down in Singapore on the same terms aspermanent residents as this would only encourage many others to resort tounlawful means to reside here." Like many other Asian nations, Singapore has a Central Provident Fund (CPF) towhich employers and workers each contribute 40 percent of their wages.Singaporean citizens can withdraw of up to 40 percent of their CPF savings tobuy a house, but the estimated 50,000 Malaysian workers and other foreignworkers are only allowed to withdraw their CPF contributions after the age of55.

The Thai government has recognized the shortage ofprofessionals, and has allowed unskilled workers entry on a provisional basis. There are an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 illegal foreign workers inThailand--most are from Burma, now known as Myanmar. The Thai immigrationauthorities complain that they can detain only 1,500 illegal immigrants, andthat at least two months are required to process the paperwork needed to deportan illegal immigrant. Today's fourth wave of Thai workers who emigrate no longer find riches abroad,according to Amara. Recruiters often take one-third of their wages, and theyare subject to exploitation abroad. This is very different from the first waveof male and semi-skilled Thais who went to the Middle East in the 1970s, andthe second wave of less skilled males who also went to the Middle East inthe 1980s. The third wave in the late 1980s saw Thai workers shift towardAsian destinations, and more women among the migrants. The Thai National Security Council estimates that in the past few years 283,500Burmese, both labor migrants and political dissidents, have entered Thailand.Burmese seek low-wage jobs in factories, agriculture and fishing boats.Burmese women find work as maids, in factories or small shops and asprostitutes. There are estimates that 10,000 immigrants travel between Rangoonand Victoria Point on Thai fishing boats earning about 1,500 to 2,000 baht permonth. The Burmese work first on the fishing trawlers then move onto higherpaying work in construction or shops. Thai officials acknowledge thatemployers take advantage of the illegal Burmese workers who can not complaindue to fears of arrest and deportation. In Thailand, some 40,000 to 50,000 Hmong political refugees and asylum-seekersfear repatriation to Laos under the Luang Prabang Tripartite Agreement (LPTA),launched in 1991 by the Thai, Laotian and United Nations' High Commissioner forRefugees with US financing. In September, 1994, some 5,000 refugees at the NaPho camp in northeast Thailand signed a petition sent to the US Congress,asking it to stop their forced repatriation to Laos. The Hmong are protestingthe Laotian government's role in where and how they are resettled.

Inequality is believed to be a major force motivating internal migration withinand from China. Those employed in joint-venture factories along China'ssouthern coast can earn $100 per month, ten times the monthly wage in otherareas of China. Their wages are rising faster than inflation, which is risingat about 40 percent per year, while other workers' wages are not. Chinese cities in the booming coastal areas are taxing the wage gap between theregions by charging internal migrants $3,000 to $10,000 for the residencepermits needed to obtain housing and subsidized food and transportation in them(Oct. MN). These richer areas can afford to pay more for food, driving up foodprices everywhere, and investments in the coastal areas appear more promising,so savings leave poorer regions. Some speculate that the increasing inequalitybetween cities and rural areas, and between China's 30 provinces, could fuelboth migration and unrest. Shanghai, a city of 7.1 million, has over 3 million temporary residents.Special organizations offer technical training for migrant workers. The citygovernment has developed regulations to manage migrants, and established laboroffices for them. Nearly 1.35 million people from outside the city haveregistered in Shanghai, and 500,000 have received certificates to work. Over48,000 people have been sent back to their homes since August, 1994. Beijing is also considering legislation to control the capital's 3.4 millionmigrants. Laws aimed at controlling crime, transport, public hygiene, andfamily planning are expected in 1995. Beijing has a permanent population ofover 10 million. Fifty-five percent of the temporary population have lived inthe city for over six months, and 23 percent for more than one year. Many ofthe workers live in "villages" named after their native provinces and work invegetable markets, construction and service industries.

Korea Thousands of ethnic Chinese Koreans who speak Korean have moved from nearbyJilin province into Korea. There are an estimated 31,000 Chinese citizens --80 percent of them ethnic Koreans -- in South Korea, and their legal statusranges from legal worker to trainee to illegal alien. There are at least 78,000 foreign workers, including the Korean Chinese, inSouth Korea. Most have "3-D" jobs-- "dirty, difficult or dangerous". Wagesaverage $1,250 monthly in Seoul, versus $50 per month in China, but workers areexpected to work much harder in Korea. The Korean Federation of Small Businesses surveyed 16,000 small- andmedium-sized companies and reported that they need more than 200,000 additionalforeign workers. Respondents preferred, in order, workers from China, thePhilippines and Vietnam. About 25,000 migrants work legally in SouthKorea--most are ethnic Koreans from China. Another 52,000 are believed to beworking illegally in the country. Foreign workers reportedly average $500-600monthly. Most Korean union groups oppose the importation of foreign workers.

Some 800,000 Vietnamese were re-settled in the US. The Vietnamese who return, known as "Viet kieu," contribute a large share ofthe $600 million annually that flows from the US to Vietnam. Many are in their20s and 30s, and use family ties to cut through Vietnam's red tape. There isalso a return of the elderly, some of whom are able to buy or build the nicesthomes in their village with US pension moneys. The Vietnamese exodus, which began in 1975, is finally coming to a close.About 40,000 Vietnamese remain in camps in Hong Kong and elsewhere in SoutheastAsia, and only about 1,000 of these camp residents are expected to be acceptedby the US before the camps are closed in 1995. Second, the Amerasian childrenof American servicemen, who came to the US directly from Vietnam, has admittedabout 20,000 Amerasians and 60,000 of their family members, and is just aboutover. Third, the refugee program for 35,000 former political prisoners andabout 110,000 family members will end in 1995. Hong Kong and Vietnam have had some discussions about the repatriation of boatpeople to Vietnam. On December 16, Vietnam rejected 150 boat people releasedfrom Hong Kong citing nationality problems. Vietnam has affirmed itscommitment to both voluntary and forced repatriation of screened-out migrantsfrom Hong Kong, but said it will only accept legal Vietnamese nationals.Britain would like to resolve the problem of Vietnamese migrants in Hong Kongprior to 1997. Vietnam protested on December 12 what it called a "massacre" of Vietnamesenationals in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge, allegedly under the cover of theImmigration Law approved by the Cambodian Parliament in August 1994. The KhmerRouge responded that there are four million Vietnamese in Cambodia, and thatall should be expelled. Cambodia has a population of about 10 million and aGDP per capita of $250; Vietnam has 73 million people.

In Taiwan, persons who are not union members cannot strike. The factory changed the way it repaid wage deductions unilaterally. Like manyTaiwanese employers, Far Eastern opened a savings account for each foreignworker, and deducted wages each month until NT$30,000 ($1150) wasaccumulated--workers forfeit the moneys in the savings account if they(unlawfully) seek new employment. Instead of repaying the deductions withinterest in a lump sum, the factory decided to repay them in installments overtwo months. There are believed to be 5000 illegal Filipino workers in Taiwan. TheTaiwanese government has threatened to locate and deport those who do not leavevoluntarily before a crackdown scheduled to begin before the Chinese NewYear at the end of January Taiwan has experienced a sharp increase in the number of foreign workerspermitted to enter, but the Council of Labor Affairs Chairman argued that COLAdoes not have the resources to manage these foreign workers. About 12 staffdeal with the employers of 200,000 foreign workers. On December 19, the Industrial Development Bureau approved 18 new "majorinvestment cases" by companies deemed to have an urgent need to hire foreignworkers. Companies investing over NT$ 200 million get special priority tobring foreign workers into Taiwan, and these companies increased their plannedinvestments in order to obtain priority to get foreign workers.

The Lao People's DemocraticRepublic will begin fining both employers who hire and foreign workers at workwithout permits on January 1, 1995. Employers are required to report theiremployment of foreign workers each June and December.

Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, SouthAfrica's Home Affairs Minister, blamed illegal immigrants for a crime wavewhich he says has reached "almost unmanageable proportions." South Africa,which once had stringent border controls to keep out African National Congressguerrillas, today has very relaxed entry controls, especially for travelersarriving at night. The illegals include persons from nearby countries such as Mozambique,Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola; migrants from West Africa, who are reportedlyinvolved in smuggling, trading and using hard drugs; and people fleeing thechaos in Rwanda. Many Africans who arrive in South Africa as tourists applyfor residence permits once they are in the country. Some 57,333 aliens have been sent home between January and September 1994,including 43,345 from Mozambique and 9,204 from Zimbabwe. Some 93,600 illegalimmigrants were returned in 1993. Some in South Africa reportedly feel the need to accommodate "economicrefugees" after years of being responsible for destabilizing the region. Withthe unemployment rate running 42 percent for those 15 to 30-years old, thegovernment plans to tighten up border controls and stiffen penalties, includingjail sentences, on employers who hire illegal aliens. Airlines that bringpassengers who do not have proper documents will also face fines. Ray Kennedy, " South Africa plans clampdown on illegal immigrants," The Times, December 5, 1994.

Many of these asylum seekersare former residents of Vietnam who were forced to return to China. Most illegal immigrants are detained until the Immigration Department hasdecided whether to accord them asylum as political refugees. Australia's HighCourt decided that no applicant for asylum can be held in detention longer than273 days. Some applicants were held for two or three years, and the governmentis considering paying them about $1 for each day there were held. Under new legislation, Australia does not grant asylum if the applicant hasalready been refused recognition as a political refugee by another country. There are reportedly 80,000 illegal immigrants in Australia. Most arrived astourists or students and overstayed their visas. Australia's 1994-95 immigration target is 73,000, a 16 per cent or 10,000increase over 1993-94. For 1995-96, the target will be 84,700. Australia hasabout 18 million people, and a 1992 average GNP of $17, 260. According to the 1991 Census, a higher proportion of migrants receive pensions,sickness benefits and welfare payments than do people born in Australia.

This law was expectedto reduce the foreign community, which is about 75 percent of the emirate's 2.1million residents, by up to 300, 000. According to some businessmen, the UAE government ordered employers to reducesome salaries offered to foreign workers in order to discourage or make themineligible to bring their families to the UAE.

The Key to Europe-a comparative analysis of entry andasylum policies in Western Countries. Available from ICMPD, Mollwaldplatz 4,A-1040 Vienna, Fax-43-1504-46-7775.(1500 words) How should the world's leading region of emigration at the beginning of the20th century deal with the fact that it has become the world's majordestination for immigrants at the end of the 20th century? This report, prepared for a Swedish Parliamentary Committee, provides avaluable overview of immigration into Western Europe that stresses three majorpoints. First, the number of persons entering Europe to settle there is at apost-WWII high of about three million per year--despite all the talk ofFortress Europe, immigration is up, not down, in the 1990s as compared to theguestworker 1960s. Second, about one-half of the annual entrants to Europe areirregular family or economic migrants. Third, there is a convergence in boththe reality and policies in all of the rich industrial democracies that asylumprocessing must be speeded up, and persons who do not have a legitimate claimto safe haven are removed promptly, and that more efforts must be made toreduce illegal immigration. The starting point for the report is that immigration to Europe is ratchetingupward, but that ever-larger immigration flows are not the answer to eitherEurope's or the emigration countries' problems. There are alternatives toimmigration to deal with Europe's demographic and economic problems, and morechildren will make Europe "younger" much quicker than even massive immigration.Second, the immigrants without much education arriving in Europe today may notdo well, given structural changes in the economy. Third, immigrants arechanging the character of Europe's major cities, threatening to create in theman underclass that will make downtowns there like US inner cities. The report outlines five phases of postwar European immigration. The firstphase, from the end of WWII to 1964, was marked by the belief that freemovement was mutually beneficial in the evolving "United States of Europe," andsome 500,000 migrants per year moved across borders for at least temporarystints abroad. The second or guestworker phase from 1965 to 1972 saw over onemillion foreigners per year arriving as probationary immigrants. The theorywas that, at the end of their one or two year contracts, they would be rotatedhome to their country of origin, and then replaced by another Italian or Turkif there was still a demand for unskilled labor in northern European factoriesand construction sites. The third phase from 1973 to 1982 saw numerous efforts to encourage the returnof settled guestworkers ant to restrict the entry of more foreigners.Immigration fell to about 700,000 annually. The fourth phase, from 1983 to 1989, saw an average 1.2 million foreignersarriving, and many asked for asylum in Europe. The fifth and current phase that began in 1989 is marked by 5 major streams ofmigrants(1993 entries) --family unification(1.4 million), --asylum seekers and those seeking temporary protection from wars athome(630,000), --the return of "citizens" to their countries of origin, as ethnic Germans toGermany(242,000), --illegal immigrants(350,000) --and temporary workers(300,000). The total number of entries peaked at almost three million in 1992, and wasreduced to about 2.6 million, excluding temporary workers, in 1993 by asylumreforms in Germany and stepped-up efforts to reduce illegal immigration. Part II of the report provides country-by-country summaries of immigrationpatterns since WWII. Austria was converted from a transit country to a countryof immigration by guestworker recruitment and its attractiveness to asylumseekers, so that the 700,000 foreigners in the country are nine percent of thepopulation. Denmark's foreign population was changed by guestworkers andasylum seekers from mostly Nordics to include more southern Europeans. Finlandhas traditionally been a country of emigration, but it has since 1990 begun toreceive asylum seekers--almost 4,000 in 1992. Non-immigrant Germany is Europe's major country of immigration. As in Austriaand Switzerland, guestworkers recruitment laid the basis for subsequentimmigration. Most of the guestworker recruitment was concentrated in the fouryears between 1968 and 1972, when the number of guestworkers rose from 1 to 2.6million, and their share of the labor force rose from 5 to 12 percent. Germanefforts to reduce immigration were only short-lived successes, and its generousasylum policy produced an estimated one million entrants to the former WestGermany in 1990. Germany has revised its asylum policies, and offeredtemporary worker opportunities to especially Eastern Europeans. France is Europe's traditional country of immigration, giving France one of theeasiest paths to naturalization. France recruited guestworkers in the 1960s,but under programs that were relatively inefficient, so that illegal arrivaland subsequent regularization of status became the norm. This toleration ofillegal immigrants has produced in France several amnesties that were coupledwith tougher enforcement of immigration laws. France in November 1993toughened its asylum and immigration policies to make it easier to removefailed asylum seekers and to make immigration more difficult. The same themes run through the other country studies. In most, immigrationratcheted upward despite policies designed to stabilize or reduce the foreignpopulation, and the frustration prompted sometimes significant changes inimmigration and asylum polices. Perhaps the most useful part of the book is its sketch of the possibilities forinternational cooperation to regulate immigration. Immigration is probably themost important international phenomenon that is not being coordinated by a aninternational organization. Imagine the confusion if trade in goods were dealtwith as are immigration flows--there would be no common definition or data, noagreement on the costs and benefits of policy choices, and no organization toenforce the rules laid down for nation-states. The report ends on the reminder that doing nothing is not a solution--theproblems of managing migration are likely to get more rather than less severeover time. European experience shows that, over the past 50 years, it has beenthe form of immigration, but not the fact of immigration, that has changed inresponse to government policies. As countries change from active selection ofnewcomers to coping with those who arrive, costs and frustrationmount--processing and caring for asylum seekers in 1993 cost $11 to $12billion. Immigration is a major international challenge at the dawn of the 21st century,as it was at the beginning of the 20th century. The 20th century experience ofintegrating European immigrants is today regarded as one of the majorachievements of North America. Reports like this one can help European leadersto ensure that their efforts to manage migration will be viewed favorably 100years from now. The European Institute organized a December 12 discussion of European-Americanimmigration experiences, and Widgren there emphasized that there is in Europetoday a (false) sense that immigration has been dealt with successfully. Thenumber of asylum seekers is down, East-West migration has been channeledlargely into temporary worker, ethnic citizen, and petty trader outlets, andthe threat of anti-immigrant political parties seems to have faded. Butsignificant problems remain. There could yet be a wave of refugees fromEastern Europe and the ex-USSR, and the tensions between freedom of movementand border controls within the EU could prove to be very divisive. The facts speak for themselves. The richest 15 percent of the world'spopulation--the 828 million residents of what the World Bank calls the 22high-income countries--accounted for almost 80 percent of the world's $23trillion GDP in 1992. Their share of the world's population is shrinking,while their share of world GDP has risen since 1970. The result are huge gapsin wages and incomes--an average person's income can be 10 or 20 or 40 timeslarger in one of the high income country. The result, not surprisingly, ismigration pressures, as the three revolutions of the pastgeneration--communications, transportation, and rights--make it easier to learnthat the grass is greener abroad, get to another country, and then staythere. There was general agreement that managing mass migrations would be a majorchallenge to governments in the 1990s and beyond, but little sense of wherepolicy makers should jump into the migration issue. Some stressed the need toprevent mass refugee movements by preventing war. Others suggested thatimmigration countries might look at their own policies to see what magnets areattracting refugees. Some stressed the need to deal with alien smugglers whoare profiting handsomely by taking advantage of differences of 10 or 20 to onein wages, while others thought it more important to learn how to deal betterwith immigration emergencies, as occur when Albanians set out for Italy orHaitians and Cubans for the US. Finally, some want to attack the root causesof migration, which might imply much more aid and trade with emigrationcountries and, at least in the short run, more emigration from them. In the search for transatlantic solutions to the common problem of managingmigration, it was noted that there is a fundamental difference between dealingwith goods and people. People crossing borders are far more complex than eventhe most sophisticated computer that is traded, but there is also anotherdifference--there is agreement that trade in goods should be as free aspossible, and estimates of the benefits of freer trade. Europe and NorthAmerica do not yet have common migration goals, and there is no consensus onthe benefits and costs or open and closed borders. Perhaps the fundamental problem is that people are ever changing, so that thereare few timeless principles in managing migration. _______________ NEHImmigration Seminar Roger Waldinger will direct a summer 1995 seminar for college teachers at UCLAon "Contemporary Immigration to the United States."

The loan guarantee proposal was withdrawnon January 31, 1995, and replaced with a package of aid that does not requireCongressional approval. Mexico's peso hit a record low of US$1=6.55 on January 30, 1995, down over40 percent from the $1=3.45 pesos on December 20, 1994. After the announcementof the aid program, the peso rebounded to $1=5.75 pesos. Many in Congress wanted to make the loan guarantee conditional on Mexicocooperating with the US to reduce illegal immigration. Although the aidpackage has no formal side conditions on immigration, US officials reportedthat there was an "understanding" that Mexico would cooperate with the US tomanage migration. President Clinton, among others, argued that the Mexican aid package would"help us to better protect our borders." The 1982 peso devaluation of 72percent was followed by a 30 percent increase in apprehensions in 1983and 1984, from about 1 million to 1.3 million. Legal and unauthorized Mexican migration to the US, which averaged about300,000 settlers and 800,000 to two million sojourners per year over the pastdecade, is expected to increase as a result the peso devaluation and hard timesin Mexico. The US Treasury originally predicted 30 percent or 430,000additional illegal entries in 1995--implying a "normal" flow of 1.4 millionunauthorized Mexican entries per year-- if the US did not provide aid toMexico. The Treasury Department based its estimates partially on research by TomEspenshade, a Princeton demographer, who used INS apprehension data to estimatethat a 40 percent peso devaluation would increase illegal entries by about460,000 annually. However, most of these additional illegal Mexican entrantswould probably not settle in the US--the estimated increase in the settledillegal Mexican population would be only about 40,000, implying that the USloan guarantee would have provided $1 million for each settled illegal Mexicanmigrant avoided. Treasury assumed a 1 to 1 linkage between the peso and emigration, meaningthat a 1 percent devaluation would be follows by a one percent increase inillegal immigration. Most migration researchers were unwilling to be soprecise, and few believe that the relationship between the peso and emigrationis linear. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, for example, says only thatemigration pressure will increase. Village economic modeling by UCD ProfessorEd Taylor finds that a 10 percent devaluation in the 1980s was associated with18 percent more emigration, but a 30 percent devaluation increases exits fromMexican villages of persons headed for the US by 25 percent. Not everyone agrees that the peso devaluation will immediately increaseunauthorized Mexico-to-US migration. Mexican migration expert Jorge Bustamantenoted that coyotes set the cost of being smuggled into the US in dollars, andthat some potential migrants may not be able to accumulate 30 percent more topay smugglers immediately. Michael Teitelbaum of the Commission on ImmigrationReform noted that the increased value in Mexico of the $3 to $4 billion inremittances from US migrants may make potential migrants better off, ifMexicans in the US continue to remit at the same levels and inflation in Mexicodoes not offset the effects of the devaluation. Along the US-Mexican border, there are reports that apprehensions andattempted illegal entries rose in January 1995, but it will be several monthsbefore it can be determined whether reports of increased unauthorizedborder-crossings reflect the peso devaluation and hard times in Mexico orrepresent reactions by the usual flow of unauthorized migrants to INS bordercontrol efforts. There is general agreement that the migration effects of the pesodevaluation will not become apparent until March or April 1995, when seasonalmigrants seek US jobs. These migrants will have to elude a beefed up BorderPatrol to enter the US illegally. Emigration pressures and migration flows will also depend on economicprospects in Mexico and California, the destination of most illegal Mexicanimmigrants. On January 3, 1995, Mexican President Zedillo made a speech thatlaid out plans to deal with the economic crisis that caused the peso to loseover 30 percent of its value in the last two weeks of 1994. The theme of thespeech was sacrifice and austerity--wages and prices are to rise slower thaninflation, the government will try to sell off more public enterprises, andgovernment spending is to be cut. On January 17, 1995, the Zedillo governmentand the opposition parties signed a political reform agreement designed tominimize political unrest by ensuring honest elections, thus restoring theconfidence of foreign investors. A sluggish Mexican economy in 1995 could increase both internal migrationto the northern border areas and emigration pressure. The Mexican economy isexpected to grow less than one percent in 1995, inflation is projected to be 15to 20 percent, and some foreign investors may put at least a temporary stop onplans to build or expand factories and stores, slowing job creation. The lower wages and costs wrought by the peso devaluation should makeMexico more attractive to foreign investors. Indeed, there has already been USinterest in shifting to unused maquiladoras in the border areas plastics andother light-assembly work to take advantage of Mexican wages and benefits thathave fallen from $2 hourly to $1.50 [about half of these wage costs are payrolltaxes and benefits]. Since labor markets in Mexican border cities are fairlytight, such an expansion of maquiladora activity should attract internalmigrants to the border. If the California and US border economies improve asexpected in 1995, there could be more stepping-stone migration across theborder. There is no doubt that Mexico will, over the next two decades, emerge as animportant low-cost manufacturing center of North America. But no one knowsexactly when and how this economic transformation will occur. At least two tothree million of Mexico's five to six million farmers, plus their families, arelikely to leave the land over the next two decades, but it is not clear whetherforeign investment will create jobs for them in central Mexico or in borderareas, or whether many will migrate to the US. Unlike fast-growing Asian nations, Mexico's 1990s boom was fueled largelyby foreign savings. An overvalued peso made imports of both capital andconsumer goods cheap, and could be sustained as long as foreigners believedthat Mexico truly was the next "tiger." In effect, US and other foreigninvestors lent money to Mexico, and Mexicans used these foreign savings to buyUS goods--it is in this manner that the US Treasury can assert that $40 billionin US exports to Mexico supports about 800,000 US jobs. A report released last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimatedthat the peso devaluation will reduce American exports to Mexico by $10 billionor 20 percent in 1995 versus 1994 Mexico has learned that foreign money has an easy-come, easy-go quality.The country achieved more than four percent economic growth-- 4.5 percent--onlyin 1990. An "orderly" peso devaluation was advocated by the Mexico's new financeminister during the summer of 1994, but ex-President Salinas reportedly wantedto be one of the few recent Mexican presidents to leave office without amassive devaluation. When the government that took office on December 1,announced its economic plans, local and foreign investors saw that the $30billion trade deficit would not be reduced in 1995. With the Mexican CentralBank running out of reserves to support the peso, they bet that Mexico wouldhave to de-value its currency, which it did (MN, Jan 1995). The peso devaluation should help to create jobs in Mexico's tourismindustry, third largest after oil and manufacturing. In 1994, an estimated 17million US residents visited Mexico, and accounted for about three-fourths ofMexico's $7.5 billion tourism revenues. Globally, 528 million internationaltourists spent $321 billion in 1994. During the 1980s, Mexico managed to keep its unemployment rate low despitedepression and economic restructuring--the official urban unemployment rate(desempleo abierto) for Mexico fell after 1983, reaching a low of 2.6 percentin 1991. Mexico's unemployment rate is low because it measures only personsseparated from formal job relationships, and because "unemployed" persons noteligible for UI are pushed into marginal jobs and considered employed. Theunemployed in Mexico are persons who can afford to search for work fulltime--usually better educated and more affluent workers. The Clinton aid package for Mexico is not popular--79 percent of thosesurveyed in one poll opposed it and, near the end of January, groups rangingfrom Ross Perot's United We Stand to Prop 187 supporters promised to work todefeat Mexican aid.

Clintonendorsed the recommendation of the Commission on Immigration Reform to test anational registry to better prevent unauthorized aliens from obtaining US jobs[the SAVE system is already in place to prevent unauthorized aliens fromobtaining public benefits]. In September, 1994, the CIR recommended that pilot projects in the majorimmigration states experiment with a computer data base that includes SocialSecurity Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service data.Employers might call a toll free number, and then obtain a confirmation codethat the worker's Social Security Number or INS-A number is valid, eliminatingthe need for an I-9 form. Civil rights groups oppose the registry because they believe it wouldincrease discrimination and invade privacy. They also believe that it is onestep closer to requiring a national identity card. The AFL-CIO ExecutiveCouncil endorsed the registry, but withdrew support for the current employersanctions system based on employers seeing worker documents and completing I-9forms because it allegedly increases discrimination against minorityworkers. The INS on January 6, 1995 announced plans to add 2,365 employeesnationwide, including 1,200 additional Border Patrol and port of entry agentsto "do something that has never been done before, which is to secure a borderthat has never been secure." By the end of 1995, the Border Patrol is expectedto have over 5,000 agents, and there is talk among Congressional Republicans ofdoubling the Border Patrol to 10,000. Attorney General Reno announced thatbeef-up-the-border enforcement efforts have succeeded in stemming illegalimmigration, with apprehensions in San Diego down an estimated one-third fromthe same months last year. As border controls are reinforced in El Paso and San Diego--where 65percent of all apprehensions are made-- apprehensions in Arizona doubled toalmost 140,000 in FY94. There was an especially significant increase inapprehensions of East Europeans and Asians, suggesting that smugglers believethat it is easiest to slip high-paying non-Mexicans into the US over theArizona border. Attorney General Reno recently announced that the number ofBorder Patrol agents in Arizona would be increased by 30 percent. Most of the Arizona border crossing activity is between the twin cities ofNogales, Arizona (pop 25,000) and Nogales, Mexico (pop 250,000). There hasbeen a tradition of border crossing between these cities, but as the Arizonaborder has become the preferred crossing point, violence has increased. Tunnelkids living in cross-border sewer tunnels are accused of leading illegalimmigrants into the US and robbing them, prompting the formation of aUS-Mexican police force to deal with border violence.

Lamar Smith (R-TX ) and Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) are expected to holdhearings and get their immigration committees to approve legislation early inthe 104th Congress. Smith reportedly plans to introduce a national version of California'sProposition 187, while Simpson on January 24, 1995 introduced legislation (S269) that would create a three-year five-state pilot verification program. ThePresident would be required to institute an improved verification system withineight years. Simpson's proposal builds on a 1994 bill that also called for increasedfunding to add border patrol agents and investigators, and to streamlineexclusion and deportation proceedings. It includes stiffer penalties fordocument fraud and alien smuggling, and would repeal the law allowing immediateasylum for Cubans. Simpson will wait until the CIR releases its study of legalimmigration in June 1995 to introduce a bill reducing legal immigration.Simpson has advocated a five-year 25 percent reduction in legal immigration,currently set at 675,000 annually. Although some speculate that Republicans may try to make controllingimmigration a partisan issue, as Governor Wilson allegedly did by endorsing andcampaigning for Prop. 187 in California, both Smith and Simpson have said thatthey want to continue the tradition of dealing with immigration in a bipartisanmanner. Both favor a better worker verification system, and more efforts toprevent illegal aliens from receiving social services. House Republican leaders initially proposed to bar legal aliens from 60federal programs to save money ($22 billion over five years) and to avoidalleged abuses, as when children sponsor the immigration of their elderlyparents, who then depend on SSI and Medicare from the moment they becomeeligible until they die. Senator Simpson and many Republican governors opposedbarring legal aliens from all federal programs. A January CNN/USA poll reportedthat 62 percent of Americans want to eliminate virtually all benefits,including education, for unauthorized aliens. Welfare--federal means-tested assistance-- plays a special role in thisdebate. AFDC-- a $16 billion per year program that makes payments to 14million people or five percent of the US population at a cost of about onepercent of the US budget--was created during the 1930s so that World War Iwidows could stay home with their children. However, today almost 60 percentof all women with children under eight are in the labor force, making thenotion of paying women to stay home with children less acceptable. About the same numbers of babies are born today as in the early 1960s, buttoday one-fourth, versus one-tenth in the early 1960s, are born out of wedlock.The current welfare system seems especially unable to serve as a bridge to thelabor force for single mothers. In 1992, 39 percent of AFDC recipients wereBlack, and 34 percent were white. On January 9, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that House Republicans may"revisit" the issue of eliminating benefits to legal immigrants in light of anannouncement by Republican governors that they would be willing to accept afive-year freeze at current federal levels in the block grants devoted towelfare programs, which would save about $40 billion over five years accordingto Gingrich. Gingrich endorsed the current ban on benefits for illegalimmigrants as the "least destructive" way to save scarce federal funds. One compromise is to deny eligibility for benefits for the first few yearsafter arrival, and then enforce sponsorship agreements to deal with problemssuch as those involving elderly immigrants and Supplemental Security Income.One-fourth of the recipients of SSI in the US are legal immigrants. Republicans would prevent the children of immigrants from bringing theirparents to the US to retire on the SSI program, and encourage these elderlyimmigrants to become US citizens. The CIR, in contrast, recommended thatchildren who sponsor the entry of their elderly parents be required to signbinding pledges to support them so that they will not need SSI and othergovernment programs. On January 27, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation thatwould reimburse states for the costs they incur to incarcerate illegal aliens,who are an estimated 14 percent of California inmates. California wouldreceive $400 million under the legislation. A Newsweek poll found that 60 percent of all Americans think thatadditional immigration would be "bad for the country," spawning proposals toreduce admissions of, or benefits available to, legal immigrants. Among themany proposals are bills introduced by Senator Jesse Helms (D-NC) and RepRobert Torricelli (D-NJ) to deny immigrant visas to persons who illegally own,rent or manage American-owned property abroad. The intent is to put pressureon countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and Honduras, where American propertythat was confiscated is now being used by persons who want to make businesstrips to the US. Representative Ron Packard (R-CA) introduced three bills that he describedas "a three-pronged attack [on illegal immigration]... shore-up our resourcesat the US-Mexico border; close the inland checkpoints; and deny taxpayer-fundedbenefits to illegal immigrants." Packard's bill would double the number ofBorder Patrol agents from 5,000 to 10,000 within five years. Representative Bob Stump (R-AZ) introduced on January 4, 1995 theImmigration Accountability Act of 1995, which would prohibit the payment offederal benefits to illegal aliens and stop automatic citizenship for thechildren of illegal aliens born in the US. This bill would also limitimmigration to the spouses and minor children of US citizens, "legitimate"refugees, and persons waiting to immigrate legally for 10 or more years. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL.) reintroduced a Immigration Moratorium Act onJanuary 6. The bill places a five-year moratorium on most categories of legalimmigration, and would reduce legal admissions by two-thirds, from the current900,000 per year to 325,000 annually.

Only 677 Haitians--about 1 in6--accepted the offer. On January 5, the US began to return the 3,900 Haitians who had rejectedthe payment offer. Upon their arrival in Haiti, the first 54 were given $15and taken to the Port-au-Prince bus station. Several US immigration advocates criticized the return of Haitians, arguingthat the US has neither the legal or moral right to return Haitians. The USand Haiti signed an agreement in 1981 that permitted the US to intercept on thehigh seas and return to Haiti Haitians seeking to go to the US by boat; thatagreement expired in 1994. Since President Aristide was restored to power October 15, 1994, over16,000 of the 21,400 Haitians in Guantanamo in August 1994 have returned toHaiti. In Panama, officials report that 31 mostly young male Cubans have tried tocommit suicide as is becomes clearer that they will not be allowed directlyinto the US. There are about 8,600 Cubans in Panama who will be sent to jointhe 21,000 Cubans in Guantanamo before the Panama base is closed on March 6.About 3,000 Cubans have been admitted to the US from the Panama and Guantanamocamps for family or health reasons, and officials are worried that Cubans maytry to feign mental illness to gain admission to the US.

The combination of theINS's Operation Gatekeeper and Prop. 187, plus calls by California GovernorWilson and former Mexican President Salinas, has led to speculation that theremay be serious discussions in 1995 about a temporary US-Mexican program thatwould admit farm and perhaps other workers. Martin Anderson of the Hoover Institute, and former domestic policy advisorto President Reagan, recently called for large "guest-worker programs, underwhich foreign nationals who wish to work in the United States could do solawfully, with dignity, with no threat of being hunted down and deported."According to Anderson, "Once upon a time we had such a program -- and we had noillegal alien problems." Frank del Olmo, deputy editor at the Los Angeles Times, believes illegalimmigration could be controlled if the US negotiates an agreement with Mexicoto open US borders to workers as long as they register with the properauthorities. Their return to Mexico could be guaranteed by withholding 25percent of their pay until they return to Mexico. The devaluation of the peso is expected to increase Mexico-to-US migrationin 1995, but some farm leaders are nonetheless predicting farm labor shortages.For example, the chairman of Tri-Valley Growers, a cooperative of 650 fruit andvegetable growers, predicted that a labor shortage would force up wages in 1995for the 32,000 workers in nine processing plants. US farm employers can request permission to bring into the US temporaryforeign farm workers under the H-2A program. In 1993, DOL certified that17,162 farm jobs could be filled by temporary foreign farm workers, and in1994, 18,939. In the early 1980s, California farmers led the drive against the then H-2program, arguing that perishable crop farmers could not make hiring plansaccording to H-2 requirements. Farmers won in IRCA a special agriculturalworker legalization program, and a replenishment agricultural worker programthat would have permitted foreign workers to enter the US in the event of farmlabor shortages. Sacramento Bee, January 10, 1995. Frank del Olmo, "Perspective onImmigration," Los Angeles Times, January 31, 1995. _________________________________________ MinimumWages, Jobs, and Immigration President Clinton, in his January 24th State of the Union address, calledfor a hike in the minimum wage which is currently $4.25 per hour. The USDepartment of Labor estimates that 2.5 million workers are paid the minimumwage, and that another 1.7 million are paid less than $4.25 because they e.g.,receive tips. Two-thirds of the roughly four million minimum wage earners areadults over 25, and many are immigrants. Another 5.5 million US workers earn$4.25 to $4.75 per hour. Economic theory predicts that a higher minimum wage means fewer jobs, soeconomists view minimum wage hikes as a trade off between jobs and wages at thebottom of the labor market. Similarly, theory asserts that more immigrantsmeans more US jobs, but lower wages and worse conditions in immigrant-dominatedlabor markets. But this trade-off between wages and jobs is relatively small in the USeconomy, which offers 125 million jobs. Most studies agree that a 10 percentincrease in the minimum wage would lead to about one percent fewer jobs, sothat raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5, or 18 percent, would reduce thenumber of minimum wage jobs from about four million to 3.9 million. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee onImmigration and Claims says that "a sizable minority of illegal immigrants workfor significantly more than the minimum wage." He asserted that about 15percent of illegal alien workers are in the construction industry, where wagesaverage $9.50 per hour. "As the economy becomes more high-tech, more and more lower skilled workerscompete for fewer jobs... The answer is to increase wages to make those jobsmore attractive to Americans. It is unfair to American workers to allowillegal aliens to directly compete with them for scarce jobs." According to Smith, the "displacement factor" ranges from one-to-three toone-to-six, meaning that, for every three to six illegal aliens employed, oneAmerican worker is displaced.

There were estimated to be 2.1 million overstayers, and 1.9 million alienswho entered without inspection (EWI). About 150,000 overstayers and 150,000EWIs settle in the US each year, increasing the illegal alien population by300,000 annually. Some 22 million foreign visitors enter the US each year, but only 600 ofthe 39,000 deportations in 1993 resulted from visitors who overstayed. [Mostillegal foreigners depart voluntarily after being detected.] Foreign visitorsare presumed to want to settle in the US unless they can prove to US consularofficers abroad that they have sufficient ties to their home countries, plus around trip ticket, to make them likely to return. For nationals of the 22countries in the visa waiver program, only a round trip ticket is required tovisit the US. Countries from which it is estimated that more than 100,000aliens entered as legal visitors and then settled illegally include Mexico(357,000), Poland (107,000), Philippines (106,000), and Haiti (102,000). The Ironbound section of Newark has reportedly been settled by illegalPortuguese immigrants, many of whom arrived on tourist visas. There areestimated to be 17,000 illegal Portuguese in New Jersey, and the Portugueseenclave in Newark developed after the 1974 military coup in Portugal. ThePortuguese today are about 40 percent of the area's 40,000 residents, and theirpresence is attracting Portuguese-speaking Brazilian immigrants. On January 12, the ABC News program Day One aired a segment on the INS'sfailure to detain and deport immigrants who had committed crimes and servedtheir sentences in the US. Day One estimated that there were 500,000foreign-born persons in jail or on probation in the US, or about 2.5 percent ofthe 23 million foreign-born persons in the US. After their release fromprison, most criminal aliens can be deported. The INS in 1993 deported about20,000 of the 200,000 criminal aliens in the US subject to deportation. Both Day One and a New York Times profile of bounty hunters employed bybail bondsmen to track down fugitive criminal aliens were critical of the INS'sfailure to locate easy to find criminal aliens who have been ordered out of theUS. If an alien is charged with committing a crime in the US, he or she isentitled to due process and a public defender at trial. If convicted, there is another hearing--about half the time in jail--atwhich a convicted criminal alien can "show cause" why he or she should not bedeported from the US. In most cases, the alien will be ordered deported unlesshe or she can show mitigating circumstances, such as a US citizen family and,if the hearing is held in jail, the aliens being deported will be takendirectly to a bus or plane upon their release. At a mid-December hearing ofthe CIR, some argued that criminal aliens facing deportations should havepublic defenders appointed to represent them (MN, Jan 1995), although fewthought Congress would approve such an expenditure. Because the INS can detain only 6,000 aliens nationwide, some criminalaliens released from prison are ordered to post a bond that guarantees theywill show up for deportation hearings. Many fail to show, but reporters foundit easy to find the criminal aliens who failed to surrender. The INS arguesthat it does not have sufficient resources to detect and detain criminalaliens, although bounty hunters in New York allege that, in some instances, INSrefused to accept criminal aliens brought to their offices because they had nomore room to detain them, or the INS would have had to find travel documents inorder to get them into their country of citizenship. On January 9, Senator William Roth (R-DE) introduced legislation tofacilitate the apprehension, detention and deportation of criminal aliens. Thelegislation, S179, or the Criminal Alien Control Act of 1995, streamlines thedeportation process for criminal aliens by, among other things, requiringaliens who are not permanent residents and who wish to appeal deportationorders, to do so from their home countries, after they have been deported. Thelegislation further streamlines the process by allowing state and federaljudges to order the deportation of criminal aliens.

On January 27, the Wilson Administration sued to have theconstitutionality of Prop. 187 determined first in California state courts,thereby removing the case from a Los Angeles federal judge who has issued aninjunction blocking Prop. 187's implementation. The governor's suit asks afederal Court of Appeals to permit a state court to determine Prop. 187'svalidity. News reports in January 1995 reported that, while fearful, unauthorizedimmigrants' lives in California are "returning to normal." Clinics report theusual number of patients, and immigrant activists report that they do not knowof any unauthorized immigrants who have left California because of Prop. 187. As before the election, reports of "mixed families" illustrate howdifficult it would be to enforce Prop. 187's provisions. For example, in manyhouseholds, the father is a legal immigrant, the baby is US born and a UScitizen, and the mother and older children are unauthorized. In such a family,issues arise about who gets services? Do privacy laws protect the unauthorizedmembers of the family when legal members seek services, or when theunauthorized mother seeks services for her US citizen baby? There are estimated to be 950 illegal aliens among the 320,000 studentsenrolled on the 20 campuses of the CSU system, and on January 17, 1995, aCalifornia appeals court ruled that they must pay an additional $5,000 per yearout-of-state tuition, ending the practice since 1985 of charging them in-statetuition. This ruling means that all three of California's higher educationsystems--University of California, California State University, and communitycolleges--charge unauthorized aliens higher out-of-state tuition. There is asyet no Prop. 187-type system in place to verify the legal status of Californiastudents. California institutions of higher learning enroll about 1 in 6college students in the US. In December 1994, the National Coordinating Committee for Citizenship andCivic Participation met in Arizona and adopted the Plan de Tucson to boycottCalifornia food, tourism and entertainment industries. Corporations targetedinclude Chevron and Disney, which report no effects on their businesses. Some Mexican officials reportedly fear a return of unauthorized Mexicansbecause of Prop. 187. There is no evidence of such a migration. Patrick McDonnell, "Court Requires Tuition Hike for Undocumented," LosAngeles Times, January 19, 1995. "Court OKs higher fees for illegal immigrantsat CSU," Associated Press, January 17, 1995. Prop.187 Moves Across the Nation Fifteen states across the nation are being targeted for Prop.-187 stylemeasures to deny public services to illegal immigrants. Florida, with anestimated 400,000 illegal aliens, is considered ripe for a Prop. 187-typeinitiative, primarily because the state allows initiatives. Texas does notpermit initiatives. A citizen's group in Florida has begun fundraising and petition drivesaimed at qualifying the measure for the ballot. In Arizona, AZ-187 BorderBlockade, a Tucson political action committee, is planning to put a Prop.187-measure on the 1996 ballot. Arizona Governor Fife Symington was opposed toCalifornia's Prop. 187, and there are currently no immigration control bills inthe Arizona Legislature.

Immigrationand Affirmative Action Many of the grassroots supporters of Prop. 187 have become vocal supportersof the California Civil Rights Initiative, an initiative planned for the 1996ballot that would "prohibit the state or any of its political subdivisions fromusing race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for eitherdiscriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individualor group in the operation of the state's system of public employment , publiceducation or public contracting." Governor Wilson lent his support to theeffort to repeal race and sex preferences with an end-of-the-year comment thathe favors ending California's affirmative action laws. Early polling indicates that the proposal to end preferences based on raceand sex has a 50-50 chance of voter approval even if white women vote againstthe initiative. In one commentary, the same California voters who pioneeredthe tax cutting fever of the late 1970s and 1980s are in the 1990s voting forlaws that get tough on criminals with three strikes, get tough on illegalaliens with Prop. 187, and now get tough on preferences with the CaliforniaCivil Rights Initiative. The California Legislature may attempt to head off the initiative with apartial repeal of preferences in contracting. Assemblyman Bernie Richter(R-Chico) has proposed legislation for a so-called "colorblind society" thatwould, inter alia, eliminate race and gender preferences in universityadmissions and public employment and end the practice of requiring a certainpercentage of public contracts to be awarded to e.g., women, minorities, ordisabled veterans. Some of the groups that supported Prop. 187 are also challenging the $40billion aid package for Mexico and arguing that the renamed "America" needs a"refounding amendment" that would, inter alia, restrict US citizenship to"those born of an American." The opposition to Mexican aid links the Prop. 187groups with Ross Perot's United We Stand organizations. Patrick McDonnell, "Is Prop 187 Just the Beginning," Los Angeles Times,January 28, 1995, A1.

MoreBlacks Leaving Los Angeles There are about 900,000 Blacks aged five and older in Los Angeles county,and 62,000 or seven percent of them left between 1985 and 1990. Many moved tonearby counties, but some moved across the US to southeastern states such asGeorgia. Many Blacks complain that the quality of life is deteriorating in LosAngeles. South Central Los Angeles is becoming a Latino community. Blacks escapingsouthern racism began moving there in the 1940s, but after the Watts riots in1965, factories and good jobs left the area. The 1992 riots encouraged moremigration from the area. Kenneth Noble, "Blacks Leave LA in Search of good life," New York Times,January 8, 1995, A1.

The US Department ofLabor regulations are designed to prevent US employers from paying belowstandard wages to temporary skilled foreign workers. DOL decided to limitlabor condition applications (LCA) to single occupations, but DOL has notlimited them geographically (e.g., only to areas within the jurisdiction of asingle DOL regional office). There is an annual cap of 65,000 H-1B foreign workers with "specialtyoccupations"--often engineers or physical therapists who have at least abachelor's degree. In FY 94, DOL approved employer requests for 60,179 H-1Bworkers, versus 61,591 in FY 93 and 57,125 in FY 92. The INS reports thatthere were 110,000 H-1B workers in FY 92, and 93,000 in FY 93, but the INS datareport each entrance of such a worker, so that, e.g., a UK software engineerwho takes a summer vacation in England and then returns to the US is countedtwice in INS data. The new rules also affect contractors who move H1-B workers from job tojob. A new "time test" allows employers to shift an H1-B worker to a worksitenot listed on the LCA for 90 days without filing a new LCA. To stem abuse, DOLrequires that there be no strike at the particular worksite, that the work bethe same for which the approval was granted, and that the off site work be lessthan 90 work days over three-years. Employers of H1-B employees will now be required to notify DOL within threedays if a strike or lockout occurs at particular place of business. DOLenforcement powers will be significantly increased, the agency to conductinvestigations on its own initiative instead of waiting for complaints. Labor groups, especially US software engineers, welcomed the new rules.But software companies such as Microsoft and Intel and their lawyers complainedthat the new rules make it too hard to bring in needed foreign workers. In many cases, these "brand-names" American companies use a subcontractorto supply them with foreign workers, so that they may not know of substandardwages and conditions. The Department of Labor decided "at this time" not toestablish special procedures for companies that obtain foreign workers throughcontractors. The new rules reduce the maximum length of a work permit from six to threeyears, and require US employers to offer more evidence that they are indeedpaying prevailing wages to foreign workers. However, most of the employerapplication continues to consist of attestations--meaning that the employerasserts that Americans are not available for the jobs foreigners will fill, andthat the wages and conditions offered are normal for the occupation. One of the arguments for the 1990 IMMACT was that the US needed to make iteasier for scientists to immigrate because, according to a National ScienceFoundation report, there would soon be a shortage of everything frombiochemists to mathematicians. Many universities expanded their Ph.D.programs, and the number of scientists grew almost three times faster than thelabor force as a whole. There were 402,000 workers in all fields of science in1992, including 53,000 biomedical scientists. Real federal funding for scientific research has been frozen at about $57billion since 1987, and as a result, more newly minted Ph.D.'s are scramblingfor ever fewer secure jobs. The unemployment rate for scientists, threepercent, is the highest for any US profession, and many new Ph.D.s shuttle fromone $20,000- $35,000 post doctorate to another. As US students sought alternative careers, universities filled up theirgraduate programs with foreign students. Today, there are more foreign than USborn post-doctorate scientists, 17,000 versus 16,000, while in 1979, there weretwo US-born post-doctorates for every foreign born post doctorate. The number of foreign-born scientists continues to increase. In 1993, theChinese Student Protection Act allowed the 27,000 Chinese students who were inthe US during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre to become immigrants. Manyare believed to be scientists and engineers. The US allocates 140,000immigrant visas annually for needed workers, including scientists, and about 30percent of the 50,000 to 60,000 immigrant workers admitted--15,000 to 20,000--are believed to be scientists (the remaining visas are used for familymembers).

US English is a national organization that favors a constitutionalamendment to make English the official language of the US. By 1994, 19 stateshave made English their "official language." A Georgia Senate education subcommittee unanimously passed a proposal tomake English the official language of Georgia. Opponents of the bill worrythat it will send the wrong message as the city begins preparations for the1996 Olympics. Supporters say the bill will save money because officialdocuments will no longer have to be printed in different languages. Similarmeasures have been considered by the Georgia Senate the past two years, buthave not passed. In December 1994, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Arizona'sOfficial English Amendment, adopted in 1988, by ruling that a state employeecould prepare reports in Spanish, and that individuals have a right to requeststate services in their own language. Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) introduced legislation on January 9 todesignate English as the official language of the US government( S 175).According to Shelby "Last year, tax forms were printed in a language other thanEnglish for the first time in the 131 year history of the IRS, and theImmigration and Naturalization Service is now conducting non-English languagecitizenship ceremonies.

This has provoked aseries of so-called hidjab or headscarve battles--Muslim women who wearheadscarves have been barred from French schools for wearing "ostentatious"religious objects. The headscarves, in turn, reflect the growth of Islamic fundamentalism,especially among second and third generation North African youth in the suburbswho have had a hard time finding jobs and careers in high-unemployment France.In these suburbs, youth allegedly have two choices, both of which make theFrench uncomfortable--adopt secular values, and be attracted to drugs anddelinquency, or become devoutly religious, and perhaps be attracted to Islamicfundamentalism and terrorism. The estimated three to five million Muslim immigrants in France make Islamsecond only to Catholicism in adherents among France's 57 million people. Manyobservers call for compromise, and accommodation is often made for religiousdifferences, but there are also reports of e.g., Muslim workers beingdisciplined for asking for work breaks to pray. There were many laudatory profiles of French Interior Minister CharlesPasqua after hostages aboard an airplane hijacked in Algeria were released insouthern France. Pasqua expelled several fundamentalists from France duringthe summer of 1994, and he reportedly takes care to cultivate the mainstreamMuslim population in France. A French writer compared the dissatisfaction of the French and Californianswith illegal immigration, noting that, in France, foreign workers, legal ornot, are accused of looting French society by taking advantage of generoussocial services, disregarding French values and cultural habits, and raisingthe crime rate. Presidential candidate and National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has saidhe would expel million of immigrants if he won the French presidentialelection. During a speech announcing his candidacy for the April 1995election, he said, '"I pledge an immediate end to all immigration and to sendthree million immigrants home."

The CDU-CSU-FDP coalition thatwon the October 1994 election proposed a conditional citizenship for thechildren of immigrants who have lived in Germany for at least 10 years--at age18, the child would have to choose German or his parents'nationality. Kohl's Christian Democrats continue the affirm their ardent opposition todual nationality or anything that would liberalize current immigration policy.The proposed bill threatens to drive a wedge between the FDP and the ChristianDemocrats (CDU) weakening the center-right coalition government. The proposalis very close to the position of the FDP, the small party that helps maintainKohl's slim 10-seat parliamentary majority. Germany's major opposition party, the Social Democrats (SPD), votedunanimously on January 24 to offer a nationality bill that would make dualnationality possible, cut the naturalization period, and automatically grantcitizenship to third-generation immigrants. The Social Democrats argue thatthe bill will help the 6.9 million foreigners integrate better. Germany's nationality laws are based on blood or decent rather than placeof birth. The proposed law would entitle children of foreign parents to Germannationality if one parent was born or lives in Germany. Allowing retention ofanother nationality would benefit the 1.8 million Turks. Some have beendeterred from naturalizing because they feared losing inheritance rights inTurkey. The CDU believes that the new law would send the wrong message andopen the flood gates to further migration to Germany. Of Germany's 80 million population, about 6.5 million are foreign born, andnearly 60 percent of the foreign-born have lived in Germany for more than 10years. Many gained residence rights through the once liberal asylum process.According to the Interior Ministry, 127,210 foreigners applied for asylum in1994, compared to 322,599 in 1993 and 438,191 in 1992. Some 222,600 ethnic German immigrants arrived in Germany in 1994, comparedwith 218,900 in 1993 and 230,600 in 1992. About two-thirds of the immigrantscame from Asian republics such as Kazakhstan, but other ethnic Germans arere-settling in Russia. On January 11, 1995, Germany announced that it would begin to forciblyrepatriate some of the 40,000 Vietnamese illegally in the country, and Vietnamhas agreed to accept them back in exchange for a $130 million aid package and$65 million in risk insurance for German companies making investments inVietnam. This works out to about $5,000 for each Vietnamese to be senthome. There were about 62,000 Vietnamese in East Germany in 1989, and 12,000stayed despite a German offer of a ticket home plus $2,000. The 40,000 illegalVietnamese include 20,000 rejected asylum seekers. "Bonn government faces Test Over Nationality Issue," Reuters, January 24,1995.

Immigrationlawyers and Amnesty International are demanding the immediate release of up to500 immigrants currently being held in custody. Howard says he will continueto hold the asylum seekers until the appeals courts tells him to release them. The ruling was a result of a clause inserted in the Asylum and ImmigrationAppeals Act of 1993 which says that no asylum seeker will be sent home untilconsideration of his or her request for safe haven has been completed will endthe British practice of detaining illegal aliens and asylum seekers who enteredthe UK illegally. The British Home Secretary fears that the prospect of freedom while asylumclaims are investigated would unleash a wave of false asylum seekers on the UK.

A final report is expectedin April 1995. Spain, France and Italy fear influxes of immigrants from Northern Africa,while Germany worries more about immigrants from Eastern Europe. At a Decembersummit meeting in Essen, Germany, EU leaders agreed on a $6.7 billion aidpackage for Eastern Europe over the next five years, with the understandingthat the amount might have to be raised later. The European Commission, theunion's executive body, had recommended $8.5 billion. Although there was somediscussion of giving the Mediterranean countries roughly half the amountoffered to the East, in the end the summiteers were unable to settle on afigure. The Council, the European Commission, and a delegation of the Forum ofImmigrants of the EU on January 30 discussed asylum and refugee requests,freedom of movement, reuniting of families and visitation rights, the rightwork in another member state, and racial discrimination and citizenship. TheForum asked the EU to allow immigrants living illegally in the Union for morethan three years to be allowed to legalize their situation under a generalamnesty. France holds the presidency of the EU in the first six months of 1995,followed by Spain and Italy at the start of 1996. This is expected tohighlight the problems of immigration into southern Europe. The EuropeanCommission is committed to giving both direct aid and wider market access toNorth Africa. Spain's EU development commissioner, Manuel Martin, has said that the EUshould consider how to deal with immigration and drug trafficking, but it isunclear whether African countries will agree to try to halt emigration and drugtrafficking in return for aid. There is also some dispute about the type of aid to be given. Germany andBritain prefer trade concessions over aid. One the other hand, SouthernEuropeans prefer aid to trade, since they fear their economies would be hurt ifcheaper textiles and agricultural products.

If approved,asylum seekers entering the Netherlands from Germany, Belgium or another safecountry would be deported back to that country. The amendment was narrowlyapproved by the lower house of Parliament in December. The bill is opposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesand Amnesty International because they feel it would make it difficult toprotect asylum seekers. The Dutch Refugee Council estimates that, under theproposed law, as many as 40 percent of all new asylum seekers would not beallowed to apply. The Netherlands received about 55,000 requests for asylum in1994. Beginning January 1, 1995, illegal immigrants in the Netherlands who canprove they have had legal work continuously for at least six years, paying bothtax and social premiums, are entitled to an official residence permit. Theamnesty will continue until January 1, 1999. Robin Pascoe, "Senate to Vote on 'Safe Third Country' Rule, Inter PressService, January 27, 1995.

There are both supply and demand reasons for the surge in migranttrafficking. War and poverty, plus knowledge of opportunities abroad,encourage migrants to seek jobs abroad. At the same time, there areopportunities to earn 10 or 20 times more in Europe than at home. Bordercontrol officers complain that, even if they think they know who is smugglingaliens, arrests can be made only when smugglers are caught with aliens, andsmuggling is not always considered a serious crime because, within the EU,there is no consensus on whether to treat migrants being smuggled into Europeas criminals or victims. Interior ministers from four European countries--France, Italy, Spain, andPortugal-- and two north African nations--Algeria and Tunisia-- met in Tunison January 21 to discuss Islamic fundamentalism and illegal immigration.These 4+2 talks reflect fears especially in France that Islamic terrorists canobtain funds and recruits among that country's 4.5 million Moslems.

Switzerland, which received 3,000 Tamil asylum seekers in 1985, today hasabout 25, 000 Tamils in the country. Most Tamils had their applications forasylum rejected, but they were nonetheless allowed to remain in Switzerland,and work in the hotel and restaurant business or in construction as long asthey engage in no criminal activity. Three hundred Tamils living in Norway will be returned to Sri Lanka becausethe Norwegian government believes that they no longer risk persecution due tothe end of the 12-year ethnic war. Many of the Tamils have gone underground toavoid deportation. Police have been instructed to use force, if necessary, toexpel them.

Beginning in the 1950s as"foreign labor cooperation," China has sent workers abroad to complete 1,000projects in 70 countries, most notably the railroad between Tanzania andZambia. After economic reforms in 1978, China began to promote the export of laboras a means to earn foreign exchange and to ease domestic unemployment. Threemajor types of government entities--national government corporations, localgovernment companies, and trading companies--and today there are 130,000 to200,000 Chinese workers abroad, mostly in Asia. The Ministry of Foreign Tradeand Economic Cooperation, which reports 200,000 migrant workers were abroad in1994, estimated that remittances and earnings from Chinese-supplied materialsused in foreign projects generated $8 billion for China in 1994. There are two major arrangements under which Chinese workers are employedabroad. Labor service agreements, most often made by one of the 61 localgovernment companies, sent 68,000 workers abroad in 1991. Contract-tiedworkers, most often employed by one of the 56 national government corporationsthat have a contract to build e.g., a dam or bridge abroad, sent 21,500 workersabroad in 1991. There are reportedly 30,000 Chinese workers employed to buildHong Kong's new airport and to work in construction there. There are also Chinese "worker-trainees" in Japan, ex-USSR, and the US,Chinese farmers in Japan, and 10,000 Chinese workers in South Korea. China isasking Japanese and Korean construction firms to consider using Chinese workerswhen they win jobs in third countries, such as the Gulf states. Over half of all Chinese workers come from 10 of China's 30provinces--about 20 percent come from the South China provinces of Guandong andFujian. These provinces are among the fastest growing in China, and they arethe preferred destination for some of the 60 million Chinese who re-settleevery year within China, and the 20 million who migrate to seasonal jobs withinthe country. China has 1.2 billion people, 80 percent of whom live in rural areas.Despite an economy that expanded by 12 percent in 1994 to about $520 billion,and $35 billion in direct foreign investment in 1994, second only to foreigninvestment in the US, there are an estimated 150 million surplus workers inrural areas, and 15 to 20 million un- or underemployed workers in urban areas.By 2010, even if the population remains at 1.2 billion, it is predicted thathalf of the country's people will live in urban areas, implying a massiverural-urban migration and large cities. Relatively better conditions in the urban areas of the country--industryexpanded by 18 percent in 1994, versus four percent for agriculture--accentuateinequalities that promote rural-urban migration. There are an estimated 50 to60 million internal migrants within China. They are described as so-called'mangliu' ('blind migrants'), since they gather at railroad stations lookingfor jobs and fellow villagers, much as southern European guestworkers didFrance and Germany in the 1960s. These internal migrants have rapidly made for themselves a place in localeconomies, but they also threaten social unrest. For example, most ofBeijing's 800,000 construction workers are reportedly internal migrants, butthese migrants are also 43 percent of the convicted criminals in Beijing.Migrants also dominate occupations such as maid, peddler, and food-stalloperator. The Chinese government is trying to manage rural-urban migration bylimiting the employment of rural migrants in urban factories and expandinglabor exports abroad. As China relaxes the household registration system, somecities have begun to tax newcomers for the right to change their registrationfrom rural to urban, thereby making available to them the permits they need toget local government housing. The Year of the Boar, which begins January 31, 1995, is expected to seemillions of internal migrants return to their villages with gifts--last year,almost one in six Chinese traveled by rail in the two months of the lunar NewYear. China hopes in 1995 to keep 60 percent of the internal migrants at theirworkplaces to avoid overloading the transportation system by encouragingemployers to offer overtime and bonuses, and prohibiting them from hiring newmigrant workers until 30 days after the holiday season. China is planning a national campaign at the start of 1997 to help preventa mass influx of mainlanders into Hong Kong after the sovereignty handover.The current entry procedure for mainlanders to visit and stay in Hong Kongwould be kept intact after 1997. Currently, 105 immigrant visas are issuedeach day for mainland immigrants to Hong Kong. There are reports thatmainlanders are asked to pay up to $300,000(HK) for these permits.

It has one of the highest immigrant worker shares in theregion--an estimated one million foreigners in a workforce of about eightmillion, and persisting employer complaints of labor shortages. Foreign workers in Malaysia include over 61,000 professionals orexpatriates who earn at least R1200 ($500 ) per month. There were also 563,000unskilled and semi-skilled foreigners with Temporary Visit Work Passes inSeptember 1994. Over half of these foreign workers, who receive two-year workpermits that are renewable for one year-- were in the Kuala Lumpur area, andabout 30 percent were employed on plantations, 30 percent in construction, and20 percent as maids. For the 340,000 legal foreign workers for whom country oforigin data are available, two-thirds are Indonesians, followed by 20 percentBangladeshis. Beginning in 1993, Malaysian employers were required to pay an annual levyon each foreign legal worker. The levy varies from about $120 for plantationworkers to $170 for construction workers and $350 for skilled service workers.Since April 1993, there has been a freeze on employer applications to bringadditional foreign workers to Malaysia, but a cabinet-level Task Forceconsiders and approves applications for foreign workers on a case-by-casebasis. Malaysia is attempting to rapidly upgrade its economy, thereby eliminatingjobs that might be filled by unskilled workers. Malaysia's Sixth Five yearplan projects shortages of skilled and surpluses of unskilled workers by 2000.The Malaysian government has asked private employers to do more to train theskilled workers expected to be in short supply. Malaysia is now trying to attract overseas investors with tax and otherincentives, but is choosy about the type of industry allowed in the country.The government is aiming for capital-intensive projects such as semi-conductormanufacturing.

The Advisory Council for National Labour Developmentwill be investigating workers from Myanmar (formerly Burma) in the Thai fish,construction and husbandry industries. Along the Myanmar-Thai border, nearlyall the workers are from Myanmar migrants. Many Thai employers claim they are faced with labor shortages because Thaiworkers refuse "dirty" jobs. The government believes that part of the reasonthey hire foreign workers is to reduce labor costs. The government estimates that there are more than 100,000 illegal foreignlaborers in Thailand. A recent study by the Social and Population ResearchInstitute estimated that there were 520,000 illegal foreign workers inThailand, more than half of them from neighboring Myanmar. The National Congress recommends that foreign workers register and having afixed wage and welfare benefits. The president of the congress recommendedthat labor laws be changed to allow foreign workers into fields unpopular withThais.

Someof the reasons for returning include lack of servants, job shortages, hightaxes, and separation from friends and relatives. Emigration from Canada, usually after the immigrant has obtained Canadiancitizenship, is estimated at about 15 per cent. Increasingly, Hong Kongcitizens are emigrating to Australia, London, Singapore, and Europe. Hong Konghas been losing 60,000 people per year, or about one percent of the population. The brain drain of middle level management worries the government in HongKong. The British offer of citizenship to 50,000 families -- which could mean250,000 people -- may be the first immigration scheme in history aimed atkeeping people in their homeland rather than helping them leave. The theory isthat once a Hong Kong resident gets British citizenship, he or she will feelsecure enough not to leave. Foreign citizenships are being offered to peopleHong Kong least wants to lose, such as mid-level managers, businessentrepreneurs, those with vital skills, such as air traffic controllers, andpeople with "sensitive jobs," such as police chiefs. A judge in Hong Kong has ruled that the government is guilty of illegaldetention of Vietnamese boat people. At least 125 boat people could bereleased following the January 26 ruling that long periods of detention incamps without prospect of repatriation was unlawful--14 Vietnamese detaineeswere freed after five years in detention by this ruling. Vietnam refused to accept the 14 because they were holding Taiwanese traveldocuments. Freeing the Vietnamese has angered China, which has warned theBritish to remove all Vietnamese prior to the takeover in 1997.

One reasonfor creating the court was to deal with increasingly frequent worker protests,such as one staged by 13 Nepalese workers outside Seoul's Myongdong RomanCatholic cathedral until the Korean Federation of Small Business (KFSB) agreedto their demands. The Nepalese thought they would earn $400 to $500monthly and receive technical training. But the agency offered them only$210 monthly when they arrived in South Korea. The KFSB promised to pay theseworkers directly rather than through their agency. A private consulting body has also been created to assist the South Koreangovernment with the management of foreign workers. Small businesses employ about 18,000 foreign workers and another 10,000will soon be invited to work in country. There are between 50,000 to 100,000foreigners working illegally in the country.

The government also announced plans to begin imposing criminalpenalties on employers of illegal workers, and plans to introduce sanctions ofthree years or fines of Taiwan $15 million (US$ 577,000) on operators ofTaiwanese boats and aircraft were caught smuggling Chinese immigrants to Taiwanand other countries. Taiwan plans to require foreign workers to deposit 30 percent of theirwages in savings accounts that pay interest, but workers only get their savingsif they abide by their contracts. Taiwan is also planning to extend from threeto four years the maximum stay of foreign workers, and to establish anearly-warning system that would warn of "overreliance on foreign workers,"defined as so many foreign workers that the upgrading of the manufacturingcapability of Taiwan's enterprises is hindered.

Australia'sdetention camps are already full, with 1,000 boat people who arrived in 1994.The President of the Indochina Refugee Association indicates that theAustralian government does not have much confidence in talks with China on howto stem the flow. Over 700 persons repatriated from Hong Kong to China have turned up on thenorthern shores of Australia since mid-November. Most are Vietnamese who fledVietnam fearing persecution and were granted asylum in China in 1979. With theassistance of the United Nations they set up homes in Beihai and are nowleaving in boats for Darwin. In Australia, most requested asylum on the basisof China's one-child policy. China has told the Australian government that it is under no obligation totake back the Vietnamese-Chinese boat people. The Chinese blame the exodus onthe Australian government decision to grant refugee status to former Vietnameserefugees in 1994. Australia places those who arrived in detention camps. The UNHCR endorsedAustralia's warning that these boat people would not be granted asylum. Chinaannounced that the one-child policy does not apply to ethnic minorities orrefugees such as Vietnamese and Laotians granted refuge in China, and Chinesepolice are reportedly arresting persons attempting illegal emigration andconfiscating their boats. Legislation will be proposed in the Australian Senate to make it moredifficult for the boat people to seek refugee status. The legislation has beenannounced to send a message back to Beihai, that the chances of successfullyfinding refuge in Australia are poor.

The African National Congress-dominated coalition government,facing elections in October 1995, is under pressure from mainly black tradeunions and workers to step up border controls in order protect jobs for localworkers. The ANC wants to avoid alienating neighbors who harbored itsguerrillas during the struggle against apartheid. The South African government today uses random ID checks and raids onsuspected ''safe houses'' to detect and deter illegal immigrants. According toone survey, most South Africans favor even more immigration controls. A recentsurvey reported that a majority believed that illegal aliens should be roundedup and deported. However, many of those apprehended say they will try toreturn, since the wage gap between South Africa and Mozambique is 10 or 15 to1. The main rail station in Johannesburg serves as South Africa's major daylabor market. There are believed to be two million aliens in South Africa. About 53,000aliens were expelled in 1990, 97,000 in 1993, and well over 100,000 in 1994.

The Fijian government is now inviting Chinesebusiness migrants to come to Fiji to fill the void left by the Indianprofessionals and entrepreneurs who left. The Fijian Cabinet approved a proposal to allow up to 7,000 Chinesebusinessman and their families from Hong Kong to migrate to Fiji, provided theypay an application fee of $30,000 and invest at least $100,000 ingovernment-approved projects. The government says the program will bring in upto $ 2.5 billion in investments and create some 80,000 jobs. The Chinese areexpected to be heavily involved in repacking and refining import commoditiesfor re-export. The 1990 constitution favors indigenous Polynesians over Indians, who makeup nearly half of Fiji's 770,000 people. It bars non-natives from becomingpresident or premier, and reserves 37 parliamentary seats for indigenousFijians, 27 for Indians, and five for other groups under the General Voterscategory. Current estimates are that there are about 5,000 Chinese in Fiji. While afew settled in the islands a century ago, some 1,000 Chinese, have come to dobusiness in Fiji in the last few years. More than 900 work permits have beenissued to Chinese nationals since 1987, and the Fiji Trade and Investment Boardsays there are nearly 60 Chinese running joint ventures in Fiji. Official figures show that between 1987 and June 1993, Fiji grantedcitizenship to 508 Chinese. During the same period, 24,014 Indians left thecountry for Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

Most of the additionalfunds would go to the INS, which would see its budget rise 27 percent to $2.6billion, to prevent illegal entries and to detect and deport unauthorizedaliens in the US. There were an estimated four million illegal aliens in the US in October1994, and their number is believed to be increasing by 300,000 each year, or25,000 per month. About 40 percent of these settled illegal aliens areMexicans. An average 2,000 to 2,500 aliens are apprehended daily along theUS-Mexican border. Clinton's budget would add 700 Border Patrol agents to the current 5,000and provide $300 million to states to cover their costs of incarceratingcriminal aliens, $100 million to reimburse states for the costs of educatingillegal alien children, and $150 million to reimburse states for the costs ofproviding emergency medical services to unauthorized aliens. California aloneis requesting $3 billion from the federal government, and other states aredemanding $5 billion more. The administration is also proposing steps to speed up the deportation ofaliens who have been convicted of crimes in the US. There were 37,000 criminalaliens deported in 1993, 22,000 in 1994, and the administration is expected toincrease criminal deportations to 58,000 in 1996. There are an estimated 77,000 criminal illegal aliens in federal and stateprisons. If they are released before being deported, many fail to leave theUS--about 20 percent of those ordered deported are released before receiving afinal deportation order. There are believed to be about 100,000 illegal alienswho have been convicted of crimes in the US, served their sentences in the US,been ordered deported, but are nonetheless here. Senator Simpson's immigration control bill (S269) gives the president eightyears to establish a system to verify the eligibility of every new worker hiredand every applicant for public benefits. Simpson's bill directs the attorneygeneral to establish a data base that could be used to establish eligibility.The cost of establishing such a registry has been estimated at $3 to $6billion, primarily to clean up the Social Security and INS data bases. Under Clinton's original proposal, some of the additional immigrationcontrol funds would have been raised by a $3 per car and $1.50 per pedestrianborder entry fee at the 169 border crossings between the US and Canada andMexico. There were 409 million legal land entries into the US in 1993, and thefees were expected to raise $200 million in 1996, and then $400 million peryear. The border crossing fee had supporters and detractors in Congress. Over 20border-area Congressmembers released a letter asserting that a bordercrossing fee would in fact be a tax that would slow traffic and hurt borderbusinesses, contrary to the spirit of NAFTA. According to San Diego critics,Mexicans in the Tijuana area, many of whom now make trips to the US every twoto four days, would find it too costly and time consuming to enter. Opponentsalso assert that traffic congestion at ports of entry could worsen airpollution there. Opposition from Canada and Mexico, as well as border state politicians, ledClinton to withdraw the border crossing fee proposal on February 22. Stateswill be given the option of adopting the border crossing fee and, if they do,they will share the funds raised to do additional immigration control andborder infrastructure projects. A representative for California Governor Pete Wilson said that Clinton'sproposals offer only a "Band-Aid solution" that ignores the passage of Prop.187 in California. An attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense andEducational Fund criticized the Clinton proposals for failing to provide fundsto promote of the naturalization of immigrants. The House of Representatives, on February 10, 1995, approved by a vote of380-20 revisions to the 1994 crime bill that expands the list of crimes forwhich illegal immigrants can be deported, and speeds up their deportation. TheCriminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act also includes provisions that raisepenalties for smuggling aliens into the US from today's average 18 monthsimprisonment and $5,000 fine to up to 20 years in prison and tripleRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) damages, which couldtotal millions. On February 25, the US Drug Czar announced that Operation Hard Line wouldimmediately prompt INS and US Customs to more frequently inspect cars enteringthe US for drugs. Some 80 US Customs inspectors will be transferred to theUS-Mexican border, and US helicopters will be permitted to take Mexican policeto places inside Mexico where drugs are loaded onto trucks headed into theUS.

Under a proposal to targetenforcement on industries and employers likely to violate labor and immigrationlaws, Clinton's budget proposal calls for 365 additional INS inspectors todouble checks for illegal aliens in US workplaces, and 202 additional DOL wageand hour inspectors to increase by 65 percent inspections in workplaces likelyto employ unauthorized workers, such as garment makers, construction firms,agriculture and food services. These additional inspectors would be concentrated in the seven states withthe most illegal aliens--California, Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, New York,Florida, and Illinois. If the budget increase is approved by Congress, thenumber of illegal aliens detected in the workplace is expected to double. In 1994, 1,400 of the 2,200 employers investigated by INS for hiringillegal aliens were issued fines totaling $11 million; 4,400 investigations areplanned for 1996. In 1993, when the INS had 318 sanctions enforcement agents,it completed nearly 1,800 cases against employers that resulted in fines.There was a backlog of 36,000 leads of employers possibly employing illegalaliens in September 1994. INS and DOL data report different levels of employer compliance withchecking on the legal status of all new hires and refusing to hire illegalaliens. The INS reports that 90 percent of all employers inspected are incompliance, and DOL reports about 50 percent employer compliance. INS datareflect violations only after an employer has been given a chance to correctmistakes, while DOL data do not. Clinton's budget proposal would also permit a significant expansion of thetelephone verification system, whereby 200 employers in 1995 call in the SocialSecurity and immigration numbers of their new hires to INS. The number ofemployers using this system is expected to increase to 700 in 1996. Clinton's proposal would also provide $28 million for a pilot workerverification system. The pilot worker registry would permit a test of severalways to combine INS and Social Security data in major immigration states sothat employers could quickly verify a worker's legal status. The INS is planning to reduce from the current 29 documents to 16 thedocuments that workers can present to employers to establish their legal rightto work in the US. An estimated 50 percent of all illegal aliens working inthe US present fraudulent documents to employers.

The workers would be protected in the US, accordingto Lungren, by the right to change employers, and induced to return by having10 to 25 percent of their US earnings deducted in a manner that they couldre-claim only upon their return to Mexico. Los Angeles Times editorial page manager Frank del Olmo argued in a January31, 1995 Op-Ed in the newspaper that a guest worker program is the "least bad"means to control illegal immigration. He too called for withholding part ofthe alien workers' pay to induce their return, and argued that the increasedsophistication of the workers and media attention would prevent abuses. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner argued strongly against a guest workerprogram, calling it a short-term fix that produces long-term problems anddistortions. Meissner argued that guest workers are inherently exploitable,and that the notion that a country can add workers to its labor force and notresidents to its population is fundamentally flawed. However, agricultural interests in February 1995 made the rounds inCongress, laying the groundwork for a proposal to introduce a non-H2A foreignfarm worker program. Their success in securing an alternative to the then H-2program in the early 1980s has led to speculation that farmers may be even moresuccessful in today's Congress. A decade ago, when the ample supply of unskilled farm labor was threatenedby employer sanctions, the debate over guest workers centered on how todetermine whether there was a "need" for foreign workers, meaning that issuessuch as how soon before workers were needed must the US employer request helpfrom the US Employment Service to find US workers, what wages and benefits hadto be offered to them, and how to handle complaints that US employers findAmerican workers unqualified. The 1995 calls for guest workers, by contrast,downplays whether foreigners are needed, and focuses on measures to assure thatany foreign workers admitted will in fact return to their countries of origin. Programs that aim to add workers to the labor force without addingpermanent residents to the population have produced one of the few "principlesof migration"--there is nothing more permanent than temporary foreign workers.Countries initiate guest worker programs for four major reasons: to alleviatelabor shortages, to better manage inevitable migration, to providework-and-learn opportunities, and to promote socio-economic integration. Guestworker programs generate economic, migration management, and developmentbenefits, but they also create distortion costs in the labor importingcountry's economy and labor market, as well as creating a dependency that leadseverywhere to some leakage from temporary to permanent settlement. Past guest worker programs attempted to use rules and regulations to manageeconomically-motivated migration that, in turn, changed the economies ofsending and receiving areas. Asian countries are pioneering economicinstruments to manage migration, such as levying a tax on employers who hireguest workers and requiring the guest workers to deposit 30 to 50 percent oftheir earnings in savings accounts that they can reclaim only in their countryof origin.

Ken Chavez, "Call for Guest Workers," SacramentoBee, February 7, 1995, A3. ___________________________________________ EvaluatingStepped-Up BorderControls The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in January 1995 that INSefforts to deter the entry of illegal aliens at the border rather thanapprehend them in the US seem to be working. Beginning with Operation Hold theLine in El Paso, followed by Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego and OperationSafeguard in Arizona, the INS has installed steel fences along the border andmassed agents there to discourage attempted entries. In El Paso, there were 8,000 to 10,000 Mexicans entering El Paso daily inDecember 1993, when the INS launched Operation Hold the Line by moving 400agents to the border to try to prevent illegal entries. Apprehensions havesince fallen by 73 percent, and the fence has been repaired and fortified tobecome a formidable obstacle. In San Diego, by contrast, Operation Gatekeeper on October 1, 1994 soughtto push aliens attempting illegal entry from the western six miles of border tothe eastern 60 miles, where mountains and desert make detection andapprehension easier. Aliens were deterred at the western border by a fence,lights, and then three tiers of Border Patrol agents. Apprehensions firstfell, but rose by 18 percent in January 1995 versus January 1994. Five Republican California congressman called for the Border Patrol toabandon its three-tier strategy in San Diego and move all the agents to theborder, similar to the El Paso blockade. The Border Patrol has begun movingagents closer to the border as a visible deterrent, but Border Patrol officialssay their "push them east" strategy remains intact. The Border Patrol arguesthat a saturate-the-line approach would not work in San Diego because of theterrain differences and the desperation of the crossers. There is also concernthat this desperateness might lead to violence against Border Patrol agents. The GAO concluded that the prevention strategy reduced apprehensions,crime, and Border Patrol-alien confrontations, and enjoyed strong publicsupport in the areas where it was tried. In addition, INS believes that someMexicans in the interior of the country are deterred by reports of more agentson the border. However, there is also evidence that aliens attempting illegal entries mayhave shifted from e.g., El Paso and San Diego to Arizona, where apprehensionsdoubled between January 1994 and 1995. There is also limited evidence that theprice of being smuggled into the US--often the most reliable indicator ofsupply and demand in illegal markets--has risen, but not as much as might havebeen expected--from $200 to $300 to be smuggled to Los Angeles to $250 to$400. There were 1.3 million apprehensions by the Border Patrol in FY93, and onemillion in 1994. The number of enforcement hours was stable at about 8.8million. The Mexican border crimes task force expects an average of 30,000 crossingattempts per month. Smugglers sometimes lead aliens on "banzai runs" upInterstate 5 south of San Diego; 120 people have been killed since 1985 runningon or near border freeways in the San Diego area. Along Mexico's southern border, a special operation will target thesmuggling of US-bound non-Mexicans.

There were 24,000 feweremployment-based immigrants admitted, 15,000 fewer unmarried sons and daughtersof US citizens, and 21,000 fewer dependents of legalized aliens. Citizenship applications have increased dramatically, especially in thefive-county area around Los Angeles. Government officials believe that acombination of fear, convenience and increased political awareness areresponsible for the rise. There were 423,000 naturalizations in 1994, comparedto 314,681 in 1993. In California, more than 110,000 aliens became naturalized US citizens inFY94, twice the usual number. In Los Angeles alone, the Immigration andNaturalization Service approved 13,259 applications for citizenship in Octoberand November 1994. During the same two months of 1993, the Los Angelesdistrict, which includes Orange, Ventura, and Riverside counties, approved only5,510 applications for naturalization. INS officials can interview no more than 600 naturalization applicantsdaily, which means that there is an average six month wait between filingpapers and participating in a naturalization ceremony. Anyone who has been inthe US legally for five years is eligible to apply for US citizenship. Most ofthe three million aliens who were legalized in 1987-88 under IRCA'slegalization programs now qualify to apply for US citizenship.

Thomas Elias, "Immigrants suddenly rush to becomecitizens," San Francisco Examiner, February 19, 1995. ___________________________________________ PesoDevaluation, US and Mexican Jobs, andMigration The Mexican peso fell from $1=5.4 pesos on February 1 to $1=6 pesos onFebruary 28. Many businesses in Mexico came to a near standstill because offoreign-exchange losses, sales declines, and a loss of confidence. By oneestimate, as many as 250,000 jobs, equivalent to 1 percent of Mexico'semployment, and 2.5 percent of formal sector employment, have been lost sinceDecember. Most of the auto companies in Mexico, for example, closed theirassembly lines temporarily because of expected sales declines of 30 to 50percent in 1995; consumer durables sales are down as a result of consumerinterest rates of 60 to 70 percent. Many Mexican companies are expected to go bankrupt and lay off theirworkers as the Mexican economy shrinks by perhaps two or three percent in 1995.Some foreign investors that had announced expansions or new facilities inMexico put their plans on hold; total foreign investment in Mexico fell 22percent in 1994, with most of the decline in the last 10 days of the year,although direct foreign investment in factories and equipment rose over 60percent. Under the US aid plan withdrawn on January 31, Mexico would have depositedthe roughly $7 billion per year it earns from oil exports in the US FederalReserve Bank, so that the US could keep the money if Mexico defaulted on theloans that Clinton proposed. However, Congress proved unwilling to approve the$40 billion loan guarantee plan because it would allegedly also be bailing outUS and foreign investors who had pumped billions of dollars into Mexico.Private capital flows to developing countries world wide have quadrupled since1989, from about $40 billion to $160 billion in 1994. The Dallas Federal Reserve Bank estimated that a 40 percent pesodevaluation would result in 20,000 to 30,000 lost US jobs, due both to lower USexports to Mexico and increased illegal Mexican immigration. The US exportedgoods worth about $49 billion to Mexico in 1994 and, since each $50,000 inexports is assumed to support one US job, this implies that about one millionUS workers had jobs in 1994 that depended on exports to Mexico. If exports toMexico fall by $10 billion in 1995, there would be 100,000 lost US jobs--actualjob losses would be less because some of the goods not exported to Mexico couldbe exported elsewhere. Some 36,000 US workers have filed claims with the US Department of Laborasserting that they lost their jobs because of NAFTA-inspired trade increases.In January, 24 members of the US House of Representatives sponsored a bill thatcalls on the US to withdraw from NAFTA. As apprehensions of illegal aliens increased, there continued to besecond-guessing on how much illegal immigration will be prevented by US aid forMexico. Apprehensions were up in January in Texas and Arizona, and down in SanDiego. Commentators such as Patrick Buchanan argued that adding just $1billion of the aid to the US Border Patrol budget would do far more to preventillegal immigration than providing loans and loan guarantees. Many in Congress had demanded that, as a condition of receiving US aid,Mexico must "cooperate" with the US to reduce drug trafficking and illegalimmigration. At the second meeting of the Bilateral Commission on February 13and 14, 1995 in Zacatecas, Mexico pledged to double the Grupo Beta borderpolice unit that fights smuggling and drug trafficking on the Mexican side ofthe border. Mexico also agreed to begin a joint pilot program to repatriate illegalimmigrants from San Diego to the Mexican interior. In Texas, two new GrupoBeta units will be formed and a struggling Grupo Beta unit in Arizona will bereorganized. Mexico also reorganized its National Migration Institute, andannounced that its migration policies would be based on the three principles ofborder enforcement; immigration that benefits Mexico; and protecting the humanrights of all persons in Mexico regardless of their legal status. Mexico strongly denied that it would block its side of the border toprevent illegal migration to the US in exchange for aid. Despite a provisionof the Mexican constitution that permits Mexicans to leave the country only atauthorized ports of exit, a Mexican official asserted that Mexican lawprohibits police from stopping persons leaving the country.

Tim Golden, "Mexicans Deny They WouldOrder Border Crackdown in Return for US Loan Guarantee," New York Times,January 27, 1995, A5. ___________________________________________ Welfare,Taxes, andImmigrants The General Accounting Office on February 2, 1995 released a report thatconcluded that immigrants are twice as likely as US citizens received benefitsfrom the Supplemental Security Income and Aid to Families with DependentChildren programs in 1993. Half of the immigrant recipients of SSI and AFDCare in California, which had 38 percent of all immigrants in the March 1994Current Population Survey (CPS). Immigrants received an estimated $3.3 billionof the $24 billion in SSI benefits in 1993, and $1.2 billion of the $22 billionin AFDC payments. Both the Clinton Administration and the Republicans "Contract with America"would reduce the eligibility of aliens for these benefit programs. Currently,legal immigrants, refugees, asylum applicants, and certain other PRUCOL(persons residing under color of law) aliens are eligible to apply for thesebenefits. However, US immigration law permits aliens seeking entry to beexcluded if they are likely to become a public charge. An alien can pledge tobe self-sufficient by providing proof of sufficient personal resources, a joboffer that offers a sufficient wage, post a bond, and/or have a US residentsponsor sign an affidavit that promises to support the alien if necessary. It is estimated that 90 percent or more of the family-sponsored immigrantsadmitted to the US obtain bonds from US residents in which the US sponsorpromises to support the immigrant if he/she cannot support him/her self.Several courts have ruled that these affidavits of support are not binding onthe US resident. For this reason, sponsorship rules were changed to requirethat, if a sponsored immigrant applies for SSI or AFDC benefits after arrival,a portion of the sponsor's income and other resources will be "deemed" to beavailable to the immigrant as part of their income in determining whether theimmigrant is eligible for benefits. This deeming period is three years afterarrival for sponsored immigrants applying for AFDC, and five years forimmigrants applying for SSI. The Clinton Administration's proposal would extend the deeming period forboth SSI and AFDC to five years, and maintain the eligibility for cashassistance of current recipients. The House Republicans proposal would, oneyear after enactment, make all aliens ineligible for AFDC and SSI for six yearsafter their arrival, except for refugees and aliens 75 and older who have livedin the US at least five years. If access to benefits were restricted as proposed by the ClintonAdministration, program savings may be $1 to $5 billion annually; the Houseproposal might result in program savings of $2.5 billion annually. Savingsestimates are difficult to make because aliens denied federal benefits may turnto state and local government programs, naturalize, turn to sponsors forsupport, or not immigrate. The IRS is checking the validity of claims for refunds that low-earners canreceive under the Earned Income Tax Credit. The EITC is a negative income tax,paying up to $306 to single workers, and $2,528 to a family with two or morechildren. About 15 million people in 1994 received $20 billion EITC on their1993 earnings, including 2.2 million receiving $2.3 billion in California. Theaverage payment nationwide is about $1200. There has been a sharp growth in the number of Hispanic-surnamed personsfiling for EITC in California, prompting speculation that immigrants areapplying. Nancy Bolton of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project obtained dataon tax returns in 1989 and 1992, and found that there was a 12 percent increasein the number of Hispanic households filing California tax returns, and thattheir mean income fell by 13 percent to $20,629 in 1992.

On February 8, 1995, a California state court issued an injunction thatprevents California colleges and universities from inquiring about the legalstatus of the estimated 13,600 illegal alien students, most attendingCalifornia community colleges, until a full trial on Prop. 187's provisions isheld in June 1995. On February 13, 1995, a U.S. District judge dismissed California'slawsuit demanding $2.4 billion per year from the federal government for thecost of providing services to illegal aliens. California's $56 billion annualbudget for FY95-96 assumes that the federal government will provide $732million to reimburse it for the costs of services provided to unauthorizedimmigrants. In Florida, where an estimated seven percent of the state's 14 millionpeople are unauthorized aliens, two groups are gathering signatures for a Prop.187 initiative. Save Our State plans a November 1996 vote, while Floridiansfor Immigration Control is still planning its campaign. A similar campaign isnot expected in Texas because the state does not have an initiative process.

Until January30, 1995, the INS was accepting provisional applications from illegal aliens,and issuing them working papers, if they claimed that they would have appliedin 1987-88, but were discouraged by initially overly strict guidelines oncontinuous residency.

Under a September 9, 1994 agreement, Cuba halted the exodusof migrants, and the US promised to admit at least 20,000 Cuban immigrantsannually, but only from among those who applied to immigrate to the US in Cuba.Over 200,000 Cubans have applied to migrate to the US in Havana. The Clinton Administration says it will allow family members to visit theCuban refugees housed in Guantanamo. The administration decided to permit thevisits after the transfer of the Cubans from Panama to Guantanamo. In Panama,the Cuban refugees were permitted visits from family living in the US and othercountries. On February 14, 1995, some 55 Cubans who had originally landed in the GrandCayman Islands arrived in Florida on rafts after their power boat sank one-halfmile from shore. There are believed to be at least 700 Cubans on the Caymansand, if they reach the US, they have very different rights than if they areintercepted at sea--after an initial period of detainment, most are quietlyreleased into the US.

Jacques Santer, president ofthe EU Executive Commission, said that the EU continues to remain committed tothe free moment of people. Britain heads the EU nations seeking to preserve national border controls,for historic reasons that it traces to its island mentality and its traditionof independence. A junior minister in charge of British immigration affairsbrought the issue to a head in mid-February, when he resigned to protest thepossible loss of Britain's right to control entry over its borders. Britishgovernment lawyers reportedly asserted that the opt-out of no bordersnegotiated by former Prime Minister Thatcher would not prevail if the EuropeanCommission were to take Britain to the European Court of Justice. Other government officials and Prime Minister John Major asserted thatBritain has the right to maintain border controls. Major was particularityupset that the junior minister raised the specter of millions of immigrantsflooding into the country. European officials say that Germany, the richest EUnation, is the real magnet for immigrants, not Britain. Britain has seen the proportionately largest outflow of population to therest of the EU in the past 20 years. British citizens are the largestexpatriate communities in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece. The Britishexpatriate community in France has doubled since 1973, from 25,000 to50,000, and in Germany there are 100,000 Britons, more than ever despite adeclining military presence. In part to offset fears of being swamped by immigrants, the British HomeSecretary announced on February 16 that an extra 12,000 asylum seekers per yearwould be expelled from Britain, and that measures would be taken to streamlinethe asylum process. Eighty percent of the asylum applications are rejected,five percent are granted refugee status, and 15 percent are granted exceptionalleave to stay on compassionate grounds. The main countries of origin ofapplicants in 1994 were Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Ghana. Most of thosewho received asylum were from Iraq, Iran and Turkey. The British Immigration Office disagrees with the number of immigrantsreported by the Home Office. The Home Office says that the total number ofimmigrants in 1993 was 55,640, only a slight increase over the 52,790 in 1992and 53,900 in 1990. The number of immigrants who have been removed, either bydeportation or after formal warnings, also remained stable at about 6,000 eachyear in the 1990s. The Immigration Office believes that these data understate illegalimmigration. The Immigration Service Union believes that, including illegalentrants would triple immigration to 150,000 per year. Concern has been raised that the opening of the Eurotunnel has also openeda new door for illegal immigrants into Britain. Police have caught 120 illegalimmigrants since limited service began a few months ago; they are prepared fora massive influx as service increases. An important part of the Schengen agreement was the establishment of acomputerized database that will contain information on asylum, illegalimmigrants, and persons with criminal records. Agreements that permit policeto pursue illegals across borders, and to request surveillance on suspects inother countries, is scheduled to become effective in 1995. With the implementation of the Schengen agreement, the German governmentwill supply an additional 500 border police to the southwestern state ofBaden-Wurttemberg. According to the Baden-Wurttemberg Interior Ministry, 1,665people were apprehended trying to enter Germany illegally from France in thefirst eight months of 1994. Most of the illegal immigrants are Albanians fromKosovo. These numbers are expected to rise dramatically after March 26, whenborder controls are abolished. German officials are also concerned thatIslamic activists, in trouble in France, will seek shelter in Germany. SomeAlgerian fundamentalists already have a base near Cologne. The IOM estimates that there are 1.5 to 3 million illegal or clandestineworkers in Western Europe, including 300,000 to 500,000 Albanians in Greece andItaly, or 10 percent of Albania's labor force. Most find jobs, sometimes withthe help of labor smugglers, in construction, agriculture, non-durablesmanufacturing such as garments, and hotels and restaurants. A report released on February 22 by the European Council on Refugees andExiles, "Safe Third Country, Myths and Realities," reports that EU membercountries are violating the Geneva Convention principle of "non refoulement."The report claims that thousands of refugees are being expelled from the EUevery month without any attempt to hear their asylum case. The ERCE General Secretary asserted that EU member-nations should not havesigned the London Convention in 1992 because it declares that asylum seekerswho travel through "safe" countries can be deported. This may result in adeportation chain, in which the asylum seeker is sent back to the country fromwhich he or she fled persecution. According to the ERCE, in one six Somali nationals who arrived in Belgiumon May 29, 1994 were deported to the Czech Republic, then to Slovakia, and thento the Ukraine, the first nation they transited.

The bill would have granted German citizenship tochildren born of settled foreigners in Germany, a position advocated bygovernment's commissioner for foreigners, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, who wantsnaturalization laws now based on descent to be changed. Currently, foreign children may apply for citizenship if one parent hasGerman citizenship. Otherwise, they may gain German citizenship by satisfyingresidence and other requirements and by renouncing their citizenship ofbirth. Every year tens of thousands of people try to cross the Oder Riverillegally that separates Poland and Germany. About 60 percent of those whocross the Oder are Romanians. Most rely on smugglers (Schleppers) to sneakthem across the river. If the would-be immigrants are not detected by Germanradar, hunting dogs, and helicopters, they will usually be led by a Schlepper12 miles along a dirt road to Eisenhuettenstadt, and then to Berlin to findwork on building sites or in hotels and restaurants. Being smuggled to Germany typically costs DM1,500 ($1,000), of which DM300must be paid in advance, and the rest during the first few months of theimmigrant's stay in Germany, according to the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS). The BGSis more concerned about a wave of immigrants from Russia, where passports totravel abroad will be freely available after June, 1995, than the end of bordercontrols with Schengen. Fewer than one per cent of the illegal immigrantsapprehended apply for asylum. For the second time, the German Interior Minister has extended its freezeon the deportation of Kurdish refugees to allow a parliamentary committeehearing on the issue. Bonn would like to speed up deportations to discourageasylum seekers, but it wants to ensure the safety of the Kurds in Turkey. ATurkish court recently imposed jail terms on eight Kurdish deputies forcomments they made in support of Kurd's in Turkey's Parliament. Norway continues to return Turkish refugees who have been denied asylum toTurkey. In 1994, 30 Turkish nationals, mostly Kurdish, requested asylum inNorway. Only one was granted asylum. Norway rejects most of those western Turkey, while those from southeastTurkey -- where Kurdish separatists are fighting the Turkish army -- are mostoften granted asylum. There are large numbers of Kurdish refugees living inmakeshift camps around Istanbul and Ankara. Human rights organizations do notagree that Kurds are safe in around these Turkish cities. In a ruling by the Court of the Justice of the European Union on February14, 1995, Germany was ordered to change its method of taxing border commutersand immigrants. A Belgian national named Schumacker commuted to a job inGermany, and Germany required him to pay taxes there as a single worker, eventhough he was married and his wife was unemployed. If he were considered aGerman resident, his wife's status would have been recognized, and he wouldhave been able to deduct certain work-related expenses from his income. The Germans argued that the discrimination against Schumacker was based onresidence and not on nationality, so that Schumacker could not challenge itunder Regulation 1612/68 of the October 15, 1968 on free movement of workers,which stipulates in Article 7 that workers in one Member States who arenationals of another are eligible for the same tax advantages as nationalworkers. The Court found that "non-residents are usually non-nationals," sothat Germany's failure to take into account Schumacker's family situation inlevying taxes was a form of discrimination based on national origin.

National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen deplored butdid not condemn the killing, possibly hurting his chances in France'spresidential balloting this spring. The first election is April 23, and therun-off May 7. According to La Pen, his supporters are instructed not to putup signs at night, and not to carry arms. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua warned that the world faced a campaign ofdestabilization by Muslim. Pasqua called on "democrats" in Algeria to holdfirm. French officials fear that the fall of the Algerian government mightproduce a mass exodus to France. The populations of Algeria, Morocco andTunisia are young--more than half their population are below the age of 25--andhave high unemployment rates-- 50 percent in Algeria. Income gaps between Europe and North Africa are widening. In 1992,per capita GDP in France was $22,260, versus $1840 in Algeria, $1030 inMorocco, and $$1720 in Tunisia. The populations of the Maghreb are projectedto grow from 60 million in 1992, about the same as France's 57 million, to 83to 86 million in 2010. French officials report that the number of people deported from France in1994 rose 53 percent to 11,400; another 566 were expelled, at a total cost tothe French taxpayer $18 million. According to the head of French immigration,illegal immigrants, once mainly from the France's former colonies in Africa, in1994 included nationals of Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and evenChina and Sri Lanka. Increased illegal immigration is blamed on smugglers,especially Asians, who supply illegal labor for leather and constructionindustries.

TheFreedom Party, which got 23 percent of the vote in the October 1994 election,wants to end immigration to Austria. Haider has said that stopping illegalimmigration will be the central platform in his party's campaign to take powerin 1998, the next scheduled general election. According to Haider, there are 250,000 illegal aliens in Austria, and "Thesafety of our streets is directly linked to the problem of illegal aliens inAustria." Austria's immigration control problem stems primarily from its geography;it has an easily crossed and unpatrolled border with Slovenia. Austria joinedthe EU January 1, 1995, and when Austria abolishes border controls with Germanyand Italy as part of the Schengen agreement, border controls with non-Schengennations will be increased. Gypsies in Austria are the latest victims of racial terrorism in Austria.On February 5, four of the 117 Gypsies in the small village of Oberwert, 75miles south of Vienna, were killed by a pipe bomb hidden by a sign that read"Gypsies Go Back to India." One day later, another bomb with the sign "Go backto Dalmatia (a reference to a Croatian region) was found near a school. A neo-Nazi group has taken responsibility for both bombs. In 1993, theAustrian government recognized about 5,000 of the estimated 20,000 gypsies inthe country as an official minority. There are an estimated six milliongypsies in Europe. The Austrian government has changed its quota of foreign workers from ninepercent to eight percent of a firm's employees. An initiative was proposed inthe Austrian parliament in late January guaranteeing work permits to Bosnianrefugees and the foreign children of international managers, although the quotaof such permits for 1995 is already exceeded. At the same time, the number ofguest workers from the EU has already increased by 20,000; EU workers do notneed a permit in order to work in Austria. The number of foreigners (workers, self-employed, family members,pensioners) entering Austria is limited to 17,000 in 1995 (14,900 in 1994).

Some Russian leaders used the threat of massemigration as a means to induce Western nations to provide aid in the early1990s. However, the threat of mass migration from a region that had very highrates of labor force participation and very low population growth was nevercredible, according to some experts. There is a steady emigration from Russiaof about 100,000 ethnic Germans, Jews, and Greeks each month, but Russia is anet immigration area. For example, so-called "shabai" are illegal Ukrainianworkers in Russia who work at Moscow construction jobs for up to $200 permonth, even though the prevailing local wage is just $50 per month. However,these illegal aliens in Russia have no residence permits and thus no access togovernment housing or benefits such as health care. About three million of the estimated 25 million Russians outside Russiahave returned within the past three years. For example, Kazakhs are only 40percent of Kazakhstan's 17 million people, but with salaries only $25 permonth, and priority for "good" state jobs going to Kazakhs, many Russianprofessionals think that their only hope is to emigrate. The Ukraine and Russia dropped the issue of dual citizenship when theysigned a friendship treaty on February 8. The Ukraine strongly objects toRussian proposals that the Ukraine grant dual citizenship on demand, fearingthat a large Russian minority could gain political power.

To receive Estonian citizenship, a person must live in Estonia for at leastsix years, up from three years. Intending citizens must pass a test todemonstrate they are able to comprehend an official announcement, informationin the press, and warning signs; they must also write a simple text inEstonian. Besides taking an oath of allegiance to the Estonian state, the newcitizens must prove - in a written test - their knowledge of the Constitutionof Estonia and its law on citizenship. A new regulation also allows the government to rescind Estonian citizenshipif it is determined that applicants are also citizens of another state.Estonian citizens who have acquired the citizenship of another country by birthmust give up that citizenship or Estonian citizenship at age 18.

The delegates also decided to maintain the December, 1995 deadline bywhich all Vietnamese asylum seekers throughout Asia should be repatriated. Anexception, until early 1996, was made for Hong Kong, which has more than halfof the 45,000 boat people in the Southeast Asia. The plan must still beapproved at the Comprehensive Plan of Action Steering Committee meeting inGeneva on March 16. Voluntary repatriation is the goal for the 23,000 Vietnamese still in HongKong, though over 1,000 boat people have been forced onto flights to Vietnamsince 1991, according the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The UShas been reluctant to support forced repatriation. Forced repatriationagreements have been signed with all first asylum countries expect Thailand.Vietnamese asylum seekers in the Philippines have threatened to commit suiciderather than be sent back to Vietnam. At the meeting, China announced that the Hong Kong will be not serve as theport of first asylum after 1997. No asylum seekers have ever been turned awayfrom Hong Kong. There are 80,000 Vietnamese in Germany, about half of whom have essentiallyan immigrant status in the former West Germany. There were also about 11,000Vietnamese in the former Eastern Germany. Some 20,000 Vietnamese have appliedfor asylum in Germany, but only about 200 have been granted refugee status. In January 1995, Germany and Vietnam reached an agreement under whichGermany will provide DM 100 million per year and Vietnam will agree to acceptits repatriated citizens. The agreement does not rule out forciblerepatriation. During a three-day visit to Vietnam on January 18, Cambodia's First PrimeMinister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, promised Vietnam that there would be notmass expulsions of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia. Cambodia also agreed tobegin talks in February on what to do about Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. Vietnam estimates that 150,000 Vietnamese live in Cambodia--some have livedthere for generations. The Cambodian government says up to one millionVietnamese live in the country, and many are illegal economic migrants. Ethnic Vietnamese who left the Cambodian-Vietnamese border in 1993 cannotreturn to Cambodia unless they have pre-1970 Cambodian papers. Those withpost-1970 papers will be accepted on a case-by-case basis. Those without anylegal identification papers will not be allowed to into Vietnam or Cambodia. The 3,705 ethnic Vietnamese who fled to Chrey Thom in 1993 are waitingthere to return to Cambodia. The refugees traveled to the border under theprotection of the United Nations, after fleeing massacres of ethnic Vietnameseby the Khmer Rouge. Some 100 ethnic Vietnamese were reported to have beenkilled by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in 1993. Eric de Castro, "Vietnamese threaten mass suicide in Philippines," Reuters,February 23, 1995.

Thegovernment will replace its foreign trainee program with a work permit systemthat grants more rights to foreign workers. The Nepalese workers claimed thatthe trainee program was tantamount to slavery. There are between 33,600 to 84,000 foreigners legally employed in Korea,and 19,000 to 32,000 of them are industrial trainees. The new labor policy announced by the government promises easier entry forforeign workers if small companies improve labor conditions. The governmentnext year will introduce a 'work permit' system, similar to ones used inSingapore and Germany, to ensure a steady supply of imported labor. Under thework permit system, foreign workers will receive that same wages and legalprotections available to Korean workers. There is some confusion in press reports about which program will beterminated. It is not clear if the work permit system will replace a recentlyadopted training program for skilled workers, or only the unskilled "industrialtrainee" program that began in 1993. The Korean Federation of Small Businesses is offering 50,000 won (about$63) for information on "runaway" foreign workers. About 20 percent of theindustrial trainees admitted to Korea in the last half of 1994 left theiremployers--who offer them less-than-minimum training wages--for higher wagejobs elsewhere. Beginning in March 1995, legal foreign workers will be eligible for workerscompensation coverage after paying a premium of $3.80 per month. Under thisoptional plan, employers will also pay $3.80 per month. "South Korea to open job market to foreigners," The Xinhua News Agency,February 14, 1995. S.

Although Hong Kong willbe a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration laws, there is amisconception among millions of Chinese that the gates will open for them. A delegation from Hong Kong was told in Beijing last December that amassive publicity campaign would be launched six months before the change ofsovereignty to explain that the rules for traveling to Hong Kong will notchange. Hong Kong legislators are asking the government to review its immigrationpolicy on Chinese mainland spouses and the children of Hong Kong residents.Current law permits the entry of children of Hong Kong residents, but notnecessarily their mothers. There is concern that this ambiguity in the lawcould lead to a large influx of unaccompanied illegal child immigrants. The daily quota for mainlanders is 105 one-way entry permits. Fifteen ofthese are for the wives of Hong Kong men and another 15 are for mainland-bornchildren of permanent residents. The remaining 70 are allocated by localChinese officials. Hong Kong officials estimate that of the 300,000 mainland-born children ofHong Kong residents in China, about 64,000 legitimate children will be eligiblefor permanent residency. About 55,000 mainland-born children with residencyrights are projected to be in China in 1997. The number of children under 15who came to settle in Hong Kong on one-way permits in 1992, 1993 and 1994 was7,853, 8,396 and 11,156, respectively. In Hong Kong, up to 10 maids had their contracts terminated every day atthe end of 1994, as families went on holiday, and chose not to take along orpay their maids, according to the chairman of the Asian Domestic Workers'Union. Maids whose contracts are terminated have two weeks to find another jobbefore they are required to leave Hong Kong. "Hong Kong fears wave of illegal immigrants from China after 1997,"Deutsche Presse-Agentur, February 13, 1995. South China Morning Post December27, 1994. ___________________________________________ ChineseUnemployment andMigration China has a labor force of about 600 million, with 440 million peasants,109 million in the state sector, 36 million in the collective sector, and 15million in the private sector. The official unemployment rate is 2.8 percent,but the real unemployment rate may be 15 to 17 percent, or the highest indecades. Workers are moving from rural to urban areas in response to higher wages,but once there, they are competing with redundant urban workers for jobs.Annual average incomes for farmers are $106, $262 for rural factory workers,and $419 for urban factory workers. Many urban workers are "xia gang" or offpost, meaning that they remain attached to their work unit, but they receiveonly a portion of their wages and do not report to work. Competition between "xia gang" and rural-urban migrants has led to tension,especially in southeastern provinces such as Guangdong near Hong Kong, wherethere are at least 13 million rural migrants looking for jobs. Chinese andHong Kong officials are especially concerned with the increase of illegalimmigration from the northern provinces of China. These immigrants are blamedfor an increase in crime. Most cities and provinces try to protect local residents. In Shanghai, anofficial asserted that the four million migrants in that city should do its"dirty work." Only about 500,000 of Shanghai's migrant workers are officiallyregistered, which allows migrants to work legally in factories. Some predict that social tensions and emigration pressures will risebecause of China's one-child policy. Chinese parents prefer boys to girls, andin 1990, there were 114 boy babies born for each 100 girl babies, far higherthan the usual 105 boys to 100 girl ratio. This means that there are likely tobe one million more 20 year old boys than girls in 2010 and, since emigrationstreams are often led by solo males, some predict rising emigrationpressures. Despite China's one-child policy, the population is growing by 1.1 percentper year, and reached 1.2 billion in February 1995. In 1994, there were about21 million births and seven million deaths. Food production is stable ordeclining, as China, with 22 percent of the world's population, tries to feeditself with seven percent or 235 million acres of the world's arable land.

There are an estimated 293,000 illegalaliens in Japan, and the government is simply repatriating, rather thandetaining or fining, those who lost their homes and jobs in the earthquake.Illegal aliens are not entitled to housing or most other assistance that isbeing made available to quake victims. As Japan struggles to build replacement housing for those left homeless,the government came under pressure to permit foreign carpenters to enter tobuild the 2x4 wooden homes common in the western US, but rare in Japan. Thesehomes withstood the quake far better than traditional Japanese homes, but Japanis reluctant to permit US builders to bring to Japan the carpenters skilled in2x4 construction. Japan classifies carpenters as simple labor, and oneofficial asserted that, "Even in an emergency, we don't desire letting insimple[foreign] laborers." Some 2,365 illegal foreigners were deported from Japan following a majorcrackdown in September, 1994. More than 90 percent of those caught wereworking illegally, usually in small and medium-sized enterprises, particularlyat construction sites and in metal goods manufacturing. About one-fourth (509)were Koreans, followed by 363 Thais and 292 Chinese. In 1993 Japan repatriated177,904 illegal immigrants, up from 169,443 in the previous year. The Kochi Prefectural Government announced that it would begin to acceptapplications from and hire foreigners for certain city jobs, despite a 1953 lawthat requires all public servants to be Japanese citizens. About 1.3 millionforeigners were registered as residing in Japan in January 1994. The Japanese deep-sea fishing labor management council has approved the useof more foreign workers on fishing vessels because of a shortage of Japaneseworkers. The council will raise the current ceiling of 25 percent foreignfisherman to 40 percent of the crew. About 3,400 foreign fisherman worked onthe 1,700 Japanese deep-sea fishing boats in 1994. About 70 percent of theforeign fisherman were Indonesians, followed by Filipinos and Peruvians. Wagesfor foreign fisherman are about one-tenth of the wages of Japanese fishermen.

There are, by some estimates, one millionforeign workers in Malaysia--half are unauthorized, and many are reportedly thevictims of thugs who take advantage of their illegal status to rob them. Somereportedly pay $20 monthly, on earnings of $ 200 monthly, as protection moneyto local gangs. The Malaysian government on January 7, 1994 imposed a ban on theimportation of unskilled foreign workers. There were several calls inFebruary, 1995, for Malaysia to review its foreign worker policies. TheNational Union of Plantation Workers warned that foreign workers will become apermanent feature of the Malaysian labor market unless the government takesaction. It recommends that a committee of union, employer, and governmentofficials review employer requests for foreign workers. The Association of Foreign Workers Agencies argues that foreign workersmust be legal and better regulated. They complain that, even with thegovernment's one-stop offices, there is a three to four month lag between anemployer's application and the arrival of the foreign workers. There are 168employment agencies that bring foreign workers into Malaysia, and 101 aremembers of the Association. Each agency must post a RM 100,000 or $40,000 bondwith the immigration department. The Malaysian Prime Minister told members of the private sector, thatinstead of importing new recruits from overseas, they should hire workers whohave already entered the country illegally. The presence of foreign workers istaxing the country's infrastructure, he said, especially in housing, health andeducation, said the prime minister. Malaysia is calling for the private sectorto develop industries which are not labor intensive. Malaysia issued 200,000 three-year work permits in 1992, and there arefears that the government will not renew some of them in 1995. Developers inJohor Bahru worry the their construction projects will come to a halt if theforeign workers permits are not renewed. About 90,000 of the passes were givento foreign workers in Johor. The passes are not automatically renewed andworkers are required to return to their native land to renew the passes or theycan be renewed by the employer in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia announced that illegal foreigners who marry aboriginal Orang Asliwill be deported if apprehended. Some 241 foreigners, mostly men, reportedlymarried Orang Asli women.

Gabon, a once richoil producer in recession, has between 75,000 to 100,000 foreign workers,primarily from Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Cameroon, France and Senegal.Since the September, 1994 announcement of the February 15, 1995 deadline,55,000 foreign nationals left the country, and 15,000 legalized theirresidency. There was criticism of the Gabonese government because of the fees onmigrants wishing to remain in the country. The fees varied by country oforigin, with critics contending that migrants from the richest countries werebeing charged the least. French citizens, for example, were required to payonly about $100 for a new residence card, while immigrants from many of WestAfrica's poorest countries were charged as much as $1,200. Criticism of the Gabon government increased as the February 15 deadlineapproached. Many immigrants could not afford the air fare and used trucks andships to return home. The Beninese government authorized hiring a ship toevacuate Beninese living illegally in Gabon prior to the February 15 deadline. About 1,000 people, mostly Nigerians, Ghanians and nationals of neighboringEquatorial Guinea, have been detained by a special unit to hunt illegalimmigrants since February 15. Those detained are being held in a camp and willbe repatriated. Hundreds of people were reported to have fled into therainforest around the oil town of Port-Gentil to escape the police. The twin-island nations of Sao Tome and Principe have set up an emergencycommission and requested help from the United Nations to assist with the influxof returnees. There are over 20,000 Sao Tomeans in Gabon forming Sao Tome'ssecond largest emigrant community. About 25,000 Sao Tomeans live in Angola anda further 10,000 live in Portugal. The Gabonese government warned that any violence against foreigners wouldbe dealt with severely. In 1992, violence followed the expulsion of thousandsof illegal Nigerian workers. During an anti- immigrant campaign in late 1993,many West Africans were rounded up and jailed in poorly maintained prisons.About 60 of them, mostly Nigerians and Ghanaians, died in custody. The Ivory Coast, also a magnet for foreign workers, enacted laws recentlythat barred foreigners from voting. The Ivory Coast recently passed laws thatbar foreigners from voting and require that presidential candidates be of pureIvorian parentage.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin continues to called for up to25,000 foreign workers to be brought into Israel to eliminate the need forPalestinian commuters. The number of Palestinian workers in Israel peaked 110,000 in 1987, andthere were about 60,000 before the ban. The mid-February agreement permits upto 15,000 Palestinians daily to enter Israel, far less than the numberentering in January. Israel has been replacing Palestinians shut out of Israelwith Romanian and Thai guest workers. A week after the Beit Lid bombing in early February, the Israeli cabinetauthorized the importation of 6,000 foreign workers. Most of the workers posta bond and surrender their passport to their employer to ensure that they willremain on the job during the contract. In early February, several hundred Romanian and Thai workers demonstratednear a construction site in Hod Hasaron. The workers were demanding twomonths' back pay from a construction company that went bankrupt, stopping allwork on the site. The workers complained that the construction company stillhad their passports. Thais are employed primarily in agriculture and construction and remitabout $700 million to Thailand each year. Non-Palestinian guestworkersallegedly accept lower pay and longer hours than other foreign workers. The average per capita GDP in Israel was $12,300 in 1993, versus $1500 inthe West Bank and Gaza and $1200 in Jordan. Israel has a population of 5.4million, the West Bank and Gaza 1.8 million, and Jordan 4.4 million. "Rabin plans to import foreign workers," Sacramento Bee, February 27,1995, A4.

The major countries of origin are Mozambique, wherethe government is barely functioning; Angola, ravaged by civil war; Malawi,emerging from a decades-long dictatorship; and Zimbabwe, where a restructuringof the economy has left many workers jobless. The South African government would like promote economic development in thecountries of origin so that if does not have to deport aliens back to countriesthat sheltered the ANC. Migrant worker movements were halted in January 1995in an effort to curb violence in South Africa. Xenophobia is growing in South African townships that are housing migrants.There are an estimated two to 8 million illegal aliens in South Africa, withmost experts agreeing that the two million figure is most realistic. InJanuary, 1995, the Concerned Alexandra Residents' Association was created, andit has led thousands of people on marches calling for illegal aliens to gohome. The African nation of Malawi is carefully screening foreign workers toensure that they have work permits and do not replace native workers. Thenewly democratic government claims that the previous government gave workpermits to all foreign whites, even though qualified local workers wereavailable. Companies investing in Malawi often want to bring in foreignmanagers. The Malawi government also announced on February 14 that it has given80,000 Mozambican refugees notice that they must return home by May or face acut-off in food and transportation. More than one million Mozambicans havealready been repatriated. The southern districts of Malawi is home toMozambican refugees fleeing a 16-year civil war.

The population of the GulfCooperation Council(GCC) states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United ArabEmirates, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait is expected toincrease from 25 million in 1995 to 39 million in 2010. Foreign workerscomprise 90 percent of the UAE labor force, 83 percent in Qatar, 82 percent inKuwait, 69 percent in Saudi Arabia, and 60 percent in Bahrain. Oman's Sultan Qaboos has criticized Omanis for boycotting jobs in severalsectors because of low wages. He also charged that the private sector prefersto employ low-paid foreigners. He reported that 30,000 Omanis were jobless,even though there are 535,000 foreign workers. Most Gulf states offer government jobs to all citizens, a policy that hasbecome very expensive as oil revenues decline and citizens refuse menial jobs.Foreigners also dominate in technical jobs for which citizens are oftenunqualified. Kuwait has eased its visa regulations for foreigners who want to transferfrom one employer to another. The foreign workers can be charged up to thecost of a round trip airfare to their country of origin, making the cost ofchanging employers higher for Asian than for Arab workers. Under new rules, Kuwaiti employers using foreign workers on governmentcontracts must provide them suitable housing. Kuwait's imported work force makes up more than 55 percent of the country'stotal population of 1.6 million. There are about 180,000 Egyptians in Kuwait,followed by Indians, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans. Over 100,000 foreigners, mostly Asians, who were violating residence lawsin Saudi Arabia have left that country in the past four months. Employers werewarned that if they illegally employed foreign workers they would be subject toa $13 fine and/or three months imprisonment. Workers violating the residencylaws face two years imprisonment and/or a $26,000 fine. In November 1994, theSaudi government allowed those workers without legal residence or work permitsto leave the kingdom without penalty. There are over four million foreign in Saudia Arabia.

In return, China promised not to take any actionsagainst those returned. There are about 700 Chinese refugees who have arrived in Australia by boatover the past year and are being detained in camps. Most are members of aChinese ethnic minority in northern Vietnam who were forced to flee to China inthe late 1970s when a border conflict broke out. On February 9, the Australian Parliament passed a new eliminating China'sone-child policy as grounds for asylum in Australia. Australia also voted todeny refugee status to persons granted asylum in another country. The newpolicy is retroactive to December 30, 1994, and may affect about 700 Chinese,mainly from the city of Behai. Tom Anderson, "China policy no ground for Aussie asylum," UPI, February 6,1995.

Two background points were emphasized. First,all studies are forced to use snapshots to try to construct a motion pictureaccount of immigrants' lives. Second, there are a number of legitimateconceptual issues that are obscured rather than highlighted in manystudies. For example, a snapshot study of the taxes paid by, and the tax-paidservices received by, high school or college students would show that most costmore than they pay. Yet such findings cause little concern, because we assumethat those who complete school will eventually earn more and pay higher taxes. There are dozens of conceptual issues. These include what costs to use.For example, should one include only costs attributable to illegal aliens, oralso costs attributable to their US citizen children who would not be here iftheir parents were not? Should the costs attributed to immigrants, legal orillegal, be the generally minimal marginal costs of providing park ortransportation services to one more person, or the typically higher averagecost calculated by taking the total cost of education or health care anddividing by the number of residents? Most studies of the taxes paid by and the costs of providing services toillegal aliens use as a benchmark a 1992 Los Angeles county study. Los Angelescounty has about nine million residents, including an estimated one millionunauthorized aliens, or one-fourth of the unauthorized aliens in the US.Immigrants at the extremes of the education distribution--with college degreesand without high-school diplomas--continued to move into Los Angeles despite asevere recession that encouraged high-school educated US citizens to leave. Los Angeles began to lose jobs in 1989. Nonfarm wage and salary employmentin Los Angeles county fell by 500,000, from a peak 4.2 million in October 1989to a 3.7 million in October 1994. All studies agree that the taxes paid bygenerally youngish and lower-than-average-earning immigrants go primarily tothe federal government, while the costs of public services used by immigrantsand their families are provided mainly by state and local governments.Furthermore, most studies conclude that illegal immigrants do not generate asmuch in revenues to cover the costs of the public services they consume. The result was a budget squeeze, and a reaction against especially illegalimmigration as exemplified by Prop 187 in November 1994. Rand reviewed the taxes paid and costs of services provided and concludedthat the national studies were not comparable because all included differentamounts of costs and revenues. According to Rand estimates, the amount ofrevenues included ranged from 45 to 75 percent of actual revenues collecteddirectly and indirectly from immigrants, and the percentage of costs includedranged from 40 to 80 percent. Thus, one reason why there is disagreement onwhether all immigrants, or subgroups of immigrants, "pay their way" is thatdifferent studies include different percentages of the universe of possiblecosts and revenues. All studies agree that US-born citizens have more favorable revenue-costratios than recent immigrants, and that legal immigrants have more favorablerevenue-cost ratios than illegal immigrants. These differences are dueprimarily to assumptions about earnings and taxes paid. According to Rand, lack of adequate data on actual service usage and taxpayments by immigrants have led the studies to make potentially erroneousassumptions. For instance, many of the studies assume that illegal immigrantshave a high incidence of payroll deductions and tax payments. But RAND foundthat less than 40 percent of a sample of illegal Salvadorans in Los Angeles hadpayroll taxes deducted from their average $10,000 incomes in the early1990s.

Rand, 1700 Main St, SantaMonica, California, 90407-2138; GAO-HEHS-95-58 Characteristicsof US Farm Workers Gabbard, Susan, Richard Mines, and Beatiz Boccalandro. 1994. MigrantFarmworkers: Pursuing Security in an Unstable Labor Market. Washington DC:US Department of Labor , ASP Research Report 5, May. This report is based on interviews with workers employed on US crop farmsin the early 1990s. Migrant farmworkers are defined as those who moved atleast 75 miles from their usual residences to do farmwork, and 42 percent ofthe sample workers were migrants under this definition. There is no firm estimate of the number of US farmworkers, and there is nouniform definition of migrant farm worker. If there are 2.5 million USfarmworkers, and if the sample covered 1.6 million workers employed oncrop farms, then there would be 670,000 migrant farmworkers on crop farms.Note that if 10 percent of the remaining 900,000 workers were migrants, theoverall migrant percentage would be 30 percent of the US hired farm workforce(90 + 670/2500=30). Most migrant farmworkers are immigrants--85 percent--and another 10 percentare US-born Hispanics. Their mean age was 30, they had an average seven yearsUS farm work experience, they had an average 6.5 years of schooling, and theyaveraged fewer than three US farm employers per year. Migrants averaged 25weeks of farm work annually, and earned about $5.60 hourly. Two major types of migrants are distinguishable in the data: follow thecrop migrants who move from one US farm to another, and shuttle migrants whomove back and forth between Mexican homes and US farm jobs. A few migrantsshuttle into the US and then follow the crops. About one in three migrantworkers follows the crops, five in six shuttle back and forth, and one in sixdo both. Follow the crop migrants were the predominant type of migrants in the1960s, and the notion that migrant workers follow the sun from south to northis the image that still comes to mind when migrants are discussed today.However, only 13 percent of crop workers--an estimated 210,000--and less than10 percent of all farmworkers--had at least two US farm jobs at least 75 milesapart within in one year. There has been a major change in the "base state" or usual residence ofmigrant farmworkers--Mexico has replaced Florida, Texas, and California. Mostmigrant farmworkers shuttle back and forth between homes in Mexico and jobs inthe US, i.e., they maintain homes at least 75 miles from the place where theydo farm work for wages. Most of these shuttle migrants--83 percent--have homesin Mexico, and commute to US farm jobs. One in six migrants live in one USlocation, such as South Texas, and commute to another US location to do farmwork, such as California or Michigan. Migrants prefer to settle in one location. By arraying workers by theiryears of US farm work experience, it appears that men with less than six yearsof US farm work experience shuttle or back and forth without their families,and sometimes follow the crops within the US, but later they shuttle into theUS for farm jobs in one area, and then settle in the US. Since migration, especially follow the crop migration, is associated withyounger immigrant workers who travel without their families, these data callinto question some of the premises upon which the $600 million in federal farmworker assistance programs are based. These programs assume that there aresignificant numbers of migrant farm worker families who follow the crops, andthat their children will be unable to escape the migrant stream withoutassistance. The NAWS data, however, indicate that, when migrant workers gainexperience, they "naturally" tend to settle in one area. DBSBRFPs Invited The Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch (DBSB), Center forPopulation Research, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(NICHD) invites qualified researchers to submit applications for research onimmigration to the United States. For the purposes of this PA, an immigrantrefers to a foreign-born person who enters the United States without U.S.citizenship. The large number of immigrants in the past two decades may havealready had a major impact on the social and economic structure of the UnitedStates. American immigration policies have been shaped by a duality of economic andhumanitarian concerns. Humanitarian concerns are reflected in the preferentialtreatment of refugees as well as the importance of family reunification as a selection criterion for immigrant status.Especially in recent times, public policy and scientific debates aboutimmigration have focused on the estimation methods used to count the numbers ofimmigrants and emigrants, and the effectiveness of public policies in dealingwith the impact of immigrants, particularly their contributions and costs tosociety. The purpose of this Program Announcement is to encourage: 1) development ofmethodological research tools for measurement and analysis of immigration andemigration; 2) descriptive and analytical study of immigrant populations,particularly immigrant children and families; 3) maximum use of existing dataon immigrants or the foreign born for analyses, and the linking of such data toadministrative records on, for example, program and welfare use to obtain amore accurate profile of immigrant experiences; and 4) the collection of newlongitudinal and panel data to examine issues such as the health, socioeconomicstatus, and resilience of immigrants, as well as intergenerational transmissionof skills and resources.

But then came the 50 percent devaluation of theMexican peso, and the number of aliens apprehended jumped in January andFebruary 1995 over 30 percent above year earlier levels, with especially sharpincreases in apprehensions in Arizona. The spring and summer of 1995 will provide a test of how well beefed-up USborder controls can cope with sharp increases in Mexican emigration pressures.The peso has lost about 50 percent of its value since December 20, 1994,widening the US-Mexican wage gap from 8 to 1 to about 12 to 1 (wages in Mexicohave been raised). In addition, up to 10 percent of the 10 million Mexicanswho have formal sector jobs may lose them. There have been several attempts to project Mexico to US migration in 1995.Princeton demographer Tom Espenshade, who puts the annual flow of unauthorizedMexicans in the US sometime during a typical year at 1.5 to 3 million,predicted for the US Treasury, an annual increase of 460,000 illegal bordercrossers including about 40,000 who would settle in the United States. Most US migration researchers agree with Espenshade that unauthorizedMexico-to-US migration is likely to rise in 1995. Both UCSD's Wayne Corneliusand University of Pennsylvania's Doug Massey, for example, report that in theMexican villages from which most migrants come "bags are packed" for the treknorth--stepped up border controls, they argue, are not likely to determigrants. In a January 1995 survey, Cornelius found that 30 percent of the Mexicansquestioned thought that "it was not at all difficult" to find a job as anillegal alien in the US, while 28 percent thought that it was "very difficult."Over 80 percent of the Mexicans interviewed by Cornelius had heard of OperationGatekeeper, and 80 percent thought that it was now more difficult to enter theUS, but over 70 percent of those who had worked in the US in recent years werethinking of migrating to the US in 1995. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner on February 24, 1995 said that some of theundocumented immigrants being apprehended by INS agents have said they crossedthe border because of plant closings or other job losses related to the pesodevaluation. Some Mexican researchers, on the other hand, argue that suddenly poorerMexicans may not be able to finance the trip to the US. Jorge Bustamante,President of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF), a Mexican researchcenter in Ensenada, said the number might actually drop because the cost oftraveling to the United States has increased by about 50 percent. In onereport, the average cost of being smuggled from Tijuana to Los Angeles rosefrom about $300 to $450. COLEF researchers monitoring illegal border crossings from Mexico reportthat, as a result of Operation Gatekeeper, aliens must often make four or fiverather than just one or two entry attempts. However, there is no indicationthat the need to make multiple entry attempts has so far deterred large numbersof illegal entrants. Cornelius emphasizes that so many migrants have left rural Mexico andsettled in the US since 1986 that there is not much "migration potential" leftin many traditional emigration areas. Moreover, settlement in the US has alsoreduced remittances to communities of origin, increasing the migrationpotential of those who remain. There have been three major peso devaluations in the past 15 years, andeach has produced a distinct migration response. In 1982-83, Mexico alsoexperienced a sharp peso devaluation (70 percent), but much of the adjustmenttook the form of lower real wages in urban areas rather than open unemployment.In rural areas, it took 16 months of a cost-price squeeze on farmers to producea significant increase in apprehensions. In 1986-87, the US offered amnesty or legal status to practically any ruralMexican who had some US farm work experience. Because of US legalization, themid-1980s peso devaluation was not associated with increased apprehensions in1987. In 1994-95, by contrast, Nora Lustig of the Brookings Institution notesthat the adjustment seems to be taking the from of open unemployment in urbanareas, as manufacturing and other firms announce bankruptcies and layoffs.Separations from good jobs seem to be concentrated in urban areas, whileemergency programs to alleviate the effects of devaluation seem to beconcentrated in rural areas. The Mexican government plans to temporarilyemploy 500,000 unemployed workers to build rural roads. If more urban-origin migrants head north in 1995, then a new set ofmigration streams may be set in motion, promising more migration in the yearsahead. As the number of apprehensions along the US-Mexican border rose 38 percentto 118,000 in February 1995 in comparison to February 1994, US Border Patrolagents report that violence against them has increased. Seven of the nineUS-Mexican Border Patrol sectors--San Diego and El Centro, California; Yuma andTucson, Arizona; and El Paso, Del Rio, Marfa, Laredo, and McAllen, Texas--sawapprehensions rise (the Border Patrol divides US borders into 21 sectors).These stations had 3,750 agents--or 88 percent of all agents-- in September1994. Agents reportedly have more rocks thrown at them, encounter nails driventhrough boards to stop their vehicles, and often confront larger groups ofaliens being smuggled into the US. Mexico has promised to expand its GrupoBeta, which seeks to eliminate border crimes committed against aliens, but notdeter Mexicans from migrating illegally to the US, and to crack down harder onsmugglers of aliens (coyotes). The US and the Mexican governments have launched a three-part study of themagnitude, impacts, and solutions for unauthorized Mexico-to-US migration. Thestudy was launched in February 1995, with Mexico and the US sharing its costs.The aim is to reach consensus at each phase of the study--numbers,characteristics, push-pull factors, impacts, and policy recommendations--beforeproceeding to the next phase.

Border Control: Revised Strategy Is Showing Some Positive Results(GAO/GGD-95-30, Dec. 29, 1994). ___________________________________________ INS:Naturalization,Greencards and FamilyUnity The number of immigrants electing to become naturalized US citizens jumped75 percent in the first four months of 1995. In FY94, some 558,139applications were filed. In the first quarter of FY95 (October-December 1994),some 234,000 applications for naturalization were filed, almost amillion-a-year pace. The Los Angeles INS district has been receiving 1,500 ormore naturalization applications every day in 1995, double the number in1994--about half of California's naturalization applicants are believed to bein the Los Angeles area. According to the INS, an average 235,000 naturalization petitions werefiled in the late 1980s, and a similar number of aliens became naturalized UScitizens. Petitions and naturalizations rose in the early 1990s: there were342,00 petitions filed in 1992, and 240,000 persons naturalized, and 522,000petitions filed in FY93, when 315,000 persons naturalized. There are several reasons for the upsurge in naturalizations. First, thenumber of aliens eligible for naturalization is peaking, as those legalized in1987-88 become eligible. Second, Congress is debating measures to make non-UScitizens ineligible for many welfare benefits--many commentators asserted thatthe upsurge in naturalization applications represented a backlash againstCongressional Republican attempts to deny benefits to non-citizens. Accordingto the Department of Health and Human Services, some 2.2 million legalimmigrants would lose benefits if the Republican plan is approved. Some assertthat a high percentage of persons naturalized tend to vote in the firstelection after they receive voting rights, which would be 1996 for personsnaturalized in 1995. Third, the INS is requiring the estimated one million aliens who arrivedbefore 1979 to replace by March 20, 1995 their I-551 Alien Identification orgreen cards--between 1946 and 1964, the card was green. The new I-551, whichcosts $75, has a photo, fingerprint and signature--a naturalization applicationcosts $95, only $20 more. There are more than 10 million immigrants in the US eligible to become UScitizens, and the INS has proposed a simplification of the rules under whichaliens can become naturalized US citizens. Under current procedures, an alien 18 or older must be a permanent USresident for at least five years, with no absences of more than a year, andpass an English and civics test. Aliens married to US citizens can becomenaturalized US citizens after three years. Aliens wishing to become naturalized US citizens must complete a four-pageapplication form (N-400), be fingerprinted, and pay a fee of $95; they mustalso be persons "of good moral character, attached to the principles of theConstitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order andhappiness of the United States." They are then scheduled to be interviewed and tested by an INS official fortheir knowledge of English and US government--applicants are asked five to tenof 100 questions on US history and government. Aliens 50 and older with 20years US residence, or 55 and older with 15 years residence, are offered asimplified English test. Most naturalization applicants take about 50 hours of instruction inEnglish and civics in classes organized by schools, churches, unions, andCommunity-Based Organizations (CBOs). CBOs and community colleges are alreadypermitted to certify an alien's knowledge of English. The INS is considering a proposal to let CBOs certify an applicant'sknowledge of civics to reduce backlogs that have lengthened the wait betweenpetitioning for naturalization and the interview-test to six months or more.Some CBOs believe the US government should subsidize their teaching and testingof immigrants. Most Mexican and Canadian immigrants who are eligible to become naturalizedUS citizens do not do so for fear of losing legal and emotional links toMexico. Mexican citizens lose their Mexican citizenship when they become UScitizens, and many Mexican immigrants falsely fear that loss of Mexicancitizenship might threaten their property rights in Mexico. Mexico recentlychanged its citizenship laws to permit Mexican citizens to reclaim Mexicancitizenship if they wish. Some are pushing for both the US and Mexico to adoptdual citizenship. In a settlement of a class-action suit on March 31, 1995, the INS andimmigration rights lawyers established new family unity guidelines inimmigration law. Under the new standards, immigrants living continuously inthe US since May 5, 1988 may return to their home countries for visits withoutfear that their naturalization applications will be denied. The settlement also affects undocumented family members of personslegalized during the 1980s amnesty programs. Under the family unity provision,qualified undocumented immigrants who arrived two years before the cut-off dateof May 5, 1988, can receive renewable work authorization and protection fromdeportation while their naturalization cases are considered. In a related development, a federal judge in California dismissed an INSeffort to close the door on an estimated 300,000 illegal aliens who assert thatthey failed to apply for legalization in 1987-88 because of an INS rule that,to be eligible, illegal aliens had to live in the US CONTINUOUSLY since January1, 1982. The INS rule was later modified to permit "brief, casual, andinnocent" absences from the US but, on January 30, 1995, the INS announced thatit would no longer accept applications from illegal aliens who claim that theywere discouraged from applying for legalization. The lawsuit, now in its ninth year, seeks to force the INS to permiteligible "discouraged aliens" from applying for legalization. Hundreds ofapplications continue to be filed each month in Los Angeles and NewYork. Marcos Breton, "INS alters policy that split immigrant families,"Sacramento Bee, April 1, 1995, A1.

TheCommission on Immigration Reform (CIR) considered many of the sameissues. The CIR is expected to issue recommendationson legal immigration during the summer of 1995. On March 7, 1995, Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyoming) and Rep. Lamar Smith(R-Texas) held a joint press conference to announce plans to introducelegislation that deals with legal and illegal immigration. Simpson, chairmanof the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs,introduced a bill targeting illegal immigration, and a hearing was held on S269 on March 14, 1995. Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration andClaims, has been holding weekly hearings on immigration issues. Smithannounced that he would not support a House Republican plan to make legalimmigrants ineligible for welfare benefits, but that he would support measuresthat would make sponsors of immigrants legally liable for supporting them untilthe alien becomes a US citizen. Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) introduced a reform package on March 21 whichincludes a $1.00 border crossing fee, increases in civil and criminal penaltiesfor forgers and makes document fraud an aggravated felony. The measure wouldalso increase employer sanctions with fines ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 perundocumented worker hired. Current fines range from $250 to $2,000.Feinstein's reform package also includes an employer verification system andadding 2,100 Border Patrol agents. Unlike the Simpson measure, the legislation does not call for reducinglegal immigration. Feinstein has not endorsed Simpson's plan, although the twomeasures are similar. The 41-member House Task Force on Immigration headed by Rep. Elton Gallegly(R-CA) is due to make recommendations to reduce illegal immigration by June1995, so that the House can hold hearings and approve immigration reformlegislation by September. Gallegly asserted that his proposals would make ittougher for illegal aliens to enter and work in the US, but he left open thedoor to an expanded guest worker program to fill "legitimate" laborneeds. The House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on GovernmentManagement, Information and Technology on March 7, 1995 heard about the INSTelephone Verification System (TVS) Pilot system under which 200 employers inindustries likely to employ illegal aliens can call in newly hired workers'A-numbers to verify their right to work. Under TVS, an employer gains instantaccess to the INS database, and can determine whether a newly-hired worker isauthorized to work in the US. The employer punches in a code, the employee'sdate of birth, and his or her A-number, and minutes later receives a reportfrom the INS on whether the A-number is valid, and whether it permitsemployment. In 70 percent of the cases, INS confirmed employment authorization rightaway, and secondary verification took five to ten days. The theory is thatfraudulent documents will lose their value, because the employer will in mostcases learn instantly that the worker is not authorized to work in the US. TheINS system currently works only for aliens, and relies only on INS data. If the worker is not authorized to work, the employer keeps the employee,mails in a secondary verification form, and awaits the results of manualverification. This INS computer verification system is being extended from 9businesses nationwide to 200 Los Angeles area employers in 1995-96, and to1,000 in 1996-97. On February 23, 1995 CIR Chair Barbara Jordan repeated before the HouseJudiciary Committee's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee the CIR'srecommendation that pilot computer employee validation systems that combinedata from Social Security Administration and Immigration and NaturalizationService be tested to enable US employers to determine quickly if ALLnewly-hired workers are authorized to be employed in the United States.According to a Harris poll, 53 percent of Americans in 1994 favor a nationalwork permit system for US citizens and authorized aliens, up from 46 percent in1990. On February 22, 1995, the INS announced that it had detected over5,000 aliens working in entry-level hotel, restaurant, construction, andmanufacturing jobs in Arizona after a 10-month investigation. About 10 percentof the 50,000 I-9 forms at 500 Arizona companies that were checked by the INSwere signed by workers not authorized to hold US jobs. About 500 unauthorizedworkers were deported, and 30 employers were fined $326,120. According to theINS, most employers were not purposely violating the employer sanctionslaw. The CIR also called for better border management--deterring illegalcrossings while facilitating legal ones. Jordan also emphasized that,"Deportation is crucial. Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up inone sentence: those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out,are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required toleave." About 333 million foreigners were admitted at 200 air, land, and sea portswith legal visas in FY94, and 662,000 were denied entry to the US--90 percentof the legal entries were over US land borders. About 93 percent of allnonimmigrants enter with visitor visas for pleasure or business. Procedures for issuing visas vary from country to country, withface-to-face interviews required in countries where fraud is common. Visitorsfrom 22 countries coming to the United States for business or pleasure for upto 90 days may be admitted without visas under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program.Mexicans can receive border crossing cards, which permit them to travel within25 miles of the border for up to 72 hours. Of the estimated 300,000 visa overstayers in 1992, 60,000 were Mexicans,18,000 Italians, 15,000 Filipinos, 13,000 Bahamians, and 9,000 Poles.Lawfully-admitted nonimmigrants comprise approximately 33 percent of aliensfiling asylum applications with INS. According to the British press, there are an estimated 150,000 illegalalien workers from Britain in the US, and more are being apprehended in INSraids on British-themed restaurants. Most presented their US employers withfalse documents. On March 14, House Republican leaders decided to bar legal immigrants onlyfrom five of the 60-some federal assistance programs that would have becomeoff-limits to them under the original welfare reform proposal. Legalimmigrants would be barred from the so-called Big 5 programs--Medicaid ($155billion in federal-state costs per year), Food Stamps ($27 billion), Disabilityaid, AFDC ($23 billion), and Title 20 social service programs--they would notbe barred from employment and training programs. States would also gain morepower to require the sponsors of immigrants to repay the cost of any aid thatthe immigrants receive. Most of the savings anticipated from welfare reform come from barringnon-citizens from welfare programs. For example, if the proposed ban on non-UScitizens receiving AFDC is approved, the CBO estimates that about $2 billionannually would be saved from the $23 billion federal-state AFDC program.During the summer of 1993, about four million mothers were receiving AFDCpayments for 10 million children. There were about 4.2 million foreign-bornmothers, and nine percent or 400,000 of them were receiving AFDC payments,about the same as the 11 percent rate for US-born mothers.

There are about four million births annually, and twomillion deaths, so that natural increase adds about two million Americans peryear. Net international migration adds another 770,000 residents per year,according to Census estimates. About 43 percent of the immigrants areHispanic, 30 percent are Asian, and 10 percent are Black. The largest five states included 36 percent of all residents. California,with 31 million people (12 percent), Texas and, New York, 18 million each(seven percent each), Florida, 14 million (five percent), and Pennsylvania, 12million (almost five percent). According to the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, California's employmentgrew by almost two percent in 1994 to 12.2 million nonfarm employees, up fromthe 1993 low of 12 million. California's population, which had been growing byalmost three percent per year in 1989-90, is now growing by only one percentper year--in 1994, net immigration to California is projected to be zero, thefirst time in recent memory that as many people left the state asentered. Even though California's economy is turning up, 57 percent of Californiansin a March 1995 poll believed that the state was on the "wrong track." Amajority of those polled thought that California's economy would get better intwo or three years, but one-third are not confident that they will have theircurrent jobs in six months. Data on job attachment between 1973 and 1993 indicate that a stable 20percent of American workers aged 45 to 54 have worked for the same company formore than 20 years, and half of them have worked for the same employer for 10or more years. This apparent stability of job attachment seems to fly in theface of stories of corporate cutbacks at companies such as IBM and Kodak thatused to offer "lifetime employment." It may be that job attachment isdeclining fastest among the less-educated men whose real earnings are alsodeclining, fueling the "angry white men" syndrome to which some attributeRepublican political victories. Moving company records for 1994 indicate that almost twice as many familieswere moved out of California as were moved in, 95,500 out, and 54,300 in.However, California continues to receive enough immigrants so that, even iftwice as many residents leave California for Texas, Washington, Arizona, andColorado, the state's population grows as immigrants replace departingCalifornians, and immigrants and resident Californians have babies.

Demographer Jeff Passel notes that ESTIMATES of number of illegal aliens inthe US have fallen while the actual NUMBER increased. For example, estimatesof six to 12 million illegal aliens were common in the late 1970s, even thoughit was later estimated that about 2.1 illegal aliens were included in the 1980Census. In 1985, Passel estimated that there were three to five million illegalaliens. Some two million were legalized in 1987-88, or about two-thirds of theillegal aliens in the US since 1982, and the number of illegal aliens wasestimated at 2.2 million in 1988. However, the number then began to increase,reaching an estimated 3.4 million in October 1992, and 4 million at the end of1994. Between October 1986 and 1988, there was an especially sharp drop in thenumber and share of Mexican illegal aliens because so many Mexicans werelegalized. Mexicans dropped from about 58 percent to 38 percent of the totalpopulation of illegal aliens in the US, and in California the estimated illegalalien population fell from 2.9 million to 800,000. There are two broad strategies to combat illegal immigration. What mightbe called the "island" model is the policy of the UK and Australia, which havestrict entry controls, but neither residence permits nor employer sanctions.The so-called "continental" strategy puts the primary emphasis on internalcontrols, usually with residence and employment permits. The US has traditionally relied on a continental strategy, relyingprimarily on the Border Patrol to deter illegal entry, but an analysis by INSstatistician Bob Warren of data on aliens who entered the US legally, and thenstayed too long and became illegal aliens, suggests that most of the 3.4million illegal aliens who were believed to be living in the US in October 1992entered the US legally. These data suggest that the US may be pushed to movetoward both island and continental strategies, beefing up both border controlsand internal controls. The number of illegal aliens was increasing by about300,000 per year between 1988 and 1992. The INS in August 1994 adopted a strategic plan that shifts the focus fromapprehending aliens to preventing the entry of illegal aliens. Some inCongress are pressing the INS to adopt the El Paso Hold-the-Line strategy offlooding the border with agents to deter illegal entries in California.According to some estimates, 8,000 to 9,000 agents concentrated on the 165miles of border through which most illegals enter could dramatically reduceillegal immigration. The INS counters that Hold the Line is not appropriate inSan Diego, where an estimated 99 percent of the illegal alien entrants arepassing en route to an interior location such as Los Angeles, versus 35 percentin El Paso. According to the INS, the San Diego strategy of using three lines of agentsto apprehend all illegal entrants IS working. Aliens apprehended report thatthe price of being smuggled to Los Angeles has jumped 50 percent, from $300 to$450, and the GAO agreed with the INS in testimony on March 10 that smugglersare attempting to bring aliens into the US in other areas, especiallyArizona. In FY 93, the San Diego and El Paso Border Patrol sectors accounted fortwo-thirds of the 1.2 million southwest border apprehensions. In FY92, overhalf of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600border miles--13 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico,and five miles along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Inresponse to the INS's new border control strategies, in FY94, the San Diego andEl Paso's share of total southwest border apprehensions dropped from two-thirdsin fiscal year 1993 to about one-half in fiscal year 1994. The Border Patrol reopened in March the checkpoint on Interstate 5, 66miles north of the US-Mexican border, to determine how many illegal aliens weregetting into the US despite Operation Gatekeeper.

Several CIR commissioners arguedthat more rather than fewer immigrants should be selected on the basis of USemployer needs, but DOL argued that, if the US continues to admit large numbersof foreign scientists and engineers, 20 years from now even more will be neededbecause the US will have given up on ways to interest young people in thesecareers. Also on February 23, the CIR heard George Borjas, a professor at theUniversity of California, San Diego, argue that 20 percent of the wage gapbetween less-skilled and more skilled workers in the United States is due tothe presence of the most recent wave of immigrants, legal and illegal, who havefewer skills than previous generations of immigrants. Vernon Briggs of CornellUniversity argued that the labor market is being buffeted by changes such asdefense cutbacks, echo baby boomers entering the labor market, and more womenworking for wages, and that, immigration today is "far too high for labormarket needs." Harriet Orcutt Duleep of the Urban Institute argued that only illegalimmigrants and refugees have low levels of education, although her analysisexcluded all Mexican immigrants because it was hard to separate legal andillegal Mexican immigrants in the data used. Markley Roberts of the AFL-CIOargued that DOL should do an even better job of laborcertification--determining that American workers were truly not availablebefore allowing US employers to hire foreign workers. DOL finds that employersare often employing the same foreign workers illegally that they are requestingDOL to certify that they need. Representatives of US engineers and computer programmers argued that the USis permitting the entry of foreigners to fill jobs even though there are largenumbers of unemployed American engineers and programmers. US employers, theyargued, use temporary foreign workers because they are cheaper and easier torecruit. It was noted that entry-level engineering salaries have fallen threepercent between 1974 and 1994, from $35,700 to $34,700 in 1994 dollars. Thereal wages of more experienced engineers fell even more. An engineer with aMaster's degree and 25 years experience made $78,600 in 1974 (in 1994 dollars),and $71, 400 in 1994. In a critical review of DOL labor certification procedures, a Boston firmattempting to hire a British alien who did not have a BA degree, and thus didqualify for a professional employment visa, reportedly spent $10,000 and sixmonths before securing a temporary visa for the British worker. As the storymakes clear, US employers think that the tough part is finding the idealforeign candidate for a vacant job; US labor certification procedures, theyfeel, are simply a bureaucratic obstacle to getting the foreign worker theyfeel is needed. A US employer who wants to bring into the US temporary foreign workers mustfile two applications for alien labor certification with the Department ofLabor. The first, labeled an ETA-750A, specifies the terms and salary of theparticular job; the second, called an ETA-750B and filled out by the would-berecruit, lists the applicant's qualifications. The local Employment Service(ES) office where the employer files the application then does a prevailingwage survey to ensure that the employer is offering the going wage. After the ES approves the wage offer, the employer is required to do threekinds of recruiting: The employer has to place an ad for the job with theemployment department for 30 days, within its own offices for 10 days, and inan "appropriate publication" for no less than three consecutive days. When UScitizens and legal immigrants respond to the ads, the employer is required toprovide the employment department with "lawful, job-related reasons" for notchoosing them. Janitors are the largest single occupation in the US in which a majority ofthe workers are probably immigrants, and the 10-year Justice for Janitorscampaign of the Service Employees International Union is moving from citiessuch as Los Angeles, New York, San Jose, and San Francisco, where a majority ofthe janitors are SEIO members, to smaller cities such as Sacramento. Non-unionjanitors typically earn about $5 per hour and have few benefits; unionizedjanitors earn $7 to $8 and have benefits such as health insurance and pensions.Justice for Janitors typically targets corporations with household names thathire their janitors through contractors. The US Information Agency modified on February 14, 1995 regulations underwhich 10,000 European au pairs enter the US each year. USIA had proposedrequiring that the weekly stipend be raised from $100 to $155, but reduced thestipend to $115. USIA dropped the proposed requirement that au pairs be atleast 21 to care for children under two, and the proposed requirement that theybe limited to nine hours of work daily (the limit is 45 hours weekly). The aupair program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 1995. _________________________________________ StateActivities to Deter IllegalImmigration Prop. 187 in California may have marked a new era in state and localgovernment activism to reduce illegal immigration. Virginia is estimating thenumber and cost of illegal immigrants in order to seek federal reimbursement,and Maryland has held hearings on whether English should be the official statelanguage. In Florida, the Orlando-based group Save Our State is planning to put aninitiative on the November 1996 ballot to withhold publicly-funded servicesfrom unauthorized aliens. It needs 50,000 signatures to have the proposedconstitutional amendment reviewed by the Florida Supreme Court, and 430,000signatures to put the measure on the ballot. In California, a federal judge on March 13 scheduled a trial for September6, 1995 on the constitutionality of Proposition 187. The State of Californiahad sought to have the constitutionality of Proposition 187 determined first inCalifornia state courts. A bill has been introduced in Congress to requirethree rather than one federal judge to agree to issue an injunction to blockthe implementation of a voter-approved initiative. According to a Los Angeles Times poll that included non-voters and non-UScitizens, most Californians think that the passage of Prop. 187 was a goodthing. Most want Prop. 187 to be implemented immediately; 52 percent want Prop.187 implemented immediately, while 38 percent do not. Only Latinos--by 54percent to 35 percent--do not want Prop. 187 implemented immediately. By 53 percent to 40 percent, those questioned thought that passage of Prop.187 was a "good thing." Only nine percent of those questioned thought thatthere had been a major increase in discrimination since the passage of Prop.187. Yale law professor Peter Schuck reviews the likelihood that the courts willeventually uphold 187, and notes that there is ample precedent for the USSupreme Court to uphold or to strike down the proposition. Schuck believesthat it would be wrong to uphold 187, largely because the optimal level ofillegal immigration is not zero--it costs too much to completely stopimmigration--and so the illegal aliens who inevitably arrive should receivepublic education and emergency health care. Schuck also believes that it would be foolish to make ineligible forwelfare benefits legal immigrants in the US, since, he asserts, Congress candiscriminate against legal immigrants in welfare programs, but the statescannot without Congressional approval, so that a federal ban may wind up simplyincreasing state and local costs. There are currently four bills before Congress that would declare Englishto be the official national language. Under English-only rules, bilingualballots are banned, government documents are printed only in English, andgovernment workers must speak English at work. Three of the four bills wouldalso abolish Bilingual programs in the US Education Department. California Governor Pete Wilson announced that he would "explore" seekingthe Republican presidential nomination, and signaled that two of his themeswould be opposition to illegal immigration and affirmative action. However,President Clinton responded that "some" who supported Prop. 187 in 1994 toreduce illegal immigration had laid the ground work for illegal immigration in1984-85, when Congress approved an "easy" farm worker legalization program thatpermitted over half of the mostly young Mexican men who became legal USimmigrants to gain that status fraudulently. If illegal immigration becomes a major issue in the 1996 campaign, the1983-86 campaign by western growers for a "free agent" guest worker program islikely to be scrutinized closely. The kingpin was Rep. Coehlo (D-CA) whoarranged to have former Rep. Panetta, currently Clinton's chief of staff, carrya bill that would have permitted Mexican workers to enter the US and "float"from farm to farm as needed. After the House approved such a program in 1994,then Senator Wilson persuaded the Senate to approve a similar program in 1985. Unions, churches, and ethnic organizations strongly opposed thesenon-immigrant programs, setting the stage for the last-minute compromise in1986--a legalization program for all unauthorized workers who had a minimalattachment to US agriculture.

Farm workers are one of only three US occupations with one million or moreworkers in which the majority of workers are immigrants--the other two aremaids and janitors. There are two to three million farm workers, includingabout 800,000 persons who work for wages sometime during each year onCalifornia farms. About half of these California farm workers might beconsidered dependent on farm work for most of their earnings--a typicalCalifornia farm worker earns about $5 hourly for about 1,000 hours of work, for$5,000 in annual farm earnings. For over 100 years, most California farm workers have been persons whocould not obtain any other jobs in California, usually because they lackedEnglish, skills, and contacts. In 1965, Cesar Chavez organized a strike byCalifornia grape harvesters to protest grower refusal to pay mostly localworkers the same wages that they were required to pay to non-immigrant Mexicanworkers and, since the Bracero program ended in 1964, Chavez's United FarmWorkers was able in 1966 to win a 40 percent wage increase. In 1975, California became the first major agricultural state to enact alaw that granted farm workers the right to organize into unions, and requiredemployers to bargain with the union representative elected by workers. Duringthe next 20 years, there were about 1,200 elections involving 100,000workers--the same worker could vote in several elections--but one-third ofthese elections were held in the last five months of 1975. Immigration marked the rise and fall of the UFW. In 1980, the UFW askedfor another 40 percent increase. After a bitter strike that saw growers turnto labor contractors who organized crews of often illegal workers to be strikebreakers, the UFW won an Pyretic victory--many companies that agreed to UFWdemands went out of business. UFW membership fell from a peak of perhaps60,000 in the late 1970s to as few as 5,000 in the early 1990s. The UFW resumed efforts to organize farm workers after Cesar Chavez died in1993, and in December 1994, the UFW won an election to represent the 1,400workers employed by Bear Creek, better known as Jackson-Perkins, the rosecompany. On March 17, the UFW negotiated a three- year contract that increaseswages and benefits 22 percent over the life of the contract, sets a $5.82hourly starting wage, and offers nine paid holidays, including Chavez's March31 birthday. On the eve of the ALRA's 20th anniversary of the ALRA, the state'sLegislative Analyst proposed eliminating the ALRB as an independent agency, andcombining it with the agency that regulates labor relations for publicemployees. The ALRB currently has only two of its authorized five members, andin 1993-94 its 50 employees certified the results of nine elections and issued31 Unfair labor Practice complaints. The UFW protested the inclusion of theALRB into the PERB, arguing that it is currently in negotiations with 32 farmsthat employ 13,000 farm workers. California was battered by storms in January and March 1995--rainfall wasalmost twice normal levels--and the rain washed away at least temporarily thejobs of many immigrant farm workers, especially in Salinas-- the nation's"Salad Bowl" about one hour south of San Francisco. The Monterey Countyagriculture commissioner, for example, estimated that instead of the usual40,000 farm workers employed in March in the area, 30,000 acres of floodedbroccoli, cauliflower, and lettuce left only a few thousand employed.Statewide, losses were estimated at $500 to $600 million, or 2 to 3 percent ofusual annual farm sales of $20 billion. However, there should be about the same number of hours worked inCalifornia agriculture in 1995, because farmers will replant vegetables such aslettuce, and there will be significant clean up work in the state's orchardsand vineyards. For example, only 600 of the state's 23,000 acres ofstrawberries were washed away--less than 3 percent of the acreage. There is some question about whether residents of small cities hard hit byflooding -- Pajaro, Watsonville, and Castroville--will advise friends andrelatives in Mexico to stay there, especially in light of stepped up borderenforcement. However, with workers in rural Mexico hearing of $5 to $6 hourlywages in California, versus less than $1 per day in Mexico, many maynonetheless be tempted to migrate. There will be no water shortages to constrain planting in Californiaagriculture in 1995. However, the demand for hired farm workers has beenincreasing, as farmers shift from low-value and mechanically harvested cropssuch to high-value fruits and vegetables that require more labor. The Legal Services Corporation, which funds legal services for migrant farmworkers, is threatened once again with budget cuts. The 1994-95 budget of $415million for 320 organizations and 4000 lawyers has been slated for eliminationover 5 years, according to one plan of the House Republican leaders.

Nothing suggeststhe influx of migrants to either country will soon cease. Population growth in both countries is fueled by immigration. In the USabout one-third of population growth is due to immigration; in Germany, 100percent of the population growth is due to immigration. About eight percent ofthe 260 million US population are foreign-born, and almost nine percent ofGermany's 81 million residents are foreigners. Some foreign-born residents inthe US are naturalized US citizens, and about one-sixth of Germany's foreignerswere born in Germany (persons born in the US are automatically US citizens;persons born in Germany acquire the nationality of their parents). Successive German governments have taken the position that "Germany is nota country of immigration." This is not to be understood as a descriptivestatement, but as a declaration of policy: it means that Germany does notinvite settlement by foreigners. The population of resident foreigners isnonetheless growing, primarily as the result of a continuing influx of asylumseekers, family unification, and births to foreigners living in Germany. Can Germany and the US, despite differences in immigration history andpolicy, learn from each other? A March 28, 1995 conference in Washington DC onimmigration and asylum challenges and choices in Germany and the US, sponsoredby the UC Comparative Immigration and Integration Policy program, the AmericanInstitute for Contemporary German Studies, and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung,heard German experts review recent developments, and Americans draw comparisonswith recent US developments. Germany and the US offer an interesting comparison. Germany proclaims thatit does not wish to become a country of immigration, but provides a relativelygenerous set of services to legal foreigners. The US, by contrast, basks inits immigrant heritage, but provides relatively few public services to help tointegrate newcomers. Managing migration is a tough but not impossible challenge facingindustrial societies, and international comparisons will continue to befruitful. As numbers rise and force action, leaders must be willing toconfront the trade-offs inherent in deciding how to manage immigration andintegration. Immigration. The two parts of Germany have been affecteddifferently by migration. The former West Germany added 13 million netimmigrants between 1950 and 1993, while the former East Germany lost fivemillion residents because emigration exceeded immigration. The former WestGermany included in 1993 about four in five Germans, and virtually all of theseven million foreigners in Germany live in the former West Germany. Germany is unlikely to remain a country in which foreigners arrive andremain foreigners. If a net 400,000 immigrants continued to arrive annually,Germany would in 2030 have a population of about 90 million, of whom 30 percentwould be foreigners. Major cities such as Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Munich,which are now about one-quarter foreigners, would have populations that werehalf or more foreign. Since one in six foreigners in Germany today was born in Germany--1.2million of seven million--and half have lived in Germany for 10 or more years,the status quo of foreigners remaining foreigners is not likely to continue. Asylum. Most of the foreigners arriving in Germany over the pastfive years seeking to settle have arrived as asylum seekers. In Germany andall of the industrial democracies, the majority of asylum applications arerejected, so that separating genuine and false asylum applicants is a majorobjective of all asylum systems. When the number of asylum seekers surges, as it did in 1992 in Germany toabout 438,000, the cost of housing, feeding, and deciding asylum cases--some DM6 to 8 billion or $4 to $5 billion--can equal contributions for developmentassistance (Germany provided $7 billion ODA in 1993). In 1992-93, there were numerous attacks on foreigners in Germany at a timewhen over 1,000 foreigners daily were applying for asylum. Germany addedresources to speed up the processing of asylum cases, to streamline the systemfor determining whether a foreigner was being persecuted for political reasonsin his country of citizenship, and to return to neighboring "safe countries"asylum seekers who passed through Poland and the Czech Republic en route toGermany. Most observers consider the asylum reform a success. The number of asylumapplicants fell by three-fourths, reducing the state and local costs of housingand feeding asylum applicants. Romanians and Bulgarians learned that it wasnot worthwhile attempting to get to Germany and apply for asylum. There doesnot appear to be an offsetting increase in illegal immigration from countriesthat were sending asylum seekers. In the early 1990s, the US too faced a huge backlog of asylumapplications--over 400,000 in 1995, representing over 700,000 individuals. InJanuary 1995, the US streamlined its system and added more staff to speed upasylum processing. In the US today, an applicant applies to one of what willsoon be 327 asylum officers (Germany has 900), and that asylum officer eithergrants asylum or refers the case to an immigration judge--a non-INS employee.Second, asylum applicants must now wait at least 180 days to work legally inthe US. Both Germany and the US have invented in-between categories for aliens whoare not eligible for asylum, but who nonetheless are not deported. The US andGerman acronyms--TPS, DED, "tolerated"--reflect the expectation that thesealiens will eventually depart. Mass asylum in industrial democracies is a 1980s-1990s phenomenon that hasbeen confronted with more staff to decide cases quickly, and by restrictingaccess to the system. How is the asylum system likely to evolve? Some believethat the concept of safe haven will replace resettlement. Under some notions,ALL persons requesting asylum would be offered safe haven, perhaps onextra-territorial islands. Then, as budgets permit, individual cases would beheard, and those deemed in need of resettlement would be granted the right tobegin life anew. Foreign Workers. Germany recruited guest workers between 1961 and1973, when their number peaked at 2.6 million, making one in eight workers aforeigner. Over the next 15 years, these foreign workers united their familiesin Germany, and second and third generation-foreigners joined their parents inthe German work force. Immigration in the 1990s. Germany responded to rising migrationpressures from the east after 1989 with five distinct foreign worker programsthat involve some 350,000 foreigners, and add the equivalent of about 150,000full-time workers to the German work force. However, unlike 1960s guest workerprograms, 1990s foreign worker programs have a different purpose--to cope withmicro rather than macro labor shortages, and to make inevitable migrationlegal. German foreign worker programs today also have different incentives forthe workers involved; the emphasis is on ensuring return to their countries oforigin. The most important program involves project-tied workers. Under thisprogram, German firms sub-contract with foreign firms, and the foreign firmsupplies the expertise and workers to complete a particular phase of a project.There were an average 40,000 project-tied foreign workers in Germany in 1994,down from 60,000 in 1992 because of scandals that involved German contractorsusing project-tied agreements as backdoor guest worker programs. Most newly-arrived foreign workers are employed seasonally in Germany. Apeak 150,000 seasonal foreign workers in 1994 contributed the equivalent of40,000 FTE to the German labor force. Seasonal foreign workers can remain 90days in Germany, and most are employed in agriculture, restaurants, orconstruction. If the workers are employed less than two months, the workersand their employers do not have to pay social security taxes on theirwages. The third program is for border commuters from the Czech Republic andPoland. If local workers are not available in Germany within 50 km of theseeastern borders, then employers can request permission from the GermanEmployment Service to employ commuter workers at prevailing wages who canremain in Germany for up to two nights weekly. The fourth program permits about 6,000 young East Europeans to work andlearn in Germany for up to 18 months, although evaluations indicate thatCzechs, Poles, and other East Europeans learn few skills in Germany that theyuse at home. Finally, about 1,000 nurses from the former Yugoslavia areallowed to work in Germany. In both the US and Germany, there has been a shift in the rationale fortemporary foreign worker programs. Instead of recruiting foreign workers todeal with macro or widespread labor shortages, most programs today arejustified as a way to deal with a micro labor shortage, or to channel intolegal programs inevitable and otherwise illegal migrants. However, most of the industrial democracies have heeded the advice of theOECD and deregulated their labor markets, and most today play less of ajob-matching role in labor markets. The German ES matches about 35 percent ofall job seekers and jobs, the US ES three to four percent--giving governmentsless credibility when considering employer requests for foreign workers.

There have been Muslims in France since the beginningof the 20th century, but it was only in 1967 that their number topped onemillion. France on January 1, 1994 had 58 million residents. The French populationhas been increasing by about 400,000 annually, due to 300,000 more births thandeaths, and 100,000 immigrants. Half of all French immigrants, and 40 percentof the asylum seekers, are from Africa. In the past, France had an assimilationist attitude towardimmigration--immigrants were expected to learn French and to conform to Frenchvalues in public. Muslims have begun to challenge assimilation just as France,like other industrial countries, is debating the best way to integrate minorityimmigrants. In Fall 1994, the French government officially banned girls who wear"ostentatious" headscarves from attending public schools. Some Islamicassociations immediately attacked the headscarf ban as a symbol of Frenchintolerance for minorities; 22 percent of the Muslims polled in October 1994thought that Muslim girls should be allowed to wear headscarves to school.One-third of the Muslims polled agreed that integration into French societymeans that an individual becomes less Muslim. Muslim girls in France face special challenges. At home, boys are favored,but in school, Muslim girls reportedly do better than Muslim boys because theyare treated more equally than at home. Many Muslim families reportedly arrangemarriages for their daughters at age 18 and, if the girl objects, she sometimesmust make a break from her family. Other girls go to the other extreme,becoming fundamentalist to gain power within their families. On March 21, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights issuedits annual report on human rights in France. The report expressed alarm overthe continued spread of intolerance toward foreigners, especially toward thoseof North African origin. The Commission reiterated its criticisms of a seriesof laws passed in 1993 tightening controls on immigration and restrictingaccess to the French nationality. One of the laws passed in 1993 tightened the regulations on marriagesbetween immigrants and French citizens. Immigrants married for more than oneyear to a French citizen, or who are parents of a child born in France,generally cannot be deported. Previously, the government granted long-termresidence cards to such immigrants. Under the 1993 law, the government rarelygrants work, study or residence permits. The two-year-old law, according to a government spokesperson, wasdesigned to stop marriages of convenience. Mayors have the power to reviewmarriage applications and refuse those they think are for convenience. Anorganization called Lune de Miel says that the law has left many partners inhonest marriages between an immigrant and French citizen without access tosocial services and employment. French authorities are continuing to stop dark-skinned men to check theirdocumentation. The random checks began in fall 1994 after five French citizenswere slain in Algeria. French authorities worry that the violence plaguingAlgeria will move to France. After the hijacking of an Air France plane fromAlgiers, French citizens backed the crackdown. "The zero generation" is a term coined to describe the French born-childrenof immigrants parents, who have no opportunities due to a stagnant Frencheconomy. They are frequently turning to fundamentalism. In Algeria, a civil war between Islamic fundamentalists and the militarygovernment threatened to add to the 800,000 Algerians and three million Frenchcitizens of Algerian origin in France. Algeria, which has 28 million people and a per capita GDP of $1800, wonits independence from France in 1962. A new 1989 constitution permittedpolitical parties to contest elections but, when it appeared thatfundamentalists would win the general election, the government annulledthe election, with the support of the French government. Since then, there has been fighting between Islamic militants andgovernment troops, and 300 to 600 militants headed to Algiers were reportedlykilled by government troops in an ambush near the end of March.

Proponents of the legislation argue thatHeathrow Airport has become a magnet for asylum seekers. The proposed reformsseek to ally the concerns expressed by Euro-skeptic MPs that "EU laws woulddismantle Britain's [immigration] controls." The immigration bill being prepared by Home Secretary Michael Howardresponds to critics who assert that current controls fail to combat illegalimmigration and that European integration will worsen the problem of "backdoor"immigration. If enacted, Britain would introduce sanctions on employers ofillegal immigrants, removing the right to oral hearings for those asylumseekers whose claims are without foundation, increasing the countries to whichvisa restrictions apply, and publishing a list of safe third countries to whichrejected asylum seekers could be sent. Additionally, a reduction in benefits payable to asylum seekers is part ofthe proposed reform to combat illegal immigration. Last year, 50,000 asylumseekers waiting for their applications to be processed received Social Securitybenefits. The impetus for the proposed benefits reductions stems from the growth inthe backlog of applications awaiting decision, from 5,060 in 1985 to 55,000last year. Allegations that 80 percent of the asylum applications are bogusfurther fuels the drive for reform. Proponents argue that cutting benefitswill send an important message to bogus asylum claimants. Under the proposal to fine employers of illegal immigrants, employers wouldhave to check national insurance numbers - or social security ID cards - beforeemploying someone. The British Department of Employment reports that 864,000 foreigners wereemployed legally in Britain in spring 1994, and they were three percent of theoverall labor force. Of the two million foreigners in the country, 44 percentwere employed. Foreign workers in Britain are grouped at the ends of the skillspectrum--they tend to be more or less skilled the labor force as a whole. Theprofessionals, managers, and technical workers are often in Britain because ofcorporate transfers. The lower skilled foreigners are more likely than Britons to work inlabor-intensive industries, such as hotels, restaurants, distribution andrepairs. The Irish Republic has been a traditional source of immigrantlabor--over 200,000 Irish workers are employed in Britain, as well as 15,000Germans. Britain is the only country that conducts DNA tests to see if a child beingbrought into the country for family reunification is indeed the claimant'schild. The tests are most frequently used for those coming from South Asia andAfrica. Applicants have the right to refuse the test. Last year the British High Commission in Islamabad carried out 833 genetictests on Pakistanis trying to send children and other relatives to Britain. Inan effort to keep track of the complicated strands of Muslim family life, whereone man may have several wives, British embassy officials in maintain about280,000 files on Pakistani families with British ties going back to the 1950s.Each applicant is asked to draw up a family tree, which is incomputerized.

These countries have established the Schengen Information Systemin Strasbourg, simplified extradition arrangements, and agreed on a list ofcountries from which visas will be required to enter any Schengen membercountry. Britain threatened to veto any attempt to mandate the extension ofthe Schengen agreement to all EU states. The traveling public noticed little change because most of the land bordersshared by the seven countries had been reduced or eliminated since customschecks ended on January 1, 1993 with the launching of the single Europeanmarket. The main impact of the Schengen changes will be felt at airports, whichwill make a distinction between passengers arriving from within the Schengenarea and those flying in from outside. Hence, flights between Munich and Pariswill be able treated domestic trips, and passengers will be able to travelwithout their passports. On March 26, 1995, 30 Ghanaians who were being deported walked unchallengedthrough the barriers at Amsterdam's Schipol airport. Another 80 were stoppedby immigration officials. The Ghanaians were given "smart cards, "on a flightfrom Brussels to Amsterdam, where they were to catch a connecting flight toAfrica. The Belgian police thought the Ghanaians would be held in the transitarea, as happened in the past. There are believed to be 3.5 to 5.5 million illegal aliens among the EU's372 million residents, meaning that 1 to 1.5 percent of the EU population areunauthorized foreigners. The French in October 1994 established a 6,200 memberpolice force to reduce the number of illegal immigrants. Germany tightened border security along the eastern frontier to preventillegal immigration. But, the feared hordes of Poles flooding Germany failed tomaterialize. Germany launched a crackdown--putting up traffic checkpoints--on itswestern frontier with France, Belgium, and the Netherlands on January 1, 1995that resulted in the apprehension of 900 illegal aliens in two months. Manywere Albanians who had paid $1,300 to $2,000 to be taken by ferry to Italy,then to France, and finally to Germany. A report noting that despite EU promotion of the four freedoms--the freedomof movement of goods, capital, services, and labor-- less than two percent ofthe EU nationals live in another EU nation, prompted one reporter to assertthat abolishing US border controls would solve the immigration control problemand "would produce no new tidal wave of the poor into Texas, Arizona andCalifornia." The major basis of this conclusion is that most people do not move.According to some Europeans, ''The real [immigration] controls are complicatedthings like cultural traditions and language, not the physical barriers betweencountries.'' From 1987 to 1991, approximately 1.5 million people moved from onemember-state to another. Much of the movement has been the north-southmovement of retirees--for example, 29,000 Spaniards have moved to the UK, while86,000 Britons have moved to Spain. With a projected 75 million retirees bythe year 2000, some predict more north to south migration. Denmark was the wealthiest EU nation in 1991--its per capita GDP of $23,660was four times Portugal's $5,620.

TheGreek government denied that the shooting occurred. There had been hope that relations between the two countries were improvingafter Greece's foreign minister visited Albania. The mid-March visit wasdesigned to repair relations after Greece expelled 70,000 Albanians in 1994 inretaliation for Albania sentencing several ethnic Greeks to death for spying.There are about 400,000 ethnic Greeks among Albania's three million people. Greece and Albania agreed to establish a program under which Albanians canwork seasonally in Greece. They also agreed to consider opening a Greek bankbranch in Tirana to facilitate the transfer of remittances from Albanianworkers in Greece. Albania is the poorest country in Europe. According to the government,unemployment is 30 percent, although some Albanians claim it is 80 percent.There is running water only three times per day and the electricity supply issporadic. According to a poll by a Tirana professor, 82 percent of Albanians wouldleave the country if they could, and only Germany has agreed to accept a fewhundred Albanian emigrants. Malaysia is the only country to allow Albanians toenter without a visa. On March 26, police dispersed 1,200 youth in Tirana who had assembledoutside the US Embassy after a newspaper falsely reported that the US wasoffering work visas. A similar incident occurred three days earlier. On the streets of the Albanian capital of Tirana, counterfeit passportssell for about $US 5,000. A visa to Italy is about $US 1,500. Familiespurchase the documents with their life savings --the average income in Albaniais less than $US 400 per year. If they cannot afford false documents,Albanians go to Vlora to catch a $US 500 to $US 1,000 three-hour boat ride toItaly, where taxis wait to take them to the train station. Italian border police report that 11,000 ethnic Albanians from the Kosovoprovince in Serbia have vanished after arriving legally in the country. Borderpolice speculate that they moved on to France and Germany. Citizens of formerYugoslavia, including Kosovo Albanians, do not need visas to enterItaly.

Turkey is a country of 60 million that has been knocking on Europe's doorsince 1987, when Turkey formally applied to join the EU. Turkey's applicationwas rebuffed in 1989, but on March 6, 1995, Turkey and the EU signed a customsunion that will free up trade beginning in 1996. If the agreement is approved by the EU Parliament, Turkey would receiveabout $900 million in aid over several years. However, members of the EUParliament have threatened to withhold approval of the agreement because ofTurkey's treatment of its Kurdish minority. There are also fears that fundamentalists could come to power in Turkey, orthat a fundamentalist-secular split could plunge the country into civil war.The conflicts within Turkey are already mirrored in disputes among the twomillion Turks in Germany. There are about two million Turks in Germany, including about 400,000Kurds, 400,000 to 600,000 Alawites, and 1 million ethnic Turks. Germanyestimates that about 35,000 of the Turks in the country are fundamentalists,extremists, or PKK militants. Germany has several times suspended the deportation of Kurds because ofTurkey's alleged violations of Kurdish human rights, but at the same time, theGerman government has sold weapons to the Turkish government. On March 20,Turkey sent 35,000 troops across the Iraqi border in an effort to wipe outKurdish bases there. In March there was a wave of firebombings of Turkish mosques, travelagencies and cultural centers. Unlike previous violence of Germans attackingforeigners, these firebombings are the result of the divisions between Turks.German authorities believe that most of the attacks are led by the separatistKurdish Workers Party (PKK). Some Turks believe that there is tacit Germansolidarity with the Kurds, and that the German authorities were not doingenough to protect Turks from Kurds in Germany. In Germany, the attacks on Turks are reportedly convincing more Germansthat the Turks will not be easily integrated into German society. On March15, the German government decided to resume the deportation of illegal Kurdishimmigrants and rejected asylum seekers, after a Parliamentary committee heard17 witnesses testify that Turkey generally does protect the rights of Kurds andall other Turkish residents. Even though 11 of Germany's 16 foreigners'commissioners asked that the moratorium on deportations be extended, theForeign Ministry and the Turkish government argued that even Turks accused ofcriminal conduct in Turkey who are returned have their legal rightsprotected. Deportations are the responsibility of the state governments, and the 11SPD-ruled states announced that they would continue to not to expelKurds. Violence against Turks appears to be moving to Switzerland followingfirebombings aimed at several Turkish travel agencies in several northern Swisstowns. In Basle, Kurdish protesters fought with police after a Kurdishcultural center was closed. In Zurich, Turkish Moslem Alawites and Turkish andKurdish communists staged separate demonstrations to protest police violence inIstanbul and Ankara, and the Turkish army's drive against Kurdish separatists.Similar marches were held in German, Austrian and French cities on March 18.

The Philippinesis among the world's top labor exporting countries, with an estimated 2 to 3.5million Filipinos working in some 140 nations as construction workers,domestic helpers, entertainers, crew members on ships, hotel employees,teachers and office clerks. In 1994, Filipino overseas workers sent home some $2.4 billion throughformal channels, up from 1993 remittances of $2.2 billion. The economic impactof these remittances in the Philippines is believed to be over $8 billionannually, or one-sixth of the Philippines $52 billion GDP. On March 17, 1995, Singapore hanged a 42 year-old Filipina maid for killingin 1991 another maid and a child. Her case became a cause celebre in thePhilippines after two other Filipinos argued that she was framed. Philippine President Ramos asked that the execution be postponed and, whenit was not, the Singaporean Prime Minister was forced to postpone a scheduledtrip to Manila. There are about 75,000 Filipinos working in Singapore, most asmaids, and on March 26, 1995, there were massive demonstrations throughout thePhilippines to protest harsh treatment of Filipinos in Singapore. As publicresentment swelled, President Ramos recalled the Philippine ambassador andbanned Filipinas from going to work in Singapore. The maid's March 26, 1995 funeral march turned into a massive demonstrationagainst Singapore for executing the maid, and against the Filipino governmentfor failing to protect Filipino workers abroad. Some reports compared theemotional outpouring for the executed maid to the 1986 revolt that led to theend of the Marcos government. Philippine President Ramos ordered the evacuation of Filipina maids whowanted to leave Singapore and sent military aircraft on March 29 to fly home 83Filipina maids. Most of the maids who signed up for the flight home claimedthey were mistreated by their Singaporean employers or were homesick. Severaldays later, Ramos extended the invitation to return home at government expenseto overseas workers in other countries. The hanging of the Filipina maid in Singapore has reopened a debate overhow to protect Filipino migrant workers abroad. Every year, reportedly"hundreds" of Filipino migrant workers return in coffins, usually as a resultof workplace accidents, but also for violating other countries' laws. The Middle East and Singapore are among the places most frequently cited asabusing Filipino workers. The Philippines has been pushing for aU.N.-sponsored global conference on labor migration. The Philippines sponsoreda resolution in the United Nations seeking more protections for migrantworkers. Most Asian labor-importing nations object to more migrant workerprotections. A high level Thai official called for an agreement on the free movement oflabor after the hanging of the Filipina maid. Such an agreement would giveASEAN member countries a framework upon which to base uniform rules for theprotection of workers' rights. The issue is expected to be raised at aninformal meeting of ASEAN economic ministers in April 1995. In 1994, the Philippine government required Singaporean recruitmentagencies to post a $4,000 bond for every 50 domestic helpers they recruited inthe Philippines. Manila says the bond will be put in escrow and used to helpmaids who have been abused in Singapore. The Department of Labor and Employment has also started an accreditationscheme for foreign employers. DOLE reports that domestic helpers in Japan canearn $ 1,200 a month compared to $200 monthly in Saudi Arabia. Following pressure after the hanging of the Filipina maid in Singapore,President Ramos appealed for clemency for a Filipino worker sentenced to diefor murder in the United Arab Emirates. The Philippine leader has also orderedfull legal assistance to another Filipina domestic being tried in the UAE formurdering her employer, who had allegedly raped her. Filipina maids in Hong Kong are worried that as the colony prepares to beturned over to China, they will lose their jobs. Chinese government officialshave given no official response to the question of whether Filipina maids willbe able to be employed in Hong Kong after 1997. There are about 100,000Filipina maids in Hong Kong, earning an $US 485 per month. The average percapita income in the Philippines was $770 yearly in 1992.

However, its attempts to use foreign traineesto curb labor shortages in Korea and provide the training needed to acceleratedevelopment in labor-surplus countries got off to a rough start. In January 1995, Nepalese factory trainees held a nine-day sit-in atSeoul's Myongdong Cathedral, complaining that the trainee program begun in1993, and administered by the Korea Federation of Small Business, was really aslave labor program. In January 1995, trainees were 19,000 of the 33,600foreigners legally working in Korea. Most were from China, the Philippines,and India and Pakistan. A survey by of 185 workers at an industrial complex in Seoul indicate that42 percent were beaten. Beginning in 1996, Korea plans to admit legal foreign workers--nottrainees--who will have contracts and be guaranteed the same wages as Koreanworkers. Korea hopes to control illegal alien workers, who number about50,000, by 1999. The government will increase the number of foreignindustrial and trainee-workers to fill the gap in the industrial work forcethat results from the deportation of illegal workers. The policy is based on the belief that the only way to fundamentallyresolve the controversial issue of illegal foreign workers would be toeliminate foreign workers who overstay their visits and to improve the foreigntrainee system. However, small industries depend heavily on illegal foreignworkers who overstay their visits, and the labor ministry plans to reduce theirnumber by deporting about 10,000 a year through 1999. Immigration data indicate that overstaying foreign workers totaled 49,800as of the end of January, 1995. They include 19,800 Korean-Chinese, 7,500Filipinos, 5,000 Bangladeshis, 2,300 Pakistanis and 2,000 Nepalese. A total of4,422 illegal foreign workers were deported in 1994, 894 of them forcibly and3,528 voluntarily after they received exit orders. Two Korean government agencies disagree on the employment and management offoreign workers. The Ministry of Labor is trying pass special laws to employand manage foreign workers, but the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy isopposed to any law, saying it will impose a burden on smaller companies. The Labor ministry has announced that, despite protests, it will introducea minimum wage system for foreign trainees in Korea. However, a minimum wagemight encourage some employers to reduce their outlays for lodging and boardingof foreign workers. The technical trainees earn about US$20 per month. Many prefer to workillegally, since they can earn US$450 per month. Bruce Cheesman, "Plight of Foreign Workers an Issue Ready to Explode,"Australian Financial Review, March 21, 1995.

Emigration from the US is estimated to beabout 200,000 of the estimated 850,000 immigrants arriving annually in theearly 1990s, suggesting that emigration is about 25 percent ofimmigration. An OCAC survey on ROC nationals who have migrated to the United Statesshows that 27 percent have done so for business reasons, 21 percent have gonefor the sake of their children's education, and another 10 percent said theymigrated to continue their own advanced studies. Only 14 percent said theyemigrated due to the low quality of life in Taiwan, and 9 percent said theychose to emigrate because of the poor social security situation in Taiwan. Another 8 percent said their motive for emigrating was their fear of acommunist Chinese invasion, 7 percent said they were wary of the unstablepolitical situation, and 5 percent said they wanted to live with other familymembers in the United States. The report says that the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, andSouth Africa are the top five countries of destination for Taiwanese emigrants.Data from the five countries show that 21,166 ROC citizens emigrated to thosecountries in 1990; 19,988 in 1991; 21,580 in 1992, and 22,081 in 1993. The emigration rates of Taiwanese to the five countries are related tothose countries' immigration policies. Stricter immigration policies adoptedby the US, Canada, and Australia are expected to slow the number of immigrantsfrom Taiwan, while the relatively more relaxed immigration rules of New Zealandwill prompt more Taiwan people to seek residency there. In addition, theInterior Ministry is planning to establish an emigration agency. Many of the returning Asian professionals studied in the US, and wereoffered jobs upon graduation by US employers. With prospects for using theirtraining at home in modern labs dim, many stayed in the US. In the 1990s,however, US aerospace, financial, and other industries sharply reducedemployment, while such industries boomed in Asia. Most of the Asians are returning in what Taiwan calls rencai huiliu--returnflow of human talent--accept pay cuts of 30 to 40 percent in exchange for beingcloser to aging parents and relatives and what they see as better prospects forupward mobility. In a bid to attract more professionals and investment capital from HongKong and Macao, Taiwan has relaxed its immigration rules. Investmentrequirements have been lowered from $US 384,000 to $US 192,307; investors mustremain in Taiwan for 21 out of 24 months. The new rules must be approved bythe Cabinet.

Half are in HongKong and the rest are scattered throughout Southeast Asia. As countries such as the Philippines begin to force the remainingVietnamese to return home, scenes such as that near Manila--where Filipinopolice had to prevent Vietnamese from committing suicide as they were beingmoved to an island in preparation for their return to Vietnam--are likely tobecome more common. British officials are skeptical that Vietnam can meet thetimetable to prepare for the return in 12 months of the 22,000 boat people inHong Kong. Most of the Vietnamese in the Filipino camps left Vietnam in boats in thepast eight years to take advantage of a US program that offered US citizenshipto Amerasian children of American soldiers. The Vietnamese were in a programallowing them to emigrate to the US after cultural training and English at thecamp. US officials concluded that virtually all of the documentation of theremaining Vietnamese in the Philippines is false, so they were denied entryinto the US. The UN closed the camp in which they live on December 31,1994. The US has offered to pay repatriation costs for the 272 boat people buthas encountered difficulties negotiating with the Vietnamese government. TheUNHCR has requested that countries donate $74 million for the repatriation ofthe Vietnamese. A World Bank report says that 51 percent of the Vietnamese population livesin poverty. The Vietnamese economy is growing at eight percent per year, andthe World Bank estimates that poverty will have fallen by 29 percent by2000. The Vietnamese community in Australia had begun a campaign to persuade theAustralian government to assist boat people in overseas refugee camps. Thecampaign has been sparked by fears in the international Vietnamese communitythat genuine refugees will be forcibly returned to Vietnam and face persecutionor death.

Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark laid out a "very concrete" argument touse with "ordinary people" to justify aid to emigration countries: "if youdon't help the Third World...then you will have these poor people in oursociety." Since "Europe has now lived through a period where thousands andthousands and thousands of refugees are coming from various parts of theworld...ordinary people now recognize ...the global situation." The challenge is daunting. About 20 percent of the world's population isvery poor, 70 percent of the poor are women, and poor nations owe $1.4 trillionin debt. Industrial nations urged poor nations to follow market-orientedeconomic polices and to extirpate corruption and guarantee basic human rights.Poor countries countered that their debts should be canceled, and that aidshould come without strings. The Group of 77--130 developing nations--asked industrial country donors toadopt a 20-20 formula--20 percent of their aid would be earmarked for basichuman needs such as schools and hospitals, and recipient countries would alsocommit 20 percent of their government expenditures to basic human needs. Ifimplemented, industrial countries would have to triple their spending on basichuman needs, and poor countries double their spending. According to economists, the gap between the richest 20 percent and thepoorest 20 percent of the world's population has doubled since the 1960s. Manyof the 1,050 citizen groups that ran a parallel conference criticized the UNparley as filled with rhetoric but few concrete plans.

Theexpulsions were a reprisal for a raid by Colombian guerrillas that killed eightVenezuelan marines. The Colombian government demanded that Venezuela compensate the Colombianfarmers who were deported. The Venezuelan government rejected the demands andreinforced the border area. The government said it plans to deport another2,500 Colombians in the near future. Colombia and Venezuela share a 1,378 mile border that has been the frequentsite of border skirmishes between the two countries. An estimated 1.5 millionundocumented Colombian immigrants are in Venezuela. Colombian guerrillas haveattacked Venezuelan military installations about 50 times, killing 30Venezuelan soldiers. During the last half of 1994, about 3,600 cars stolenfrom Venezuelans were taken to Colombia. Virtually all of the three tons ofcocaine confiscated in Venezuela last year came from Colombia. Venezuela is now demanding the right of "hot pursuit" to chase Colombianguerrillas across the border. A Colombian public opinion poll conducted theweek of March 5 found that 96 percent of the respondents oppose allowingVenezuelan soldiers to enter Colombia.

An additional amendment to preventChinese boat people from claiming refugee status in Australia on the grounds oftheir country's one-child policy is expected to be included in the package. The proposed law has sparked bitter criticism from Australia's Asiancommunities, human rights groups, and the Catholic Church, and prompted thecountry's longest-serving politician to threaten to resign if it ispassed. The bill was introduced by Immigration Minister Nick Bolkus to counter thethreatened flood of boat people. He explained that the bill was needed to"ensure that unauthorized arrivals are not able to abuse the system." These reforms come three years after Minister Gerry Hand introduced theMigration Reform Act of 1992. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairsannual report for 1993-94 found that its refugee decision-making process wasworking effectively. The opposition indicated that it will support the amended bill if itensured that people who had "direct" fears of persecution under the one-childpolicy would be allowed to apply for asylum. Targeting the Sino-Vietnamese as potential abusers of the refugee system issurprising, considering their unusually high recognition as refugees. UNHCRcommented that such restrictive measures may prevent genuine refugees fromaccess to asylum. Following the arrival of 106 asylum seekers from China, the Australiangovernment is bracing for another possible influx if illegal boat people. TheAustralian facilities are currently full and any more arrivals will be housedat a air force base in the western part of the country. Australia has signed a memorandum of understanding with China under whichthe Australian government has agreed to pay for the transport of boat peopleback to China -- if they do not succeed in their attempts to gain asylum -- andsome of their repatriation costs. Under one proposal, asylum would be refusedif an applicant already had the protection of another country. In mid-March, Australia announced that foreigners who deposit $550,000 ingovernment securities for at least three years can become legal immigrants.About 2,100 of the 76,000 slots available to immigrants in 1995 have beenreserved for such investors, and 15,000 immigrants have come to Australia undersuch investor programs since 1981.

Compared to year earlier levels,apprehensions along the US-Mexican border were up 10 percent in January, 38percent in February, and 40 percent in March 1995. There has also been a 38percent increase in people trying to enter through ports of entry using falsedocuments and false claims of US citizenship. Apprehensions totaled 512,000 in the first six months of FY95, up 15 percentover FY94. About one million illegal aliens were apprehended in FY94,including 65 percent in San Diego and El Paso, and another 15 percent in theTucson and south Texas areas. The Border Patrol plans to add almost 3,000agents over the next three years, so that it has 7,000 agents in 1998. Mexico acknowledged that 750,000 of its 26 million workers lost their jobs inJanuary-February 1995, almost double earlier predictions of layoffs in theaftermath of the peso devaluation. Another 400,0000 to 600,000 workers areexpected to be laid off in 1995. President Zedillo, in an April 5 speech, acknowledged rising illegal emigrationpressures, and promised Mexican action against "those who, in violation ofMexican laws and human dignity, traffic in human beings." Zedillo also blastedProp. 187. The US added Mexico and other Latin American countries whose immigrants maytravel to the US via Mexico to Operation Distant Shores. Distant Shores wasbegun to deal with the threat of mass immigration developed in 1994 for theCuban and Haitian immigration emergencies. Under Distant Shores, abandoned US military bases are used to hold illegalimmigrants temporarily. While they await processing and extradition, the Armyprovides logistical support, such as transportation, food and medical aid. Inthe event of a presidential declaration of an immigration emergency, theFederal Emergency Management Agency is directed to coordinate the activities ofvarious federal agencies, including the INS and the military. On April 6, the INS released its six month evaluation of Operation Gatekeeper,the strategy begun October 1, 1994 that arrayed three lines of agents along theUS-Mexican border south of San Diego in an effort to prevent illegal aliensfrom eluding apprehension. Each of the 170,000 aliens apprehended betweenOctober 1, 1994 and March 31, 1995 was fingerprinted and photographed, enablingthe INS to determine that about 20 percent of those apprehended were beingcaught for the second time. These recidivism data also show clearly that the INS has succeeded in pushingaliens to the east; aliens who were caught in the westernmost section of theborder are being apprehended on their second and third entry attempts five to10 miles further east. Apprehensions in the westernmost section fell 50percent since October 1994 and, according to the INS, "entries" fell by 40percent. Border-area residents report fewer trespassers and stolen autos, but residentsfurther east are complaining that aliens attempting illegal entry there areleading to litter and auto theft there. House Republicans led by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) are demanding that the INSput enough agents on the San Diego border to create an El-Paso like "humanblockade" on the border. Hunter is also demanding more fencing and ditches. Activists in San Diego allege that fingerprinting and photographing apprehendedaliens makes them fearful to report instances of agent abuse against them.Some activists allege that up to 30 percent of those apprehended are abused atthe hands of the Border Patrol. Human Rights Watch-Americas advocated in April the creation of an independentcommission to receive and investigate allegations against Border Patrol agents.A Citizens Advisory Panel met for the first time on April 12, 1995 to considerways to deal with and reduce complaints about INS agents. An average 220complaints against INS agents each year have been referred to the JusticeDepartment's civil rights division--the INS notes that there is about onecomplaint per 17,000 apprehensions. In Los Angeles, the Mexican Consul on April 11, 1995, held a press conferenceto express alarm at what he termed a criminal justice system biased againstLatinos. Los Angeles police and sheriffs responded that each case of allegedanti-Latino bias must be considered individually. It will not be clear until the summer of 1995 whether Operation Gatekeeper andsimilar efforts to use more and redeployed Border Patrol agents have succeededin reducing illegal immigration. Reports from Mexico suggest that Mexicans areaware that Gatekeeper has made it more difficult and expensive to enter the US,but "going north" has become such an integral part of life in especially ruralMexico that few potential migrants are deterred. On the US's 5,500 mile northern border with Canada, about eight percent of theUS Border Patrol's 4,000 agents apprehended about 13,000 illegal aliens in1994, or one percent of the total. Most were Canadians, but there are reportsthat, increasingly, smugglers are attempting to use the "northern route" tosmuggle e.g., Chinese into the US. The INS unexpectedly extended the March 20, 1995 deadline for replacing "greencards" issued before 1979 for another year.

On March 30, several Senate Republicanstemporarily stalled a vote on that would have permitted the US to send thesecond $5 billion of the $20 billion in loans that the US promised to Mexico. On March 9, Mexico announced new austerity measures that went into effect onApril 1, 1995. The peso climbed against the dollar, ending April at 5.9 pesosto $1, and the Mexican stock market rose 65 percent since early March. If the exchange rate averages 6 pesos to $1 in 1995, there would have been a 42percent devaluation. The Mexican economic crisis resulted from the country's reliance on short-termforeign debt to finance far more imports than exports. When investors thoughtthat they would be repaid in devalued pesos, they dumped peso-bonds, causingthe devaluation as Mexico ran out of money to support the peso in December. Each time that the international rescue package appears to run into trouble,the peso dives: in the two weeks between the announcement of the internationalrescue package and the announcement of Mexico's new economic plan, the pesoreached new lows--at one point falling to 7.7 pesos to $1.00 on March 9. Thepeso ended March at 6.8 to $1.00. One dollar bought 3.45 pesos until December20, 1994. Mexican-US relationships are asymmetric. The US imports goods from manycountries and exports goods around the world, but three-fourths of Mexico'sexports and imports are to and from the US. However, the Mexican economy issmall in comparison to the US economy--equivalent in economic output to LosAngeles county. Among US states, Texas is most dependent on Mexico--about three percent of itseconomy is dependent on trade with Mexico, versus less than one percent inCalifornia. On April 24, the Mexican group El Barzon (Plowshares) blockedbridges between Texas and Mexico for several days to protest Mexico's austeritypolicies. El Barzon, which claims 700,000 members, all of whom are debtors,wants a four-year moratorium on the repayment of bank debt. The peso devaluation has weakened all three NAFTA currencies, leading toexpectations that Canadian, Mexican, and US exports to the rest of the worldwill rise in 1995. For the first time, the new Mexican economic policy has not been endorsed bybusiness and labor, ending the era of tripartite pacts to divide the pain ofeconomic policy changes. The government estimated that the economy wouldshrink by two percent in 1995, and that inflation would top 42 percent. Mexico's minimum wage rose 12 percent on April 1 to 18.30 pesos per day($2.70). For the first time, Mexico will publish money supply and otherfinancial data, so that outsiders can better predict the likely future courseof the economy. According to a mid-February poll, 81 percent of Mexicans believe that Mexicopaid too high a price for the US rescue of the peso. Over 60 percent reportedthat the peso devaluation had a negative impacts on their standard ofliving--savers have lost about half of the dollar value of their savings--and80 percent thought the Mexican economy was in bad shape. Crimes such asrobbery have reportedly risen sharply. Many Mexicans believe that the conditions attached to the US loan infringe onMexican sovereignty. Under the terms of US assistance to Mexico, the $7 to $8billion that Mexico earns from oil exports annually must pass through theFederal Reserve Bank of New York; Mexico will get these oil export earningsonly if it is repaying the US loan. A major beneficiary of the peso devaluation have been the foreigners who ownmaquiladoras, the 2,300 assembly operations employing 650,000 workers andgenerating about $7 billion in foreign sales that are strung out along theUS-Mexican border. These factories import practically all of their inputs, addvalue by e.g., assembling TVs, and then export the finished products, usuallyto the US. The peso devaluation reduced maquiladora labor costs about 40percent in dollar terms (the 50 percent devaluation was followed by a 10 to 15percent wage increase). Maquiladora workers, mostly young women, have protested the reduced value oftheir wages--13,000 maquiladora workers went on strike in Juarez in the firstthree months of 1995. Some maquiladoras have offered subsidies to theirworkers to compensate for the peso's decline. Mattel, which employs 2,000workers in a Tijuana toy factory, has begun to offer free breakfasts forworkers whose wages are in pesos, but whose expenditures are dollar-linked inthis border city. Average maquiladora wages and benefits that were worth about $2.40 per hour inDecember are now worth the equivalent of $1.40 per hour. The governmentallowed wages to rise 12 percent on April 1, 1995, but some maquiladoraemployers reportedly fear that, if they do not grant bonuses and wageincreases, Mexican workers will be tempted to migrate illegally to the US.There are about 725 plants with 100,000 workers in California south of SanDiego. Mexican government actions have also, in the opinion of some, remindedforeigners of the "old Mexico," in which rules change suddenly. On March 31,the Mexican government imposed a 1.8 percent tax on the value of maquiladorareal estate and machinery, increasing the tax bills of many maquiladoras byfive times. In Washington, the US Secretary of Labor sent a letter to his Mexicancounterpart requesting talks on Sony violating Mexican workers' right toorganize at a plant in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The first two labor complaintswere dismissed. In March, Zedillo announced a program that will create 550,000 jobs in ruralcommunities. Earlier, the agriculture minister announced a farm aid package tofreeze fertilizer prices, continue subsidies and price guarantees for basicgrains, and expand credit. Farmers of small plots have been among those hardest hit during the recession.Experts predict that 1 million Mexicans--farmers and their families--will leavethe land over the next 10 years. With bank loans for farm equipment andchemicals inaccessible because of 100 percent interest rates, some farmers arereportedly allowing land to lie fallow. The major purpose of the US-led bailout of Mexico was to restore foreignersconfidence in the economy, and thereby maintain the inflow of foreigninvestment and persuade foreigners who own Mexican bonds to reinvest in Mexicoas their bonds mature. However, continued economic and political uncertaintyled many foreign investors to turn the pesos they received from maturing bondsinto dollars; most are reportedly refusing to reinvest despite the loanguarantees. Many US economists predicted that Mexico would run a trade surplusin 1995, but mostly because it imports fewer American goods, not because it hasbecome an export machine. Mexican export sales increased 16 percent in 1994, and the government hopesthat they will jump 27 percent in 1995. In February 1995, Mexico recorded analmost $500 million trade surplus, the largest trade surplus since April 1988.The US trade deficit widened to a record $12 billion in January 1995, largelybecause of the sharp drop in exports to Mexico and Latin America. The lower peso especially helps the industrial giants based in Monterrey, whosecosts are in pesos, but whose export revenues are in dollars. Companies suchas CEMEX and Vitro represent about one-seventh of the Mexican economy. Someforeign-owned firms are accepting short-term losses on their Mexican productionin the hope that the economy will soon rebound. Smaller firms that have not established export markets may find it difficult tobreak into the export market quickly. Lulled by affluence at home anddiscouraged by an overvalued peso, many did not seek export markets in theearly 1990s. Those that did are now stuck with very high interest rates to payfor imported machinery. The Mexican government projects that it will receive $8 billion in foreigndirect investments in 1995, which would indicate a quick restoration ofconfidence in the Mexican economy. The Mexican stock market reportedlyreceived a net $630 million in February, 1995, versus a net outflow of $3.3billion in January. According to many US experts, the peso devaluation has undone the value ofNAFTA to Mexico. The rush of foreign investment to Mexico--equivalent to eightpercent of Mexican GDP in 1993--permitted Mexico's real exchange rate to risesharply relative to the US dollar--the real exchange rate is the peso/dollarrate adjusted for the difference in inflation rates. Many in the US Congress continue to oppose US assistance for Mexico. In boththe Senate and the House, there were moves in early April to stop sendingMexico some of the US loan money promised unless the US government suppliesdetailed information on its discussions with Mexico. The Administration failedto meet a March 15 deadline to supply requested information to the House. UCSD's Wayne Cornelius notes that the ruling PRI kept most of the party'sresources in Mexico City, so that it is relatively weak in the states andcities where opposition parties are strongest. When threatened at the locallevel, the PRI traditionally pumps huge sums of money into local elections--anestimated $80 per vote in 1992 in Michoacan--and resorts to fraud to stay inpower.

About half of all naturalization applications are currently being filed in LosAngeles and San Francisco--over 1,500 each day in February. After petitioningfor naturalization, an applicant must typically wait one year for an in-personinterview with the INS. Over the next three years, the INS expects more than 2.5 million people topetition to become US citizens. The INS would like to farm out some functions,such as certification of English, civic and history proficiency, then spend afew minutes per applicant for the official interview. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner requested $30 million from Congress to keep upwith naturalization applications; the INS received $500,000. There were 555,407 applications for naturalization in FY94, an estimated760,000 in FY95, and perhaps 800,000 in FY96. Applications for naturalizationwere pouring into INS offices at the rate of over 50,000 per month early in1995. There are an estimated 10 million immigrants eligible for UScitizenship. The number of applications for green cards is also increasing, in part becauseof an October 1994 change in the treatment of intending immigrants who arealready in the US. Under the old law, aliens had to return to their country of origin to beinterviewed to determine whether they should be allowed to immigrate to the US.Today, they can remain in the US to be interviewed by paying a $600 fine, whichis cheaper than a return trip for many aliens. Over 15,000 aliens monthlyapplied for green cards under the new rules in FY95. Jim Specht, "As Concern over Illegals Grow, More Immigrants Seek Citizenship,"Gannett News Service, April 21, 1995.

However, in January1995, the Hispanic unemployment rate equaled the Black rate of 10.2 percent forthe first time since Hispanic labor force data became available in themid-1970s. There are about 12 million Hispanic and 14 million Black workers in theUS labor force of 132 million. Some Hispanic leaders argue that the jump inthe Hispanic unemployment rate reflects increased discrimination againstHispanics unleashed by IRCA in 1986 and Prop. 187 in 1994. Others point to thevery low educational levels of many recent Hispanic immigrants, and to thesevere recession in California --one-third of US Hispanics live in California,which has a higher than average unemployment rate of 6.7 percent. On April 5, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims heardthat immigration hurts US minorities, but there was little agreement amongthose who testified on how much. Three witnesses argued that the depressingimpact of immigrants on US workers was substantial, especially in areas such asLos Angeles where immigrants concentrate--the population of Los Angeles is 38percent foreign-born. Vernon Briggs of Cornell University emphasized that especially unauthorizedimmigrants are willing to work "hard and scared," so that Americans cannotcompete with them. Frank L. Morris, a professor at Morgan State University,argued that Blacks suffer disproportionately the effects of illegal immigrationbecause they lag behind the rest of the population in education and skills.Norman Matloff of the University of California at Davis argued that newimmigrants compete with earlier arrivals. Joseph G. Altonji of Northwestern University argued that between 1980 and 1990,when immigration added six to eight percent to the US population, the wages ofless skilled natives fell by about two percent. Lindsay Lowell of the US Department of Labor testified that, in the early1980s, there were very small effects of illegal immigrants on US wages andemployment. This conclusion was based on estimates of the number of illegalaliens in most major US cities in 1980. According to most estimates, 10percent more illegal immigrants in a city's labor market reduced the averageearnings of Black and Mexican-American workers by two to five percent--meaningthat adding 10,000 more illegal workers in a city with 100,000 such workersmight reduce hourly earnings by $0.25, or from $5 to $4.75. The April issue of Reason magazine includes an article in praise of illegalimmigrants that asserts that that nearly a third of all the nation's full-timefarm workers are unauthorized--full-time is not defined, and one-third isprobably high, since most unauthorized workers are employed seasonally, usuallydefined as three to nine months. According to the Reason article, higher wages in the US and free trade mightresult in some labor-intensive commodities being mechanized or imported. Thisnormally free trade magazine considers such an event undesirable. It is often argued that, without immigrants, a particular industry or regionaleconomy would grind to a halt. While it is true that it is very hard topredict exactly how particular industries and economies would adjust to fewerworkers and higher wages, economics is built on the notion that changing priceseliminate shortages, including labor shortages. In the late 1980s, American hospitals increased the share of nurses who wereRNs, hiring in some years 30,000 RNs per year. Today, of the 1.5 millionnursing staff in the US hospitals, about one million are registered nurses, and200,000 are LPNs. However, in response to cost cutting in the health care industry, the number ofaides has increased sharply. Hospitals stopped using RNs for tasks such asbathing patients and taking temperatures.

Although initial reports that Middle Eastern terrorists wereresponsible proved to be wrong, lawmakers still want to toughen up existinglegislation. The proposals under consideration include: establishing special courts to speedup the deportation of suspected terrorists, denying entry to anyone affiliatedwith a terrorist group, and giving the FBI and other federal investigatorswider surveillance and wiretapping powers. Many of these provisions weredrafted after the World Trade Center bombing, but Congress and the Clintonadministration have been slow to act on them. Current law does not deny entry to members of foreign terrorist organizations,unless they have committed a terrorist act. Suspected terrorists sometimesenter the US and request political asylum, which allows them to remain in theUS while their request is being considered. Tom Diemer, "Senate Vows Quick Action Against Terrorism, Bombing," The PlainDealer, April 25, 1995. Michael Ross, "Terror in Oklahoma City," Los AngelesTimes, April 21, 1995. _________________________________________ WelfareReform, SSI, and the AmericanPoor The House appropriated $1 billion more for the INS in 1996, as requested byClinton, but said that the additional funds should deter at least 300,000illegal entries, suggesting that the House Appropriations subcommittee waswilling to pay $3,300 per deterred alien. The House also approved a welfare reform bill that would ban most legalimmigrants who are not-US citizens and younger than 75 from many means-testedprograms. One goal of the ban is to reduce the cost of Supplemental SecurityIncome or SSI, a federal program that provides $2 billion annually to about440,000 legal immigrants, or one-fourth of the elderly immigrants in the US.About 10 percent of elderly US citizens receive SSI. SSI provides in most states almost $300 per month for persons 65 and older whohave incomes of less than $450 and liquid assets of less than about $2,000.The argument for making elderly immigrants ineligible for SSI arises from thefact that many elderly immigrants receiving SSI live with often-affluentchildren who sponsored their entry by promising that, if their parents werepermitted to immigrate, they would not become a public charge. However, 1990COP data suggest that 20 percent of the elderly immigrants receiving SSI livein households with incomes of $50,000 or more, higher than the $37,000 medianhousehold income for US families with the same five persons in 1989. Until 1994, elderly immigrants could apply for SSI three years after theirarrival; in that year, the wait was lengthened to five years. Most of theelderly Mexican immigrants collecting SSI are Mexicans, two-thirds of theLaotians 65 and older collect SSI. Resentment has been fueled by the factthat, e.g., almost half of the elderly Korean immigrants collect SSI, eventhough Koreans are among the highest-income groups in the US. In the Senate, there were indications that the House-approved ban on most legalaliens obtaining most forms of public assistance such as Food Stamps, AFDC, andMedicaid would be dropped. Legal aliens who work in the US pay taxes just asUS citizens do, and there were objections raised to rewarding those who chooseto become US citizens with access to welfare. Abuses, some argue, could becleared up by requiring US residents who sponsor their relatives to reimbursethe government if, after arrival, the aliens need assistance. The exclusion oflegal aliens from welfare saves about $4 billion per year. Welfare reform will, in any event, give the states greater flexibility todecide who is eligible for benefits. The Congressional fight is over groupsthat will be denied benefits even if states were willing to make them eligible.For example, the welfare reform approved by the House would prohibit statesfrom paying benefits to mothers under 18 who seek benefits for their children,and require states to end cash assistance after five years. New restrictions on welfare should enlarge the pool of US workers available forunskilled jobs. Some studies show that there is intense competition forlow-wage jobs, even if they are part-time, and offer lower real wages than in1979--the real wages of male high school dropouts have declined 23 percentsince 1979 to $21,600, while the real wages of persons with at least four yearsof college have increased five percent to $50,300. Traditionally, many women get off welfare through marriage, but declining malewages have made that option more difficult. A woman working 30 hours weekly or120 monthly earns about $900 per month, without health benefits, and oftenincurs child care costs of at least $200 per month, and $100 fortransportation, leaving $600 for all other expenses. The IRS estimated that at least 160,000 illegal aliens collected $200 millionin Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) by filing tax forms that claim the refundin 1994. There is no current provision in the Internal Revenue Code thatprohibits illegal aliens from receiving the Earned Income Credit even thoughthey are ineligible to work in the United States. In Los Angeles county, where 23 percent of all residents were foreign-born in1990, an examination of 4,000 AFDC cases in 1993 found that 44 percent of therecipients were immigrants, including 17 percent who were illegal immigrants.Refugees got the highest amount--$7,900-- because they had almost four personsper family on AFDC, while illegal immigrants with US citizen babies got theleast per family--$4,900--but the most per capita.

There are two to three million farm workers, includingabout 800,000 persons who work for wages sometime during each year onCalifornia farms. About half of these California farm workers might beconsidered dependent on farm work for most of their earnings--a typicalCalifornia farm worker earns about $5 hourly for about 1,000 hours of work, for$5,000 in annual farm earnings. For over 100 years, most California farm workers have been persons who couldnot obtain any other jobs in California, usually because they lacked English,skills, and contacts. In 1965, Cesar Chavez organized a strike by Californiagrape harvesters to protest grower refusal to pay mostly local workers the samewages that they were required to pay to non-immigrant Mexican workers. Sincethe Bracero program ended in 1964, Chavez's United Farm Workers was able in1966 to win a 40 percent wage increase. In 1975, California became the first major agricultural state to enact a lawthat granted farm workers the right to organize into unions, and requiredemployers to bargain with the union representative elected by workers. Duringthe next 20 years, there were about 1,200 elections involving 100,000workers--the same worker could vote in several elections--but one-third ofthese elections were held in the last five months of 1975. Immigration marked the rise and fall of the UFW. In 1980, the UFW asked foranother 40 percent increase. After a bitter strike that saw growers turn tolabor contractors who organized crews of often illegal workers to be strikebreakers, the UFW won an Pyretic victory--many companies that agreed to UFWdemands went out of business. UFW membership fell from a peak of perhaps60,000 in the late 1970s to as few as 5,000 in the early 1990s. The UFW resumed efforts to organize farm workers after Cesar Chavez died in1993, and in December 1994, the UFW won an election to represent the 1,400workers employed by Bear Creek, better known as Jackson-Perkins, the rosecompany. On March 17, the UFW negotiated a three- year contract that increaseswages and benefits 22 percent over the life of the contract, sets a $5.82hourly starting wage, and offers nine paid holidays, including Chavez's March31 birthday. The United Farm Workers Union held events around the nation tohonor the anniversary of the death of UFW founder Cesar Chavez. On the eve of the 20th anniversary of California's Agricultural Labor RelationsAct's, the state's Legislative Analyst proposed eliminating the ALRB as anindependent agency, and combining it with the Public Employment RelationsBoard, the agency that regulates labor relations for public employees. TheALRB currently has only two of its authorized five members, and in 1993-94 its50 employees certified the results of nine elections and issued 31 unfair laborPractice complaints. The UFW protested the inclusion of the ALRB into thePERB, arguing that it is currently in negotiations with 32 farms that employ13,000 farm workers. In Washington, the welfare reform bill approved by the House of Representativesin March 1995 included a provision that permits H-2A temporary alien farmworkers for the first time to receive AFDC, SSI, Medicaid, Food Stamps, housingassistance, and most of the other federal means-tested benefits that would beeliminated for legal immigrants under welfare reform. There was much speculation as to who inserted this provision, and why. Mostguesses were that south Florida orange growers who have planted thousands ofacres of oranges in places where there is population or housing inserted theprovision so that, if they need H-2A orange harvesters in the future, they canuse the welfare system to subsidize the cost of housing and feeding them. After Rep Berman(D-CA) alerted his colleagues to the provision, Rep. Archer(R-TX) defended the eligibility of H-2A workers for welfare by asserting thattemporary farm workers need better treatment (Congressional Record of March23,1995, H3594).

The ruling means that a trial will be held on theconstitutionality of Prop 187 in federal court in Los Angeles. The WilsonAdministration has drafted regulations to implement 187, but it is not clearwhether they will be used during the trial to illustrate how the stategovernment interprets Prop 187. California Rep Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) introduced a bill in the House inearly April that would permit states to deny free public schooling to illegalimmigrants. In Los Angeles county, where the number of people on welfare--924,000 or 10percent of the population--doubled between February 1989 and mid-1994, welfarerolls have been shrinking since summer 1994--1.84 million county residents werereceiving benefits from at least one of eight means-tested programs in February1995, from AFDC to Medi-Cal to general relief. In a sign of the times, California in 1995 will spend more to house 126,000prisoners than it spends to educate students in the UC and CSU systems.Corrections takes 10 percent of the state's $40 billion budget, while highereducation gets about 9.5 percent. If the three strikes law is fullyimplemented, and corrections and higher education continue to share 20 percentof the state's budget, then corrections would take 18 and higher education twopercent of the state's budget in 2002. Florida expects that the number of criminal aliens deported will quadruple from468 in FY 1994 to about 2,200 in FY 96. The INS has promised to hire moreimmigration judges, investigators and lawyers to speed up the process. An article in the April 20 New England Journal of Medicine warns that Prop. 187could endanger public health, deny care to people in need and undermineprofessional ethics. Another article warns that there could be a spread ofcontagious diseases like tuberculosis among untreated illegal immigrants. A separate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study reports that 30percent of the TB cases reported in the US in 1993 occurred in foreign-bornpersons, an increase from 22 percent in 1986. Most of those with TB wereimmigrants were from Latin American and Southeast Asia. "INS, Florida Implement New Plan to Boost Criminal Alien Deportations," PRNewswire, April 17, 1995.

Fred Alvarez, "Gallegly's Bill TargetsFree Public Schooling Of Illegal Immigrants," Los Angeles Times, April 4, 1995. _________________________________________ EarlyIntervention to Prevent MassEmigration Some speculate that early intervention in emigration nations could preventcrises that later produce illegal immigration. Between the September 19, 1994entry of troops into Haiti and March 1995, the US government spent about $700million on Operation Uphold Democracy, or $140 million per month, or almost $5million per day. Before the intervention, the US was spending $300 million per year, or about $1million per day, on Coast Guard patrols, safe haven camps, and asylumprocedures for Haitians. The Clinton Administration considers the Haitioperation "an investment that protects our borders," according to DeputySecretary of State Strobe Talbot before the House International RelationsCommittee on February 24, 1995. In early April, 1995, the US Coast Guard picked up 240 Haitians in boats, thefirst boat people since Aristide's return in October, 1994. Aristide did notrenew the immigration agreement between the US and Haiti, so there is somequestion as to what will happen to Haitians picked up at sea. Haiti is finalizing plans to repatriate boat people. The Turks and CaicosIslands, British possessions, will wait until November, 1995 to repatriateHaitians, while the Haitian government tries to prepare for their return. Cuba and the US ended two days of talks on immigration issues on April 19. Thetalks were the third round of negotiations since an agreement between the twocountries in September which halted the exodus of 35,000 boat people. Theagreement calls for "safe, legal and orderly" migration between the twocountries. In 1994, some 32,000 Cubans left the island nation. There are still 22,000Cubans in Guantanamo and, after humanitarian cases are admitted to the US,there will still be 15,000 Cubans there. An estimated 1,000 Cubans returnedillegally from Guantanamo to Cuba. During the talks, Cuba argued that the 32-year US trade embargo stimulatesemigration. Cuba hopes to head off an effort by Senator Jesse Helms that wouldtighten the embargo. Of the more than 6,000 Cubans allowed to come to the United States fromGuantanamo, about five percent are college graduates. A poll released on April 16 of Cuban exiles in Miami and Union City, New Jerseyconducted by Florida International University, shows that 83 percent think thatthe Cuban refugees at Guantanamo should be allowed to come to the US. Only 34percent agreed that the Cuban refugees should have been sent to Guantanamo inthe first place. Jeanne King, "Cuba-US Talks end with progress, official says," Reuters, April19, 1995.

What do the lessons of history teach about thecurrent debate over immigration? About one million immigrants arrived annually at the beginning of the 20thcentury, and about one million are arriving annually today. It is widelybelieved that the immigrants arriving in the early 1900s came to settle, andmade their way in the US without welfare assistance, while some of theimmigrants arriving today allegedly come to get public assistance. The population in 1900 was smaller, so the number of arrivals per 100residents--the rate of immigration--was larger. But Americans and immigrantshad large families then, so the immigrant contribution to population growththen was lower than it is today--immigrants accounted for about 20 percent ofpopulation growth in the early 1900's and 30 percent today. In the early 1900s, most Americans were farmers and rural residents, while mostimmigrants moved to cities. This means that immigrants were a large fractionof the clients in public hospitals and similar institutions--since suchinstitutions existed mostly in cities. Nathan Glazer notes that the expansion of the welfare state--in a time of lowimmigration, and when there was no expectation that the US would ever againbecome a nation of mass immigration--left the US vulnerable to e.g., elderlyimmigrants who never worked in the US depending on an SSI system designed forelderly Americans who did not accumulate sufficient credits for social securityand pensions. Glazer argues that the US today is both more tolerant of minorities and lessoptimistic about its future. Instead of Americanization, he notes, there isbilingual education; and the combination of falling real wages and worries ofover population and environmental degradation make it harder to assume therewill be unidimensional progress with or without immigration. The US is likely to restrict and reform its immigration policies in the 1990s.Glazer argues that it should begin by making immigrants ineligible foraffirmative action and similar preference policies, and Frederick Rose arguesthat immigration in this century has gone through a hump shape in terms ofperceptions of immigrant success. Early 1900s immigrants were perceived to include many persons dependent on themeager public assistance programs then available. The immigrants arrivingafter numerical restrictions were imposed in 1921 led to a high proportion ofvery skilled and talented immigrants, a trend that was maintained by the 1965lifting of the ban on Asian immigrants. However, the rising number of especially Hispanic immigrants in the 1980s hasled to a reassessment and a perception that, once again, immigrants includemany people who are in need of public assistance. Although most researchersnote that, in an economy with 132 million workers, of whom no more than 10million are unskilled legal and illegal immigrants, the nation's economic fateis not tied to immigration, a reassessment of immigrant progress by GeorgeBorjas that argues that Mexican immigrants who lagged Northern Europeans ineducation and income a century ago continue to have slower upward mobility.

Thisrepresented 15 percent of all votes cast, and 27 percent of the votes cast byworking class voters and the unemployed. Jacques Chirac, the conservative candidate in the May 7 run-off election,appealed for votes from Le Pen supporters by asserting that "France must firmlyoppose illegal immigration," and that changes are needed to avoid ethnic andreligious ghettos. France has a 12.3 percent unemployment rate, and a mixture of economicuncertainty and fears of immigrants reportedly gave Le Pen thehigher-than-expected vote. Racial intolerance is reportedly rising in Southern France, where the gapbetween French and North African immigrants is widening. Le Pen is especiallypopular in Marseilles, where he won 28 percent of the vote. North Africans inMarseilles with French citizenship registered to vote in record numbers. On February 21, 1995, supporters of the National Front, while posting campaignsigns, killed in unclear circumstances a 17-year old son of an Africanimmigrant in Marseilles. (March, 1995 Migration News) Le Pen did not punish theFront members, claiming the killing was an accident, until 15,000 peopleprotested the weekend after the shooting. Le Pen then expelled the three supporters from the party. They are nowawaiting trial. Le Pen now claims now that the killing was a conspiracy todiscredit his party. Marseilles city officials banned the National Frontrallies, fearing violence. France continues to worry about another wave of Algerian migration. Aninstitute in Paris released a report that asserts that political instability,not demography, will be the major factor contributing to emigration from NorthAfrican nations. Population growth rates have been falling--between 1975 and1980, annual growth rates in Algeria and Morocco were 3.1 percent and 2.4percent. Today, they are estimated to be 2.2 percent and 2 percent. Almost 80 percent of those polled in a recent survey agreed that "Muslimfundamentalism is a very serious threat in our country which must be fought."There are about five million Muslims in France. In a new report based on interviews with 13,000 people, the National Institutefor Demographic Studies (INED) concluded that immigrants are assimilating inclassic ways--90 percent of Algerian youth consider French to be their nativetongue, children in working-class families are doing better than their parents,as well as similar French youth, and mixed marriages between French and NorthAfricans are on the rise. Almost half of the Algerian immigrants reported thatthey did not actively practice Islam. The French population, now 56 million, is projected to rise to 62 million by2015, or about 333,000 per year, assuming that fertility remains at 1.8children per woman. Most of the growth would be in the Paris region and insouthern France.

Germany plans to return all of the Vietnamese by the year 2000. Vietnam in mid-April protested searches of Vietnamese apartments by Germanpolice. German police targeted Vietnamese hostels in Berlin following gangwarfare between competing cigarette-trafficking rings, which left five peopledead. At the end of 1994, there were about 100,000 Vietnamese in Germany. There were 10, 991 asylum applications in March 1995, and 32,995 in the firstthree months of 1995, a 10 percent drop over the first three months of 1994.The German Bundesrat, dominated by the SPD, has proposed a legalization forasylum applicants who have been in Germany eight or more years. German President Herzog visited Kazakhstan in early April to discuss the futureof perhaps 500,000 ethnic Germans who have the right to return to Germany ascitizens under an annual quota of 225,000 per year. Stalin deported hundredsof thousands of Germans to Kazakhstan in 1941, and a 1991 census put theirnumber at some 900,000 out of a Kazakh population of 17 million. In 1994, 122,000 Germans in Kazakhstan returned to Germany, up from 115,000 in1993 and 113,000 in 1991. Germany officially bans dual citizenship, but an estimated two million ofGermany's 81 million population have two passports. Most are ethnic Germans,who are allowed to keep their Russian or Kazakh passports and acquire Germanpassports upon their arrival in Germany. Germany has begun recruiting more foreign-born police officers so that they canhelp ease the tensions between minority communities and the police.Non-Germans also have a better change to infiltrate foreign criminal bandsoperating in Germany. Of Germany's 227,000 police officers, 100 are notGerman-born. Two stumbling blocks to recruiting more foreign-born police are languagebarriers and the requirement that police officers must be German citizens. In a recent survey of job seekers, 36 percent of the west Germans, and 12percent of those in the east, reported that they could conduct business in aforeign language, usually English. Over 95 percent of the students in WestGermany studying a foreign language are learning English. Germany's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 9.6 percent in March, meaningthat there were about 3.7 million unemployed and 35 million employed workers inGermany. Germany's GDP is projected to grow by three percent in 1995, or 2.5percent in the west, and 8.5 percent in the east. On April 5, 1995, Germany and Poland signed an accord to deal with illegalimmigration. All police radio communications, telephone, and fax links are tobe standardized on both sides of the border; the cost will be covered from theDM120 million marks ($US 87 million) in aid already pledged by Bonn to Warsawfor crime-fighting measures. Recent German research indicates that 12 million non-German workers - prisonersof war, concentration camp inmates, and civilians in German-occupied areas -were required to work in German factories and other workplaces, so that, by theend of the war, non-Germans were 40 percent of the German manufacturing workforce. Only the Italians, until the collapse of the German-Italian axis in1943, were legally on an equal footing with German workers. Typical work dayswere 10 to 11 hours, and 60 hour work weeks. Some of the forced laborers have gone to court to demand compensation. A 1952agreement between Germany and Israel paid $1 billion to "slave laborers."Non-Jewish "civilian" forced laborers who were not war prisoners have notreceived compensation. The 1952 agreement does not allow claims to be madedirectly against German companies; they must be made by countries againstGermany.

Currently, claims take about seven months to be heard. The newrules mean that once applicants have been refused political asylum, they willno longer receive benefits while they appeal their rejection. Howard also plans to introduce stiff fines on employers who hire illegalimmigrants. Prime Minster Major has endorsed the call for all legal residentsof Britain to be required to carry an ID card. In January and February of 1995, over 6,500 immigrants who were caught enteringthe country illegally, or overstaying their tourist visas, claimed politicalasylum. In 1994, over 42,000 asylum seekers were paid welfare benefits whichrange from L41per week for a single man over 25 to L114 for a couple with twoteenage children. Many also claimed housing benefits of up to L100 per weekper family. According to the Scottish Refugee Service, asylum seekers need thewelfare benefits because the government does not permit them to work for theirfirst six months in the UK. The 1993 Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act brought a spectacular jump in theproportion of asylum claims refused, from 14 per cent in the six months beforeit came into force to 76 per cent in the first nine months of 1994. There were53,000 applicants awaiting a decision in September 1994. The Scottish Refugee Council claims that the Home Office has inflated thenumber of asylum seekers to justify more restricted border controls. The HomeOffice based its proposed legislation on the assumption that 90 percent of theasylum seekers are in fact economic migrants, which the Scottish RefugeeCouncil says is not true. The Home Office reports that many North Africans enter the country through anetwork of underground smugglers, then claim millions of dollars in benefits.The problem, they assert, is especially common among Algerians, who purchaseforged documents for as little as L40. Between January and April, 1995, morethan 500 Algerians claimed asylum in Britain, compared with 305 in all of1993. It was estimated that at least 5,000 illegal immigrants used false documents toenter Britain in 1994. A London raid on a visa factory found thatcounterfeiters were making false British passports by using names and addressesfrom phone books and selling them to foreigners for $800 each. Police alsouncovered advice for Kurds that advised them to apply for asylum ifapprehended, since the process of considering their application would give themat least 32 weeks in the UK. According to the European Commission, Britons are the leading emigrants in theEU, surpassing even the flow of refugees from the former Yugoslavia. In 1992,there were nearly 150,000 British emigrants. The most common destinations were the US, Australia and other EU states,primarily Ireland and Germany. These data exclude most of the estimated100,000 British workers who work in the German construction industry.

Under the Schengen agreement that went into effect on March 26, 1995, cars cancross the national borders of France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Belgium,Holland and Luxembourg at slow speed, since all of the Schengen countries haveagreed on a common visa for non-EU nationals. Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, which has only one terminal, has emerged as aplace where illegal immigrants can slip into the EU. Intra-EU passengersreceive smart cards that enable them to bypass passport controls, but many ofthe cards are tossed away by arriving passengers who go through immigrationinspection, so that persons wanting to avoid passport controls can use them. Germany's tougher controls on its eastern borders have led to long queues atPolish and Czech crossing points; Germany requires tourists from countries suchas Bulgaria to have the equivalent of DM 50 per day to enter.

Foreign workers are willing to work for low wages, about 2,200 Czech crowns permonth, about 5,300 Czech crowns less than Czechs. According to official data,the average wage in the construction industry for the first three months of1995 was 7,652 Czech crowns per month. In addition, those employing illegalworkers do not pay medical and social insurance. A total of 32,000 foreigners were legally working in the Czech Republic as ofDecember 31,1994. Over 24,000 were manual workers, about half of whom wereemployed in the construction industry. The premier of the Czech Republic predicted that unemployment in the countrywould increase by two percentage points over the next two to four years. Hesaid that as industrial output increased, the foreign workers were beingabsorbed into the economy, but the government should not tighten restrictionsbecause there are more Czechs working abroad than foreigners working in therepublic. Almost 320,000 Slovaks acquired Czech nationality in 1993 and 1994 followingthe 1993 split of Czechoslovakia. Over 20,000 people were questioned, detained or arrested in 1994 in connectionwith illegally crossing the Czech border, and 3,500 were apprehended in 1994.In 1994, legal proceedings started against 74 people for smuggling migrants. Under a 1994 Czech-German migration agreement, Germany is to provide DM60million to the Czech Republic to pay for border security, administeringregulations concerning foreigners, and building asylum infrastructure. TheCzech Republic granted refugee status to 1,300 aliens since 1991, but in 1994,one-third of those in Czech refugee camps disappeared, presumably to try toenter Germany or Austria. Czech farmers have complained that there are not enough farm workers, and that"thousands" of guest workers will have to be imported to tend livestock. Farmwork is "hard and poorly paid" according to farm spokespersons. "Premier expects unemployment to rise by two percentage points," CTK NationalNews Wire, April 24, 1995.

The Philippine government reprimandedseveral of its diplomats in Singapore for not doing enough to help the maid anddowngraded relations with Singapore. Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulaannounced his resignation on April 17, taking blame for "shortcomings" inhandling the case. The Philippines president called a special session of the country's newCongress, which will be elected in May, to ratify a Charter for OverseasContract Workers. The government will also review its policies on thedeployment of workers abroad and will conduct on-site investigations of theworking conditions abroad. The commission appointed after the hanging called upon the president to: 1)certify for ratification by the Senate the International Convention on theProtection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and members of their families;2) consider having Philippine government representatives help to regularize thestatus of undocumented workers overseas --an estimated 1.8 million, or 42percent of all overseas workers; 3) conduct an immediate study and consider aselective ban on domestic helpers and those belonging to the so-calledvulnerable trade from going abroad; and 4) conduct a serious crackdown onillegal recruitment, and illegal exaction of fees by licensed and unlicensedrecruitment agencies. The Philippines sent several observers to the trial of a 15-year old Filipinamaid in the United Arab Emirates who has been accused of murder, which shealleges was self-defense after a rape. A Sri Lankan maid in the UAE wasexecuted by firing squad on April 13 for the murder of her employer's four-yearold daughter. The Philippines requires migrant workers to be at least 25, and the United ArabEmirates requires them to be at least 18. The 15-year old Filipina used falsedocuments to get the UAE job. About 75 percent of the UAE's two millionpopulation are expatriate workers and their families, including some 100,000Sri Lankans. There are, according to President Ramos, 4.2 million Filipinos employed in 120countries. Ramos identified eight "critical countries" where Filipino migrantworkers need to have their rights protected-- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UnitedArab Emirates, Libya, Saipan, Malaysia and Singapore. The Philippines is oneof the few countries from which female migrants outnumber male migrants--about55 percent of the overseas workers are female.

About 23,000 work as industrialtrainees with official contracts in small-and medium-sized firms. The government has announced plans to increase their number by 12,000 to 18,000to cope with labor shortages caused by projected growth rates of seven percentannually, and an unemployment rate of less than two percent. Young Koreansreportedly prefer white collar jobs, even though some manual jobs that arefilled by foreigners pay better. South Korea has developed a reputation as being a difficult place for foreignworkers, due to harsh winters, difficult work, and the Korean language.According to a recent study, foreign laborers work on average 11 hours a dayand earn $720 a month, including allowances and other benefits, up from $480 in1994.

China has 500 officially recognized cities,including 200 that appeared since the mid-1980s. Real incomes are risingthroughout the country, but much faster in urban areas, so that urban wages andincomes are often four to six times greater than rural wages and incomes. Effective May 1, the Chinese government reduced the work week from 44 hours to40. This comes a year after the government asked companies to reduce the workweek from 48 hours to 44. Government officials hope that the adjustment willmake more jobs available. Under new rules to take effect in Beijing on July 15, employers will not beable to hire migrant labor without a special permit from a designated jobintroduction organization. There are now over three million migrant workers inBeijing. Migrants must obtain temporary residence permits to find work andhousing under the new rules. In China's southern province of Guangdong, officials report that a program tocontrol migrant workers by licensing has been successful. They expect to coverabout half of Guangdong's 10 million transient workers by the end of 1995. Theprovince has also set up a labor information network. Chinese officials estimate that, of the 220,000 Chinese students who have goneabroad since 1979, only 75,000 have returned. The Chinese government believesthat part of the blame for this 'brain drain' falls on Western nations such asCanada and the United States whose immigration policies give easy entry to thewell-educated. To counteract the 'brain drain,' several universities, such as BeijingUniversity, are offering higher pay, better housing, and improved workingconditions for students who return home. The government has also established afund to support the research of returnees. The State Education Commission in April began a proactive program whichrequires students to return in a timely manner as a precondition for governmentfunding of overseas education. But this impacts few students. Of the 220,000who have left China, only 40,000 were state-funded. There are also reports of an internal 'brain drain,' in which talented studentsare migrating from China's poor inland areas to the rich coastal regions. Anestimated 35,000 skilled technicians have left China's inland western provincesover the past three years. Incentives similar to those offered to overseasstudents have been given to students from the inland provinces who return. Authorities in Guangzhou are trying to close illegal quarries which have beencompared to concentration camps. In some quarries, 50 to 60 workers sleep in aroom of about 160 square feet. Workers are sometimes held as virtual slaves.At one mine, rescuers freed workers several times over the past year. Workersare physically abused and often not paid.

The vote is expected to raise the issues of violenceagainst domestic workers. Hong Kong officials said domestic helpers qualify tovote as long as they acquired permanent residency under the Electoral ProvisionOrdinance, which requires them to have been in Hong Kong for seven years ormore. The government of Hong Kong is investigating the consulate of the DominicanRepublic in Hong Kong, which has been accused of selling passports to Chineseheaded to the US. Investigators believe hundreds of mainland Chinese have paid$15,000 for illegally-issued passports and visas. Dominican authorities saythe illegal immigrants are then transported to Puerto Rico by an internationaltrafficking ring. In the fall of 1994, Hong Kong's honorary consul in Antigua was fired afterbeing tied to the issuance of illegal passports. In February 1995, aninvestigator with the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in Hong Kongwas jailed for four years for accepting bribes from people applying to emigrateto the US. Mainland Chinese mothers are illegally entering Hong Kong to deliver theirchildren so that they can receive automatic right to abode in 1997 underArticle 24 of the Basic Law.

The US declared onMarch 17 that Vietnamese whose applications for asylum were rejected have nochoice but to return home. Malaysia on April 11 announced its plan to return 4,700 Vietnamese. There are22,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong, and most are due to be returned. Vietnam arguesthat 400 of the boat people in Hong Kong are not Vietnamese. Vietnam is accepting most of those being returned, but it is refusing to acceptthe return of at least several hundred thousand ethnic Chinese. China hasagreed to accept the ethnic Chinese rejected by Vietnam. There are believed to be 50 Vietnamese in Vietnam who were sent by the US intoNorth Vietnam in the early 1960s to disrupt the economy there, but the INS doesnot believe their story, and has refused to accept them as refugees to the US.Classified papers can be read to suggest that their assertions are true, whichmay entitle them to refugee status in the US.

At the end of 1994, 112,188 foreign laborers worked in Taiwan's manufacturingsector, up 22 times from 1992 and accounting for five percent of allmanufacturing workers. Foreigners were six percent of Taiwan's constructionworkers. Taiwan announced that manufacturers could request another 8,200 foreign workersbeginning in April 1995. Turnover in electronics and garment factories ishigh--20 to 40 percent annually. Many Taiwanese have moved to China because oflabor shortages in Taiwan. Taiwan estimates that its labor shortage in construction was 11 percent inApril 1990, but fell to one percent in September 1993. The labor shortage inmanufacturing was seven percent in June 1989, and four percent in September1993. Taiwan will encourage immigration to the Spratly Islands in an attempt toassert its sovereignty. Fisherman are the first group to be encouraged tosettle on the islands. The Spratly Islands are claimed in part or in whole byChina, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Except forBrunei, all the countries have stationed troops on the islands. The SpratlyIslands command strategic sea lands and are believed to be rich in mineralresources.

The crack down comes against a backdrop ofincreasing attention to the safety and well-being of an estimated 1.5 millionskilled and unskilled Indonesians believed to be working abroad. Indonesia, which supports the legal export of workers abroad, plans to send 2.5million workers overseas over the next five years, and expects them to remit upto US$ 12 billion in foreign exchange. Most illegal workers were from theprovinces of East and Central Java, East and West Nusa Tenggara and SouthSulawesi.

Almost 30 percent of theimmigrants were from Europe, including the ex-USSR, and 20 percent were fromsoutheast Asia. Immigration to Australia peaked at 145,000 in 1988-89. About half of the immigrants were in the family unification category, and 18percent or 12,800 came because they had needed skills--the skilled categoryexperienced a sharp decrease. There were also 11,400 humanitarianadmissions. Critics alleged that too many non-English speaking immigrants arrive in thefamily unification category; according to one, Australia risks creating "a newethnically-based non-English speaking underclass of long-term jobless migrantsnow living on unemployment benefits." One reason why the number of skilled immigrants dropped so sharply is thatAustralia is facing an oversupply of lawyers, engineers and school teachers.In 1993-1994, 445 doctors, 324 civil engineers, 537 secondary school teachers,210 lawyers, 149 economists and 114 architects were among the immigrants toAustralia. Some critics believe that immigration is creating new job seekerswhen there is already an oversupply. A study by a Monash University sociologist found that Australia's unfocusedacceptance of migrants has led to an increase of professional migrants wherethere is already a surplus. For instance, a large number of doctors have beenadmitted to Australia but they are not allowed to practice. Doctors wishing toenter Australia as skilled migrants have to achieve a set number of pointsaccording to government criteria and pass an English test. Others are acceptedif they are sponsored by relatives in Australia. To practice medicine, theymust pass an Australian Medical Council multiple-choice test that has a passquota of 200 migrant doctors a year. Successful candidates can then attempt aclinical test. The Australian government announced that it will request a modest increase inimmigration. The planning level for 1994-95 is 73,000 under the family reunion,skilled and business skills categories, plus 13,000 under the humanitarianprogram. The government says the use of the points test to screen contractual andindependent entrants is ensuring that migrants are skilled and that most ofthem are finding jobs. The government has recently required entrants to post abond and pay for their own English language training (an up-front cost of$20,000 for some migrants) is meant to avoid mismatches in the labor market. An Australian union, ACTU, has asked the government to stabilizenon-humanitarian immigration and impose tougher requirements on employersseeking to import skilled workers. The union argues that with an unemploymentrate of 8.7 percent there was no need to increase non-humanitarian programs. Australia had an official "whites only" immigration policy until 1973. Thefirst act of the Australian Commonwealth in 1901 was to pass a law banningnon-Europeans from immigrating, and this "White Australia," was not fullydismantled until 1973. Australia has gradually shifted its focus from "mother England" to Asia. Mosttrace the break to the UK joining the EU in 1973, which eliminated specialpreferences for Australian agricultural exports in Britain. The value ofAustralian exports to Asia have risen from 30 percent of the country's total in1960 to about 63 percent in 1993. Australia had a serious recession in the1980s, but it led to the dismantling of trade barriers that had shelteredinefficient manufacturing industries. Australia and New Zealand removed trade barriers between them in 1983, andtrade soared. So-called "crops and rocks" --agriculture and mining--economieshave been transformed into diverse exporters--one-third of Australia's exportsare now manufactured goods, including cars and IBM Personal Systems/2 desktopPCs. However, rocks and crops remain important exports-- coal alone accountedfor 11 percent of Australian exports in 1993, followed closely by gold, beefand wool. Both Australia and New Zealand have large service exports. In 1994, Australiaearned $1.2 billion educating 63,000 foreign students, and New Zealand's numberone earner of foreign exchange--generating $2 billion--was tourism. Many Asian business leaders are pessimistic about Australia's chances to keepup with fast-growing Asian economies; they blame Australia's strong unions andsocial welfare state. Former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew warned Australiait could become "the new white trash of Asia." A former Australian finance minister argued for very low levels of immigrationon the grounds that much of Australia's wealth are rents from agriculture andmining, so that population growth means a smaller per capita share for eachAustralian. A 1994 report issued by the Bureau of Immigration and PopulationResearch concludes: "The evidence strongly refutes the claim that immigrationleads to increases in unemployment," and in the long run generally conferspositive economic benefits on the Australian population. The opening to Asia changed immigration patterns; typically half of Australia'simmigrants come from Asia, and five percent of the Australian population wasborn in Asia or are first-generation Australians with Asian parents. The Asianpopulation of Australia is projected to reach eight percent by 2010 and 10percent by 2020. Australia accepted 140,000 Vietnamese after 1975. Australia is officially a multicultural society, which has been likened to a"salad bowl" with different ingredients but each retaining its own distinctiveflavor. Various cultural activities are subsidized, and there are laws againstmaking derogatory remarks or discriminating in jobs and housing. For example,the regional government in Sydney committed itself to place 7.5 per cent ofgovernment advertisements with the ethnic media and to encourage the naming ofpublic places "to reflect the nature of our multicultural society". When a member of Parliament was slain in a Vietnamese suburb of Sydney, PrimeMinister Keating said that Australia "is not and can never be an 'Asian nation'any more than we can or want to be European or North American or African."

The controls must now be approved by the Parliament.Estimates of the number of illegal aliens in the country range from two toeight million, although experts believe that the lower number is closer toreality. In 1994, South Africa deported over 90,000 illegal aliens, stepped up patrolsalong the Zimbabwe border, and turned the electric fence along the Mozambicanborder to the "warning" level. South Africa is worried about Black joblessness--estimated at 41 percent orfour million--but also does not want to offend neighboring countries thatsheltered South Africans during the struggle against apartheid. Migrants areaccused of stealing jobs and committing crimes in South Africa. Estimates pegthe cost of dealing with illegal immigration about $60 million, with the billexpected to grow to $285 million by the year 2000. The Confederation of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called foreliminating laws that limit the free flow of labor in southern Africa, butstrengthen regional unions. Cosatu has 1.4 million members, and it wantsnegotiated and periodically reviewed quotas for foreign workers in each of theregion's various countries. According to Cosatu, South Africa has been operating within the framework ofthe South African Customs Union, which allows it to use Botswana, Lesotho,Namibia and Swaziland as reservoirs of cheap labor and captive markets.

In April, 79 Bangladeshi workers has accused an "untraceable" Kuwaiti employerof not paying wages--35 dinars ($120) a month-- for five months. The workers,including welders, electricians and drivers, also complained of poor housing.Kuwait attributes the problem to agencies that sell entry permits to migrantworkers but do not guarantee the workers' jobs, so that, after their arrival,the workers must accept poor jobs. There are reported to be two million Egyptians in the six Gulf states,including one million in Saudi Arabia. Worldwide, the report says that fivemillion migrant workers send $7 billion to Egypt each year. Egypt, a country of 60 million that has received $35 billion in US aid over thepast 17 years, has at least 17 percent unemployment and a declining standard ofliving. At least 50 percent to all Egyptians are illiterate. As economic growth in Egypt has slowed to less than two percent since 1992, andtourism has been reduced by terrorism, remittances of $5 billion annually nowalmost equal the $6 billion earned from Suez Canal receipts, oil exports, andtourism combined. The economic outlook is grim. Egypt's pound is estimated to be at least 40percent overvalued, and the failure of the government to privatize the 80percent of the factories that are state-owned, and to reduce the corruptionthat wipes out small businesses and discourages foreign investment, means thatthere is little hope for an export-led boom. Egypt has long benefited from its location and willingness to trade aid forsupporting the position of a super power. In exchange for making peace withIsrael, the US has been providing about $2 billion annually in aid, of which $1billion goes to Egypt's 400,000 man army, covering over half of Egypt's annualdefense budget.

ISSN 1081-9916 NORTHAMERICA _________________________________________ ClintonProposals to Reduce IllegalImmigration On May 3, 1995, Senators Kennedy (D-MA), Boxer (D-CA), and Simon (D-IL),formally introduced President Clinton's proposals to deal with illegalimmigration, S754, the Immigration Enforcement Improvements Act of 1995. The Administration bill is similar to the proposal of SenatorSimpson (R-WY), S 269, increasing the likelihood that immigration reform willbe enacted in 1995. The administration's proposal would permit US border communities as a"local option" to impose a $3 per vehicle fee on border crossers, with thefunds used to add staff and crossing points that would speed legal crossingsand deter illegal immigration. Other features of the proposal include:testing a pilot worker identification system, adding 1,500 INS employees overthe next three years, reducing the appeals permitted to aliens in deportationproceedings, and allowing the use of racketeering laws to wiretap and prosecutealien smugglers. The administration proposal would double employer penalties for hiringunauthorized workers if the employer was also guilty of violating other laws,such as not paying the minimum wage. The White House also plans to increasethe number of inspectors who investigate immigration and wage-and-hourviolations. The number of documents that a new employee could present to anemployer to prove authorization to work would be reduced from 26 to six:resident alien card or "green cards," employment authorization issued to otherwork-authorized aliens, a Social Security card, a U.S. passport, a driver'slicense, or a state-issued identification card. US birth certificates would nolonger be acceptable to prove authorization to work. Clinton acknowledged that the US "was built by immigrants," but he thenasserted that the US "won't tolerate immigration by people whose first act isto break the law as they enter the country." An April 1995 Times Mirror pollfound that 62 percent of all Americans, up from 58 percent in March 1994,believe that the US is losing ground in dealing with illegalimmigration. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton pledged to expedite the deportation ofcriminal aliens from the US. Under US law, there must be a separate proceedingto determine whether convicted "criminal aliens" should be deported. The USdeported about 40,000 aliens who had been convicted of crimes in 1994, andthere is a backlog of another 100,000 awaiting deportation. US Attorney General Janet Reno announced on May 22 a one-month pilotprogram at the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles that would place 46 INS agentsat the facility to detain all illegal immigrants upon their release. Theinmates will be taken into federal custody, transported to a specialimmigration court, and promptly deported, most on the same day they arereleased from jail. The INS expects to deport 1,500 illegal aliens through this program in June1995. About 20 percent of the inmates in Men's Central Jail are illegalimmigrants, according to the Sheriff's Department. In Congress, there are bills pending to require that aliens apprehendedtwice in the US be returned to at least 300 miles from the US border. Stateand local governments would be required to cooperate with the INS or losefederal funds. Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) heads the Congressional Task Force onImmigration Reform that is expected to make recommendations to reduce illegalimmigration to the House subcommittee in June 1995.

Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) is expected to introduce in June 1995a 35-page proposal billed as a tool to "manage migration." A similar measureis expected to be introduced in the House. The growers' proposal would substitute attestation for certification todetermine whether foreign workers are needed. Instead of requesting permissionto import foreign workers from the US Department of Labor, and then waiting forDOL to certify that the grower tried to recruit US workers at prevailing wagesand with offers of free housing, transportation, and contracts for work,growers would simply assert that they had taken these steps, and DOL would berequired to approve their applications unless the applications were obviouslyincomplete or inaccurate. Under one scenario, farmers would fax applications that include promises torecruit local workers and to pay prevailing wages to the US Department ofLabor. DOL could review the request for completeness and accuracy, but notinitiate an investigation unless there was a complaint. Unless DOL disapproved within seven days, growers would be free to employforeign workers, either workers in the US, or those abroad. Details on howforeign workers would obtain what would be a new work authorization visa aresketchy. Growers assert that their new program would encourage foreign workers toleave the US when there is no work, but they have not yet spelled outhow. Most of the arguments in favor of a new guest worker program are familiar.Cheap labor is necessary to have cheap food, Americans won't do farm work, sothere is no correlation between US unemployment rates and the availability offarm workers, and it is well known that agriculture relies heavily onrecently-arrived immigrant workers, so the US should openly deal with thereality of immigrant farm workers. The counter arguments are also well established. Most begin with arestatement of economic theory--there is no shortage of workers, only ashortage of wages. Wages have stagnated in agriculture, and if immigrant farmworkers did not continually arrive, farm wages would rise, and more US workerswould seek or remain farm workers. Because of the higher wages, the demand forimmigrant farm workers would fall--farmers would learn how to produce food withfewer workers, or the US might import more labor-intensive crops. Under current law, growers anticipating labor shortages can bring tothe US non-immigrant workers under the H-2A program. The H-2A program requiresgrowers to ask DOL to certify their need for workers at least 60 days beforethe shortage is anticipated. The H-2A program also requires recruitment inplaces where US workers are found, and requires that growers offer to US andforeign workers housing and round-trip transportation. About 3,000 US farmers requested 17,000 H2-A workers in FY94. About 470California farms and ranches apply for H2-A workers annually. Most of the H-2Afarm workers in California are sheepherders, primarily from Chile, Mexico andPeru. California Attorney General Dan Lungren renewed his appeal for a guestworker program on May 3. Lungren's proposal would require foreign workers todeposit a portion of their pay in an escrow account to encourage them to returnhome. Lungren distinguishes his proposal from the Bracero program because, hesays, it would not require foreign workers to stay with one US employer,thereby limiting exploitation.

According to reviews of how 35 years ofproviding immigrant status to Cubans was reversed, political and safetyconcerns forced the change in policy. Politically, it was thought that riots in Guantanamo, or another wave ofrafters in the summer of 1995, might hurt Clinton's chances of carrying Floridain 1996. It was also feared that the mostly young men held in Guantanamo couldnot be held there indefinitely, or returned to Cuba, without violence. The trick was to figure out how to solve the problem created by the safehaven policy established in summer 1994 without setting off another wave ofmigration to the US. The compromise was to count the 21,000 Guantanamo Cubansagainst the guaranteed 20,000 immigrant visas provided for Cubans each year. By counting the Guantanamo Cubans against the 20,000 quota over the nextthree years, fewer visas will be available for Cubans who apply to emigrate inHavana. This alleviated concerns by Floridians that they would again beflooded with refugees, but angered Cuban-Americans because fewer slots areavailable for those wishing to emigrate from Cuba. The Administration asserted that the policy shift would save money. The USwas spending $1 million per day to care for Cubans in Guantanamo, and themilitary had requested $100 million to upgrade facilities for Cubans there. Most Cubans who come to the US move in with relatives, but the StateDepartment said that it would seek $100 million for medical assistance andlanguage training for the Guantanamo Cubans. Leading Florida politicians welcomed the policy shift, saying it was thebest compromise to deal with a difficult situation. Many Cuban Americanswelcomed the admission of Cubans in Guantanamo, but protested the new policythat, in the future, will have the US Coast Guard returning to Cuba personsleaving the island in small boats. On May 9, the first 13 Cubans picked up atsea were returned to Cuba . Cubans blocked traffic in the Miami area to protest the policy change, andon May 18, it was announced that the White House aide who negotiated theagreement with Cuba would no longer deal in Cuban affairs. However, it wasreported that many Cuban-Americans disapproved of the disruptiveprotests. Some House Democrats and Republicans criticized the Clinton administrationfor "trusting the word" of Castro. About 45 percent of the Cubans in Miamiapproved of the new policy. There are about 1.5 million Cuban-Americans in the US, and 11 millionCubans in Cuba. The Cuban-American National Foundation, the most powerful Cuban group inthe US, wants to toughen the sanctions that the US has imposed on Cuba. Itsupports, and the Clinton Administration opposes, a proposal in Congress toprohibit the importation of sugar from any country that buys sugar from Cuba.The US pays a premium price for imported sugar. Canada and Mexico, Cuba's two largest trading partners, also opposetightening the sanctions on Cuba. Supporters of the Florida version of Prop. 187 say that the admission ofthe Guantanamo Cubans should help the passage their initiative, which wouldeliminate health, education and welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. Theinitiative would not affect Cuban exiles, but the image of thousands ofFlorida-bound immigrants becomes blurred with illegal immigrants, say backersof the Save Our State initiative. A second initiative, called FLA-187, has begun to circulate. It also callsfor making English the official language of all state and local governments. The INS on May 19 announced that the last 203 Haitian children inGuantanamo will be removed by June 30, 1995; it is widely assumed that mostwill be admitted to the US. The Cuban agreement did not mention Haitians, and on May 3, the US returned27 Haitians to Haiti. There were on May 1, 1995 about 350 Haitian childrenunder 17 among the almost 500 remaining Haitians in two camps in Guantanamo,and they attend schools while awaiting a decision about their fate. Most ofthe 21,000 Haitians in Guantanamo were repatriated after November 1994. It has proven difficult to find the children's parents and relatives inHaiti, and some of the children hope to be admitted to the US, as are Cubanchildren from the 12 Cuban camps for whom life in Guantanamo is considered bythe INS to be "an extraordinary hardship." Haitian advocates in the US allegedthat, in some instances, Haitian children were returned to strangers inHaiti.

But the debate over how todeal with legal and illegal immigration has split Republicans. Republican presidential hopefuls have begun to address immigration issues.Patrick Buchanan has called for a five-year moratorium on most legalimmigration to allow the US to "assimilate" recent arrivals, a constitutionalamendment to deny citizenship to the children of illegal aliens, and stepped upefforts to prevent illegal immigration, including a 100 mile, double-layeredfence at the most significant border-crossing points. Buchanan has also called for a national law based on California's Prop.187, which creates a state-run screening system to prevent illegal aliens fromobtaining welfare and medical benefits; Buchanan also endorses making Englishthe official language. Phil Gramm and Pete Wilson have also staked out toughimmigration control stances--Gramm has called for a "lifetime" ban on immigrantaccess to federal means-tested benefits such as Medicaid. Senator Bob Dole is likely to follow the lead of Senator Alan Simpson onimmigration reform, supporting efforts to reduce illegal immigration, andreducing legal immigration by about 25 percent. Dole is reportedly skepticalabout barring legal immigrants from federal welfare programs. Some Republicans favor more immigration, but none of them is running forpresident. House Majority Leader Dick Armey recently asserted that US problemswould not be diminished by less immigration, and may be ameliorated by more.He decried restrictions on immigration, and suggested that the US "should bethinking about increasing legal immigration." Armey has vowed to oppose an improved work place identification system.The Commission on Immigration Reform, President Clinton, and leaders onimmigration reform in both parties endorse at least pilot programs that wouldmake it harder for illegal aliens to use false documents to obtain USjobs. Republicans such as Armey represent the libertarian wing of the party thatwants as little government as possible, while Buchanan represents thereconstructionist wing that wants to use government to reshape society as theythink it should be. On May 3, 1995, California Governor Wilson confirmed that in 1978 his firstwife employed an illegal Mexican maid in their home, paying her $25 per day.There was no federal penalty for US employers who hired illegal aliens until1986, and the maid became a legal immigrant in 1979. California Democrats called Wilson a hypocrite for taking such a strongstand against illegal immigration, while having hired an illegal alien. Wilsonand his former wife owe about $3,000 in back Social Security taxes andpenalties. All other announced Presidential contenders for 1996 have asserted thatthey did not employ illegal aliens.

According to INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, the guidelines are meant tosensitize asylum officers to gender-based discrimination and provide a means toevaluate a woman's asylum claim. The guidelines do not lower asylum standards:women must still show that their personal political convictions made them atarget of state persecution. The guidelines are not expected to affect asylum cases involving forcedsterilization or abortion in China. On May 2, a federal judge held that thesepractices alone do not constitute grounds for political asylum because thereexistence does not constitute individual political persecution. There continues to be a debate whether women in the US who might be subjectto persecution in e.g., Algeria or Saudi Arabia because they refuse to veilthemselves should be granted asylum in the US. In 1993, Canada granted asylumto a Saudi student who argued that she would face persecution if she was seenin public with her hair and face uncovered. The US does not generally grantasylum to persons who argue that their lifestyles clash with cultural mores athome, and thus they would face persecution if they returned. Lawyers asked that the 136 Golden Venture aliens still being detained bereleased while their asylum appeals are processed. According to the lawsuit,about 40 percent of all Chinese asylum applications have been approved, butonly 14 percent of those from the Golden Venture have been approved, allegedlyproving that the US government manipulated the consideration of the GoldenVenture applications to send a signal that applications from persons smuggledinto the US will not be considered favorably. Most Chinese asylum applicantsbase their claims on China's one-child policy. Sally Lehrman, "Asylum rule: big step for women," San Francisco Examiner,May 28, 1995.

Mexican immigrants in the US couldbecome US citizens, and keep their Mexican passports, plus enjoy all otherrights of Mexican citizenship except the right to vote in Mexican elections. If approved by the Mexican government as expected, some predict a surge ofMexican applications for US citizenship among the five million Mexicansresiding in the US who might qualify for US citizenship (other estimates putthe number of Mexicans who might apply for dual citizenship at 1.5 to 2million). Permitting dual citizenship might create a powerful, pro-Mexicanlobby in the US, and increase the workload of US immigrationauthorities. Some analysts speculated that the Mexican dual citizenship proposal is aresponse to the attack Mexicans face in the US after the passage of Prop. 187and similar initiates around the nation. US press reports on Mexico's economic prospects were mixed. The ClintonAdministration announced that the US bailout was working as intended, and thatMexico was on the road to recovery. On May 31, President Zedillo announcedthat the economy would grow at a five percent per year clip once Mexico snappedout of its current recession. However, the official jobless rate rose to 5.7percent in March 1995, and projections are that the economy will shrink by fourpercent in 1995. In Mexico, there appears to be increasing resentment against growinginequality. It was widely reported that rich Mexicans --the top 10 percent ofearners received 38 percent of the nation's income in 1992--were alerted to thepossibility of devaluation in December, when the new government had troublere-negotiating the pact between unions and employers. These rich Mexicansbegan a run on the peso, foreigners followed suit, and Mexico was forced todevalue. Mexicans who managed to convert their pesos into dollars before thedevaluation are richer than before, and sales of some luxury goods, such as$50,000 Mercedes, were up 25 percent in the first quarter of 1995. Expensiverestaurants are reportedly full, while medium-priced establishments arestruggling. In Mexico, reports of middle-class suffering abound. Some 10 to 20 millionof Mexico's 90 million people were considered to be middle class before thepeso devaluation on December 20, 1994, meaning that they had credit cars, ownedcars and often houses, and could afford to take vacations. Many middle classMexicans believed that Mexico had turned the corner toward first world status,and they borrowed freely in anticipation of a continued boom. Crime is reportedly up sharply. In addition to home and street thefts, USbusinesses complain that criminals posing as police stop southbound trucksloaded with merchandise and steal it. Some 85 percent of US-Mexican trademoves by truck, and US businesses complain that, until police corruption iscurbed, theft losses will drive up the Mexican prices of US goods. For the first time in decades, Mexico's Congress of Labor, and thebusiness and peasant organizations, who form a pillar of the ruling PRI,canceled the traditional May 1 labor day parade. Instead, "independent" unionsdrew about 75,000 protesters to Mexico City's main square, where theycomplained that the government's economic policies were hurting workers. There were 2,000 threatened strikes in Mexico between January and April1995, but fewer actual strikes than in any comparable period in the 1990s,reflecting worker fears of job losses. In Mexico City, the governmentdissolved Ruta 100, the 4,000-bus, 14,000-driver transit service for theFederal District, reportedly because the drivers' union protested governmenteconomic policies. The U.S. National Administrative Office (NAO) created by NAFTA's labor sideagreement said it will investigate charges that Sony fired workers at its NuevoLaredo maquildora because they tried to affiliate with the independentAuthentic Workers Front (FAT) union. The NAO previously dismissed similarcomplaints against General Electric and Honeywell. Mexico's agricultural sector is in a crisis that is expected to producesharp reductions in production in 1995, and fewer farmers in the years ahead.There are five to six million farmers in Mexico, including one to two millionlandless workers. In 1994/95, the production of 10 basic grains during the winter/springgrowing season fell almost 40 percent, from 11 million tons to seven milliontons, and some predict that up to 10 million hectares will not be plantedduring the spring-summer agricultural cycle because of low prices and highcredit and fertilizer costs. Corn tortilla prices rose 26 percent in the Mexico City metropolitan areain early April, to about 15 cents per kilo. Mexico is obliged to permit thetariff-free import of 2.5 million tons of corn from the U.S. and 100,000 tonsfrom Canada in 1995. Mexico's more open political climate is seeing more open debates about howto put the economy back on a sure footing. There have been calls, for example,to restructure the tax system to reward savings and tax consumption, so thatMexico does not have to depend as heavily on foreign investment, and to step upprivate and public investment in infrastructure. Mexico attracted about $5 billion of the $19 billion Foreign DirectInvestment that flowed to Latin America in 1993, and $8 of $22 billion in 1994.Foreign investment in Mexico is currently governed by a Foreign Investment Lawenacted December 28, 1993. The Mexico crisis may delay NAFTA's expansion to include Chile. Chile, acountry of 14 million rich in natural resources, has been growing at a sevenpercent annual rate over the past eight years. Exports in 1994 were about $12billion, including $2 billion worth of commodities sent to the US, and importswere also $12 billion, including goods worth $2.5 bought from the US. The Clinton Administration in mid-May endorsed a bill to extend NAFTA'sfree-trade provisions to Caribbean Basin Initiative countries. Employer andunion representatives of apparel firms protested that extending free trade toCBI nations would destroy their industries in the US.

Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX) noted thatimmigration has been increasing, and that there appears to be no "natural" endto the current wave of immigrants in sight. Smith argued that narrow specialinterests have replaced the broader national interest in the making ofimmigration policy. Ranking minority member John Bryant (D-TX) expressed concern that legalimmigrants and non immigrants are displacing US workers. Susan Martin, executive director of the Commission on Immigration Reform,promised CIR recommendations on legal immigration reform in June 1995. Shenoted that legal immigration dropped by about 10 percent in FY94 versus FY 93,from about 880,000 to about 800,000. Preliminary data suggest that there will be about 800,000 legal immigrantsin FY95, which ends September 1995. Almost all of the witnesses agreed with Martin's three-pronged definitionof the US national interest, viz, to admit close family members of US citizensand settled immigrants, needed workers, and humanitarian (refugee) newcomers.The disagreement came in answer to the three fundamental immigration questionsof how many, from where, and in what status newcomers should arrive. Also testifying was British-born journalist, Peter Brimelow, whose bookAlien Nation is, some say, doing for the immigration debate what CharlesMurray's book Losing Ground did for the argument that government assistancehurts rather than helps poor Americans. Brimelow argues that immigration is aluxury that the US can no longer afford, because too many of today's immigrantsare too poor and too poorly educated to be assets in America. Brimelow recommended that the US limit annual legal immigration to 200,000,which he estimates to be annual emigration. The key failure of US immigrationpolicy, according to Brimelow, is that the US admits only one in six legalimmigrants on the basis of US economic needs. In the ensuing debate, it became clear that there is widespread concernabout the logic of admitting minority immigrants into a country that has asystem of preferences for all minorities, including immigrants not descendedfrom those who suffered discrimination at the hands of US governments.Political scientist Peter Skerry argued that, if the current system of grouprights and group politics were ended, there may be less need to worry about thelarge numbers of minority immigrants who arrive, since they would not beasserting claims to preferences. A recurring issue was whether the "immigration problem" was due primarilyto the number of new arrivals, or who is arriving. Some argued that onlynumbers--and perhaps skills--matter; others argued that rights to entitlements,such as minority preferences in the US, were the most important factor indeciding who should immigrate. In a debate between Brimelow and TV Think Tank host Ben Wattenburg,Brimelow argued that the 1965 Immigration Act unexpectedly triggered today'simmigration wave, and that the US is inflicting current and future assimilationproblems on itself by not stopping the unexpected wave of immigrants.Wattenburg countered that the immigration moratorium favored by Brimelow wouldput the US on the same demographic track as most of western Europe--belowreplacement fertility, and thus producing an aging and stable population thatwill cease to be the dominant world power. Several witnesses stressed that legal immigration requires difficulttrade-offs that Congress can no longer avoid. It was emphasized that, whenCongress considered legal immigration reform in the late 1980s, with the aim ofincreasing the proportion of needed workers in the flow, the number ofimmigrants was expanded so that there was no need to make difficulttrade-offs. However, in a preview of the 1995 Congressional debate, witnessesrepresenting narrow interests such as high tech computer firms made theseemingly contradictory argument that, even though the process for creatingsoftware is becoming so mobile that some companies already employ e.g., Indianprogrammers who are linked by satellite continuously to programmers in the USand Europe, the US immigration system should make it easy for US firms who wantto import foreign programmers. In reaction to the 48 Hours story (See related story below) of how USprogrammers were laid off and replaced by legal temporary foreigners fromIndia, an employer lobbyist argued that, in this case, the current systemworked as intended, since DOL has recommended that the offending company bebarred for one year from importing foreign workers. Other witnesses arguedthat the current system invites employer abuse, since employers simply "attest"that they tried and failed to recruit US workers, and then they receivepermission practically automatically to import foreigners. DOL investigatesonly if there is a complaint, and the one year ban on importing more foreignworkers was considered by some to be inadequate. A compromise between employers who want to continue getting skilledtemporary workers automatically via the attestation process, and unions whowant a detailed labor certification process, may lie in the adoption of oneaspect of the German sanctions system, which permits easy entry of skilledworkers, but also permits the confiscation of any profits earned by unlawfullyemploying foreign workers. Most witnesses offered general proposals and guidelines for reforming legalimmigration. Several echoed CIR Vice-Chair Lawrence Fuchs, who noted that themajor difference between mass immigration at the end and the beginning of the20th century is that the almost one million legal immigrants arriving each yearat the end of the century are accompanied by large numbers of non-immigrants(almost 25 million each year) and unauthorized aliens (an estimated two tothree million entries, and 300,000 settlers annually). Fuchs notes that thehope for economic betterment has long been the major motivation of immigrants,although most of those hoping to improve their lot enter through familyunification channels. It was noted several times that US immigration law begins with definitionsrather than clearly articulated goals of immigration policy, that few Americansunderstand the current immigration system, and that today's complex system is,in any event, poorly administered by the INS. Some urged that the US adopt a point system for admitting immigrants--allpersons wishing to immigrate to the US would apply, and they would receivepoints for e.g., being young and educated and having US relatives and/or a USjob offer. All persons who score above the cutoff level would then enter anannual lottery or a queue. Canada and Australia each admit about half of their annual immigration flowthrough such point systems. In Canada in 1993, for example, individuals couldscore up to 34 points for education and training, 18 points for having workexperience in labor short occupations, 15 points for knowledge of English orFrench, and 10 points each for having a job offer, being young, and beingpersonally suitable--70 pints is required for entry. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) plans to introduce in the summer of 1995 apoint system to admit legal immigrants, restarting the debate over how much"expert systems" should be used to select immigrants. On the one side aremostly economists who argue that the US should use the scientific toolsavailable to pick immigrants most likely to succeed in the US, benefiting theimmigrants and the US. On the other side are ethnic lobbies who argue that a point system wouldexclude especially poorly-educated Mexicans, and those who argue thatfamily-based immigration does admit ambitious immigrants who will succeed inthe US. On May 10, the Senate heard testimony on a new, fraud-proof Social Securitycard that would include individual biometric information on the person to whomthe card was issued. Simpson envisions a two-part check: the employerverifying that the person presenting the card is the person to whom the cardwas issued, and then the employer calling in the Social Security Number to adatabase to verify it, much as credit card numbers are verified. There are 270 million Social Security accounts in a nation of about 265million. The total cost of re-issuing Social Security cards is estimated to be$3 to $6 billion, but this cost might be spread over many years, by, e.g.,beginning with students and school leavers seeking their first jobs. Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) was scheduled to introduce the growers' guest workerproposal at the May 26 Senate markup on SB 269, but the markup waspostponed.

House testimony, Federal New Service, May 17,1995. _________________________________________ TVNews Show TacklesMigration On May 11, the CBS-News TV program 48 Hours aired a segment on abuse of theattestation procedures under which US employers can "attest" that they tried torecruit US workers at prevailing wages, which allows them to bring into the UStemporary foreign professionals, such as computer programmers, to the US tofill job vacancies. One example of abuse was a New Jersey insurance companythat reportedly laid off 130 US programmers, and then replaced them with 130programmers from India hired through a labor contractor. Under the H-1B program, the US Department of Labor is permitted to reviewemployer attestations only for completeness and accuracy; DOL does notinvestigate employers who are requesting H-1B workers unless there is acredible complaint. Some 42,000 H-1B visas were issued in 1994. The hour-long show, entitled "Slamming the Door," also dealt with the rapeof a small girl by an illegal alien in a small town in Utah, the failure of theINS to deport and keep out the US illegal aliens who have been convicted ofcommitting crimes here, and the costs borne by California and Florida toprovide medical care and education to immigrants and their children. California reportedly spends $1.2 billion annually on medical care forillegal aliens, in part because some Mexicans prefer to have their babies bornin the US because of the quality of medical care, and because the babies bornin the US are US citizens. Prenatal care and emergency medical care areavailable to all residents, but MediCal fraud investigators find that, in manycases, aliens provide US addresses, but are not residents. In an especially telling segment, the show reviewed how the INS sendsso-called "surrender letters" to criminal aliens asking them to appear at anINS office before leaving the US, but only four percent of the aliens to whomsuch letters are sent respond. The INS is trying to deport convicted illegalaliens straight from their jail cells, so that they are not freed from prison,and then have to be re-located and removed.

However, the INS is also likely to speed up the deportation ofNicaraguans whose asylum applications have been denied. The 1990 COP found 74,000 Nicaraguans in Dade County, while local leadersestimate there are as many as 200,000. The first wave that arrived after theSandanistas took power in 1979 were welcomed as refugees from Communism, butsubsequent waves included many poorer and less educated Nicaraguans. Under a US policy begun in the early 1980s, Nicaraguans were given workpermits even if their applications for asylum were rejected, and some have nowworked in the US for more than a decade. On March 1 in Miami, about 1,000 ofthe 100,000 Nicaraguans in southern Florida protested an INS policy effectiveJanuary 4, 1995 that discontinued the automatic issuance of work permits toasylum seekers. Today, work permits are issued to Nicaraguan and other asylumseekers on a case-by-case basis. About 60,000 Nicaraguans are affected by the ruling; 24,000 applicantswhose cases have not yet been heard, and the rest applicants who are appealinga denial of asylum in the US. Nicaraguans say the changes will force them to take illegal jobs or returnto a economically troubled homeland. In December, 1994, Nicaraguan PresidentVioleta Barrios de Chamorro urged President Clinton to allow the Nicaraguans toremain in the US longer, because, she said, the Nicaraguan economy could nothandle the return of thousands of Nicaraguans. Chamorro says that Nicaraguareceives $150 million per year in remittances, although exiles believeremittances exceed $300 million. Nicaragua is a country of four million with a 1992 per capita GDP of $340,lower than Pakistan and China. About 200,000 Nicaraguans are believed to havereturned from the US to Nicaragua since 1990.

Bilingual education has now come under attack. In many school districts,all students with, for example, Hispanic surnames, are tested for Englishlanguage proficiency, and those who score in the fortieth percentile or lessare placed in bilingual classes. Those placed in bilingual programs arereportedly isolated from other students. Many studies conclude that non-English-speaking students taught in Englishdo better than those taught in their native language. In the second such studyby a major school district, a New York study concluded that those taught mostlyin English perform better in English and math and science than children taughtsubjects such as math and science in their native language, with supplementaryEnglish instruction. The justification for bilingual education is that, byteaching non-English speaking children in their mother tongue, they will notfall behind other students, and will learn English. One alternative to bilingual education is English as a Second Language. InESL settings, students take regular classes in math and science, but then takesupplemental intensive instruction in English. In New York City, overthree-fourths of the non-English speaking children who entered kindergarten inESL programs were able to move into regular classes within three years, versushalf of the children in bilingual classes. Bilingual education costs $7,289per student per year in New York City, versus $5,149 for regularclasses. A reassessment of the overall performance of the US educational system bySandia concluded that "America's 'on-time' high school graduation rate has beensteady for over 20 years at roughly 75 percent to 80 percent....[but the]recent immigration of Hispanics, many of whom come into the US school systemwith inadequate background to succeed is significantly inflating dropoutfigures for the Hispanic population....some students require more than fouryears to complete high school, and many dropouts avail themselves ofopportunities to reenter (GED, night school, etc.), resulting in an overallhigh school completion rate for young adults of over 85 percent. This rate isimproving and is among the best in the world." Organizations such as the American Legion have attacked bilingualeducation, bilingual ballots, and the practice of swearing in new US citizensin a language other than English. For example, in 1993, 76 immigrants inTucson became US citizens in a ceremony conducted mostly in Spanish. InCalifornia, drivers may take their test in any one of 35 languages, includingLaotian, Farsi, Samoan, Western Armenian, and Tongan. Federal law requiresthat voting materials be printed in the language of any non-English speakinggroup of 10,000 or more, or if they are five percent or more, of a votingdistrict. California had a law practically mandating the teaching of "limited Englishproficient" (LEP) students in their own language until 1987 but, according to arecent reports, the state Department of Education has been captured byadministrators and unions that benefit from own-language instruction, so thatthe law's requirements persist. At a December 1994 hearing in Sacramento,there was widespread opposition from such groups to plans that would permit theestablishment of English immersion programs if the local school board thoughtthat English immersion was the best way for LEP children to learn. California Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin asked theBoard of Education to increase flexibility for districts that want to use moreEnglish-language instruction because educators are becoming convinced thatbilingual education is not the most effective means to teach non-native Englishspeakers. Eastin also plans to crackdown on school districts using thenative-language model and not performing well. California has 1.2 million LEP students in 500 school districts (of 5.2million), and spends $300 million annually to educate non-English speakers intheir native languages. The debate over bilingual education is illustrated bythe response to the Sacramento Bee editorial by William Dawson, the formeracting state superintendent of public instruction in California. There isdisagreement on the facts: Dawson asserts that the research shows that usingthe students primary language leads to English becoming the main language aftertwo to three years, but that special services are needed for five to sevenyears. English First, the organization that supported Prop. 63 in 1986, opposesbilingual education. The 4,300-member California Association for BilingualEducation (CABE) supports the continuation of bilingual educationprograms. In New York City, an "immigrant high school" has been proposed to educateup to 1,000 ninth to twelfth graders in English and native languages who havebeen in the US for less than one year. If approved by the Board of Education,the new school would offer newcomers up to four years--rather than the usualone year-- of native language instruction; critics allege that such newcomerschools institutionalize the isolation of immigrant children, making it hardfor them to make the transition into regular schools.

At its closest point,Albania is 50 miles across the Adriatic Sea from Italy. Officials estimateover 50,000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union each year throughItaly's heel. The governments of Albania and Italy announced a joint task force on May 27to deal with the problem of illegal immigration from Albania to Italy. Italyhas also tighten its border controls. On May 10, the Italian government moved1,000 soldiers to the southern Adriatic coast to deter illegal immigrants fromentering the country, and another 500 will be moved into the area during thesummer months. After six days at the border, the Italian troops arrested only 30 TurkishKurds and one Albanian crossing the Adriatic. The Kurds were given medicalchecks, photographed, and then released and told to leave Italy within 15days. Albania has also assigned 300 troops to stop Albanians from leaving theirhomeland. The Albanian Interior and Defense ministries recently tightenedmaritime and land border crossing patrols to prevent the country from beingused as a springboard for illegal immigrants. In May 1995, Albania turned backabout 500 Turks, Kurds, Pakistanis and Chinese. One reason why illegal immigrants aim to enter the EU through Italy isthat, under the 1991 Martelli law, most illegal aliens who are apprehended aregiven 15 days to leave the country--only Albanians are expelled immediately. Ifcaught trying to enter Italy without papers, Albanians are returned on a ferrythat makes the journey between Italy and Albania three times each week. Italydoes not require visas from former Yugoslav nationals, a violation of anagreement made by Schengen members in January. The Italian foreign minister is considering granting temporary seasonalvisas to Albanians in an effort to reduce illegal immigration. An eleven-page report by the Carabinieri, the armed police of the ItalianInterior Ministry, details how Turkish smuggling organizations move Turks intoEurope through Italy. Turkish migrants enter Italy along the Apulian coast,having been brought across the Adriatic from Albania. Until it was blocked bythe war in ex-Yugoslavia, the more direct land route through the Balkans wasused. Most of the current illegal border crossers are Kurds, attracted by theprospect of jobs in Germany. They are collected by the smuggling organizationin busses from such Kurdish cities as Eiazig, Bingol, Mes, Palu, Eleskirt,Varto and Nardin, driven through Bulgaria to Albania, and parceled out tooperators who take them by truck and bus to the harbor cities of Durres andVlore, where Italy is only fifty miles away across the Straits of Otranto. From Italian coastal towns, they are taken by train to Milan or Voghera toSan Remo or Ventimiglia, and then taken across the French border to Marseilleand Lyon. They are then moved from France to Germany. The Carabinieri report says that the smugglers take the Turks' passports atthe start of the journey, so that they can control them more easily, and alsoso that the Turks are in better position to claim asylum should they be caught.Smugglers charge each migrant about $4,300 for the whole trip--$2,100 as far asAlbania, $1,050 for the boat crossing to Italy, another $500 or $600 to get toFrance, and the rest for the final push to Germany. The Carabinieri estimate that the smuggling organization has brought morethan 7,000 unauthorized migrants through Italy into France, and has earneditself some $28 million in that way. In the first quarter of 1995, the Germanborder police picked up 435 Turkish citizens attempting illegally to cross theFrench and Benelux borders into Germany. There is no estimate of how manypeople may have succeeded. Germany's Interior Minister, Manfred Kanther, argued that Italy must policeits borders more effectively. Kanther has said that Italy is disregarding thespirit of Schengen by allowing hundreds of illegal immigrants into the EU everyday. Italy has signed but not implemented the Schengen agreement. In Rome, Kanther was contradicted by Christopher Hein, director of theItalian Refugee Council, who said that the influx of Kurds was a long-rangeconsequence of the German recruitment of Turkish guest workers in the 1960s. Italy is also facing an influx of illegal Chinese immigrants being smuggledin by Chinese gangs. Italian authorities are concerned that the Chinese andItalian mafias are working together.

According to some observers, there is a markeddifference between the original "guest workers" and their children--the now 50and older guest workers are trying to stay connected to Islam and theirhomelands via satellite TV, while their children adopt the language and valuesof their host countries. Some Muslims living in Europe support militant movements to changegovernments in their home countries, and in recent years, many have beenarrested for stockpiling weapons. Many older Muslims who arrived as guestworkers reported that they did not think about their religion, and religiousdifferences, until settled and they and their children suffereddiscrimination. Second-generation immigrants suffer high jobless rates--often 50 percent ormore--and some turn to militant Islam because of their failures to obtainpromising jobs. In other words, unemployment, not Islam, is believed to be atthe root of the appeal of militant Islam. Fears of militant Muslims reportedly pervade the thinking of governmentofficials--NATO in 1995 announced that militant Islam is as much a threat toWestern Europe today as Communism was before 1989. About 200 militant Muslimswere arrested and expelled from Western Europe in 1994. Most of Europe's Muslims are in four countries: France--five millionMuslims in a total population of 57 million, Germany, two million of 81million, UK,1 million of 58 million, and the Netherlands, 750,000 of 15million. In most countries, there are relatively few mosques for these largeMuslim populations. France is trying to support the development of what it calls "FrenchIslam," a secular type of Muslim religion.

Some 40,400 foreigners have applied for asylum in Germany so far in1995. On April 28, a Schleswig-Holstein court ruled that Kurds facing deportationfrom Germany risk persecution in Turkey and should not be sent there.SPD-governed states or Laender such as North Rhine Westphalia announced thatthey would not deport Kurds until at least June 12. Under German law, thefederal government decides whether a foreigner deserves asylum in Germany, butit is up to state governments to remove rejected asylum seekers from thecountry. In early April 1995, virtually all of the EU Parliament deputies votedagainst an EU-Turkey customs union to protest the Turkish government's allegedviolation of human rights in its war against PKK Kurdish separatists. On May 16 Amnesty International released a report on German policebrutality against foreigners, which concluded that the police do not helpforeigners attacked by Germans, and sometimes are the cause of violence againstforeigners. There were 70 reports of police brutality against foreignersreported to police between January 1992 and March 1995. Amnesty Internationalcalled upon federal and regional authorities to prevent police brutalityagainst foreigners. More than half of the cases involved police in Berlin. Berlin has thelargest Turkish population outside Turkey. The city also has many Vietnamesewho were brought in during the Communist era and are now regarded as illegalimmigrants; many of those without work permits live by selling smuggledcigarettes on the streets. In 1994, there were 1,233 xenophobia-grounded violent crimes against non-Germans in Germany. German schools report that xenophobic violence is becoming more common onschool grounds--and not just in urban areas. German authorities reportbombings near schools and drive-by shootings. In Eppingen, a southern Germantown of 18,000, a local 30-member gang of extreme rightist youths stormed ahigh school graduation ceremony shouting "Deutschland den Deutschen (Germanyfor the Germans)." The gang beat up pupils and teachers and engaged invandalism. Marc Fisher, "How ugly are we Really?"

The proposals would allow the Home Office'sImmigration and Nationality Department to reveal confidential details ofimmigration cases to other officials. Government departments and localauthority staff would be encouraged to exchange information with immigrationofficials routinely. Another proposal by the Social Security Secretary would detain thousands ofasylum seekers in camps and cut welfare benefits while claims are beingconsidered. The plan would also speed up the asylum process. Similar campshave been set up in Holland, Germany, Norway and Spain. The British HomeOffice has expressed concern about whether there would be a cost savings. Mostasylum cases take about 32 weeks to process and there is a backlog of 55,000cases. A bill to make it illegal to employ undocumented immigrants was passed bythe House of Commons with a majority of nine votes. Although not expected tobecome law, there is speculation that Howard will introduce a similar measurein his package of immigration reforms in the next Queen's Speech. In Britain,it is illegal to harbor illegal immigrants, but it is not illegal to employthem. Howard is determined to close loopholes in UK immigration laws and tostreamline the procedures for dealing with asylum-seekers. About 80 percent ofall asylum applications are rejected -and 80 per cent of appeals are alsoturned down. The majority of the 34,000 asylum applications since 1994 are not genuine,according to the Home Office, which is drawing up procedures to decide morequickly which applications are without merit. Howard is reviewing the extentto which asylum-seekers should continue to obtain welfare benefits while theirappeals are pending. New and tougher penalties for the smugglers of illegalimmigrants are also being considered. Paul Eastham, "Lock-up in camps for the migrant cheats," Daily Mail, May29, 1995.

On May 1, a Moroccan immigrant was drownedwhen a French skinhead pushed him into the Seine river during a rally of LePen's National Front. According to the National Front, the suspect was not amember, but was there to sabotage the demonstration. Both candidates criticized Le Pen for not condemning the drowning, and bothpaid homage to him as a victim of racism and xenophobia. Both took strongstands against illegal immigration, and Chirac urged more foreign aid forAfrica to prevent African immigration. Both candidates promised to work harder to curb illegal immigration, andChirac has promised to enforce aggressively the 1993 Pasqua laws enacted tomake it more difficult to immigrate to France. These laws permit random policechecks of persons to determine whether they are illegal immigrants. Chirac announced that reducing France's 12 percent unemployment rate washis top priority, and proposed a $400 monthly subsidy for two years toemployers who hire a worker who has been unemployed 12 months or more.Employers would also be exempt from payroll taxes on such hires. The French economy is expected to grow three percent in 1995, inflation islow, and France is the world's fourth leading exporter, but there are greatconcerns about persons "excluded" from French growth, including foreigners.

Since 1994, about 2.5 million people have moved to Russia from theformer Soviet states, according to the Russian Federal Migration Service.Russia's Center for Economic Affairs estimates that by the year 2000, therewill be a net migration of 2.8 million people from the former Soviet republicsinto Russia. Most of the migrants are Russians from Tajikistan, Azerbaijan andUzbekistan, but the influx from Kazakhstan is increasing. Within Russia, theconflict in the Caucasus has produced some 300,000 internal refugees, and afurther 320,000 have fled the war in Chechnya. Many of the migrants from the Third World in Russia are in transit to theWest. The FMS estimates the number of such migrants at 500,000, mostly fromAfghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Iran, Sudan, Angola, Pakistanand Nigeria, and mostly awaiting a turn to go west in Moscow. "Operation Foreigner," a Russian program to rid the country of illegalChinese immigrants, has been in effect for over one year and, according toRussian officials, has been successful. Operation Foreigner includes moreborder guards at the Chinese frontier, and closer scrutiny of documents. In some border towns, Chinese workers have both Russian and Chinesedocuments, and the influx of Chinese is blamed in part on lax tourist controls.To enter Russia, a Chinese citizen needs only a certificate or specialpassport. The murder of a Russian border guard on April 12 resulted in a demand byCossack border troops to root out and deport Chinese citizens living thereillegally.

The chief of police reports that there is a ring smugglingNigerians into the country, and that the number of Chinese increased five-foldin the past two years. Many Chinese immigrants establish businesses in Bulgaria, which anyforeigner can do with a capital investment of 50,000 leva. They then bringtheir family and relatives into the country. Bulgaria is the only EasternEuropean country that has not canceled its agreement with China on relaxed visarequirements. A proposed law would require foreigners applying for residence in Bulgariato prove that they are not being sought by tax authorities. They would also berequired to obtain approval to deal with foreign exchange from the BulgarianCommerce and Industry Chamber, register the amount of their foreign investment,and present their company's financial results at the end of each year to localauthorities. The law is an effort to stop the spread of international crimenetworks in the country.

The largest number are employed in Saudi Arabia, according to a 1992survey. Hong Kong and Singapore each had about 65,000 maids, and Bahrain had40,000 maids. The Philippines was the largest source of maids--at least275,000 Filipinas work overseas. The next largest exporters of maids were SriLanka and Indonesia, each with about 100,000 women abroad. Maids go to the Middle East because of the high wages, but there iswidespread agreement that working conditions are harsh. Hong Kong pays threetimes the wages of Singapore. Canada was previously a popular country becauseCanada granted permanent residence to maid caregivers after two years' ofemployment. Canada halted that policy in 1991, but foreign workers are allowedto marry or change their employment. In Singapore, the number of foreign maids rose from about 5,000 in 1978 to40,000 ten years later. Since 1988, the number of maids has doubled again tomore than 80,000; the sharp rise is seen in data that indicate that in 1990,the Singapore Census found that only two percent of the households relied onforeign maids to care for children. Today, one out of every ten households in Singapore has a maid. Aboutthree-quarters of Singapore's maids are from the Philippines; the rest are fromIndonesia, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Foreign maids first started going the Singapore in the 1930s when theso-called amahs arrived from China and Malaysia. The amahs belonged to asisterhood, called kongsi, which believed in spinsterhood and femaleindependence. This organization provided them lodging, helped in recruitmentand negotiated working conditions. In the 1970s, the Singapore government began to allow more foreign maidsfrom the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka to be employed because of theshrinking supply of amahs and local maids. In 1989, the government gavemarried working women an income tax deduction for the wages they paid to aforeign maid. As the number of foreign maids grew, the government implementeda levy on foreign maids. Today, Singaporeans wishing to bring in foreigndomestic workers must pay a monthly fee of $US 235 to the government. In June, 1995, some 50,000 Sri Lankan, Indian and Bangladeshi women areexpected to move to Singapore to replace Filipino maids. There is some concernthat cultural differences between the South Asian and Singaporeans will createproblems that did not arise with the English-speaking Filipinas. More than 60,000 Filipina maids continue to work in Singapore, despitethree planeloads of their compatriots returning home under following thedispute over the hanging of a Filipina maid (Migration News, May 1995). Philippine President Ramos has called a special legislative session todevelop a Magna Carta for Philippine nationals working abroad. The PhilippineDepartment of Labor and Employment has developed proposals to prevent anotherPhilippine national from being hanged without a complete investigation byincreasing the number of Philippine Labor attaches, adding legal attaches andmilitary and policy attaches abroad to aid Filipinos victimized by unfair laborpractices. The human rights organization Kalayaan called for the UK to change its lawsto protect 20,000 foreign domestic servants in the UK. British law allowsemployers to bring domestic workers into the country, but does not grant theman independent immigration status, which means they must stay with theiroriginal employer. Many of the UK's foreign workers are Filipino. The Trade Union without Borders helps domestic workers in Geneva, wherethere are about 2800 foreign maids. The union asserts that there are many ofabuse and exploitation of these maids. "Highly paid diplomats exploit their servants in Geneva," Arno Mayer,Deutsche Presse-Agentur, May 17, 1995.

About 30,000Indians and Bangladeshis work in the shipyard and construction industries ofSingapore. Residents who live in the nearby area worry about their safety, butare resigned to the use of vacant lots as gathering places for foreign workers. In another part of town called Little Thailand, the 40,000 Thai workershave similar gatherings. The 60,000 Filipino maids gather at the mass transitstations on the weekends. Foreigners account for more than 300,000 of Singapore's 1.6 millionworkers. Foreign worker quotas were raised in 1994 in the manufacturing,service, and shipbuilding sectors. On April 1, 1995 the foreign worker levy was raised by 10 per centto prevent an influx of low-wage foreign workers. Government officials hopethat these foreign worker policies will prevent the settlement of foreignworkers, and discourage local employers from becoming dependent on foreignworkers. The Singapore Minister for Home Affairs told employers that they should notrely upon workers from only a small number of countries, such as Malaysia andthe Philippines. He suggested India, Burma and Vietnam as possible new sourcesof labor. "Singapore employers told to look beyond region for workers," Agence FrancePresse, May 21, 1995.

The workers will come from Thailand, thePhilippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and possibly Fiji. The council will allow amaximum of 35 percent of a company's work force to be foreign workers. The workers will be allocated under quotas to industries, such as fabricand sock weaving, sweater producers, electroplating, pigments, machinerymolding plants, and producers of stone products. Individual companies will no longer be allowed to employ foreign workersprivately; all foreign workers will be admitted under government contracts.The government will control the number of foreign workers in Taiwan and willset a ceiling of five percent of the Taiwanese work force, or a maximum460,000. The CLA has issued permits for 250,000 foreign workers, which meansthat Taiwanese employers will be permitted to bring in another 190,000 foreignworkers. There are currently about 169,000 foreign workers and 8,800 domestichelpers in Taiwan. They earned about US $600 per month. The police said 9,333 foreign workers brought into Taiwan had run away fromtheir legal employers as of the end of March, 1995. But only 3,144 of themhave been found and deported.

After three years, JITCO has brought40,000 trainees to Japan, mostly from Southeast Asia and China. The governmentestimates that 30,000 foreigners are working illegally in the country. JITCO signed a "record of discussion on the development of employment" withThailand on March 31 last year. Thai officials said no Thai trainees have yetgone to Japan through JITCO, but 4,000 Thais have gone through private bodies,such as the International Personnel Management organization. Japan is considering admitting foreign nurses. With over 28 percent of theJapanese population aged 65 or older, there is a shortage of geriatric nurses.Foreign nurses are currently not permitted to work in Japan. Kamolwan Sansomsook, "Low Pay and Difficult Working Conditions Make Nursinga Job Not Enough Japanese are Willing to Take," Bangkok Post, May 14, 1995. _________________________________________ MalaysianReliance on/a>ForeignWorkers Malaysia's booming economy has drawn more than a million migrants fromIndonesia, the Philippines and Bangladesh, among others, in search ofjobs. By one estimate, if economic and job growth continue at current rates--thegovernment projects economic growth of seven percent per year to 2020--Malaysia will need 23 million workers in 2020, but will have only 13 millionworkers. Malaysia currently has a per capita GDP of $3200. Despite promises by Malaysia's Prime Minister to permit industrial wages torise, and to reduce the country's reliance on foreign workers, the governmentis considering extending the work permits for foreign workers. The MalaysianDepartment of Human Resources proposed a 3+2 formula which would allow workpermits for foreign workers to be extended for two years upon the request of anemployer. Foreign workers are currently given two-year work permits, with theemployer having the option of extending the permit for one year. Employershave ask the Malaysian government to permit another two year extension so thatthey can keep trained workers. Malaysia is considering imposing stiffer fines on recruitment agencies whoemploy foreign workers in illegal activities. Some of the proposed penaltiesinclude higher fines, jail and caning. A bill with the proposed changes isexpected to be submitted by the Attorney General's office before the end of1995. Malaysian authorities arrested over 3,000 illegal Indonesian migrants injust two months, mostly in the provinces of Johor, Selangor, Melaka and NegriSembilan. Many of the illegal immigrants are arriving by boat. Those caughtare held temporarily in one of five immigration detention camps. In 1992, the government licensed about 300,000 illegals from these campsfor temporary employment in households, plantations and the constructionindustry to ease the acute labor shortage in these areas. Malaysia is considered an economic success story, but there continue to beconcerns about the country's treatment of unions. The Malaysian electronicsindustry employs 140,000 workers, including 120,000 women, but labor law bansunions from this "pioneer" industry in which the government hopes to lureforeign investment. Most electronics workers are young women who start on the assembly line atage 17 to 25, and stay for less than 10 years, earning $140 to $250 per month.A Spring 1993 survey reported that electronics workers were 75 percent female,63 percent Malay, and 57 percent skilled. Skilled workers were paid an average $1.15 per hour or $221 per month,including benefits. Unskilled workers were paid an average $133monthly. The Australian government reports that fewer Malaysians are settling inAustralia. Between 1984 to 1994 over 40,000 Malaysian, 16 percent of allsettlers from Southeast Asia, settled in Australia. Malaysia was the thirdlargest source of settlers after Vietnam and the Philippines. "Extension of work permits will benefit all involved, The Straits Times,May 29, 1995.

Foreigners promised to invest $2.5 billion in the Philippines in1994. Earlier in 1995, there were fears that the Philippine bubble would burst,as did Mexico's because so much of the foreign money coming into the country isportfolio investment in stocks and bonds. The Ramos government reportedlykilled two birds with one stone by permitting competition in the telephoneindustry--reducing the power of the local oligarchy, and lowering costs. The Philippines, with 68 million people, has one of the fastest populationgrowth rates in Asia, about 2.2 percent, versus 1.4 percent in Thailand, whichhas 60 million residents. But the Catholic church in the Philippines--85percent of Filipinos are Catholics--insists that there be no governmentalsupport for birth control. President Fidel Ramos called the Philippine Congress into a specialone-week session from May 21 to 28 to approve measures to protect overseasworkers. The government is also calling on the Philippine Senate to approve aninternational convention to protect the rights of migrant workers. The number of Philippine overseas workers declined by 2.5 percent in thefirst quarter of 1995 compared to the same period last year. The Middle Eastremained the primary destination of overseas workers with 48 percent, while 36percent went to other Asian countries. An estimated 100,000 illegal aliens in the Philippines will be offeredamnesty under a new program. Under the Alien Social Integration Act of 1995,foreigners who entered the Philippines before June 20, 1993 can apply for legalstatus. The amnesty program runs from June 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996.Illegal aliens with pending criminal cases and refugees can not apply under theprogram. The Philippines government announced that it will also closely monitorforeign students after police officials said that some were linked tointernational terrorist groups. The police will verify the identities of allforeign students and identify any who have overstayed their visas. "Philippine overseas workers decline in 1st quarter," Xinhua News Agency,May 22, 1995.

The cause of the riot was ostensibly a bill in the US House ofRepresentatives that provides $30 million to resettle in the US about half ofthe 40,000 Vietnamese boat people being held in detention camps through outAsia. The bill, proposed by Republicans and opposed by the Clintonadministration, would permit the money only to be spent on resettling theseVietnamese in the US, thereby overturning the US and international policy-knownas the Comprehensive Plan of Action-- of returning to Vietnam those who remainin camps throughout Asia by the end of 1995. If approved, the bill would endUS contributions to the UN program that has since 1990 returned to Vietnampersons found to be economic migrants. A vote on the bill is scheduled forJune. There are about 21,000 Vietnamese in camps in Hong Kong, and UNHCRofficials there expressed fear that, as the House proposal becomes known in thecamps, few Vietnamese will return to Vietnam voluntarily, and more may leaveVietnam in small boats. In 1994, a false rumor that Japan was acceptingVietnamese boat people prompted more than 1,000 Vietnamese to sail for thatcountry. The UN and the Hong Kong government started an information campaign shortlyafter word of the US proposals began to filter through the detention camps,emphasizing that that no US law has been enacted that will reverse the decisionto return them to Vietnam. But some believed that, with powerful champions inCongress, they should resist returning to Vietnam in the hope that the bill mayyet be enacted. On April 30, 1975, Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh city) fell to North Vietnamesetroops. Some 1.2 million southeast Asians eventually left their countries oforigin, and most were resettled in the US. There are over southeast Asians inCalifornia, and about 60 percent are on public assistance. As Americans re-debated whether the US should have fought in Vietnam, therewere remarkably few reflections on how the southeast Asians are faring in theUS and California. Most profiles stressed the success stories--the children ofrefugees who are valedictorians in high school and the success of refugees inbusiness, including the Cambodians, who dominate California's donut business.A few profiles emphasized the welfare dependency of Southeast Asians inCalifornia, and the tendency of youth gangs to break into homes of recentarrivals and rob those unlikely to complain to police.

Bangladeshi officials say the shoot-on-sight order isnecessary to stop smuggling of illegal immigrants. News reports said that those entering Bangladesh were being "pushed" out ofIndia by Indian authorities on the grounds that they were illegalimmigrants. Almost two million Bangladeshis are believed to have migrated to thenortheastern Indian state of Assam over the past 20 years, and clashes betweennatives and immigrants have killed 7,000 since the 1980s. Instead of crackingdown on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, India is now emphasizing the need toreduce emigration pressures from the world's most densely populationnation--there are 2,200 people per square mile in Bangladesh. Indian estimates are that 15 million former East Pakistanis andBangladeshis--some of whom were Hindu--have settled in India since 1947. Karachi, Pakistan is a vast city spread over 30 miles of semi-desert area,whose population has been increasing by six percent per year. Police inKarachi estimate that up to 20 percent of the city's 10 million residents areillegal aliens. An estimated 1.2 million are Bangladeshis, followed by 200,000Burmese, and 84,000 Afghans. Each wave of immigrants allegedly adds another slum to the city. Accordingto Pakistani officials, illegal migrants cause crime and take jobs away fromPakistanis. Pakistan has been unable to deport illegal Bangladeshis, becauseBangladesh does not take back citizens who have left the country illegally. Pakistani employers reportedly prefer to hire the illegal workers becausethey are willing to work for lower wages. Pakistani police recommend alegalization program, and then a 1000 rupee-- $33--charge for a work permit.Some human rights lawyers do not want the Pakistani police to have any role inimmigration, since they allege that the police are responsible for extortingbribes from immigrants. Instead, they call for better border controls. On March 12, the provincial government of Karachi cracked down on illegalaliens and arrested several hundred. The Pakistan government blames much ofthe terrorism in the port city on illegal immigrants, primarily muhajirs, whoare Urdu-speaking migrants from India and their descendants. Pakistan's economy grew by four percent in 1994, and foreign directinvestment topped $300 million, but it remains one of the world's largest poorcountries--GDP per capita was just $420 in 1992, versus $310 in neighboringIndia.

The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs asked the government to stop laborbrokers or manpower companies from importing foreign guest workers. Theminister said that the agencies are responsible for deteriorating workingconditions of foreign workers. Israel is slowing reopening its borders to Palestinian workers after twoyear of restrictions following a wave of terrorist attacks. There are now over30,000 Palestinian workers permitted to cross the border daily; half areagricultural workers, and the rest construction workers. There were about100,000 Palestinians workers in Israel before the borders were closed followingterrorist attacks two years ago. Israel in 1995 accelerated the substitution of Asian and European workersfor Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, importing 70,000 foreign workersfrom Romania, Thailand, Ghana, and Turkey since 1993. In some cases,Palestinians are being asked to train other foreign workers, who usually earnthe minimum wage of about $2 per hour. Some Israeli employers prefer Asian andEuropean unskilled workers because they reportedly have little knowledge of theArab-Israeli conflict. Israeli and Palestinian officials in March 1995 began negotiations on thepossible repatriation of Palestinians who left what is today Israel, the WestBank, and Gaza. Some 600,000 to 800,000 Palestinians are believed to have leftwhat is today Israel in 1948, and another 220,000 to 330,000 left the West Bankand Gaza in 1967. Today, there may be as many as three million Palestinianrefugees and their children. There are about three million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gazatoday, and all sides agree that the economy there cannot support immigration.However, Palestinian officials are committed to the gradual and unconditionalreturn of all refugees. US officials are calling on Israel to find short-term solutions toalleviate Palestine unemployment, which is 60 percent in Gaza. Palestinianeconomists estimate that Palestinian workers lose $1 million each day thatIsrael closes the border. Israel plans to announce a series of public worksprograms inside the Palestinian Authority. Jose Rosenfeld, "Ministers slam imported labor," Jerusalem Post, May 22,1995.

Most are Moslems who entered Saudi Arabia onpilgrims' visas, often with no intention of returning home. Since January1995, Saudi Arabia deported over 5,000 Indians who overstayed their pilgrims'visas. Earlier in the year, Saudi officials deported one thousand Bangladeshiand Pakistanis who had overstayed their visas. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gives Moslems who want to go to SaudiArabia on pilgrimages only exit visas. There is very little crime committed by foreigners despite the fact thatmost are young men separated from their families--an average 150 per year havebeen arrested in 1993-94. However, Saudis complain that Catholic nannies passon their religion to the children in their care; that the abundance of foreignworkers tends to make Saudis think that they deserve to manage others, leadingto an excess of middle managers; and that the availability of foreign workersdeters the entrance of women into the economy and labor market. Saudis consider many of these illegal immigrants to be fortune hunters whosimply want to make as much money as soon as possible, rather than learn Arabicand Saudi culture. The five million immigrants among the 12 million residentsof Saudi Arabia remit an estimated $4 billion annually to their countries oforigin.

Some feel that guest workers arethe natural second-best option for very divergent interests unable to get whatthey really want. For example, ex-President Salinas of Mexico and CaliforniaGovernor Wilson agree on little else about immigration other than that guestworkers are preferred to the status quo. The Urban Institute on May 23 held a workshop entitled "Guest Workers: NewSolutions or New Problems?" A new Urban Institute Working Paper notes that allof the OECD countries, plus many others, have programs that aim to add workersto the labor force, but not settled residents to the population. However, inevery case, the results are the same, best expressed in the aphorism that thereis nothing more permanent than temporary workers. The usual rationale for guest worker programs is economic--admit foreignworkers to fill labor shortages and thereby obtain the mutual benefits of moreproduction and economic activity in the labor-importing country, whileproviding jobs and wages for the emigration country. However, dependence and distortion are everywhere associated with guestworkers. These terms refer to the fact that some guest workers settle, thatemployers assume that foreign workers will continue to be available, and thatforeign jobs will continue to be available. These factors combine to createpowerful migration networks that make immigration control a more difficultobjective to achieve. The Urban Institute Working Paper emphasized that the rationale for guestworker programs is changing. During the 1960s, for example, guest workers werepractically synonymous with thousands of Turks and Algerians arriving every dayin Germany and France to fill macro or economy-wide labor shortages duringperiods when the unemployment rate was less than one percent. Today, guest workers are imported to herd sheep in the American west, pourdrinks in mountain resorts, and be physical therapists--these foreign workersare usually filling very specific labor shortages in labor markets with highunemployment. The instruments needed by governments to fill such precise laborshortages--active and credible employment services and control over illegalimmigration--are often lacking, making the determination over whether guestworkers are needed an increasingly contentious issue. After the government certifies that foreign workers are needed to fillvacant jobs, employers may be free to recruit in any country and under anycircumstances that they want, or they may be required to take the workersarranged by the ES in particular countries. The third and most debated aspect of guest worker programs is how to avoidemployer dependence and worker settlement. Governments in East Asia are tryingto avoid what they see as the mistakes made in Europe and North America bylevying taxes or fees on employers who hire foreign workers, and requiring someof the foreign workers' earnings to be put into government savings accounts.If workers do not claim these wages in their country of origin at the end oftheir contracts, the wages are forfeited. The mostly western growers proposal for a 1995 guest worker program for USagriculture makes major changes to the current program under which foreignworkers are permitted to be admitted for temporary US farm jobs. About 3,000US farm employers bring 17,000 so-called H-2A alien farm workers to the US eachyear, so that legal temporary foreigners are less than one percent of thenation's 2.5 million hired farm workers. But about two-thirds of all farm workers in surveys are foreign born, andabout 25 percent are unauthorized, up sharply from less than 10 percentauthorized in 1990. Farmers argue that if Congressional plans to reduceillegal immigration are successful, and because many farm workers want to findother jobs, then agriculture will face escalating labor shortages asimmigration control efforts become more effective. Farmers fearful that the US Department of Labor may not agree that theyneed foreign workers want to bypass DOL and substitute an attestation procedurefor the current certification procedure. Under their proposal, farm employerswould certify that they recruited and failed to find US workers while offeringprevailing wages etc, and the DOL would be required to agree unless it couldshow that the farm employer was lying. Farmers would then make individualagreements with foreign workers that would not be subject to governmentscrutiny unless there were complaints. Farm worker advocates attacked this proposal, charging that it undoes ahalf century of regulations that were established to prevent the exploitationof US and foreign farm workers. The growers' plan is scheduled to beintroduced May 26 during the mark up of the Kennedy-Simpson immigration reformproposal; both Kennedy and Simpson oppose the growers' proposal. A second paper on the economic crisis in Mexico and trends in Mexico-USmigration argued that the current migration hump-- the temporary increase inmigration being experienced in 1995--was a predictable result of Mexico-USeconomic integration under NAFTA. The major reasons for the migration humpinclude the fact that, despite NAFTA, there continued to be a demand-pull of USjobs that attract Mexican migrants, NAFTA-inspired restructuring in Mexicoincreased supply-push pressures, and well-established networks efficiently movemigrants across borders. NAFTA also spurred long-term foreign direct investment in Mexico, but FDItakes time to create jobs that deter migration. An overvalued peso throughout1994, the NAFTA "hope factor" that made devaluation unnecessary, and theChiapas uprising and several assassinations provided no opportunity for anorderly or gradual devaluation. Instead, a massive devaluation occurred onDecember 20, 1994, and a US led international bailout was required to stabilizeMexico's economy. The peso devaluation is certain to stimulate Mexico to US migration in1995--the only question is how much. According to most analyses, at themargin, there is a 1 to 0.7 relationship, i.e., a one percent peso devaluationincreases Mexico-US migration by seven-tenths of one percent. In order to reduce Mexico-US migration, the US could step up borderenforcement, try to channel illegal migrants into a guest worker program, orpersuade Mexico to prevent or deter exits. The paper concludes that none ofthese short-run measures is likely to provide a quick fix, and that the USwould be best off if it supported Mexico in pursuing the long-run policies thatare necessary to deter emigration, viz, stick to stable macro policies,implement political reforms, and develop Mexico's human and physicalinfrastructure.

Participants were reminded that, despite polls suggesting that the fear ofmass immigration is now equal to the fear of the spread of nuclear weapons--72percent of those polled put these threats at the top of their list-- US doorsto immigrants, non immigrants, and unauthorized entrants remains open. Everyday, about 2,500 legal immigrants arrive, as do 60,000 non immigrants, andabout 1,000 unauthorized aliens settle here. The year 1994 was the year that the Clinton administration took actions todeal with immigration issues, and 1995 is shaping up to be a year ofCongressional action on immigration. In 1994, the Clinton administrationannounced reforms that deny work authorization to asylum applicants, stepped upborder control efforts in Texas, Arizona, and California, and changed migrationpolicy on Haiti and Cuba several times. In the case of Haiti, it was notedthat some Haitians assert that their country is the only Caribbean nation that"must" remain democratic so that Haitian migrants have no claim to USasylum. Immigration bills are working their ways through both houses of Congress.The bills most likely to be enacted in 1995 would deal with illegal immigrationby experimenting with new systems through which newly-hired workers prove totheir employers that they are authorized to work in the US. The debate overinternal enforcement, it was agreed, is whether emphasis should be placed on adata base against which employers can check worker numbers, whether theemphasis should be on a secure card for all workers, or whether emphasis shouldbe placed on stepped-up workplace enforcement. There was extensive discussion at the conference about why the US seemspoised to reduce legal and illegal immigration. Some argued that theanti-immigrant mood represents another period of nativism, defined by historianJohn Higham as a combination of nationalism and ethnic prejudice. But it wasalso noted that there are powerful forces operating at individual, family, andvillage levels, as well as in emigration countries and in some sectors of theUS economy, that will make it very difficult to enact and enforce effectiveimmigration controls. One in-between outcome of an effort to reduce immigration when there arestrong forces that want it to continue is to acknowledge inevitable migration,but seek to regulate it in a manner that does not lead to settlement. This isthe definition of a guest worker program, and several participants thought thatthe US may develop different policies for different countries--virtuallystopping e.g., Haitian immigration, because it is not an economic necessity,but trying to manage Mexican migration with a guest worker program. The conference addressed both south-to-north flows of people within theAmericas as well as global migration flows. It was noted that there is analphabet soup of international organizations to deal with the one-sixth of theworld's GDP that flows across borders in the form of trade, but fewinternational organizations to deal with the two percent of the world'spopulation that flows across borders. There was considerable discussion of why states should give up power to oneor more international organizations to deal with migration. In contrast totrade organizations, for example, there is no theory or consensus thatcountries should be open to immigrants, but there is a theory that countrieswill grow faster if they are open to trade in goods. Second, it is widely recognized that freeing up trade creates winners andlosers, so that states often willingly give up power to internationalorganizations, and put the blame for free trade or tight money decisions on theWorld Bank or the WTO. Immigration also creates winners and losers, but thereis less agreement that states should turn at least some migration control overto international organizations to help them to deal with domestic winners andlosers in the wake of immigration reforms. Third, it is widely recognized that trade channels tend to narrow over timeas special interests attempt to erect barriers to trade, so internationalorganizations that regulate trade matters look skeptically at the attempts ofcountries to interfere with the free flow of goods. Migration channels, bycontrast, can widen over time as networks are set in motion, so that aninternational organization might be forced to play dual roles, justifyingrestrictions in countries that want to limit immigration, and justifying thelowering of migration barriers on behalf of countries that want to increaselabor exports. National attitudes toward migration have evolved since the mercantilistera, when especially skilled craftsmen were hoarded and emigration wasdiscouraged. In the 19th century, emigration became a safety valve forindustrializing European societies. Many other topics were raised in the free-flowing discussion. For example,just how much of the "immigrant problem" in industrial democracies is createdby these rich countries recruiting cheap labor, or sending capital abroad thatdisrupts traditional production relationships and thereby sets migration inmotion? What does it mean to be a member of more open and diverse societiessuch as the US, and how easy should the US make naturalization? The current immigrant wave raises doubts about whether the US will be ableto successfully integrate the diverse newcomers arriving today. The same fearswere raised at the beginning of the century, and it was argued that the key tointegration is the second generation, an issue on which there are signs foroptimism and pessimism. Most authors concluded that there is a permanence in the migration theystudied, whether Salvadorans in Long Island, or Colombians in Venezuela. Ineach case, a long period in a richer country leads to permanent settlement fora significant fraction of the immigrants.

ISSN 1081-9908 _________________________________________ NORTHAMERICA _________________________________________ CongressMoves on ImmigrationReform In June 1995, the House and Senate took actions that are likely to reducelegal immigration and increase efforts to reduce illegal immigration. Ifenacted, US residents who sponsor the admission of their relatives would berequired to support them, and immigrants may be barred from public assistanceprograms. The Senate immigration subcommittee marked up and approved the ImmigrantControl and Financial Responsibility Act of 1995 (S 269) on June 14, 1995 by avote of 4-2. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Alan Simpson (R-WY), deals primarilywith illegal immigration. Employers who hired illegal aliens could, if S269 is enacted, face doublepenalties if they also are found to have willfully or repeatedly violated theFair Labor Standards Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural WorkerProtection Act, or the Family and Medical Leave Act. The bill would add 300INS inspectors to enforce laws against alien smuggling and unlawful employmentof illegal immigrants, nearly doubling their number. Penalties for hiring illegal aliens would be increased. For a firstviolation, the fine would go from $250 to $1,000 per illegal alien hired. TheAdministration is given eight years to develop an automated system throughwhich US employers can determine whether newly hired workers are legallyauthorized to work in the US, adopting a recommendation of the CIR in September1994. The Justice Department supports testing an automated verification system,but it opposes the eight-year timetable to have such a system in place. Simpson's bill would also require Social Security numbers to be issued withstandardized national birth certificates and, when a person reaches 16 years,he/she must add a biological identifier to the Social Security card or similarwork authorization document, such as a fingerprint. A $1 border crossing feewas included in the subcommittee bill, with the moneys raised used to addinspectors to speed up legal crossings. The bill also authorizes the hiring of3,500 additional Border Patrol agents. Simpson's bill would also increase the responsibilities of an immigrant'ssponsor to financially support any immigrants they sponsor or petition to haveadmitted to the US. It would also make illegal immigrants ineligible for mostpublic assistance programs, whether funded by federal, state, or localgovernments. The subcommittee rejected the 50,000 per year cap on annual refugeeadmissions recommended by the CIR, but included a provision that requiresapplicants for asylum to file their applications within 30 days of arriving inthe US. On June 21, 1995, House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims chair LamarSmith (R-TX) held a press conference to announce that he would be introducingthe Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995 to reduce legal andillegal immigration. A hearing Smith's proposal, which deals with both legaland illegal immigration, was held on June 29. Under Smith's proposal, legal immigration would be reduced by aboutone-third to about 535,000 per year, and employers would be required to checkthe Social Security numbers of new hires. The US Border Patrol would bedoubled to 10,000, and aliens who enter the US illegally could be fined $50 to$250. Smith's 300-page proposal would maintain the three "front doors" thoughwhich legal immigrants enter the US, but each would be narrowed. Spouses andminor children of US citizens could continue to enter the US in unlimitednumbers (about 195,000 per year today); up to 85,000 spouses and minor childrenof legal permanent residents would be admitted each year; and up to 50,000parents of US citizens could immigrate, making family immigration 330,000 peryear. Smith's proposal would keep immigrants admitted for economic reasons atabout current levels by permitting the annual entry of 135,000 skilled workers,professionals, managers and investors. Up to 70,000 refugees, acceptedapplicants for asylum, and other humanitarian immigrants could be admitted eachyear. For five years, Smith would permit an additional 50,000 spouses andchildren of legal residents on waiting lists to enter the US. Immigrants who sponsor their relatives for admission would be legallyresponsible for ensuring that they do not become "public charges" during theirfirst seven years in the US. Becoming a public charge is defined as receivingmeans-tested public assistance for 12 or more months within seven years ofarrival. Smith's bill does not include a border-crossing fee or an agriculturalguest worker program. It does include a number of pilot programs, such as thecollection of departure records to determine how many tourists and othernon-immigrants do not depart as scheduled; the use of closed military bases todetain aliens; and the return of aliens apprehended to the interior of theircountries of origin. On June 29, a 54-member House Task Force headed by Rep Gallegly (R-CA)released a report that upped the ante in efforts to reduce illegal immigrationto the US. The Task Force's 150 page report recommends that illegal aliens bebarred from receiving all public benefits except for emergency health care, andthat, to be reimbursed, a hospital would have to notify the INS beforereleasing emergency unauthorized patients. Illegal alien children would bebarred from attending public schools, and aliens apprehended attempting toenter the US illegally would be subject to escalating fines and penalties,including forfeiture of their assets. The Senate approved a welfare reform proposal in June that goesfurther than the House welfare reform approved in March 1995 by making itharder for some immigrants to obtain Supplemental Security Income (SSI) evenafter they become naturalized US citizens. Under the Senate welfare proposal,an applicant for SSI would be asked if he or she had a sponsor. If theimmigrant had a sponsor, then the applicant for SSI would be deemed to haveavailable to him/her, in additional to his/her own income, the sponsor'sincome, for the purpose of determining eligibility for SSI payments. There is no current bar to legal immigrants applying for most publicassistance programs. Immigrants who apply are asked if they had a sponsor toget into the US and, if they did, they can be "deemed" under a few programs tohave access to their sponsors' income for three to five years. Welfare reformswould expand the number of assistance programs for which sponsors' income canbe deemed to be available to the immigrant applicant for assistance. The House welfare reform bill was criticized for denying federal assistanceunder five programs to legal immigrants until they become US citizens (MN,April 1995), but deeming under the House bill would end when the immigrantbecame a US citizen. The Senate bill, critics allege, would change the UStradition of equal treatment for all US citizens by creating two classes of UScitizens, those who were born in the US, and those who were naturalized UScitizens with sponsors. Sen. Simpson, who sponsored the amendment, argued that immigrants should beself supporting. There were 738,000 aliens receiving SSI in December 1994,including 16 percent from Mexico, 10 percent from the ex-USSR, seven percenteach from Cuba and Vietnam, and five percent each from China and thePhilippines. The US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal that the ClintonAdministration's decision to admit Cuban children from Guantanamo, and return170 Haitian children, amounted to illegal discrimination, thereby affirming theright of the US to return these Haitian children to Haiti. On June 27, 111Haitians, including 74 children were flown to the US. There are still 210Haitians in Guantanamo, including 48 unaccompanied children.

The CIR tackled the difficult trade-offs inherent in deciding how to selectimmigrants. If enacted, the CIR proposal would keep immigration at roughlycurrent levels for the next five years, but favor nuclear over extendedfamilies. The CIR recommended that Congress review immigration levels everythree to five years. After the new plan is fully phased in, family unification would remain theprimarily door for immigrants to enter the US, accounting for 400,000immigrants per year. Immediate family members of US citizens--spouses,children, and parents-- would gain admission upon application, but three of thefour existing family preferences would be eliminated--those that permit theunmarried adult sons and daughters, the married sons and daughters, and thebrothers and sisters of US citizens to gain priority to immigrate. The number of immigrants admitted because of their skills or to fill vacantUS jobs would be reduced from 140,000 to 100,000 per year. Most immigrantsadmitted for economic reasons would need a BS or equivalent. Instead of the current labor certification system, US employers who aregranted permission to bring immigrants into the US to fill job vacancies wouldhave to pay "substantial fees" that would be used to educate and train USworkers. US employers would also have to pay the immigrants at least fivepercent more than prevailing wages to ensure that their presence does notdepress the wages of US workers. Immigrants admitted with US offers of employment would be "conditional" fortwo years. They would become permanent immigrants only if they had the samejob or had good reason to change jobs after their two-year probation. The CIR recommended that the 10,000 immigrant visas currently madeavailable for unskilled immigrants--the visas that some Americans use to permittheir nannies or gardeners to become immigrants--be eliminated. The number of refugees admitted annually would be reduced from about120,000 annually to 50,000 per year. The CIR would soften the impact of the family unification changes byaccelerating the unification of nuclear families, making 150,000 additionalvisas per year available until the 1.2 million backlog of spouses and minorchildren waiting to join permanent immigrants in the US is eliminated (thecurrent second family preference). However, another 1.9 million foreigners onwaiting lists to enter as, e.g., the brothers and sisters of US citizens, or asthe married children of US citizens, could not immigrate under thesepreferences, which would be eliminated. The CIR also urged that efforts to integrate immigrants be stepped up bymaking widely available English language instruction and civicseducation. If the CIR's recommendations are adopted, about 30 percent of the 1993immigrants from the Dominican Republic, India, Jamaica, and Hong Kong wouldhave been excluded. About 12 percent of Mexican immigrants would have beenexcluded. President Clinton and most major newspapers endorsed the CIR'srecommendations--Clinton called them pro-family and pro-work, and urgedCongress to consider the CIR's recommendations as a road map to revampimmigration policy. Critics complained that the CIR was blurring the distinction between legaland illegal immigration. House majority leader Dick Armey (R-TX) argued thatlegal immigration is good for the US, and should be increased. Senator EdwardKennedy (D-MA) called the recommended cuts an unfair backlash in response toCalifornia's Proposition 187. Ethnic groups, churches, and some employers alsocriticized the CIR's recommendations, accusing the CIR of bowing toanti-immigrant pressures. Immigrants tend to be concentrated at the extremes of the education andincome spectrums--they are more likely than native-born residents to have notcompleted high school or to have completed college or more--and that those atthe bottom of the US job ladder are depressing wages for immigrants as well asnatives, helping to explain why the gap between the earnings of collegegraduates and high school dropout has risen by more than 50 percent over thepast 20 years. The CIR recommended in September 1994 that efforts to prevent illegalaliens form obtaining US jobs be stepped up, and that the US experiment withcomputer methods for employers to check whether newly-hired workers wereauthorized to work in the US. In February 1995, President Clinton endorsedthis recommendation, and Congress is considering proposals to implement pilotworker verification systems. Susan R.

Some Mexicans returnedyear after year, so only one to two million individuals participated. Simon argued for a guest worker program under which foreign workers wouldbe permitted to remain in the US for three to five years, with priority givento illegal alien workers already in the US. Guest workers would be encouragedto return to their countries of origin by wage and income tax deductions thatwould be returned as departure bonuses. According to Simon, the main obstacle to such a guest worker program is"lack of a political constituency," meaning politically weak restaurant ownersand farmers. California farmers developed a proposal in February 1995 to substitute anattestation procedure for the current certification procedure through whichforeign farm workers are legally admitted if US workers are not available tofill vacant US jobs. Under attestation, the employer opens the door to foreignworkers, and the door remains open until there is a complaint andadministrative action closes the door. Under certification, by contrast, thedoor to foreign workers remains closed until the government takes action toopen it. There is widespread opposition to calls for a new agricultural guest workerprogram. The CIR in June recommended against such a program: "a large scaleagricultural guest worker program...is not in the national interest...such aprogram would be a grievous mistake." The chairs of the Senate and Houseimmigration subcommittees, Simpson and Smith, have announced theiropposition. On June 23, President Clinton issued a statement opposing an agriculturalguest worker program, asserting that a guest worker program would increaseillegal immigration, displace US workers, and depress wages and workingconditions. Clinton said that "If our crackdown on illegal immigrationcontributes to labor shortages.... I will direct the departments of Labor andAgriculture to work cooperatively to improve and enhance existing programs tomeet the labor requirements of our vital agricultural industry consistent withour obligations to American workers." Clinton's statement highlights the difference between his view of opposingguest workers to protect low-wage US workers and that of Wilson, a candidatefor the Republican presidential nomination, who proposes to admit guestworkers, implicitly agreeing with farmers who say that US workers will not dofarm work. Western growers attacked Clinton's statement, arguing that theAdministration should review it before dismissing their proposal. The growersproposal, reportedly contained in a 35-page bill that Senator Kyl (R-AZ) isprepared to offer as an amendment to Simpson's immigration reform bill, wouldpermit employers to attest that they face labor shortages despite recruitingworkers at prevailing wages, to be recruited by associations, farmers or farmlabor contractors, and to be shifted from farm to farm as needed, and permitforeign workers to remain in the US for up to 36 months. Up to 30 percent ofeach worker's wages could be withheld and sent to the US consulate nearesttheir hometown for pickup, or forfeited by workers who failed to appear tocollect the withheld wages. Fear that western growers may nonetheless succeed in winning a guest workerprogram is based on their success in 1984-85. Clinton's Chief of Staff LeoPanetta, then in the House, and Governor Wilson, then a senator, successfullymade the arguments for agricultural guest workers over the strenuous objectionsof the chairs of the immigration subcommittees. The 1995 fight over farm workers is shaping up as a repeat of that of adecade earlier. It appears that Rep Gallegly (R-CA) and Kyl will play theroles played by Panetta and Wilson in the mid-1980s. Gallegly June 28 assertedthat 50 percent of California farm workers are illegal, and that Californiagrowers need a guestworker program. However, the mid-1980s argument that effective enforcement may lead tolabor shortages that must be met with special farm worker programs may not beas credible in the mid-1990s, since there is already a certification programthrough which farmers who cannot find US workers can request legal foreignworkers, and a history that includes worker abuse in agriculture may make ithard to approve an attestation program that relies on self-enforcement.

According to the INS,Gatekeeper has made it more difficult for individual aliens to enter the US, sothey are responding by using smugglers, attempting entry further east, andusing false documents in an effort to enter the US through the port ofentry. The INS will add agents to the border and staff at the ports of entry in astepped up effort to discourage illegal entries. The US Attorney's Officepromised to charge smugglers and document forgers with felonies rather thanmisdemeanors, meaning that those convicted could be sent to prison. The INS will also keep open border checkpoints in San Clemente andTemecula, which drew criticism from local officials. Some local officialsclaim the checkpoints do not halt illegal immigration, just divert it to thecanyons and fields of coastal and inland cities, where there are few borderagents. The INS likes the checkpoints because it forces smugglers to stopinstead of making a straight run to Los Angeles. Since Operation Gatekeeper began, the INS raided 53 so-called "drophouses," apprehending 2,500 migrants and 69 smugglers. Operation Gatekeeper was launched October 1, 1994 to deter illegal entriesin the area with the most legal and illegal crossings--the 20-some miles ofborder between San Diego and Tijuana. After eight months, two facts areclear--the number of persons apprehended along the southern border hasincreased, but more aliens being apprehended in previously little-used crossingareas, such as the easternmost sections of the San Diego area border, and inArizona. Apprehension data are always hard to interpret. Since Gatekeeper waslaunched, there have been two other significant events--Mexico has slipped intorecession, and California added over 200,000 new jobs. The INS has not released officially one indicator of which of these threefactors may be most important in explaining what is happening to illegal bordercrossings-- the recidivism rate, or the number of illegal aliens who have beenapprehended several times (each alien apprehended is fingerprinted).Unofficial reports are that about 30 percent of the 200,000 persons apprehendedand fingerprinted were caught before in the San Diego area. Apprehensions in the westernmost sector--Imperial Beach--were down 52percent in April compared to the same month last year. Arrests in Chula Vista,Brown Field and El Cajon--east of the port of entry--rose 34 percent, 126percent and 824 percent, respectively, in April compared with the same periodlast year. The INS has added 53 agents to El Cajon to deal with the increaseof illegal entries. These data can be interpreted to mean that Gatekeeper is having itsintended effect of discouraging illegal entries, or that the INS has notaltered the historical probability of being apprehended, which is about 30percent. If Gatekeeper is working, then the recidivism rate might be 100percent--no one slips through--or 0, if aliens are so discouraged that onlyfirst-timers make the attempt. If Gatekeeper has not changed the 30 percent probability of a typicalindividual being apprehended, then it must be determined whether the number ofattempts and apprehensions would have been higher but for Gatekeeper, orwhether, despite the investment in better border controls, the INS has notchanged the probability of apprehension. In a major three-part series, the Los Angeles Times on June 18-20 agreedwith the INS that there has not yet been a "tidal wave" of unauthorized Mexicanimmigrants headed to the US. The INS attributes the increased number ofapprehensions to the increased number of Border Patrol agents. The Los AngelesTimes added Prop 187 and the feeling in Mexico that California is no longer aeconomic and social beacon. Mexican researchers in Tijuana emphasize that the Gatekeeper has increasedthe cost of waiting to cross the border, and the cost of coyotes, making itharder for cash-strapped migrants to raise the $1,000 often needed to elude theBorder Patrol, get into the US, and find a job. Once in the US, migrantsreport increased difficulty finding jobs that offer steady work at more thanthe minimum wage. Most reports from Mexican villages and US work places suggest thatpotential and actual illegal entrants are aware of Gatekeeper, but that mostbelieve they can still enter the US and find jobs. There are reportedly anincreasing range of persons seeking US entry and jobs--well-educated teachersand engineers, some who went into debt to buy houses and consumer goods inanticipation of a continued economic boom, are reportedly joining small farmersin the trek north. Some of these better-educated Mexicans reportedly attemptto enter the US through ports-of-entry with false documents. In a profile of Jiquilpan, Michoacan, a township of 60,000 in westernMexico that has traditionally sent migrants to the US, the Los Angeles Timesreports that the networks or settlement of anchor friends and relatives in theUS over the past 50 years enabled residents to think of the US labor market asa safety valve. However, solo male seasonal migration became family emigrationin the late 1980s, and the settlement of especially younger families in the UShelps to explain both the backlash in California over the costs of immigration,and the fact that Mexican villages have disproportionately olderresidents. As in other countries with a tradition of seasonal and permanent migrationto the US, some in Jiquilpan complain that US culture and problems have invadedrural Mexico, and some residents think that, in an environment in which drugsand gangs have moved south, they may as well move north where at leastopportunities are better. In Lennox near the Los Angeles International airport, residents whooriginally came from Jiquilpan report that there are few jobs in nearby hotelsand restaurants for those who elude the Border Patrol. The 25,000 residentsare 95 percent Latino, and many complain that there are so many workers lookingfor jobs that many employers do not raise wages above the $4.25 hourly minimum,and do require workers to accept split shifts and unpredictable hours. Someresidents believe that stepped up border controls will encourage anyunauthorized migrants who succeed in making it to the US to settle here untilthey obtain legal status. Complaints about abuse by Border Patrol agents has increased. There havebeen as many reports of abuse in the first four months of 1995 as in all of1994. Human Rights Watch/Americas issued a report this month detailing a"climate of impunity" along the border. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) has introduced a bill that would require the INSto build two more fences near the border, and station two Border Patrol agentsevery 250 yards along this border. On May 19, the INS reported that it broke a $12 million per year businessthat supplied perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the counterfeit identificationproduced for unauthorized aliens. The business offered individuals theidentification needed to work "legally" for $120 to $180; this suggests monthlysales of identification to about 6,700 persons. The business operated fromvans in supermarket parking lots, with aliens dropping off pictures and money,and receiving identification within one hour. About 300 of the INS's 1,800 investigators enforce the employer sanctionsprovisions of IRCA within the US; there are 5,000 Border Patrol officers todeter illegal entry. The INS will ask Congress to reduce from the current 29to six the number of documents that can be provided to employers to verifyauthorization to work--passports, Social Security cards, drivers licenses, INSdocuments, and tribal documents.

In May, Californiasucceeded in consolidating the various challenges to Prop 187, and putting themon a fast track, so that the trial could start sooner. The National Lawyers Guild announced plans to use volunteer lawyers andstudents in California during the summer of 1995 to launch a "new civil rightsmovement" to oppose Prop 187 and to preserve affirmative action. A bill ispending in Congress to enact a national version of Proposition 187. Prop 187 is blamed or credited with re-opening debates over severalimmigrant-related programs, including bi-lingual education. Defenders ofteaching children in their native language, as mandated by the federalBilingual Education Act of 1967, see efforts to restructure immigrantchildren's education as another example of immigrant bashing. Supporters ofreform argue that, finally, parental pressure is challenging a flawedconcept. California currently spends about $400 million annually "extra"--forbonuses to teachers, aides, and materials-- to educate 1.2 million LimitedEnglish Proficient pupils--one-third of all LEP students are in California.Between 1981 and 1989, California required local school districts to teach LEPstudents primarily in their own language. The mandate has expired. About 80 percent of the LEP students in California speak Spanish. Eventhough the number of LEP students doubled in the state, the number whotransition to all-English classes has remained at about 60,000 per year. Tospeed up the transition to English-only classes, California permits schools whocannot find enough native language teachers to use English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) instruction. ESL-taught students generally make thetransition to regular classes within three years. Los Angeles Unified School District, with about half of California's LEPstudents, in 1988 developed a master plan for bilingual education that mandatesnative language instruction. However, there are only 11,000 fully credentialedbilingual teachers in California one for every 112 LEP students. The number ofnon-English-speaking students rose by 150 percent since 1985, while the numberof bilingual teachers increased by 30 percent. It is hard to get agreement on which teaching strategy is best. ESLstudents score higher than other students on English tests, but native-languagestudents score better on standardized tests of subject matter. On May 31, 1995, a California Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that allapplicants for driver's licenses must provide Social Security Numbers. Theruling upholds state laws intended to prevent illegal aliens from obtainingdriver's licenses. The California Civil Rights Initiative, which would end racial and ethnicpreferences in state university admissions and contracting, remains popularwith voters, even though it has not yet qualified for the ballot. A June pollfound that 56 percent of those polled plan to vote for the CCRI.

All of thosedetained had attempted to enter the US without documents, or with falsedocuments. On June 27, the INS announced that it was continuing its investigation ofEsmor. The investigation was expected to completed by June 30, but as a resultof the disturbance the scope of the investigation is being broadened. After the riot, all of the detained aliens were moved to county jails andto other detention facilities, and local officials upset at poor managementthreatened to prevent the jail's reopening. Esmor is one of about 20 US companies that have profited from theincreasing number of aliens detained because it receives from the INS $75 to$100 per detained alien per day. Guards are paid about $8 to $9 per hour tokeep aliens in detention, and food was reportedly provided under a $1.12 perperson per day contract. Esmor argued that the cause of the riot in New Jersey was the fact thataliens were detained more than six months due to INS failures to process themquickly, not conditions at the facility. The INS announced plans to begin random employer audits to check compliancewith the I-9 provisions of IRCA. In 1994, the INS opened 2,200 investigations of employers believed to behiring illegal aliens; 1,400 employers were assessed $11 million forviolations. The INS plans 4,400 investigations in 1995.

In 1991, 96,000 UScitizen babies were born to unauthorized mothers in California, including29,000 in Los Angeles County. The 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, adopted after the Civil War in1868, sought to clarify that the children of slaves were US citizens: "Allpersons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to thejurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the Statewherein they reside . . ." The US Supreme Court has never faced the questionof whether babies born to unauthorized alien mothers should be entitled to UScitizenship. There are two broad principles that govern birth citizenship--jussanguinis, citizenship based on blood, and jus soli, citizenship based on thesoil where the baby is born. The US and 12 other nations-- including Canada,Spain, Venezuela and Ireland -- follow both principles, thereby grantingcitizenship to people with either blood or soil ties to their countries. There continues to be a lively discussion of the record number ofnaturalization applications being filed by some of the 10 million alienseligible to become naturalized US citizens. Applications for US citizenshipare up 80 percent in 1995 versus 1994, and up 500 percent in Los Angeles. TheINS expects 725,000 naturalization applications in 1995, and 925,000 in1996. The consensus seems to be that the wave of naturalization applicationsis due to a combination of the fact that three million legalized alienshave become eligible to apply, that the INS required some of these aliens toreplace the green cards that demonstrate their immigrant status for a fee aboutequal to the cost of naturalization, and that Prop 187 in California andCongressional efforts to exclude non-US citizens from most federal welfareprograms illustrated as never before the benefits of US citizenship. Interviews with applicants for naturalization in Los Angeles indicate thatpersonal reasons dominate: such as a desire to join the CaliforniaHighway Patrol and ease of travel with a US passport. The 1150 INS examiners handle over five million petitions annually foritems that range from work permits and green cards to naturalization. Eventhough aliens pay fees for these services, backlogs are mounting, and user feesare piling up, because the INS has been under a hiring freeze. Applicants for naturalization complete an INS N-400 form, pay a fee, andthen wait to be scheduled for an interview with an INS examiner. After theexaminer certifies their knowledge of English and civics, naturalizationapplicants take the oath of allegiance before a federal judge. A survey that included 400 immigrants done for Fannie Mae found that 77percent of those who are not yet US citizens would like to become citizens,usually in order to vote. Immigrants define integration in terms of obtaininga college degree, getting involved in a child's school, and owning ahome. Immigrants who rent are more likely than native-born renters to want to buya home--about three times more immigrant renters than all renters said thattheir number one priority was to buy a home. Some interpret the immigrantdesire for home ownership as a sign that immigrants are more likely thannatives to be optimistic about the American economy and its future.

To raise revenue, the government in 1995 is planning its third major roundof privatization since the mid-1980s. The first two privatization roundsraised about $22 billion and, as part of the March 1995 bailout agreement,Mexico promised to raise $12 to $14 billion in 1995 through the sale ofstate-owned enterprises. Privatization has a mixed record in Mexico. The telephone monopoly wassimply transferred to private hands, and service failed to improvesignificantly. As smaller companies fail in the current round of bankruptciescaused by recession and high interest rates, there is a risk that largecompanies will swallow up their smaller competitors, increasing monopoly powerand inequality. Foreign investors continue to invest in Mexico. American companies thatreportedly doubled their long-term investments in Mexico to a cumulative $31billion since 1991, and almost $9 billion in 1995, are cutting profit marginsand taking other steps to maintain market share despite Mexico's recession. Indians, who are about 10 percent of Mexico's 92 million people, arereportedly being caught up in Mexico's drug wars. The Indians in the SierraMadre mountains 250 miles south of El Paso reportedly hide marijuana and opiumpoppy plants in their corn; drug violence in the region is increasing. In FY94, about 660,000 Mexicans legally entered the US as non-immigrantvisitors, up 10 percent over FY93. Almost 80 percent weretourist/business/shopper visitors, who have B1/B2/BCC visas. About 12,600 weretemporary workers or trainees, and 374 were NAFTA professionals--personspermitted to enter the US to conduct NAFTA-related business here. Formal negotiations for Chile's entrance to NAFTA began on June 7, 1995 inCanada. President Clinton has voiced support for fast-track legislation toauthorize Chile's accession to NAFTA by the end of 1995. Labor andenvironmental groups are pressing for side agreements. Under NAFTA's environmental side agreement, the Montreal-based NorthAmerican Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NACEC) has agreed toinvestigate the death of thousands of birds in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. Mexico's National Administrative Office (NAO), which investigatescomplaints of violations of labor laws in the US, asked the US government toinvestigate whether the US telephone company Sprint violated US labor laws whenit fired 177 Spanish-speaking employees in San Francisco in 1994. The US NAOconcluded in April 1995 that Sony Mexico had mishandled the firing of 45workers. Since NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, over 50,000 US workershave filed petitions asserting that they lost their jobs because of importsfrom Mexico or Canada, or because their US employers moved operations to one ofthese countries. In south Texas, where 1,400 so-called colonias have about 340,000residents, many recent Mexican immigrants, developers will be required toprovide water and sewer connections before re-selling land for housing. A 1989law permitted developers who had already established sub-divisions to expandthem without providing sewer and water hookups, saddling Texas with aninfrastructure bill estimated at $1 billion or more.

National Frontcandidates were also elected mayors of Orange and Marignagne, a suburb ofMarseilles. During victory rallies, National Front leader Le Pen promised toimplement "national preference" and "the French come first" policies inmunicipal jobs and subsidized housing. Critics argued that national preference will slow the integration ofimmigrants into French society. Several called for boycotts of cities withNational Front mayors. The German town of Ratstatt suspended links after 30 years with its Frenchsister city, Orange, after the election. Rastatt's Social Democratic mayorfelt there was no way to work with the "inhumane policies" of the NationalFront. The Belgian city of Liege also broke ties on June 20 with the Frenchcity of Toulon. In Dreux, a city of 37,000 west of Paris that is 28 percent immigrant, theNational Front's candidate for mayor used fear of immigration and crime to takethe lead in the race for mayor, but was not elected mayor. Many of theimmigrants in Dreux were imported to fill jobs that have since disappeared, sothat unemployment among immigrant youth who live in the high-rise apartmentsaround town is around 33 percent. In the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Grand, immigrant youth in early June wenton a rampage after a young Moroccan on a stolen motorbike crashed into trafficlights attempting to elude police. Most of the 57,000 residents are of NorthAfrican origin, and unemployment there exceeds the average rate of 12percent. When Romanian gypsies began to claim asylum in Lyon, anti-foreignersentiment reportedly rose. Many gypsies went to Lyon under the mistakenimpression that the city would provide refuge. The Socialist mayor in the cityof Saint-Priest, outside Lyon, resigned his job, claiming that the city wasoverburdened with poor immigrants. Nearly all the mainstream city councilmembers followed his example. There are an estimated two million gypsies inRomania, and many pay to be smuggled into Germany and France. On June 20, French police arrested 140 North Africans living in France whowere suspected of supporting groups seeking to overthrow the governments ofAlgeria and Tunisia. On June 22, the new French government announced that the minimum age wouldbe raised to $US 7.60 per hour, and that employers would not have to paysocial security and health insurance taxes on workers paid less than $US 1,533Fper month. These measures are intended to reduce the current 12.2 percentunemployment rate. The French government announced on June 12 that it may seek to extend thetrial phase for the Schengen accord, which abolished border controls amongseven EU member states. France was expected to implement the Schengen accordin March, 1995, but asked for a six month delay. One reason for the delay isthe disagreement between France with her neighbors, Belgium and Germany, aboutthe right to pursue suspected offenders in a neighboring country and a clashwith the Dutch about drug controls and security at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.

In response to a June 15 protest by 6,000 construction workers in Berlin,the German government agreed to consider a new law ensuring that foreignworkers are paid the same minimum wages on building sites as Germans. Theconstruction workers protested the employment in Berlin of foreignworkers--most from other EU countries such as the UK--at wages less thanprevailing German wages. The bill will be considered by the Parliament in the fall and should becomelaw next year. The law will remain in force for only two years and will applyto workers employed directly in construction, but not those in related tradessuch as electricians and painters. Foreign construction workers are cheaper because employers do not have tomake German social welfare and health contributions on their behalf, and theyare not covered by German laws that regulate work hours, severance pay, orminimum wages. According to one employer calculation, the total cost ofemploying a German construction worker is $57 per hour, about four times thecost of a Portuguese worker. Germany on August 1, 1994 allowed private employment agencies for the firsttime to place all kinds of workers in permanent jobs--previously, privateemployment agencies could only match managerial or professional persons such asmodels with jobs, and place unskilled workers in temporary jobs. By May 1995,some 2,200 private employment agencies had been certified to operate incompetition with the public Employment Service, but they made only 3,000placements between August and December 1994, far less than the pace needed tomake the projected 100,000 placements in their first year. During the first five months of 1995, almost 50,000 foreigners applied forasylum in Germany. Almost half of the 9,400 applications in May 1995 were fromex-Yugoslavia and Turkey. Some 200 churches have begun to shelter some rejected asylum seekers in aneffort to prevent their deportation. Reportedly, 2,000 asylum seekers havesought asylum in churches since 1984. There are between 60,000 and 100,000 Vietnamese living in Germany.Vietnamese who are denied work permits allegedly support themselves by sellingcontraband cigarettes on street corners in Berlin and other German cities.Fighting over the cigarette trade has led to the death of 19 people in Berlin.There have also been claims that the police are targeting foreigners forbeatings. This summer, Germany will deport the first 2,500 of 40,000Vietnamese who applied for asylum and were refused, and those whoentered, sometimes illegally, into Germany in the early 1990s. More than50,000 Vietnamese accepted $2,000 bonuses in 1990-91 and left forVietnam. Under the agreement between Hanoi and Bonn, Vietnam will accept the 40,000undocumented Vietnamese by the year 2000 and Bonn will pay Hanoi at least $72million to assist with their repatriation. During the two-year negotiations,the primary stumbling block was how much money Bonn would have to pay Vietnamto take back the illegal immigrants as soon as possible. The 40,000 Vietnamese scheduled for deportation were among the 100,000 whoonce resided in East Germany. Local officials and judges have granted eitherpermanent residence permits or "tolerance papers" to about 60,000 allowing themto stay and work in the reunified Germany. Some German legislators, including the government's special representativefor the affairs of alien residents, favor granting residency to the Vietnameseon political and humanitarian grounds. Eastern Europe is expecting many of the Vietnamese to flee there instead ofwaiting for repatriation to Vietnam. Eastern European government officials areespecially concerned about criminals, such as the Vietnamese mafia, that mayenter their countries. A Czech Republic diplomat said that Vietnamese are already starting tocross from Germany to the Czech Republic, where Vietnamese are believed to betwo percent of the total illegal immigrant population. Poles report that itonly costs a few hundred dollars to illegally cross the German-Polish border.

Asylum applicants currently get housing and food benefits ofabout L100 per week($160). Instead of cash payments, in the future they wouldbe provided these benefits in the camps. It is hoped that the camps will save money and deter illegal immigration,since some applicants currently disappear into the UK. The UK may imitateFrance and declare asylum camps to be extra-territorial in order to limit theappeal rights of residents. There were a record 32,821 asylum applications in the UK in 1994, and thereis a backlog of 55,000 applications. About 90 percent of asylum applicationsare rejected after an average 32 weeks. The UK is also considering tightening rules on marriages to persons seekingto immigrate. So-called marriages of convenience can be arranged for L1,000despite rules that make foreigners who enter the UK to join spousesprobationary immigrants for 12 months. Some immigration officials report thatspouses interviewed sometimes have trouble remembering and pronouncing eachothers' names. In 1993, there were that 19,000 immigrants admitted to the UK as a wife,husband or fiancé(e). Another 17,000 came to Britain for some otherreason, and then announced plans to marry. Britain's first Asian Bishop, who was born in Pakistan, urged the UK toopen itself to immigration to attract needed skills. The Bishop urged the UKto follow the lead of the US and Canada and plan for the annual admission offamily and economically-useful immigrants. Some 1,700 aliens were detected attempting to enter the UK clandestinely in1994. Police in Scotland in mid-June raided homes and workplaces in theirsearch for an estimated 4,000 mostly Asian illegal immigrants. Also in June, youths went on a rampage in Manningham, breaking shopwindows. This prompted a round of soul-searching that concluded that the AsianMuslim working class has been left behind by economic growth, and isincreasingly frustrated. Two police officers accused of killing an illegal Jamaican who was beingforcibly returned to Jamaica in July 1993 were cleared in June 1995. The20-year old woman arrived in Britain on a tourist visa to visit her mother, andthen married a 57-year old man whom she reportedly beat. He had her barredfrom his home after 10 weeks, which made her an illegal immigrant in the UK.After failing to leave as required by several deportation orders, she waspicked up by British police. There were many editorials in British paperscondemning the verdict and calling for better treatment of immigrants. A UK quarry hired 12 French workers when, despite 16,480 unemployed workersin Northleach, no British workers applied for the L4($6.50) per hour jobs.British employers complain of "a mismatch between what people expect and whatis available."

The report says thatalthough the number of refugees, displaced persons and other victims ofmilitary conflicts in Europe as a whole has dropped, in Russia the inflow ofimmigrants in the second half of last year rose by 39 per cent. The overall increase in the Russian population in 1994 was 810,000, nearlydouble 1993. The report cites armed conflicts as one of the reasons behind high levelsof population mobility in the former USSR. Other contributing factors are thechange in the status of a large number of ethnic Slavs in non-Slav countries,where they are subjected to discrimination, the continuing economic crisis, andvarying standards of living in the countries of the former USSR. Non-Estonians who wish to live in Estonia must apply for a residence permitby July 12, 1995, and as of early June, about 60 percent or 238,000 mostlyRussians had applied. About 650,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union have arrived in Israelsince September 1989. It is reported that hundreds of people in the ex-USSRare purchasing documents that enable them to pass themselves off as Jews andwin the right to emigrate to Israel. The going price for such documents isreportedly $800 per person. Former Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon in a June 23 editorial, calledon Israelis not to create a separate Russian party in Israel, because it willnot improve the situation of Russian immigrants in Israel. Sharon said thecountry is too focused on the Arab issue to make aliya a priority. Ariel Sharon, "A separate 'Russian' party is wrong," The Jerusalem Post,June 23, 1995.

In severalcases, aliens were told that they were in Italy, when they were actually inCroatia, or told they were in Germany but were actually in Hungary. Some Asian restaurants established by ex-guest workers have becomesmuggling fronts. In Prague, one Chinese restaurant in Prague reportedly has800 employees and eight tables. Aliens sometimes try to enter a country as members or sponsors of sportsteams. The International Center for Migration Policy Development in Viennacalculated that alien smugglers in Europe grossed between $100 million and $1.1billion in 1993; other estimates put annual receipts at $7 billionannually. When these aliens apply for asylum, most are housed in camps in EasternEurope that are often run with EU aid. Some 20,000 aliens have passed throughthe Kistarcsa camp outside Budapest since 1990. EU aid funds can be used to fight drug smuggling, but not migrantsmuggling. The major control device developed by western European governmentsare bilateral agreements with the countries of transit that require alienstransiting through e.g. Poland to Germany to be returned to Poland. Some humanrights groups argue that Eastern European governments do not have theinfrastructure to accurately determine who is a refugee. The International Organization of Migration (IOM) reported June 16 thatyoung women from eastern and central European are migrating to western Europein large numbers as prostitutes, that prosecution of smugglers and pimpssentences was difficult, and that sentences for those convicted were light.The four major countries of origin for these prostitutes are the Czech Republicand Poland, while Russia and Ukraine. There were a net 1.2 million immigrants arriving in the 15 EU counties in1992, primarily from the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, Poland andRomania. Concerned with the influx of immigrants from its southern flank, theEuropean Union agreed on June 27 to spend $6.1 billion over the next five yearsto stabilize the economies of the EU's southern neighbors. EU leaders alsocalled for more progress in negotiating trade agreements with Morocco, Israel,Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. France has used its six month's as the EU's rotating president to bringMediterranean issues to forefront. Spain takes over the EU presidency on July1 and is expected to continue pushing for firm links with its Mediterraneanneighbors. An EU-Mediterranean conference will be held in Barcelona inNovember. Following an accident that left him 80 percent disabled, a Turkish driverwho worked for several years in the Netherlands has been ordered home by theEuropean Union Court of Justice. The court ruled that since he is no longerable to hold a job in the Netherlands, Dutch authorities are not obligated toprovide him with a residence permit. The court made the same ruling in thecase of retired workers. "Invalid Turkish Driver Ordered to Return Home, Transport Europe, June 22,1995.

Turkey is attracting immigrants from the Middle East, North Africa, theformer Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland.Official data put the number of foreign residents in Turkey at 72,905. A study by the Center for Turkish Studies in Essen, found that whileofficial data indicate that 1,861 Iraqi and 4,234 Iranian migrants wereregistered as immigrants in Turkey since the Iran-Iraq war in 1991, there are5,000 Iraqis in Istanbul alone, and over 200,000 Iranians in Turkey. Officialdata indicate 68 Algerian residents in Turkey but, in 1994 some 22,000Algerians entered Turkey as tourists, and only 21,000 were recorded as havingleft the country. United Nations agencies put the numbers of Bosnian migrants in Turkeyfollowing the disintegration of Yugoslavia at 15,000, and the number ofAbkhazians escaping civil war in Georgia at 30,000. Turkey does not impose visa restrictions on Romanians, Croatians, Albaniansand Macedonians. Other former East Bloc nationals enter the country onthree-month tourist visas; some stay on to seek employment, often illegally. Turkey, the fastest growing member of the OECD in the mid-1980s, isfloundering economically. Exports totaled $41 billion in 1994, excluding anestimated $4 billion in "unofficial" Turkish exports to the ex-USSR that arecarried by women who engage in "luggage trade," arriving in Istanbul withsuitcases stuffed with cheap Russian goods, and leaving with textile andleather goods from Turkey. Turkey has been trying for a decade to be welcomed into the European Union,but its human rights record may prevent EU approval of a customs unionscheduled to go into effect on January 1, 1996. The European Parliament hasthreatened to withhold its approval of the customs union unless Turkey's humanrights record improves by October 1995. Article 8 of Turkey's anti-terrorism law forbids any verbal or writtenthreats to Turkey's territorial integrity. This law is used to prosecuteTurkish separatists and their sympathizers, and those charged are tried insemi-military courts.

The US has endorsed the Comprehensive Plan of Action, the plan to returnthe Vietnamese, but Republicans in Congress introduced legislation in theForeign Aid bill to stop forced returns and to offer up $30 million to 20,000of the Vietnamese in the camps visas to enter the US. The House approved thebill on June 8. The Senate has not acted upon the bill and President Clintonhas announced his opposition to the measure. The UNHCR and Asian governments say that the House action isresponsible for the refusal of Vietnamese to return voluntarily. SomeVietnamese told refugee counselors that they did not want to return to Vietnamand would await the final outcome of the US legislation. The US sent leafletsdistributed to the refugees in Hong Kong and other Asian countries by the UNHCRto urge them to return home. Malaysian and United Nations officials have halted talks about the 4,000refugees who refuse to return to Vietnam. On June 5, more than 4,000Vietnamese refugees, some armed with knives and sticks, tore down a section ofthe fence that surrounds the Sungai Besi transit camp on the outskirts of theMalaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. The refugees crossed a major highway toprotest their repatriation following Malaysia's decision to close the camp byAug. 31. There has been some discussion by Malaysian government officials ofkeeping the camp open past the August deadline for mandatory repatriation. On June 8, police used tear gas to stop an eight-hour protest by Vietnameserefugees at the High Island detention center in Hong Kong. The violencestarted when police tried to move 94 Vietnamese from the center to another siteprior to repatriation. In the aftermath of the riots, the Hong Kong government put on hold theremoval of any Vietnamese from detention centers while it reconsiders itsrepatriation policy. Plans to move 100 people from the High Island camp inlate June have been canceled until at least the end of July. Nearly 1,000 Vietnamese have been returned voluntarily from Hong Kong sofar this year. There are still about 500 migrants still in detention centerswho refuse to be repatriated to Vietnam. Chinese asylum-seekers stormed a West Australian detention center, injuringfour security officers, on June 11. The reason for the fighting was unclear,but seemed to center around two boat people who arrived in Australia in thesame boat. Vietnam has exported 14,000 workers since the first 811 workers were sentabroad in 1992, according to the Labor Ministry. The major countries ofemployment for Vietnamese guest workers are South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan,Malaysia, Lebanon and Libya. These data exclude the guest workers sent toEastern Europe before 1989. Vietnam is hoping to increase its labor exports; 37 of Vietnam's stateenterprises are authorized to send their workers overseas.

The new law calls for stricter monitoring of thepolicies of labor importing countries to ensure that they have adequate laws toprotect migrant workers. The bill also tightens regulations on the recruitmentof labor in the Philippines and requires workers to register with Philippineembassies overseas. It is not clear how effective the new law will be. Nearly half of theestimated 4 million Philippines' overseas workers are illegal, since they leavefor overseas jobs without the proper documentation. Many may fail to registerwith Filipino authorities abroad. The Philippine Labor Department has begun to station agents at Manila'sairport to detect Filipino workers who are attempting to go abroad illegallyfor employment. Many Filipinos go as tourists to third-country destinations,and then travel to the country in which they hope to work. In a related action, the Philippine Senate ratified the UN Convention onMigrant Workers. The Philippines signed the convention in 1993, and completedthe ratification process the last week of May, 1995. Sixteen more countriesneed to ratify the convention before it comes into force. An advisory commission appointed by President Ramos after a Filipina maidwas hanged by Singapore in March (April MN) recommended that the Philippinesstop the export of maids to "certain Middle Eastern and Asian nations." Thecommission is now on a 15-nation tour to investigate the problems of Philippineoverseas workers. In 1994, an estimated 5,000 Filipina maids left the Gulf states complainingof employer abuse. The commission asked the government to start blacklistingemployers who mistreat overseas workers. The Philippine Overseas Workers Welfare Administration reported receivingmore than 10,000 complaints from overseas workers last year, including 156cases of physical mistreatment and 18 rapes in Kuwait, 32 physical abuse casesand 11 rapes in Saudi Arabia and 33 cases of mistreatment and six rapes inOman. Since April 1995, state-owned Kuwaiti airlines returned at no chargeFilipina maids who charge that they were abused by their Kuwaiti employers.There are about 20,000 Filipina maids in Kuwait, and 20 left in April, 54 inearly June, and 44 in late June. There are an estimated four million Filipinos working abroad, includingperhaps 800,000 women, and 600,000 in the Gulf states. With the government discouraging overseas workers, remittances fromoverseas workers, a major boost to the economy, are expected to decline. ThePhilippine government hopes to offset the decline in remittances with foreigninvestment in the Philippines. A Philippine political strategist predicts thatit will take three to five years for a shift in the labor deployment rate to beevident. Data showed that during the years when the Philippine economy wasexperiencing a downturn, income from migrant workers kept the country's economyafloat. Income from abroad increased by 16 per cent, from 7.1 billion pesos inthe first quarter of 1994, to 8.2 billion pesos in early 1995. The Philippines has launched an amnesty program for illegal aliens whoentered the country before June 20, 1992. Under the program, illegal alienscan pay about $10,000 and receive a permanent resident status. The Philippineshopes to earn $39 million from the legalization program, suggesting that 40percent of the estimated 100,000 illegal aliens in the country will legalizetheir status. Most of the first applicants have been from China andTaiwan. Charles Wallace, "Philippine Maids Face Cruel Lives," Los Angeles Times,June 26, 1995.

Singapore is running a series of commercials in Hong Kong that show happyyoung families enjoying the tropical oasis. The series is designed to attractwealthy Hong Kong residents to the Singapore. The Singapore government isconfident that its strong educational system will attract Hong Kong residents. There is speculation that Singapore would like the Hong Kong residents tosettle in Singapore because its own affluent and well-educated Chinesepopulation is having fewer children. Singapore has almost no unemployment. Some Hong Kong residents are reluctant to settle in a city-state considereddull and tough on law and order. Of the 40,000 immigration applicationsaccepted by the Singapore government, only 6,500 have taken up residency inSingapore. Singapore allows qualified Hong Kongers to wait five years before they mustphysically migrate, which may account for the low residency rate. Thegovernment also offers residency to the parents of Hong Kong students studyingin Singapore. In a bid to attract more Hong Kong investors prior to 1997, Taiwan hasrelaxed its immigration restrictions, reducing in half the required investmentrate. Ronald Skeldon, a Hong Kong University geography professor, says thatHong Kong residents prefer Canada to Taiwan. Between 1,000 to 3,500 Hong Kong people settle in Taiwan each year, manyapplying on the basis of family reunification. Many Hong Kong residents are applying to migrate to several countries, suchas the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, in addition to Singapore andTaiwan. Because these Hong Kong migrants are well-off, they will see whichcountries accept them before making a decision. Canada continues to be thefavorite destination, with more than 40,000 new arrivals from Hong Kong. Australia reports that the number of Hong Kong-born people in the countrydoubled between 1985 and 1991. Australia is now has the second largest sourceof Hong Kong emigrants, after Britain. According to a 1991 census, of the 278,000 people who left Hong Kong forCanada, the United States and Australia between 1985 and 1991, more than aquarter settled in Australia. There were 57,510 Hong Kong-born residents inAustralia at the time of the 1991 Census, up from 28,293 in 1986 and 15,717 in1981.

Governor Chris Patten said that there aresharp differences on how the hiring of foreign workers affects the unemploymentrate in Hong Kong. He is considering establishing a tripartite committee withrepresentatives of government, employers and labor to manage the laborimportation plan which is now run solely by the government. A 13-point plan was presented during the summit which included stepping upretraining, doubling the immigration task force to 100 to deal with illegalimmigrants, and stiffer action against illegal workers. The unemployment issue has united the pro-Beijing and liberal camps here,which organized signature campaigns as well as a noisy mass protest outside thegovernment building where the summit was held. Hong Kong currently allows a maximum of 25,000 semi-skilled foreign workersinto the territory at any time. This excludes the 120,000 foreign domesticworkers, and thousands of foreign construction workers at the Chek Lap Kokairport site. Hong Kong's unemployment rate jumped to a nine-year high of three percentin the second quarter of 1995, prompting union leaders to press for an end tothe employment of foreign workers. The government says the actual number ofimported workers is less than one-third the number of unemployed locals. Anestimated 78,000 Hong Kong residents were unemployed in the first quarter of1995. Hong Kong has quotas for various types of foreign workers: foreignprofessionals are not restricted by quota, but there is a limit of 25,000semi-skilled workers, and 17,000 construction workers. In addition, there areabout 120,000 domestic foreign workers in Hong Kong. Unions claim that, withillegal workers, there are a total of 300,000 foreign workers in HongKong. In 1989, Hong Kong upped the foreign worker quotas to keep the territorycompetitive, but so many factory jobs have moved to southwestern China thatunemployment among garment and other manufacturing workers is reported to bealmost 10 percent. Hong Kong employers have permitted workers imported for onepurpose, for example as maids and gardeners, are being used in other jobs, asdrivers or street sales persons, or even factory workers. Patten announced that illegal foreign workers will be the target of 92inspectors of the Immigration Department in order to create jobs for unemployedlocal workers. During the first 24-hour period on June 16-17, 88 illegalimmigrants were arrested during a territory-wide sweep. Illegal foreign workers can be fined $5,000 and jailed for two years. In1994, 919 Hong Kong employers, and 2,906 foreign workers, were fined.Increased employer penalties are expected to be announced by the governmentthis year. The daily quota for the number of Chinese allowed to immigrate to Hong Kongwill be raised on July 1, 1995 from 105 to 150. Most of the additionalimmigration slots are reserved for children who are not of school age, i.e.,those less than five and 16 to 21, to minimize pressures on Hong Kongschools. After July 1, 1997, a Chinese person born outside Hong Kong can reside inHong Kong if one of his or her parents was a Hong Kong resident at birth.There are believed to be 64,000 such children in China.

A panel convened by theMinistry of Health and Welfare recommended that employers and permanent foreignworkers share the cost of health insurance premiums on a 50-50 basis, but didnot say exactly how illegal workers would be covered. This is a policy shiftfor the Health and Welfare Ministry, who had previously insisted that healthinsurance coverage for illegal workers would encourage them to stay. The Japanese Supreme Court asked lower courts to translate writtenindictments for foreign defendants into languages they can understand. Thecourt hopes that this will help protect the human rights of foreign criminaldefendants, who are increasing in number. Foreigners are 4 percent of thosearrested for criminal offenses. In 1994, over 65,000 foreigners were deported from Japan, a seven percentdecrease over 1993. The Japanese government attributed the decline to arecession and tighter control over illegal workers. Of the 59,352 foreigners found to be working illegally in 1994, 17,130 wereSouth Korean, followed by nationals of Thailand, Malaysia, China, Iran andother Southeast Asian countries. Illegal workers from China, Peru and Burmarose most sharply. The most common type of jobs held by illegal workers wereconstruction, factory or entertainment.

Migrants living under bridges sometimes rob local residents,and are victims of robbery. Police who arrest migrants for vagrancy know that many will be sentenced toproduce goods for three to six months in prison factories. The Chinesegovernment is considering holding a national conference on its new efforts tomanage migrant laborers. The "floating population," as the Chinese government refers to migrants,has affected economic development and social stability. According to agovernment spokesperson, the Chinese plan to strengthen registration and publicsecurity control. The increased number of rural Chinese migrants, many of whom belong tominority groups, has heightened awareness of their cultural differences andeconomic disadvantages. The government has launched an affirmative actionplan: exempting minorities from the strictures of the one-child birth controlpolicy and allowing them to have three or more children, opening up neweducational opportunities for them and providing better access to governmentjobs. Between 1982 and 1990, the minority population grew by more than 35percent to 91.2 million. Guandong Province has emerged as a safe haven for people fleeing povertyand forced birth control of the Jiangxi Province. Migrants often live on boatsto evade census registration, with three or four children earning a livingfishing. In northern Hunan, local government officials have started postingwarnings that boat people on Dongting Lake must report four times per year tolocal clinics for pregnancy checks or face steep fines. These internal Chinese boat people tell stories of those found withoutcensus or marriage cards having their boats destroyed or confiscated. Otherstell of family planning officials threatening to blow up houses if the womendid not submit to sterilization. On June 13, the Chinese government announced that it would reinforce itscontrols to halt illegal immigration, especially into the southern regions ofthe country. More than 20,000 foreigners enter China illegally every year,mostly from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, plus a small number of illegalimmigrants from Africa and Russia. In the past year, police detained 12,000illegal immigrants in the Yunnan province and the autonomous region of Guangxi.

Malaysia has an unemployment rate of less than three percent, and a recentpoll of 150 local, foreign and joint-venture companies reported that 62 percentof the foreign firms in Malaysia face labor shortages, but only 28 percentconsidered the problem serious. One-third of the foreign and joint-venturecompanies might shift some of their operations to other countries if laborshortages continue. Thirty-three percent of the companies in the manufacturing sector indicateda need for the government to play a greater role in upgrading training,productivity and setting up vocational institutes, and 28 per cent wanted arelaxation of the restrictions governing the importation of foreignlabor. Many of the electrical and electronics foreign firms in Malaysia recommendthat the government legalize illegal foreign workers in the country toalleviate the labor shortage. When the government recently raided Bangladeshi housing areas, there werereported to be shortages of gas station attendants. Tighter restrictions onIndonesian migration reportedly led to farm labor shortages. There are reportedly 850,000 legal foreign workers in Malaysia, including100,000 maids, and 400,000 illegal foreign workers. Instead of hiring more foreign workers, Malaysia would like to raise the 47percent female labor force participation rate, to increase the number of parttime jobs, and to make unemployed workers in depressed regions more mobile, sothat they could move to where jobs are. In addition, the Malaysiangovernment's Seventh Plan (1996-2000) provides M$1 billion to build seven moretraining centers which are expected to add 10,000 skilled workersannually. Malaysian trade unions note that several hundred thousand Malaysiansmigrate overseas for jobs, and that the solution to the labor shortage is toraise wages. In southern Malaysia, Malaysians commute to jobs in Singapore,while foreign workers fill in behind them in Malaysia. Foreign workers who change jobs in Malaysia can be charged up to $US122,while employers who hire illegal foreign workers can be fined up to $US 4,098,plus face five years imprisonment. Some foreigners reportedly enter Malaysiaas maids, and then go to work in higher-wage restaurants, grocery stores, andoffices. Malaysia and the Philippines agreed to develop an identification system forlegal Filipino workers. The Philippine government estimates that there arefour to six million Filipinos in 130 countries, and new laws grant theseoverseas Filipinos new tax exemptions and protections. The Philippine government asked Malaysia to grant partial amnesty for itsillegal workers in the country so that they could be properly registered. ThePhilippine government said it will welcome back any illegal workers who wish toreturn home. The Maybank of Malaysia, Philippine National Bank and Indonesia's Lippobankhave implemented a joint electronic remittance system. The system enablesIndonesian workers in Malaysia to remit money for a $4 fee at any of theMaybank branches, to be collected at any Lippobank branch in Indonesia. The three banks hope that the new system will funnel the money away fromunregulated couriers, who sometimes charge high fees and use arbitrary exchangerates.

Kuwaitis are currently 17 percent of thecountry's labor force. Guest workers in most Gulf states are dependent on sponsors, who pledge toemploy them, arrange work permits for them, and who must give them permissionto leave legally. Foreign workers are charged a $660 tax to changesponsors. Egyptians are guaranteed a minimum wage of $233 per month, but manycomplain that they are cheated, but have no one to complain to. Asian guestworkers are believed to be willing to work for lower wages. There are about 200,000 legal Egyptians in Kuwait among an estimated 1.8million residents. In addition, there are 10,000 to 50,000 illegal Egyptianresidents in Kuwait, who wait in coffee houses for construction and similarcasual jobs. Egyptian workers who are caught in Kuwait with expired work permits aredetained and then deported to Egypt at Egypt's expense; foreign workers arerequired to repay the Egyptian government upon their return. There are about 100 professional Russian belly dancers in Cairo, and theyare threatening to displace Egyptians because, as non-Muslims, they can dancewith fewer clothes and most have been trained in dance. Most of the Russianssigned six-month contracts with Moscow agencies for fees that may be only halfwhat Egyptian dancers earn.

They is also an increase of 500 for business migrants and3,000 in the special category for Chinese nationals who were allowed to stay inAustralia after the Tiananmen Square massacre. The immigration minister had asked the Australian Cabinet for an increaseof 10,000 immigrants, but was turned down of because of the potential impactson the labor market. According the immigration minister, the increase inbusiness migrants reflects the "internationalization of the economy," andAustralia's needs to take advantage of resources, skills and networks ofbusiness migrants. The government will plan to accept 83,000 migrants in 1995-96 compared with76,500 places in FY 94-95. The increase is restricted to the family reunion(51,000 in total), skilled migration (30,800) and special eligibility (1200)categories. There will be no increase in 1994's 13,000 slots forrefugees. A Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research report saysthat the number of new immigrants to Sydney has jumped from 38 percent of thetotal intake in 1984-85 to 44 percent in 1993-94. The next most populardestination for new immigrants in Victoria, with 23 percent of new arrivals.Up to half of the immigrants who arrived in Sydney were not in the workforce in1993-94; of those eligible to work, 11 percent did not have a job. The Australian government has raised the visa application fees from A$400to $550, and from A$1,715 to $2,430 for business migrants. This will earn thegovernment an extra A$13 million. The government also approved an increase inspending for migrant services of $40 million. The Australian Opposition claim that the government has "unleashed anunprecedented attack" on migrant communities. The opposition claims thegovernment does not provide equitable access to services for ethniccommunities, and that cuts in health and education have augmented the problems. An Opposition White Paper further claims that Australia's industrialrelations policies leave immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. Theopposition called on the ethnic communities to comment on the paper by August18, so that a new policy could be considered at the ALP state conference inOctober, 1995.

The ILO estimates that there are 200million children ages 10 to 14 employed world wide, making children almost 10percent of the world's 2.5 billion workers. One reason why the number of children working in carpet, match, and otherfactories in India is expected to increase is because India recently changedeconomic policies to stress exports. The largest single employer of childrenin India is agriculture, where an estimated 25 million are employed, and thesecond largest employer of Indian children are services that range from hotelsto household maids. But there are also believed to be over five million Indianchildren employed in labor intensive industries that range from carpet weavingto cutting gems to making soccer balls. Families in areas such as Bihar, where incomes average less than $100annually and seasonal migration to stone quarries and brick kilns is common,sending children to make carpets in the shade is considered better by somefamilies than to have them crushing rocks in the sun. In response to actionagainst child labor, carpet makers have begun to use subcontractors to producecarpets in remote villages. The Indian government's Rugmark program, whichcertifies that children were not employed to make carpets, has three inspectorsto keep children away from looms in 2,000 villages, many inaccessible byauto. Child labor, and migrant child labor, raises questions about how fargovernments and international organizations should go to intervene insituations in which families look to children to provide up to one-third offamily income. The Indian Commission on Labour Standards concluded that industrializedcountries should help fund the cost of eliminating child labor by the year2000. Nepal will begin penalizing carpet weavers who employ children by askingwestern carpet-importing countries to deny them tariff concessions. TheNepalese government's decision was in part a response to the falling sales ofcarpets after Western buyers stopped purchasing products made by companies whoemploy children. Bangladesh, on the other hand, condemned reports by the Washington,DC-based Child Labor Coalition that Bangladesh garment manufacturers employchildren. The Bangladesh government plans to send a high-level delegation tothe US to detail the measures the garment makers have taken to eliminate childlabor from the industry. In response, the CLC has agreed to suspend a boycott against Bangladesh, sothat new negotiations can begin between the garment makers and the exportersassociation. Negotiations between the US, United Nations, exportersassociation, and CLC resumed in June. The US and France want to put labor standards, including child labor, onthe agenda of the World Trade Organization. Germany has agreed with India thatnon-trade issues, such as child labor, should not be raised that the WTO. Paul Iredale, "Indian Pressure Group Frees Bonded Child Workers," Reuters,June 23, 1995.

Lamar Smith (R-TX), and co-sponsored by 59representatives. The measure will be considered by the full House JudiciaryCommittee in September. The measure deals with both legal and illegal immigration. It would reducelegal immigration by eliminating current slots reserved for the adult brothersand sisters of US citizens. The bill seeks to reduce illegal immigration by doubling the number of INSinvestigators, doubling the Border Patrol within the next five years, andstiffening penalties for illegal use of counterfeit government documents.Under the bill, states would be reimbursed for the costs of jailing illegalimmigrants, including those in county jails, and providing emergency healthcare for illegal aliens. The bill does not include a border crossing fee. The House Appropriations Committee attached an amendment to an omnibusappropriations bill that would eliminate funding for inland immigrationcheckpoints near San Clemente and Temecula and move the INS agents whocurrently operate them to the border. The change would be effective Oct. 1,1995, when FY 1996 begins. There are 35 active INS checkpoints in theUS. The Border Patrol believes that the checkpoints are effective and asked forfull funding to keep them open all the time. More than 150,000 aliens wereapprehended at the checkpoints during the past three years. According to somereports, 62 percent of all illegal entrants use smugglers to cross theUS-Mexican border, and then pay up to $300 in additional fees to be smuggledpast the active checkpoints. At the end of June 1995, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) presented a list of 100proposals to House Speaker Newt Gingrich with the promise that, if they wereadopted, illegal immigration would be drastically reduced. The 54-member HouseTask Force recommended that children born to illegal aliens in the US no longerbecome US citizens automatically, and that hospitals wishing to be reimbursedby the federal government notify the INS before releasing suspected illegalalien patients. Critics of these proposals worry that it could lead to the creation of apermanent underclass of sub-citizens--immigrants who live in the US, but aredenied public schooling and government benefits. Gallegly's task force also recommended that illegal aliens apprehended inthe US be fined $250 the first time caught, forfeit their assets the secondtime, and face time in jail for a third apprehension. The INS currentlyfingerprints and photographs the 2,000 illegal aliens apprehended every day inSan Diego and, with an estimated 20 percent or 400 repeater offenders,implementing this proposal would soon require far more than the 500-beddetention facility currently available. Gallegly recommended the use of closedmilitary bases to hold aliens. Joan Lowry, "Pushing to limit US birthright," San Francisco Examiner, July23, 1995.

On July 5, 1995, the INS reported that these newregulations have been successful in deciding quickly whether an alien needsprotection in the US. The Clinton administration planned to adjudicate 150,000 asylumapplications by September 1995. In the first eight months of FY95, the INScompleted more than 61,000 cases, compared to the 35,000 cases it adjudicatedduring the same period last year. There is a backlog of over 400,000 requestsfor asylum awaiting INS decisions. Aliens seeking asylum enter the US, and then file a form in person or bymail that asserts that the individual seeking to stay in the US would facepersecution in his or her country of citizenship. The number of asylum seekers has climbed, and reached almost 150,000 inFY94. About one-fourth of all these asylum seekers are Guatemalans, one-eighthare Salvadorans, and one-twelfth are Chinese. Another 20,000 asylum claimswere filed by aliens who were in the process of being excluded from or deportedfrom the US. About 20 percent of the aliens who ask for asylum are grantedpermission to remain in the US. The reforms announced in January 1995 have resulted in decisions on mostnew cases filed within 10 to 14 days after applicants are interviewed by asylumofficers. Asylum applicants are not eligible to work legally in the US untilat least 180 days after their application has been filed, or when it isapproved, whichever comes first. One year after being granted asylum, aliensare entitled to immigrant status. To deter fraudulent claims for asylum, the INS is increasing detention andspeeding up the deportation of those denied asylum. Asylum officers reportthat, in many instances, individuals use the same words they have been coachedto repeat to describe their persecution. These measures have decreased asylumclaims by 14 percent from January to May. The INS has the authority to detain persons seeking asylum who do not haveany immigration documents. Under legislation pending in Congress, applicantsfor asylum who arrive in the US without documents and request asylum would beexcluded from the US while their claims are processed. Aliens in the US wouldhave to request asylum within 30 days of arriving in the US--today, some alienswait until they are apprehended to apply for asylum. In 1994, about 38,000 Cubans and 26,000 Haitians attempted to come to theUS in boats to apply for asylum. To prevent their entry and process asylumapplications, the US established a safe haven for them in Guantanamo. One hundred and eight Chinese refugees from the Golden Venture, which ranaground near New York harbor in June 1993, are being held in York, Pennsylvaniawhile the INS determines whether they will be granted political asylum. Onlyfive of the York detainees have been granted asylum, 26 have returned to China.Some York residents hold a vigil for one hour every Sunday to demonstrate theirsolidarity with the Chinese refugees. On July 19, four of the Golden Venture refugees, testified before the HouseSubcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. The women said thatthey were forced to undergo abortions or sterilizations under unsanitaryconditions. All four have been denied political asylum in the US. Legislation that grant asylum to persons forced to undergo abortion orsterilization was passed by the House and is pending in the Senate. PresidentClinton has threatened to veto the measure. The INS detains over 80,000 asylum seekers annually, often in privatefacilities operated by for-profit companies. On June 18, some 300 asylumseekers being held in a privately-operated detention center in Elizabeth, NewJersey rioted, alleging that they were being mistreated. On July 21, the INSagreed with the asylum seekers, and canceled the company's five-year, $51million contract to operate the facility. The INS found that the facility wasrun by poorly trained and abusive guards, who were left unsupervised by theirsuperiors. An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said that similar abusescan be found at other detention facilities around the country. INS CommissionMeissner believes that the problems at the New Jersey facility were an isolatedincidence and plans to continue to use private detention centers. Esmorcontinues to detain aliens for the INS in the Seattle area. In Florida, several nurseries have complained that if their Salvadoranworkers, some of whose work permits expire in September, 1995, leave, they willface labor shortages. Some have worked for 10 or more years for oneemployer. The INS is stepping up its efforts to deport criminal aliens, persons whocommitted crimes in the US as illegal aliens (or became illegal aliens becauseof the crime) served their sentences, and are now being deported. In 1986,2,000 criminal aliens were deported; in 1995, 22,000, and in 1996, the INSplans to deport 58,000.

Opponents arguedthat the measure unconstitutionally interfered with the federal government'sjurisdiction over immigration policy. Opponents argued that only the federal government, and not the stategovernment, can take steps designed to reduce illegal immigration. Accordingto one anti-187 attorney, "California has no business, no business at all,saying who may come in and who may go out." The state of California countered that the purpose of Prop. 187 was todecide how scarce state resources should be allocated among persons who applyfor benefits under state-run programs. The state offered the judge a draftletter that would be given to suspected illegal aliens that advises them toeither leave the US, or contact the INS to resolve their legal status. The judge has several options, including declaring part or all of Prop. 187unconstitutional, and scheduling a trial on the entire initiative or thesections deemed constitutional. That trial is currently scheduled forSeptember. If the judge declares Prop. 187 unconstitutional, state lawyers say theywill file an appeal with the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The group thatsponsored Prop. 187 has threatened to offer a $10,000 reward to anyone who canprove that the judge personally hired an illegal alien; Prop. 187 proponentsbelieve that the judge personally opposes Prop. 187. Legal observers predict the case will reach the US Supreme Court in 1996 or1997. Several hundred college and law students are participating in a CaliforniaFreedom Summer campaign to take testimony from immigrants that Prop. 187 hasled to or increased discrimination against them. The first Freedom Summer wasin 1964, when college students flooded Mississippi to register Blackvoters. Laura Mecoy, "Public not final judge of Prop. 187's merits," SacramentoBee, July 31, 1995.

Under theCompliance Alliance, private police hired by manufacturers are to assistgovernment labor investigators by auditing contractors and identifying shopsthat break laws on minimum wage, overtime pay and child labor. Over the past five years, garment making in Los Angeles has become an $8billion annual industry. Over 150,000 workers are employed by manufacturersand contractors in Los Angeles. Under the three-year old Target Industries Partnership Program (TIP), stateand federal authorities combined forces to conduct monthly sweeps to enforcelabor laws in the garment and agriculture industries. During one two-hour sting operation, violations for illegal cash paymentsand unpaid overtime resulted in $20,000 in fines. Over 90 percent of the 4,000garment contractors in Los Angles have 50 or fewer employees, and many arenon-English speaking. Some employers close up shop after being fined, and thenre-open under a new name at a different location. In 1994, investigators conducted about 500 garment industry auditsstatewide -- most of them in Los Angeles -- assessing $4.5 million in penaltiesand collecting $2.6 million in unpaid wages.

The Wall Street Journalon July 3 attacked what it called "bipartisan animosity" toward legalimmigrants. Most of the attacks on the CIR recommendations were directed at therecommendation to reduce the number of immigrants admitted for economic andemployment, and to require US employers who bring immigrants to the US to paymore than the prevailing wage, plus a fee into a training fund to prepare USworkers for these jobs. The number of professionals and skilled workers seeking one of the 150,000visas reserved for such workers and their families--the quota was higher in1994 because of unused slots from earlier years-- fell from 147,000 in 1993 to123,300 in 1994, largely because such immigrants did not apply forvisas. The Wall Street Journal editorial argued that adopting the CIR'srecommendation to reduce the number of immigrants admitted for economic oremployment reasons from 140,000 to 100,000 annually would be costly to UShigh-tech firms. Microsoft, the software firm, reports that three to fourpercent of its 12,000 US-based employees are foreign born. USA Today analyzed data on 2.2 million immigrants who arrived between 1991and 1993, and concluded that if the US changes its immigration system to givemore weight to personal characteristics that produce high US earnings, then thesources of US immigrants would change. For example, 52 percent of the 1993immigrants from Mexico reporting an occupation listed laborer, while 0.3percent were engineers. By contrast, one percent of Indian immigrants werelaborers, and 25 percent were engineers. In 1993, 40 percent of all legal immigrants came from five countries:Mexico, China, the Philippines, Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. Most headfor New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and Houston. According to a USA Today/Gallup poll, 65 percent of all respondents, and 30percent of immigrant respondents, think that immigration should be reduced;seven percent of all respondents, and 15 percent of immigrant respondents,think that immigration should be increased. Almost 60 percent of immigrantsand other respondents think that immigrants should "blend in" to Americanculture, versus about one-third who think that immigrants should do more tomaintain their own culture. Asian immigrant groups attacked proposals by the CIR that were endorsed byPresident Clinton to eliminate the quotas for adult relatives of US citizens toenter the US as immigrants. According to their data, 40 percent of all adultchildren of US citizens, and two-thirds of all adult brothers and sisters of UScitizens, are Asians.

In Tucson, refugeeadvocates reportedly cared for 470 undocumented minors in 1994, up from 188 in1993. Most Mexican children are sent home immediately, but children from moredistant countries, such as Nicaragua, often remain in the US while their caseis being decided. The INS prefers to release children to their families orfoster parents rather than detain them. The children, all under 18, will be housed from several nights to severalmonths while the INS decides their case. The average stay is expected to be 21days. Currently, if family or foster care cannot be found for unaccompaniedminors, they are sent to shelters in California or Texas. The shelter willhave 32 to 48 beds, which leads critics to complain that it is too large andmay mean the children are detained longer than necessary. The INS opened the shelter because of recent court rulings that requireillegal immigrant children to be housed apart from unrelated adults or criminaljuveniles. The shelter will be run by Southwest Key, a private, non-profitorganization that runs about 25 treatment programs for juvenile delinquents inTexas, Arizona and Puerto Rico. This concerns some who say the organizationdeals with delinquents, not children without criminal histories. Southwest Keywill be paid by the federal government about $80 per child per day. Church groups criticized the plan. They argue that by holding thechildren, the government is using the children as "bait" to catch their illegalimmigrant parents who are already living in the US. The INS announced it will replace current border-crossing cards with atamper proof one with finger or handprints. The change, the first in 40 years,is scheduled to begin on Oct. 1. In 1994, the INS received 225,000 applications for border-crossing cards,most from those along the Texas border. To qualify, applicants must prove inan interview that they live and work in the border region. Temporary cards areissued the same day.

As in themid-1980s, the growers argue that, despite employer sanctions and highunemployment rates among US farm workers, at least 30 to 50 percent of theirseasonal workers are unauthorized. If immigration reforms successfully reduce unauthorized immigration andemployment, growers argue, there would be farm labor shortages that could notbe dealt with through the current H-2A program that admits temporary foreignworkers to fill vacant US farm jobs. Critics argue that there would be no shortage of farm workers if growersraised wages and improved working conditions. Many advocates assert that theH-2A program includes work guarantees and housing requirements to avoidexploitation. Growers say the rules make the H-2A program too bureaucratic andexpensive. On July 11, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich held a press conference nearFresno, California to announce that so far in FY95, DOL had assessed growersand contractors about $2.1 million for underpayment of 2,700 farm workers. Ina few cases, growers responded to fines by announcing publicly that they weretaking corrective actions, but most growers responded that they do comply withfederal and state laws. An important issue is whether the creation of an alternative to the H-2Aprogram would increase or decrease illegal immigration. The Bracero programthat gave between one and two million Mexican workers experience in the US farmlabor market, and is widely believed to have laid the ground work forsubsequent illegal immigration. Washington State fruit growers are asking Congress for permission to importguest workers for the first time in 40 years. The Washington State AppleCommission said as many as 50,000 temporary workers are required to harvest thestate's $ 1 billion-a-year apple crop. Some estimate that 30 percent ofWashington's farm workers are illegal. At a presidential summit in Portland in late June, Harry Kubo of Fresnourged Clinton to endorse agriculture's need for "guest workers." A University of California study found that the number of workers employedby farm labor contractors in California has risen steadily since the late1980s. In interviews, the growers said that a major reason why they turn tofarm labor contractors is increasing regulation of the farm labor market--usingcontractors allows growers to turn the cost and liability of immigration andlabor law violations over to a third party, and competition between contractorsto supply workers to growers has kept the cost of using a third party about thesame as directly hiring workers. Only one of the eleven growers interviewed said a labor shortage was thereason a labor contractor was used.

Louis Freedberg, "Growers Push for 'Guest' FieldHands," The San Francisco Chronicle, June 30, 1995. _________________________________________ Economics,Education, and Immigration Economist George Borjas estimated that the net benefits of currentimmigration are about $7 billion annually, or equivalent to half of MicrosoftCEO Bill Gates' net worth, or as much as Americans spend gambling each week.According to Borjas, immigration generates $140 billion per year in benefits tothe US, mostly from higher land and capital prices, and imposes $133 billionper year in costs, primarily in lower wages and unemployment among USworkers. The nation's 27 million Hispanics in 1994 are 10 percent of the USpopulation. A Census report released in July reported that, in 1994, only ninepercent of Hispanics 25 and older had BA degrees or more, versus 24 percent ofnon-Hispanics. This 2.7 ratio of non-Hispanic to Hispanic college graduateswidened since 1970, when there were 2.3 non-Hispanic BA degree holders forevery Hispanic degree holder. About 13 percent of adult Blacks had collegedegrees in 1994. Years of education is the best single predictor of income in the US. Inmid-1995, the median weekly earnings of full-time workers 25 and older withouta high school diploma was $309, versus $428 for high-school graduates, and $593for high-school graduates with some college. The 30 percent of the adult workforce with college degrees earned a median $750 per week. Real wages have been falling, and many workers reportedly feel poorerbecause the gap between wages and salaries and total compensation has widenedas more of their compensation comes in the form of fringe benefits. This meansthat workers who get few fringe benefits have seen both their real hourly wagesdecline and, since they get few fringe benefits, their total compensationdecline. Low earnings translate into relatively paltry savings for retirement.According to a recent survey, a typical white household with members aged 51 to60 had less than $18,000 in personal wealth (plus $70,000 in home equity),while Black and Hispanic households in this age range had less than $500 innon-real estate wealth. Claims to social security and private pensionsaccounted for over half of the typical 51 to 60 household's wealth. Some mainstream US universities are very dependent on foreign students. In1994, for example, Boston University and the University of Southern Californiahad the most foreign students in 1994, 4,700 and 4,300, respectively, andUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison and University of Texas-Austin followed with4,000 each. Most foreign students from countries such as Japan and Hong Kongpay full tuition, encouraging US universities to "market" themselvesabroad. US schools that cater to resident immigrants have been accused offraudulently enrolling needy immigrants in order to collect grant funds fromthem. For example, the Iade American Schools in Los Angeles was accused ofcollecting $58 million in Pell grants to needy students to enroll Hispanicimmigrants in classes such as auto mechanic and English as a SecondLanguage. A Stanford-Rand study concluded that there are too many PhDs produced inthe US, and that graduate schools continue to admit students to satisfy theirneed for teaching and research assistants, not because there are jobs waitingfor graduates. Unemployment among persons with PhDs is low but, it isasserted, the reason for low unemployment is because many persons with PhDs areunderemployed or employed in jobs that do not use the research skills theyacquired. The Stanford-Rand study concluded that there are, in fields such ascomputer science, 50 percent too many PhDs being produced, 44 percent too manymechanical engineering PhDs, and 30 percent too many physics, chemistry, andmathematics PhDs. The report concluded that increased federal funding forscience and engineering will only aggravate the situation by delaying theneeded shrinking of PhD programs. There are estimates that 25 to 40 percent of the scientists and engineerswho work in some US research labs are foreign born. This may be true, but mostof the nation's two million scientists and engineers-- in a US labor force of120 million--are US-born. In a related development, the US Department of Labor in mid-June began toinclude private companies in the calculation of prevailing wages thatuniversities must pay to post-doctorate foreign researchers, significantlyraising their wages. Research labs and medical schools have been forced toraise wages by 30 to 60 percent, so that they pay at least 95 percent of theprevailing wage. In some cases, foreigners working on research grants must be paid,according to revised DOL prevailing wage standards, more than the governmentagency making the research grant permits. If the foreign lab workers areswitched from F to H-1B visas, then there is no prevailing wagerequirement. The Labor Department says the change in policy should eliminate financialincentives to hire foreign workers over Americans. But educators say it willresult in pricing universities out of important research because there are notenough Americans doing similar research. Several newspapers investigated the H-1B program that admits up to 65,000temporary foreign workers annually and reported that US employers abuse the"attestation process" that permits them to certify that they looked for butfailed to find US workers at prevailing wages and conditions. According to onelawyer, the trick is to describe "the relevant job opening tightly enough thatthe INS recognizes an American probably isn't readily available for theposition, but not so tightly that the INS suspects the description is beingtailored for a specific foreign individual." Employers usually have a foreign worker in mind when they request that theUS Department of Labor certify their need for foreign workers. In 1995, onlyonce in every 200 times did the employer who requested foreign workers hire aUS worker who was referred to the vacant job for which the foreign was sought.DOL reportedly spends $50 million annually on labor certificationactivities. The firm that maintains the White House correspondence system, Mastech,reportedly imported about 1,000 of its 1,200 workers from India under the H-1Bprogram, and is currently being investigated. Two companies that have beenheavy users of the program that permits US employers to bring permanentimmigrants to the US to fill vacant jobs are Showell Farms and ConAgra Poultry.Showell Farms has reportedly brought "hundreds" of Koreans to the US to bepoultry workers for $5 per hour. Between 1988 and 1994, employers used the Permanent Alien Certificationprogram to bring to the US 793 auto body repairers, 650 carpenters, 186 pizzabakers, 104 car wash attendants, 82 doughnut makers, 51 barbers, 48 insurancesalesmen, 35 salad makers, 33 manicurists, 28 chauffeurs, 26 tire repairers, 15social secretaries, and 12 garbage truck drivers. A New York church asked DOL for permission to bring an immigrant to the USto be a missionary on the streets of New York, claiming that Americans "lackedenthusiasm and determination" for such work. DOL refused to certify thechurch's need for the alien. One California investigator estimates that 40 percent of employerapplications for immigrants to fill vacant jobs are fraudulent, in most cases,the alien is already working, and the employer simply wants to legalize his orher status.

The government now projects that Mexican GDP will shrink two percent in1995, and grow by three percent in 1996. But domestic consumption has fallendrastically in the wake of two million layoffs since December 1995, andincreased exports have not been able to absorb many unemployed workers. The US House Representatives on July 19 voted to prohibit the US Treasuryfrom lending more money to Mexico. In January 1995, the US promised Mexico upto $20 billion in funds to support the peso; about $12.5 billion has been sentto Mexico so far. In a review of what went wrong in Mexico in December 1994, much of theblame was laid on ex-Finance minister Pedro Aspe, who successfully resisted aSalinas-Zedillo agreement to devalue the peso on November 20, 1994, shortlybefore Salinas left office. Aspe was afraid that a devaluation would halt theinflux of foreign investment in Mexico. Mexican officials argued that the country could continue to run a tradedeficit financed by foreign investors because Mexico was importing capitalgoods that would accelerate its growth rate. But less than one-fourth ofMexico's imports in 1994 were capital goods. Some US investors reinforced Mexico's decision not to devalue, andencouraged Mexico to issue so-called tesobonos, government debt that was repaidin pesos at a pre-announced exchange rate. If Mexico devalued, these tesobonoswould increase the country's foreign debt in dollar terms. Mexico in 1995 has been running a trade surplus with the US, largelybecause the peso devaluation made exports cheaper and imports more expensive. A profile of a tobacco firm in Nayarit, about 400 miles northwest of MexicoCity, demonstrated the positive role that large companies can play in reformingMexico's agricultural sector. Mexico has about six million farmers scatteredacross 400 million acres of arable land, but they generate only about eightpercent of Mexico's $350 million GDP. [The US has about two million farmers andone billion acres of farm land, although crops are harvested from only 300million acres]. About 20 percent of Mexico's farm land is held in small farms of less than10 acres each. The tobacco company coordinates farmers willing to worktogether in 150 to 200 acre blocks. The farmers then farm as instructed, withequipment, seeds, and loans provided by the tobacco company. Profits are split50-50--four acres of low-grade tobacco returns about $4,000 annually for thefarm family's labor. The tobacco company, La Moderna, also exported $130million worth of fresh produce to the US in 1994. The Solidarity program, which spent $15 billion in federal funds between1988 and 1994 to help Mexican communities build infrastructure, is yet anotherSalinas-era program under attack in Mexico. Salinas hoped to be remembered forNAFTA and Solidarity, but critics now charge that Solidarity was simply aprogram to keep poor Mexicans voting PRI while the country restricted itseconomy. In addition to charges that some communities built projects such asbaseball stadiums, it has been alleged that the temporary jobs created bySolidarity do little to help Mexico's 15 million very poor people. Oneanalysis found that Solidarity funds were targeted in swing districts, and thatevery one percent increase in PRI votes in 1991 midterm elections was rewardedwith an additional $2.50 per voter spent on Solidarity projects. The government argues that Solidarity funds are spent in all 31 Mexicanstates, including the four governed by the opposition. Mexico built 6,000 kilometers of new roads during Salinas' six-year termbetween 1988-1994, with $14 billion in private foreign investment. Thegovernment is being forced to bail out several of these projects, largelybecause private construction companies far overestimated usage and revenuesfrom high tolls when obtaining loans from state-owned banks. The government often awarded road concessions to the bidder that offeredthe shortest time period of private ownership, usually 14 years until theproject was to be turned over to the government. Road concessions are beinglengthened up to 30 years. Roads are a high priority in Mexico because 80percent of Mexican exports move by land. Maquiladoras are foreign-owned factories in Mexico that import componentsand assemble electronics, auto parts, and other products to export, usuallyback to the US. After the 1982 peso devaluation, the number of maquiladorasmushroomed, so that, in the early 1990s, some 2,000 factories employed about500,000 Mexican workers. Maquiladoras were expected to shrink as NAFTA eliminated tariffs, but theyhave not. Recent projections are that almost 400 maquiladoras will be added bythe year 2000, raising the Mexican work force employed in foreign-ownedfactories from 579,000 in 1994 to 943,000 in 2000. Wages and benefits in themaquiladoras averaged about $1.80 per hour in mid-1995, and are projected toremain below $2.50 per hour until the year 2000. Ciudad Juarez, which lies across the US-Mexican border from El Paso, addedabout 40,000 jobs in the last year. Juarez expects to add another 30,000 jobsthis year despite the peso devaluation and economic crisis. NAFTA is creditedwith creating these jobs, most of which are in Juarez's 300 maquiladoras. El Paso is the fourth-largest city in Texas, and the third-fastest growingmetropolitan area in the US. Juarez is Mexico's fourth-largest urban center.El Paso grows through middle-class suburban developments, while Juarez addsshantytowns west of the city's garbage dump. Despite maquiladora jobs, many Mexicans still try to find work in El Paso.But Operation Hold the Line seems to be making it more difficult to commuteregularly as an illegal alien to a job in El Paso. The INS plans to build aten foot high wall along about 1.3 miles of border in a New Mexico suburb of ElPaso to discourage aliens from going around Operation Hold the Lineagents. Some downtown merchants have lost as much as 50 percent of their businesssince Hold the Line, although the peso devaluation and NAFTA also undoubtedlycontributed to declining sales. Car thefts and car and home burglaries aredown about 30 percent in El Paso. The US is reportedly worried about the booming drug trade in Mexico;Mexico earned an estimated $7 billion in 1994 by shipping Colombian drugs intothe US, or almost twice as much as remittances from Mexican workers in the US.Some of the money used to buy newly-privatized companies in Mexico wasreportedly drug money. Some US officials fear that the police in Mexico havebeen largely compromised by accepting money to protect drug barons.

Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg,the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain ended passport controls on their commonborders on July 1 as scheduled. France used a safety clause in the Schengenagreement to maintain its border controls, citing fears of illegal immigrationafter the EU denied a request for a six-month extension. France cited fears of illegal immigration from some of its Schengenpartners as the reason why it would maintain passport controls for another sixmonths. France noted that, in the three months since Schengen went into effecton March 26, 1995, four of the seven member nations had failed to report toSchengen computers any stolen identity documents, and only one had reported anystolen cars. France also complained that drug traffic along its northernborders increased by almost 60 percent in April-May 1995. The number of foreigners refused entry to France fell by two-thirds inApril-May 1995, which the National Front said demonstrates France's failure tocontrol its own borders. Most commentaries decried the French refusal to join in border-free Europe,since France is one of the most ardent supporters of European integration.Many asserted that France delayed Schengen implementation for fear of furtherstrengthening the National Front, which has asserted that under Schengen,illegal immigration to France will increase. The French decision bolsters the position of the UK, which argues thatborder-free Europe would increase illegal immigration and criminalactivities. The EU is scheduled to release a plan in July 1995 to remove passportcontrols between all member nations, which would be equivalent to extendingSchengen to all EU member nations. The election of several National Front mayors in local French elections inJune obscured the fact that only two of France's 225 cities of 30,000 or morehave National Front mayors. Indeed, there are so many local positions inFrance--over 500,000--that about one percent of the French population holdssome local office.

In 1994, there were over 78,000 inspections of German employers suspectedof employing illegal aliens, and almost half (42,000) led to fines of DM 24million (US $17 million) and/or warnings. The INS fined US employers $11million in 1994 for employing illegal aliens and/or not completing I-9forms. Germany has about 1,500 labor market inspectors and, at an annual cost ofabout DM 100,000 (US $70,000) per inspector, the Labor Ministry spends about DM150 million (US $110 million) annually to, e.g., prevent German workers fromdrawing UI benefits while working and to prevent illegal foreign workers fromfinding jobs. In a labor market with about 40 million workers, Germany spendsalmost $3 per worker on labor law enforcement. The US, by contrast, had 245 INS worksite investigators in 1994, and anadditional 900 Department of Labor inspectors. At an average cost of $75,000per inspector, the US spends $86 million annually on federal labor lawenforcement, or $0.66 per worker. German officials believe that the desire to preserve a generous welfarestate and an orderly labor market helps them to obtain the resources necessaryfor effective enforcement. For example, German labor inspectors can obtainlocal police support for worksite inspections at no cost to the labor ministry;when four or five labor inspectors enter a construction site, for example, theymay have 50 or 100 local police to surround the site and prevent workers fromrunning away. German enforcement officials report that German firms try to avoid negativepublicity, so they tend to pay rather than contest fines. If a German firmcontests a fine, its name can be made public. Fines are registered with localchambers of commerce, and public agencies and other firms can require employersbidding for contracts to provide information about that firm's labor lawviolations. The German Labor Ministry announced that it would conduct intensiveinvestigations of illegal employment in Brandenburg, the state surroundingBerlin, beginning in summer 1995. Berlin is currently the largest constructionproject in Europe, and perhaps the world, and thousands of foreign workers havestreamed into the city to seek construction jobs. There are currently 43 labor inspectors in Brandenburg, a labor market withjust under one million workers. For the next two years, another 150 inspectorswill be added, which means that in the Berlin area, DM20 million (US $14million) per year, or about $14 per worker, will be spent to detect anddiscourage labor law violations. The employment of legal foreign workers from elsewhere in the EU in Berlinprompted the German Labor Ministry on June 27 to push for a new law to raisethe wages that must be paid to EU construction workers in Germany beginning inFall 1995. Under the so-called Entsendereglung proposal, EU construction workers withfreedom of movement rights would have to be paid at least the minimum wagenegotiated between German construction unions and construction companies,currently about 20DM (US$ 14) per hour, plus offer them the same vacation payavailable to unionized German workers [payroll taxes add about 70 percent or DM14 (US $ 10) to the hourly wage for German workers]. Employers violating thislaw, which would remain in effect only for two years, could be fined up toDM50,000 (US $ 35,000). The opposition SPD claims that the new law does not go far enough and wantsthe government to require employers to pay all workers in Germany full Germanwages and benefits. The SPD would also ban low-wage workers from allindustries, not just construction. The 1.4 million workers in the German construction industry, plus 800,000in associated industries, include about 150,000 foreign workers. Theforeigners include 110,000 from EU nations such as the UK, Ireland, andPortugal, and 35,000 East Europeans, mostly from Poland and the Czech Republic. Foreign workers are paid as little as DM6 (US $ 4.25)per hour, and they donot receive German benefits, since they are considered employees of e.g.,British or Irish firms and temporarily assigned to Germany. EU workers havethe right to enter Germany and seek most jobs on an equal basis with Germanworkers. In several cases, Dutch firms founded construction firms in Portugal, andthe Portuguese firm made an agreement with a German firm to provide workers forDM 20 to 30 (US $14 to $20) per hour. The Portuguese workers were paid DM 6 to8 (US $ 4.25 to $5.60), and the Dutch firm kept the difference, satisfying allparties involved, but producing unemployment and complaints from Germanconstruction workers. Many foreigners are prepared to perform tasks deemed too dangerous byGerman builders. Most work a 70-hour week, almost twice as long as theirGerman counterparts. There are currently 137,000 unemployed German construction workers, andbankruptcies among small German construction firms rose 24 percent in 1994 over1993. Unemployed German construction workers receive an average DM40,000 (US $28,000) per year in unemployment insurance benefits. In addition to employing EU workers at lower-than-German wages, manyBritish workers allegedly claim to be self-employed carpenters or masons whomigrate to Germany to offer their services under the freedom of servicesprovisions of the EU. Germans allege that they are not truly "independentcontractors," and thus are not exempt from payroll taxes and minimum wagesbecause, inter alia, they are often (illegally) supervised on German worksites, and they are not enrolled in local German associations of independentcontractors. Germany has proposed that all independent contractors from other EUcountries be required to register with the local craftspersons' association,which would review each applicant's credentials before grantingcertificates. A sweep of hotels and restaurants involving 3,600 inspectors and police inMarch 1995 found that 830 of the 3,600 restaurants checked had illegal foreignworkers. About 6,000 or 43 percent of the 15,000 employees were foreigners whowere required to have work permits, and 1,300 of them (22 percent) did not.Two-thirds of the 15,000 restaurant employees did not have their socialinsurance cards on them, as required in construction, hotels and restaurants,and in fairs and other temporary exhibitions. Germany continues to debate whether its regulated labor market and socialwelfare system slows down job growth and increases unemployment. Between 1982and 1993, Germany created 3.25 million net new jobs, and an additional 1.4million net new jobs are expected to be created by 1999. German firms createdan estimated 70,000 jobs abroad in 1994, a trend that worries those who want topreserve Germany's lead in manufacturing. German employers argue thatGermany's high business taxes must be reduced, and that labor market andbusiness regulations eased in order to keep Germany competitive. The argument over whether an inclusive social safety net hurtscompetitiveness is being waged in many European countries. Employers complainthat strict labor laws discourage weekend and night work, so that expensivecapital equipment is not fully used, while sick leave that averages one monthor 22 days per year, plus four- to six-week paid vacations, leave Germanworkers with too few workdays. German employers recommend relaxing labor laws, ending store closingrequirements--most stores must currently close at 6:30 p.m. and on Saturdayafternoons and Sundays--and permitting households to deduct the wages paid tomaids, which employers estimate could create an estimated 500,000 to 600,000jobs. There have in 1995 been fewer predictions of the German and European "need"for immigrants to offset the demographic reality of aging populations anddeclining labor forces. The EU commissioned studies in 1993 that concludedthat, without immigration, the EU population would decline by about threepercent between 1990 and 2020, to 333 million and, at current labor forceparticipation rates, the EU labor force would decline by eight percent, from157 million to 144 million. To maintain the EU population and labor force at early 1990s levels, the EUwould have to admit 900,000 immigrants annually, including 400,000 per yearinto Germany, 200,000 per year to Italy, 80,000 per year to Spain, 60,000 peryear to France, and 50,000 per year or less for the all other EU nations exceptIreland. Correction: The July 1995 issue of Migration News mistakenly reported thatGerman negotiations with Vietnam were concluded and repatriations would beginin summer 1995. A final agreement was not signed until July 21, 1995. Under the agreement, about 40,000 Vietnamese nationals in Germany withoutvalid documents are to be returned to Vietnam. The final sticking point in thenegotiations was Vietnam's demand that those being deported from Germany are infact Vietnamese citizens. It was agreed that nationality would be determinedby birth certificates, seaman's papers, drivers license, witnesses, or theperson's own admission. Germany has also agreed to give Vietnam US $72 millionin development aid. There is some dispute about the number of Vietnamese living in Germany andhow many are subject to repatriation. Of the 60,000 Vietnamese who wereworking in East Germany in 1989-90, about 15,000 are still in Germany. Over 80percent of them have a residence status that will allow them to attainpermanent residence by 2001, which is in some cases 19 years after theirarrival. Some Vietnamese residents--including rejected asylum seekers-- have a"Duldung" ("tolerance"), which in most cases does NOT allow them to work.These Vietnamese could be repatriated under the agreement. Together withasylum-seekers whose applications have not yet been decided, but who are likelyto be rejected, some estimate that 20,000 Vietnamese could be deported,although most newspapers quote the government's 40,000 estimate.

The crackdownincludes: stopping non-contributory benefits for illegal or temporaryresidents, tightening access to student awards and loans, legislation to makenon citizens ineligible for social housing, and asking hospital trusts andgeneral practitioners to prevent ineligible foreigners from getting access tofree NHS treatment. Most of these measures are not expected to be implemented until1996. Four government departments will work closely with the Home Office on theseproposals - prompting concern that the Department of Education and Employmentwill encourage head teachers to see if any of their pupils come from familiesof illegal immigrants. The Department of the Environment will ensure that people from abroad arenot entitled to council houses; the Department of Social Security has alreadytightened up procedures to prevent illegal immigrants from claiming incomesupport, housing benefits and council tax benefits. The Department of Healthwill work on better ways to control access to free NHS treatment. Some teachers and health professionals were angry that they would be askedto become immigration police. Unision, the public services union, claimed thatthe plan was an attempt to get immigration enforcement "on the cheap," andwould undermine the integrity of public service. No one knows how many illegal aliens are in the UK; estimates range from20,000 to 1 million. In 1994, 5,032 illegal aliens were apprehended in theUK. The British Home Office says that the number of illegal immigrants hasalmost doubled since 1989 to an estimated 13,000 in 1994. In 1994, 23,000 ofthe 66,000 passengers stopped at posts and airports were refused entry,compared to 17,000 of 61,000 in 1992. Newspaper stories report that there continue to be large numbers of shammarriages in the UK. Marriage to a British national includes the right to livepermanently in the UK after a one-year probationary period, and it is assertedthat especially ethnic youth are attracted to the $500 to $2,000 paid formarrying a foreigner. An investigation revealed that, in one office, 146 of154 marriages involving Ghanaians and Nigerians were bogus. France in December 1994 proposed that all EU nations introduceemployer sanctions, and that public servants be required to report suspectedillegal aliens to immigration agencies. The UK has 800 immigration officerswho deal with internal enforcement, but no employer sanctions or reportingrequirements.

About 45,000illegal aliens are apprehended in France each year, and the governmentannounced that it would initiate weekly deportation flights. France expelled 81 Romanians, mostly gypsies, this month and manycomplained that French police physically abused them. A week later, 43undocumented Africans were deported to Zaire. The French Interior Minsterwarned that the highly publicized expulsions, following the suspension of theSchengen open-border agreement, demonstrated France's determination to haltillegal immigration. Amnesty International criticized France on July 12 for expelling theRomanian migrants, saying that it has found that members of Romania's largegypsy minority were sometimes jailed, solely on grounds of ethnic origin, fordisturbing public order. The new French government has announced that its top priority is to createjobs--700,000 by the end of 1996. French employers have been offered wagesubsidies if they hire unemployed youth and adults who have been unemployed forone year or more. France became a magnet for North Africans, in part because of fringebenefits guaranteed by law: six-week vacations, mandated health care and a$1,3000 monthly minimum wage. But these same social protections, are alsoexpensive. There is continued rhetoric, that if three million immigrants wereexpelled, there will be jobs for the three million unemployed French. Observers say tensions are especially high in southeastern France, wheremany of the North Africans settled. A leading Algerian political activistwarns that it could all end very badly, as tensions continue to rise. French farmers in April 1995 stopped trucks bringing Spanish strawberriesto France and destroyed them. The EU Commission threatened to bring Francebefore the EU Court of Justice for failing to prosecute the farmers involved indisrupting internal EU trade. Spanish strawberries are reportedly cheaper thanFrench berries because of the availability of cheap labor in Spain and thedevalued peseta.

Spain took over the EU Presidency on July 1, 1995, and is expected tofollow France in shifting EU attention and aid to North Africa at anEU-Mediterranean conference in Barcelona in November. Some observers note thatSpain spends less of its GDP on defense than any other EU nation--just over onepercent--so that the country hopes for the best, but is ill-prepared for theworst. Europe's southern members states are particularly concerned that furtherpolitical destabilization in North Africa, compounded by economic collapse,could trigger an increase in the number of Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisiansseeking asylum in western Europe. In Cannes at the end of June, government officials from France, Spain andItaly persuaded the EU to pledge $6.1 billion in assistance over five years toNorth African countries, arguing that economic instability in North Africa wasas threatening to the EU as crime and illegal immigration from Eastern Europethreatened northern Europe. A similar ad package of $8.7 billion was pledged for Eastern Europe. "Spain Committed to Securing Free Movement for Citizens," Reuters, July 12,1995.

Most had paid from$800 to $5,000 to be flown to Moscow on 10-day student visas, then taken bytruck and train across Eastern Europe. The final leg of the journey was inshipping containers that held 18 to 20 persons each mounted on trucks. Many of the Sri Lankans sold assets at home to finance the trip. Somereported that they were told they would receive DM10,000 and a job upon theirarrival in Germany. Alien smuggling is believed to be a $1 billion per year business. In thefirst half of this year, Hungarian authorities found more than 4,000 illegalimmigrants and arrested more than 200 human smugglers. Corresponding figuresfor the same period last year were somewhat less than 4,000 illegal migrantsand 140 immigrant smugglers. Polish employment officials estimate that the number of illegal foreignnationals working the country is more than 100,000. The State LabourInspectorate claims that the figure may be as high as 200,000. Most illegal foreign workers in Poland come from Russia, the Ukraine andBelarus, but in border towns, there are also illegals from Vietnam, Bulgariaand Romania, many working as street vendors. Since March 1995, Lithuania has tightened controls along its border withPoland to prevent alien smuggling. In February, 1995, before the controls, 17Lithuanian planes flew to Poland with planeloads of refugees. Poland claims that the flights are organized by illegal transport companieswho are moving Asians to the West via Moscow. Officials expect that with thetightening of the border with Poland, smugglers will shift their operations toBelarus and the Ukraine. Lithuania became the first of the Baltic countries to adopt a law onrefugees and asylum seekers. According to the UNHCR, the legislation meansthat asylum seekers in Lithuania will no longer be considered illegal migrants,and they will not face detention or deportation. Some estimate that there are 500,000 illegal aliens around Moscow,20,000 illegal Chinese aliens warehoused in Prague, 30,000 in Austria andperhaps 100,000 in France, most of them bound eventually for the UnitedStates.

On July 16, the Migrant Worker and OverseasEmployment Act went in effect. The Gancayco Commission, formed after thehanging of a Filipina maid in Singapore, issued its recommendations inmid-July. Under the new migrant law, overcharging by employment agencies and allother acts of illegal recruitment are punishable by a jail term from six yearsand one day to 12 years, plus a fine of P200,000 to P500,000 (US $ 7,900 to$20,000). If three or more persons jointly victimize "three or more personsindividually or as a group," then the crime becomes "economic sabotage," with amaximum penalty of a life in prison and a fine from P500,000 to P1 million (US$20,000 to $40,000). An alliance of about 500 overseas employment agencies stopped sendingFilipino workers abroad on July 17 to protest the new law. The employmentagencies say that the regulations are unfair to licensed placement agencies.Private recruiters are now preparing to ask the Supreme Court to halt theimplementation of the new law. The Philippine labor force is about 16 million, and eight million arereportedly on "labor-only contracts," which makes them dependent on anemployment agency rather than an employer. Estimates of workers abroad andremittances vary--most estimate that perhaps four million Filipinos workabroad, and that their $5 billion annual remittances at least partially supportone-fifth of the population. The Gancayco Commission recommended a halt to the deployment of womenmigrant workers by the year 2000 to the countries of Saudi Arabia, United ArabEmirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar. After questions were raised aboutthe constitutionality of a ban on emigration to specific countries, thecommission softened its recommendation to a "travel advisory." The commissionalso recommended a ban on allowing women entertainers, except musicians andartists, to travel for employment to Japan, Greece and Cyprus. Non-government organizations were critical of these recommendations, sayingthat prohibiting overseas employment would serve no purpose unless thegovernment can create jobs at home. The commission recommended streamlining and reviewing recruitmentprocedures to monitor the number of workers seeking jobs abroad. Consulatesand immigration officers were told to provide maximum assistance to workersabroad and watch for illegal recruiters. The Philippine legalization program effective June 1995 has attracted only1,710 applicants. Government officials estimate that there are 150,000 illegalaliens in the country. The program expires at the end of 1996. Most of theapplicants who have applied for amnesty are from China, Taiwan and India. For about $10,000, a foreigner who entered the country illegally beforeJune 20, 1992 can acquire permanent residency status. Once his stay has beenlegalized, he can be naturalized as a Filipino citizen in five years, half theusual time. The government expects about $78.2 million to be generated fromthe program. President Ramos said on July 19 that the country plans to normalizerelations with Singapore, which soured following the hanging of a Filipina maidin April. The Philippines, sometimes dismissed as the "sick man of Asia," embarked onan ambitious Philippines 2000 plan to close the gap with its fast-growing Asianneighbors over the next five years. One strategy for creating jobs for the 800,000 workers join the labor forceevery year is to promote foreign investment in free trade zones, that in early1995 employed about 200,000 Filipinos, three-fourths of them women. In most ofthese factories, workers are paid the minimum wage of 138 pesos (US $ 5.40) perday.

Currently, the CLA sets a minimum wage that employers mustpay to foreign workers that is typically less than the wage paid to localworkers. The CLA asserted that the number of foreign workers imported will be cut inhalf unless the employers and foreign labor agents take responsibility for thegrowing number of runaway foreign laborers. Taiwan's National Police Administration reported that 10,000 foreignworkers--about five percent of the 220,000 foreign workers in the country--have abandoned their legal jobs, either to switch to a higher-wage job thanthey were assigned at entry, or because their two-year work permits were aboutto expire. Runaways are expected to increase as the two-year work permitsgranted to them in 1993 expire. In 1992, Taiwan required some foreign workersto depart, including some who had been legally in the country for more thanfive years. The Council is considering bypassing employment recruiters and havingemployers hire workers directly from foreign countries. It is also consideringan increase in the current maximum three-year prison term for illegal alienworkers. In July, the government set up two telephone hotlines for localpeople to report runaway foreign workers. There are estimated to be at least 25,000 illegal alien workers in Taiwan,making illegals equivalent to about 10 percent of legal workers. The Ministryof Justice announced on June 19 a crackdown of Chinese overstayers, many ofwhom work in construction. The immigration department will also try to deterillegal entrants who sail from the Chinese mainland or enter through a thirdcountry such as Macao or Vietnam. On July 14, the Council of Labor Affairs announced that more than 4,000foreign workers would be allowed into Taiwan to work in six manufacturingindustries. COLA statistics showed that the manufacturing industries had anemployment shortfall of some 86,000 workers in 1993, and that number haddropped to 63,000 as of September of 1994.

Thegovernment estimates that each of the nearly one million foreign workers sendshome about $80 US per month. [In Lebanon, 700,000 foreign workers, mostlySyrians, earn an estimated 20 percent of that nation's income.] The Malaysian government warned that the country's reliance on foreignlabor in only temporary, and the deputy home minister claimed that the presenceof over one million foreign workers is a serious threat to security. On July 15 the government extended for another two years the three-yearwork permits of foreign workers in construction, manufacturing, and hotels andrestaurants. The decision to extend the passes was criticized by some unions,but praised by the construction industry. The Malaysian Trades Union Congress cited examples of abuse of foreignworkers and demanded that the government prevent further mistreatment. The government will continue to allow gas stations to have two foreignworkers for every Malaysian employed, although the industry had requested more.Five-year work passes for plantation workers will continue to be issued. Thegovernment stopped issuing work passes for foreign caddies at golf courses, butemployers can continue to use foreign caddies until their current work permitsexpires. The Malaysian Home Ministry warned foreign workers that they face a maximumfine of M$300 (US $ 123) or court action if they illegally change jobs. Manyforeign workers have work permits restricting them to work as maids, and theyhave been found to be working illegally in restaurants, grocery stores, officesand in entertainment. Employers face of maximum fine of M$10,000 (US $4,000)or five years' imprisonment or both upon conviction. The Bangladeshi government is concerned about the large number of illegalBangladeshi workers in Malaysia, and plans to try to curb illegal laborexports. Bangladesh's labor exports to Malaysia slowed down in recent months asthe Malaysian government discussed new policies to curb the influx of illegalforeign workers. As of June, 1995, a total of 161,067 Bangladeshis were employed in Malaysiawith valid documents, while 60,000 to 70,000 Bangladeshi labors are believed tobe working illegally. Of these, about 26,000 are to be legalized. About 3,200Bangladeshi illegal workers are being held in Malaysian detention camps.

Of the 120 million current surplusfarmers, nearly 80 million have already left farm work for urban areas. Thoughthe farmers have helped meet the current urban labor shortages, they are blamedfor increased crime, overcrowded transport system and a rise in birth rate. Two Chinese economists have called on the government to change thehousehold registration system to make it easier for farmers to move to thecities, where they earn money to send home and learn skills. In the first sixmonths of 1995, the average rural resident earned US$ 91, while his urbancousin earned US$ 237, official figures show. A July 9 front-page editorial in the People's Daily said that the ruralexodus of peasants seeking work in cities is straining urban facilities andcausing labor shortages in rural areas. The editorial coincided with theopening of a national conference on migrants. In order to stem the flow of farmers to the cities, the newspaper urged thegovernment to strengthen agricultural production and develop small townshipenterprises to provide other sources of employment. The State Bureau of Foreign Experts is trying to resolve disputes betweenforeign experts and their Chinese employers. Such disputes often arise whenChinese employers do not live up to contract terms involving airtransportation, pay, and working and living conditions. Some foreign expertsdemand more holidays and sometimes leave their jobs without notice. China employs about 30,000 foreign experts each year, 30 percent of whomwork for universities, publishing houses, research institutes and hospitals. Tibet's Dali Lama has claimed that thousands of ethnic Han Chineseimmigrants are streaming into Tibet as part of a Chinese plan to overwhelm thelocal Tibetan population. The vice-chair of the regional Tibetan government counters that there are18,000 Han working in Tibet, accounting for less than 30 percent of the workersemployed by the government. Most of the workers will return to their homeprovinces when they reach 30 years of age. Tibet has a population of two million. Han visitors are not permitted tobecome citizens of Lhasa or rural farmers. Mark O'Neill, "China faces problem of 200 million unemployed farmers by2000," Reuters, July 26, 1995.

HongKong officials, accustomed to full employment, were shocked when unemploymenthit an eight-year high of three percent in May. The government, which hastraditionally taken a hands-off approach, has stepped up its efforts to helpservice workers find jobs. In June, paging operator companies received permission to service callsfrom southern China, where wages are only $260 per month, instead of $1,100 permonth in Hong Kong. Industry analysts expect the entire paging industry tomove to China, a loss of 30,000 Hong Kong jobs. An estimated 10 percent of Hong Kong's six million residents have taken outcitizenship or the right to citizenship in another country as a protection fortheir families if the 1997 transition to Chinese rule is bumpy. Hong Kong's minority groups with no travel documents except the BritishDependent Territories Citizen papers or a British National Overseas passportare entitled to neither Chinese nor British nationality. These minority groupshave no nationality or guaranteed right of abode; they can only remain in HongKong as long as the Chinese allow them to remain. Many are Indians who expected the British government to welcome them toBritain but, as 1997 approaches, they are not being granted Britishnationality. They have lobbied British Members of Parliament for 10 years,hoping to get special consideration for British passports. The success rate for minorities applying for British passports is about 60percent, the same for the rest of the population--despite promises from theBritish government that the applications from non-Chinese would be only afraction of the total. Many minorities say they want British passports, not togo the Britain, but to stay in Hong Kong. They also want an escape shouldthings go wrong after the Chinese gain control of Hong Kong in 1997. The UNHCR director warned that there is a possibility that Vietnamese boatpeople who do not return to their native home before the 1997 handover of HongKong, may be sent to re-education camps or jails on the Chinese mainland. InJuly, 1995, there were two incidents when some of the 22,000 Vietnamese beingdetained in Hong Kong escaped. Most were recaptured. The escalation of housing prices in Hong Kong has made the averagemiddle-class apartment in Hong Kong worth more than the minimum investmentrequired to enter most countries under their business immigration policies. Increasingly, Filipina maids in Hong Kong are working outside the home, aviolation of their employment contracts. About 600 of the maids claim they areforced to work in violation of their labor contract by their employers. Lastyear, over 160 Filipinas were charged with unapproved employment. This year thenumbers are expected to be significantly higher. The Labor and ImmigrationDepartments encourage domestic workers to report their employers, but theFilipina maids fear losing their jobs, being jailed, and then deported.

After numerous complaints, the government reconsideredand allowed foreigners already in Singapore to continue making tax-exemptcontributions to the Central Provident Fund until December 1998. Foreignworkers complained that the proposal would have reduced their wages by anestimated 20 percent. Companies and employees must each make a contribution of 20 percent oftheir wage to the CPF. Expatriate workers can only withdraw money from thefund when their Singapore contract expires. Under the old plan, contributionswere tax exempt, but under the new rules, contributions after 1998 will beconsidered voluntary, and therefore subject to tax. About 300,000 work permit holders are already exempt from making pensionpayments under Singapore's Foreign Worker Levy Scheme. Foreign maids andconstruction workers are excluded from the pension plan. Chuang Peck Ming, "Existing expats get 3-yr reprieve from CPF cut,"Business Times, July 28, 1995.

Most illegal workers are from China, thePhilippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan. Another report said there were 130,000foreign workers, about 100,000 of them illegal. Immigration laws have now tightened so that immigrants wanting illegalentry have to pay about a million won (US $1,200) in brokerage fees. In May 1994, the Korean government launched a trainee system under which upto 25,000 industrial trainees from abroad could work and learn in Korea.Trainees are paid about $200 per month, and they have few rights under Koreanlabor law. Abut one-fourth of the trainees abandon their jobs, and illegallygo to work for wages of $400 to $600 per month. "Hard Times for Illegal Workers in ROK," Mainichi Daily News, June 15,1995.

The percapita income in South Africa is $2,560 compared to Mozambique's $80 and $650in Zimbabwe. The South African army estimates that the number of illegal immigrants inthe country is about five million (12 percent of the population), but admitsthat there could be as many eight million (20 percent). Many of the illegalimmigrants are from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, and many who work insugarcane or on cotton farms. In the first five months of 1995, the armycaptured 2,247 illegal immigrants crossing the border without documents. The South African government is reluctant to offend neighboring countrieswho sheltered many of those escaping apartheid. At the same time, resentmentagainst illegal immigrants in South Africa is rising. The Johannesburg-basedCenter for Policy Studies reported that a majority of South Africans holdillegal immigrants responsible for the nation's high unemployment rate,homelessness, and other social problems. Some in the government would like to see longtime illegal immigrants givenSouth African citizenship. Others want a regional migration policy withquotas, and still others call for the development of impoverished neighboringstates to remove the economic incentive to leave. The South African police report that Swaziland has become a major avenuefor illegal immigrants to enter South Africa. A Swazi syndicate is providingfalse documents that illegal immigrants use to get into the country. Many ofthe illegal aliens arrested told border police that controls are tighter alongthe Mozambican border than the Swazi border. The South African army is urging the government step up the voltage on afence that runs between the Mozambique border and South Africa's KrugerNational Park to Swaziland to prevent illegal entry. South Africa in1990 changed the setting on the electric fences on its borders from lethalshocks to a setting that provides only a mild shock. The fence was originally erected to make crossings by guerrillas of theAfrican National Congress more hazardous from 1986 to 1989. Human rightsgroups argue that the fence will not stop illegal immigration. Sudarsan Raghvan, "South Africa's Immigrant Dilemma, San FranciscoChronicle, July 27, 1995. Marius Bosch, "S.

Over the past three months, theBahraini government has deported 1,269 illegal immigrants, and 1,033 weredeported between January and March 1995. Shiite youth have been rioting in Bahrain to protest the lack of democracyin a land ruled by the al Khalifas, who are Sunni Moslems. As oil revenues fall, there are concerns in Bahrain and elsewhere thatlocal rulers conspired with outsiders to divvy up oil wealth. Ambitiousmembers of the middle class resent the need to pay bribes to ruling familymembers to do business, and poorer Bahrainis who live near camps housing Asianmigrant workers reportedly blame the Asians for the lack of jobs. Unemployment ranges as high as 40 percent, and the Shiites, who are 60 to70 percent of the population, experience the most joblessness. The Bahraini government has promised to substitute Bahrainis for Asianmigrant workers. However, the ruling family reportedly sells visas to employforeigners for $1,350 each even when work visas are not to be issued. "Immigrants deported," Moneyclips, July 11, 1995.

There were 22 millionforeign-born adults and 179 million native-born adults, so that foreign-bornpersons were 11 percent of the US adult population. The 13 million foreign-born adults in the US labor force in March 1994 were10 percent of the 130 million strong labor force. Foreign-born adults were less likely to be in the labor force thannative-born adults (13 of 22 million or 59 percent of the foreign born, and 117of 179 million or 65 percent of the native born); the gap for foreign-bornwomen was especially large. Foreign-born adults were also more likely to beunemployed than the native-born (9.2 percent for the foreign-born, and 6.8percent for the native born). Foreign-born adults have a much different education distribution thannative-born adults--the foreign-born are more likely to have a college degreeor more, OR to have less than a ninth- grade education, than are native bornadults. If foreign-born adults are arrayed by their years of education, theresult is an hourglass shape, reflecting their concentration at the extremes ofthe education distribution. Native-born adults, by contrast, generate adiamond-shaped distribution. The contrast between foreign-and native-born adults is sharpest inagriculture--only five percent of the self-employed farmers are foreign-born,versus 26 percent of the wage and salary farm workers. Most of theforeign-born adult farm workers were Hispanics from Mexico--Hispanics were 50percent of the foreign-born adults in the US, and 86 percent of theforeign-born farm workers. About 72 percent of the foreign-born farm workers,versus eight percent of the native born farm workers--had less than nine yearsof schooling. Over half of the foreign-born farm workers were in California, versus sixpercent of the native-born farm workers. The CPS, which asks about employmentin March, does not include most of the foreign-born farm workers--many are notemployed in March, and others arrive in April and May and stay in the US onlyuntil September or October. About five percent of the foreign-born workers were employed by federal,state, or local governments, versus almost 20 percent of the native-born laborforce. About 10 percent of both the foreign-born and the native-born wereself-employed. Foreign- and native- born adults have very different industry andoccupational distributions. In nine broad industrial sectors, foreigners aredisproportionately represented in agriculture and manufacturing, andunder-represented in mining, transportation, and public administration. Foreign-born adults are more likely to have farming or operative/laborer orservice occupations than the native born, 47 percent versus 31 percent, andless likely to have the most common US occupation--technical, sales, orsupport. There are significant differences in foreign-born and native-born workersby industry and occupation. For example, 63 percent of those employed inCalifornia agriculture are foreign born, versus 13 percent of those employed inNew York agriculture in March 1994. There are almost 100 million "families" in the US, and about nine millionare headed by foreign-born persons. There are significantly more husband-wifehouseholds among the foreign born (70 percent) than among the native born (53percent), but the foreign-born husband-wife families had much lower 1993incomes, $32,000 versus $43,000. In the states with the most foreign-born persons, one-fourth of allforeign-born families had incomes in 1993 that were below the povertyline. NB. In late July, the House voted to reduce ILAB's funding by 86 percent,which may wipe out the US Department of Labor's $700,000 per year immigrationresearch program. ILAB supported the collection of data on IRCA-legalizedaliens (Westat survey), and has supported research of many aspects of the labormarket effects of immigration.

The report expressed the hope that, withfewer entries, OECD countries could turn their attention to integratingnewly-arrived immigrants and their children. The report emphasizes that economic recovery or labor shortages in theimmigration countries, or recession and instability in emigration counties,could increase migration again. The report seemed to endorse more immigration,noting that Canada, Germany and the United States had increased immigrationsince 1988 without noticeable negative economic effects. The OECD report identifies three key migration trends--fewer asylumseekers, more unskilled temporary foreign workers, and more highly-skilledmigrants. According to the report, the 1993 foreign populations in European countriesranged from 6.9 million in Germany to 3.6 million in France to two million inthe UK and 1.3 million in Switzerland. About half of the foreigners in each ofthese countries were in the labor force: Germany had 3.4 million foreignworkers; France 1.5 million; the UK, 1 million; and Switzerland, 700,000 (insome cases, temporary or seasonal foreign workers are included, although theforeign population data refer only to settlers). In 1993, Germany took 990,000 foreigners, including 320,000 asylum seekers.Half of the asylum-seekers arriving in OECD countries in 1993 were from Europe,usually from former Yugoslavia, Romania and Turkey. In 1993, Germanyrecognized four percent of asylum applicants as refugees, Belgium, Italy andNorway recognized about 10 percent; France, 28 percent; and Canada, 50percent. In April 1995, Eurostat published a report entitled "InternationalMigration in the EU Member States - 1992" that put net immigration into the15-member EU at 1.2 million in 1992. Net immigration to the EU was close tozero in 1984, reached 1 million in 1990, and may have peaked in 1992.According to Eurostat, net immigration to Europe is increasing as immigrationflows rise and emigration remains stable. Most immigrants to EU member nations are Europeans--from 60 to 90 percentin all EU nations except Sweden where less than half of the immigrants are fromEurope. For example, Germany in 1992 had 1.5 million immigrant arrivals, and720,000 emigrant departures, according to Eurostat. Germany receivedtwo-thirds of the immigrant arrivals to the EU in 1992, and accounted for 60percent of the EU's emigrants. Immigrants in these data include returning citizens. In Denmark, Greece,Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom, half of all 1992 "immigrants" arereturning citizens.

The share of the foreign-born in the US population has almost doubled fromthe 1970 level of 4.8 percent. The foreign-born share of the US populationpeaked at 14.7 percent in 1910. There were 23 million foreign born residents in the US in 1994, meaningthat almost one in 11 Americans was born in another country. About 31 percentof these foreign-born residents have become naturalized US citizens. An estimated four million foreign-born residents, or 17 percent-- are inthe US illegally. Mexico was the country of birth for 27 percent of theforeign-born, and Hispanics were 46 percent of the foreign-born. The foreign-born are concentrated in a few states. California had 7.7million foreign-born residents in 1994, meaning that almost 25 percent of thestate's population was born abroad; New York, 2.9 million, or 16 percentforeign born; and Florida, 2.1 million--these three states had 55 percent ofall the immigrants. There were over six million persons born in Mexico and living in the US in1994, one million persons born in the Philippines, 850,000 born in Cuba, and700,000 each born in El Salvador and Canada. The next major countries oforigin were US residents born in Germany--600,000--and then five countries thatare each home to about 500,000 US residents--China, Dominican Republic, SouthKorea, Vietnam and India. About 20 percent of all foreign-born residents arrived in the last fiveyears--the foreign-born population increased by 4.5 million between 1990 and1994. Those who arrived since 1990 are almost twice as likely to receivepublic assistance as US-born residents--almost six percent of therecently-arrived foreign born, versus three percent of 1990-94 immigrants,received some form of public assistance in 1994. About one-fourth of theimmigrants who arrived recently have poverty-level incomes, but 40 percent ofrecent Mexican immigrants were poor in 1994-- 14 percent of the US born arepoor. When ranked by the single best predictor of income, years of immigration,recent immigrants have a barbell or hourglass shape. About 21 percent ofpost-1990 immigrants have a college degree or more, compared with 15 percent ofUS born adults. The number of family unification immigrants fell six percent between 1993and 1994, from 484,000 to 464,000. There were 107,000 immigrants from Mexico,making Mexicans about one in eight immigrants in 1994. The backlog for familyunification immigration worldwide was about three million. The number of immigrants admitted for employment reasons fell 16 percent,from 147,000 in FY 93 to 123,300 in FY 94. The unused employment visas willpermit more family immigration in FY95. As in previous years, about one-third of the legal immigrants in 1993 werestudents, and another 30 percent were unemployed, retired or homemakers. Therewere more than twice as many laborers and service workers (120,000) as managersand professionals (45,000). Steven A. Holmes, "The Golden Door" New York Times, September 3, 1995.Steven A.

According to the workers, most worked 84hours weekly sewing garments for wages that averaged $1.60 per hour, far lessthan California's $4.25 minimum hourly wage. The workers had the cost ofsmuggling them to the US deducted from their pay. The apartment complex's owner as well as neighbors said they did notsuspect that the fenced apartment complex was an illegal sweatshop that heldworkers inside against their will. The nine Thai operators and guards at thecomplex have been charged with a variety of immigration and labor lawviolations that carry penalties of up to $3 million and 30 years in jail;$750,000 in cash and gold was found in the factory, some of which may be usedto pay workers who were not paid the minimum wage to which they wereentitled. The Thai workers were granted six-month temporary work permits so they cansupport themselves until they appear as witnesses in the trial of sweatshopoperators. After the trial, they are supposed to be deported back toThailand. California labor authorities subpoenaed records from two department storechains, Mervyn's and Wards, to determine if they knowingly dealt with theunregistered factory, which did business as SK Fashions. It is illegal tooperate a sewing factory in a residence. The stores may be liable for backwages, since SK was an unregistered contractor. California Governor Wilson attacked the Clinton Administration for notcracking down on sweatshops that employ illegal immigrants. In 1994, Governor Wilson vetoed a bill which would have automatically madethe beneficiaries of work done in sweatshops liable for labor law violationscommitted there. According to Wilson, "it is plainly inequitable to holdmanufacturers liable for the acts of separate and independent businesses whenthey have no control over their actions." A California Senate committee reapproved the bill that would make garmentmanufacturers liable for the labor law violations by a 4 to 3 committee vote onAugust 30. Farm worker advocates and others concerned about vulnerableimmigrant workers have been seeking to have the beneficiaries of the immigrantworkers labor be liable for the labor and immigration violations of theirsubcontractors. The INS investigated the factory in 1992, but the local federal attorneyrefused to ask a court to issue a search warrant, so the INS did not pursue itsinvestigation. The federal judge to whom the case was first assigned hasindicated that she will probably step aside because she was a federalprosecutor when the federal attorney's office in 1992 decided not to search thecomplex. California labor law officials eventually investigated and discoveredthe Thai workers being held against their will. There were 19,000 ethnic Thais in Los Angles County, according to the 1990COP, but there may be more immigrants from Thailand among those who identifiedthemselves as ethnic Chinese even though they immigrated from Thailand. The publicity generated by the sweatshop raid in Thailand is allegedlyencouraging more illegal Thai immigration to the US. The raid and prosecutionhas bee widely publicized in Thailand, where officials report that "It soundspretty good to Thai people to stay in a room with a spring bed, instead of amat, and with air conditioning." The wages paid in the sweatshop, reported in Thailand to be about $15 for a10 hour day, are "pretty good by Thai standards." Thais interviewed inThailand hoping to migrate to the US reportedly "don't believe things are thatbad." The Thai Office for the Protection of Thai Nationals Abroad was notgreatly concerned about the Los Angeles sweatshop, and Thai authorities arereportedly not actively helping the INS to investigate the Thai end of thecase. The minimum wage for the 1.2 million garment workers in Thailand is $6 perday, but many women reportedly work 16-hour days for $3 to $4. The fact thatit was falsely reported in Thailand the Thai workers were to have "green cards"until the trial is over has allegedly increased interest in migrating illegallyto the US. On August 23, INS agents discovered three more sweatshops, unregisteredfactories that employed 56 illegal Asian workers smuggled into the US by Asiansmuggling rings to sew garments for contractors who supply major retailers suchas JC Penny. In California, garment manufacturing is a $46 billion industrythat involves 4000 legal, and perhaps another 1,000 illegal, workplaces and125,000 workers. Some immigrant worker advocates are concerned that highly publicized raidswill drive garment shops further underground. The raids have highlighted thedifficulties involved in simultaneously enforcing immigration and laborlaws. US Labor Secretary Robert Reich called on major garment retailers toparticipate in an industry summit on September 12 in New York to developprotections for garment workers. A 1994 study found that over 70 percent ofthe nation's garment factories paid at least some of their workers less thanminimum wages, that 80 percent did not pay all of the overtime wages that theywere required to pay, and that 90 percent had health and safetyviolations. The IRS has begun to crackdown on workers who are paid as independentcontractors so that their employers can avoid payroll taxes that add 10 to 20percent to wage costs. Texas A&M admitted on August 15 that it wronglypaid 400 farm workers employed at 10 of the university's 18 agriculturalexperiment stations as independent contractors. The IRS estimated in 1987 that almost 4 million of the then 110 millionemployed workers in the US were unlawfully being paid as independentcontractors. The single most labor-intensive activity in US agriculture is theharvesting of about 300,000 acres of raisin grapes near Fresno,California--some 50,000 workers are employed from mid-August to the end ofSeptember to cut bunches of grapes and lay them on paper trays to dry. Theworkers doing this "bottom of the farm job ladder" work are increasinglynon-Spanish speaking Indians from southern Mexico and Guatemala. Many of the "new-new" migrants are Mixtec Indians from the southern Mexicanstate of Oaxaca. There may be as many as 50,000 Mixtec Indians in Californiaand, in a sign of the times, one school district that teaches children inSpanish hired a non-English speaking teacher's aid to translate between Mixtecand Spanish.

California Governor Pete Wilson formally launched his bid to be the 1996Republican presidential candidate on August 28 by using the Statue of Libertyas a symbolic backdrop to stress his opposition to illegal immigration.According to Wilson, the Statue of Liberty symbolizes the correct legal way toimmigrate to the US. Wilson's campaign is based on opposition to illegalimmigration, affirmative action, crime, welfare and taxes. The Republicanswill hold their nominating convention in San Diego in August 1995. Republican presidential candidate Phil Gramm in mid-August received supportfor his campaign from Iowa Beef Packers, one of the major US meat packers thatwas discovered to be using a contractor who employed illegal aliens in May1995. IBP and other midwestern meatpackers slashed wages in the 1980s byclosing unionized plants and building new plants that were staffed with Asianand Hispanic immigrants. Base wages, which were $9 per hour in 1982, are nowin the $6 per hour range. Paul West, "Anti-alien rhetoric a nationwide hit," September 3, 1995.

There are two reasons for the increase in apprehensions. Most observerspoint to the peso crisis that began when Mexico devalued the peso on December20, 1994. That, in turn, led to soaring interest rates in Mexico, layoffs thatpushed the unemployment rate to 6.6 percent, and a four to six percentcontraction of the Mexican economy in 1995. The US also added 10 percent more Border Patrol agents in FY95, but theirstrategy has changed from apprehending as many aliens as possible to deterringthe entry of aliens with fences and walls and a massive presence. The INS spent $200 million to detain aliens in 1994, and detention costsare rising as more aliens are detained, and being detained for longer periods.Three types of aliens are detained-- "excludable," "deportable," and "criminalaliens." Excludables are stopped when attempting to enter the US, and they can beparoled into the US, or held until they leave voluntarily, or the INS andcourts determine if they can stay. Deportable aliens are persons in the US whohave violated the terms of their legal entry, or who entered the US withoutinspection. Criminal aliens have been sentenced for crimes committed in the US. Theyare taken into custody after they have served their prison terms, and untilthey can be deported--60 percent of the aliens detained by the INS are criminalaliens. The INS believes that detention reduces fraudulent asylum applications.For example, after persons arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York andrequesting asylum were routinely detained, asylum applications at KennedyAirport fell from 15,000 in 1992 to 9,000 in 1994. There has been discussion of detaining some of those apprehended crossingthe Mexico-US border with false documents--excludables. Over 200 aliens perday were apprehended at the San Diego border crossing using false documents totry to enter the US "legally." In response to Operation Gatekeeper, some alien smugglers are rentingborder crossing and other documents to aliens wishing to enter the US. To stopthis mode of illegal entry, the INS has announced that false documents will beseized, and the alien using them detained, and possibly held over for a trialbefore an immigration judge. The INS is keeping the checkpoints on major roads leaving the border areaopen longer, which forces alien smugglers to keep illegal immigrants inso-called drop houses in the San Diego area longer. In July, the INS found 66illegal aliens in a one-bedroom apartment. The INS launched Operation Disruption in May 1995 to detect drop houses inthe San Diego area. Some 117 such houses have been found, and 4,800 aliensapprehended. Some 120 smugglers were arrested. A toll-free number(1-800-808-USBP) has been established to report suspected drop houses. The INS expects to deport 30,000 criminal aliens in FY95. There are nodata on the number of criminal aliens deported in earlier years. The INSstations agents at selected jails, including the Los Angeles County Jail, totake into custody aliens as they are released. The 1994 Violent Crime Controland Law Enforcement Act allows the INS to begin deportation proceedings againstaliens while they are in prison for other crimes, and then to deport them upontheir release. In July 1995, there were 29,000 foreign-born inmates in federalpenitentiaries and 72,000 foreign-born people were incarcerated in statefacilities. In mid-August, the INS and California officials arrested 116 mostlyMexicans who had been deported from the US after being convicted of committingcrimes here, and then returned despite deportation. California had identified1,200 aliens who were deported by the INS after serving their prison terms, butwho returned illegally, and were being supervised by California paroleauthorities. Those arrested face up to 20-year federal prison terms for illegallyentering the US after being deported. The INS on August 31 announced a "Citizenship USA" program to reduce fromone year to six months the time needed to process citizenship applications.The number of aliens seeking to become naturalized US citizens rose from anaverage 300,000 per year to an expected 1 million in FY95. The INS hopes theplan will ease the backlog of 600,000 cases. The "Citizenship USA" program will quadruple the naturalization staff inthe Los Angeles district, increase overtime, purchase new computers, andincrease the use of community organizations to interview potential US citizens.The program will concentrate on the cities of Los Angeles, Miami, New York,Chicago and San Francisco, where 75 percent of all naturalization applicationsare filed. The INS may also waive personal interviews in some cases. A study release in August showed that, although there was a 225 percentincrease in citizenship applications in the last five years, Congress decreasedthe Naturalization Division's budget by 35 percent.

On August 3,the INS extended until January 31, 1996 the time that the estimated 90,000Salvadorans with Deferred Enforced Departure, who are eligible under a consentdecree to apply for asylum, but have not yet done so, have to file their asylumapplications or otherwise change their status from TPS or leave the US. Salvadoran TPS is a legacy of Reagan administration policies in CentralAmerica. As Nicaraguans and Salvadorans came to the US, about 80 percent ofthe Nicaraguans, but less than five percent of the Salvadorans, were grantedasylum in the US. A class action suit against the INS, the so-called ABC case,was settled in 1991 by granting 200,000 Salvadorans TPS as well as work permitsuntil the INS thoroughly reviewed their requests for asylum. Even Salvadoran activists conceded that few of the Salvadorans in the USare likely to be granted asylum. Their hope is that, as years pass, manySalvadorans will be able to prove that returning them to El Salvador wouldimpose an extreme hardship on them. The INS announced that beginning October 9, 1995, Canadians and Mexicanswho apply for border crossing and similar cards will have to pay processingfees of $4 to $32.

"Salvadoran Immigrants Start Getting Notices to Seek Asylum,"Los Angeles Times, August 4, 1995. ____________________________________________ IntegratingImmigrants The debates over affirmative action and immigration are slowly being mergedin US politics, especially in local disputes. In New York, traditionally a bastion of support for immigrants, there havebeen disputes about residency requirements to attend local schools. Hempstead,a mostly Black school district in 1984, now has one-fourth Hispanic students,and non-Spanish speaking registrars are requiring non-English speaking parentsto provide leases and similar evidence that they live in the schooldistrict. However, since some of the parents are illegal aliens who sublet rooms inapartments from family and friends, they have no written leases to prove thatthey and their children live in the district. As a result, some children arenot in school despite the 1982 US Supreme Court Plyler v Doe decision, whichprohibited states from denying illegal alien children free K-12 publiceducation. The courts have not yet decided whether local residencyrequirements are a form of prohibited discrimination against immigrants. New York Mayor Giuliani criticized Republican party leaders who are pushingfor tighter controls over illegal immigration. Under an executive orderapproved in 1985, and still in force, New York officials are required toprovide city services to unauthorized aliens, and are prohibited from providinginformation on suspected illegal aliens to the INS. There are an estimated40,000 to 60,000 children with illegal alien parents in New York publicschools. One of the first challenges for many immigrants to the US is to secure adriver's license. Many immigrants from countries such as Vietnam or China havenever driven a car. In immigrant areas, so many established immigrants haveset up driving schools that offer native language instruction that English-onlydriving schools outside public schools are reportedly rare. A July USA Today/Gallup poll of immigrants who could respond to questionsin English found that 85 percent were or wanted to become UScitizens--two-thirds of those polled were already naturalized US citizens, andalmost 60 percent of the non-citizens planned to naturalize (August MN). Onlyabout one-third of the foreign-born in the US are naturalized UScitizens. The USA Today/Gallup poll also found that most immigrants are wellintegrated into American life, and that more immigrants than US-born persons,93 versus 85 percent, believe in the American dream, i.e., hard work paysoff.

Ex-President Salinas is blamed for failing to devalue the peso in atimely fashion, thereby permitting imports to greatly exceed exports, andproducing the peso crisis of December 1994. A bailout in March 1995 stabilized the peso, and Mexico has spent abouthalf of the $50 billion provided by the US and the IMF to pay off the maturingbonds. Severe belt tightening since then has so far not produced a populistrevolt against the government. Mexico is expected to run a $5 to $6 billion trade surplus in 1995, andforeign investors looking to the long run are reportedly sending investments toMexico. However, only 20 percent of small and mid-sized US companies in onesurvey are planning to do more business in Mexico next year, down from 33percent in a 1994 survey. The economy is expected to shrink by three to fourpercent in 1995, and grow by two percent in 1996. Many analysts say that turning around the Mexican economy will be hardbecause the Mexican savings rate is so low--savings averaged only about 14percent of national income over the past decade, versus 20 percent forcountries at a similar stage of development. Baja California may replace Juarez as the major center of maquiladoraactivity in Mexico, largely because NAFTA encouraged especially Japanese firmsto expand the number of 1,000-plus factories in Tijuana and Mexicali.Baja-area maquiladoras have increased their exports by one third, and theiremployment by nearly 20 percent. While it is easy for internal Mexicanmigrants to find jobs in Baja maquiladoras , it is hard for them to findaffordable housing. In his first state of the nation speech on September 1, President Zedillopromised to support legislation that would give Mexican congressionalcommittees the power to investigate the activities of the President and theexecutive branch of government. Zedillo spent most of his speech acknowledgingMexico's economic difficulties, including the loss of at least 824,000 jobs sofar in 1995, but asserted that economic growth would resume in 1996. President Zedillo's June 1995 proposal to permit Mexicans to be nationalsof Mexico and another country, and retain their Mexican passports and propertyrights, but not voting rights in Mexico, is moving toward an expected Fall 1995approval. Mexico's PRI opposes voting rights for Mexican nationals abroad, forfear that they will vote for the opposition. Article 37 of Mexico's 1917 Constitution distinguishes between citizenshipor allegiance to a country and birth nationality, and asserts that Mexicans whovoluntarily become citizens of another country lose Mexican citizenship. Ifapproved by a two-thirds vote as expected in September by Mexico's Congress,and then by a majority of Mexico's 31 state legislatures, Mexicans in the UScould become dual nationals in about one year. About 50 nations permit dualcitizenship.

Lamar Smith's (R-TX)Immigration in the National Interest Act (HR 2202) would eliminate severalpreferences that currently permit naturalized US citizens to bring theirextended families to the US. The reduced number of immigration slots for extended family members wouldbe offset, for at least five years, by adding slots for the immediate familymembers of legal immigrants to enter the US. Smith's Immigration in theNational Interest Act, and Sen. Alan Simpson's Immigration Control andFinancial Responsibility Act (S 269), have cleared the respectivesubcommittees. Because of national interest in immigration and bipartisan support, thebills are expected to move quickly through the House and Senate. The biggestbattles are expected to be over how much to reduce legal immigration, and howstrictly to regulate immigrant and other workers' access to the US labormarket. One effect of these proposed changes in US immigration law would be to addclose family slots that are typically used by Mexicans and Latin Americans toenter the US, and reduce the number of extended family unification slots oftenused by Asians to immigrate. Asian groups have led the charge against theproposed elimination of slots for adult children and brothers and sisters of UScitizens 21 and older--1.3 million or 54 percent of the 2.4 million persons onimmigration waiting lists are reportedly from Asia, including 500,0000 from thePhilippines (Asia has 60 percent of the world's population). According to some Asians, the proposed changes in the family unificationsystem are unfair, since the extended family members in Asia have been waitingto immigrate legally, while many of the Mexicans who would benefit from extraslots to eliminate the backlog for the unification of immediate families hadfamily members who came to the US illegally, and then received anamnesty. Both the Senate and House bills would increase the size of the BorderPatrol, and add INS and labor inspectors to enforce employer sanctions. TheHouse dropped a provision that would have permitted the federal government toseize the assets of employers who habitually hire illegal aliens, and added aprovision that permits the use of testers to determine if an employer isdiscriminating against ethnic minorities. Farm employers are worried about the additional enforcement resources,fearing that their enactment might lead to farm labor shortages. Neither billincludes an agricultural guest worker program, although Rep Gallegly (R-CA) andSenator Kyl (R-AZ) have indicated that they will propose such a program whenthe full Judiciary committees consider immigration legislation thisfall. The Clinton administration is considering a proposal that would givespecial immigration status to Vietnamese in Southeast Asian refugee camps. Themeasure must be approved by Vietnam and would expand the Lautenberg Amendment,which gives preferential treatment to Soviet Jews and others. Under the plan, refugees would be guaranteed a review of their applicationfor refugee resettlement in the US if they return to Vietnam from camps in HongKong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. About 41,000 refugeeswould be eligible for a review under this plan, although it is unknown how manywould be allowed to eventually come to the US. Most have had theirapplications for recognition as refugees eligible for resettlement rejected. "US to Speed Process of Becoming a Citizen," September 2, 1995.

Some say that immigrant elderly are dependenton these federal programs because they arrived so late in life in the US, e.g.,in their 50s and 60s, so that they had too little US work history to accrue USpension rights. If the federal government eliminates welfare eligibility for legalimmigrants, counties such as Los Angeles fear that they may have to pick up thecost of supporting poor immigrants, so they asked the California stategovernment for permission to deny benefits to legal immigrants as well. Under House proposals, legal aliens over 75 who have resided in the UnitedStates for at least five years will remain eligible for federal benefits, aswill refugees who have been in the US less than five years. The US-sponsors ofimmigrants would be legally liable to support the immigrants whom theypetitioned to bring into the US. Los Angeles county has about 10 million residents, and one-third of thenon-elderly residents did not have health insurance in 1992--elderly residentsare covered by the federal Medicare program. Another 20 percent of thenon-elderly population is covered by MediCal, a federal-state program thatprovides health care for poor people. Faced with a $1.2 billion county deficit for 1995-96, half of which camefrom health care, Los Angeles proposed closing the county hospital, one of thelargest employers in a poor section of the city/county. The proposed shutdowngenerated protests from residents who depended on the complex for jobs, andfrom immigrants who rely on the facility for health care. Los Angeles has been fingerprinting applicants for general relief since1991, and applicants for AFDC since 1994. In 1995, New York City followedsuit, requiring fingerprints of applicants for Home Relief. Fingerprints aretaken electronically, with a machine similar to that used by the Border Patrolto obtain fingerprints from apprehended illegal aliens. As a result of thefingerprinting requirement in New York, about five percent of currentrecipients are no longer receiving payments. The GAO in early September criticized the administrators of the $22 billionper year Supplemental Security Income program for not doing enough to crackdown on middlemen who, for a fee, help immigrants to feign mental illness sothat they can obtain SSI benefits. The Clinton administration is screening persons who obtain housingassistance to prevent illegal aliens from receiving housing assistance.Illegal aliens have been barred from most federal housing programs since 1980,but final regulations to screen them out of the one million public housingunits nationwide were issued only on June 19, 1995. Federal housing assistanceis reserved for people who earn less than 50 percent of the median income of anarea. "GAO: US slow to crack down on immigrants defrauding SSI," AP, September4, 1995.

Many refugees in Canada are single men, who become immigrants and apply tohave their families join them--children younger than 19 or students, spouses,fiancés, parents and grandparents. In some cases, processing their applications, and receiving refugee status,requires several years. Additional time is then necessary to process familymembers. Professional immigrants in Canada face high rates of unemployment aftertheir arrival, and many are on welfare. According to Statistics Canada, mostnew immigrants are visible minorities from Third World countries who have ahigher education level than the Canadian population as a whole but are muchless likely to be employed, particularly in professional jobs. Employers,professional immigrants report, demand "Canadian experience," which they do nothave. Canada has reduced its annual immigration intake from 250,000 to 210,000 in1995, but polls indicate that 70 percent of Canadians want immigration cut backfurther. Canada also imposed a $975 per immigrant fee on arriving immigrants that isexpected to generate $150 million per year. Under a proposal drafted with the help of Vice President Gore's NationalPerformance Review, the U.S. border with Canada eventually would become an openborder, with no inspections. If enacted, persons arriving from "low risk"countries would fly into domestic airport gates, and enter the US withoutinspection. Foreign air travelers would no longer have to provide a USaddress, and the forms now required of arriving passengers would bediscontinued. The Administration quickly distanced itself from the recommendation,rejecting the open border concept as "blue-sky thinking."

Dole also attacked bilingual education, arguing that schoolsshould conduct regular classes in English. The entire 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also agreed to rehear an earlierdecision by a small group of 9th Circuit Court judges that found Arizona'sofficial English amendment to be unconstitutional. US English had filed theamicus brief earlier this year, arguing that the panel of judges hadmisinterpreted the amendment. A rehearing en banc means that 11 judges of the9th Circuit will reconsider the issue and decide anew whether the Arizonaamendment is consistent with the US Constitution. US English, founded by Sen. S.I. Hayakawa of California, has over 600,000members devoted to amending the US Constitution to make English the officiallanguage of the US. According to US English, if English were the officiallanguage, government activities would be conducted in English, except for thejudicial, health, and emergency services, which could use appropriate languagesto carry out their functions. Some 21 states, and many cities, have madeEnglish their official language. The governor of Maryland said he will veto a watered-down version of a billthat would have made English the official language of Maryland. In vetoing thelegislation he said that he felt the measure would be "punitive" to non-Englishspeaking immigrants. There are currently five bills in Congress that would make English theofficial language of the US and to end public support for bilingual education.Each of the four bills before the House Committee on Educational and EconomicOpportunity establish English as the nation's official language.

The big question is how many ex-Yugoslavs can be returned from the sixEuropean states in which most live--Germany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,and Switzerland. Germany announced it will resume repatriation of Croatian warrefugees in the first week of September because the situation in Croatia hasstabilized. Most of the Yugoslavs who left the region after 1992 received TemporaryProtected Status, not a refugee status. This means that, in theory, when TPSstatus is withdrawn, "tolerated" Yugoslavs become illegal aliens subject todeportation. However, in many countries, it is very difficult to get agreement on whento end TPS status, and then to enforce returns. For example, in Germany, theInterior Ministry has declared Turkey safe for Kurdish asylum seekers whoseapplications have been rejected, but several SPD-governed states have refusedto deport Kurds. Several German states have announced that they will notdeport in 1995 any rejected asylum seekers who have lived in Germany eightyears or more. It is also not clear if the Bosnian, Serb, and Croatian governments willpunish returning nationals who failed to fulfill their military obligations byfleeing to Europe. For example, Sweden is returning war resisters to Serbia,but Switzerland is not. There are about 500,000 Bosnians outside the ex-Yugoslavia, including300,000 in Germany, 100,000 in Austria, and 50,000 in Sweden. Perhaps 10percent of them have Croatian passports, and they may be forced to leaveGermany on September 15, when TPS for Croatians expires. "Germany to resume repatriation of Croatian war refugees," DeutschePresse-Agentur, September 1, 1995. _________________________________________ AustrianImmigration Austria is a country of eight million that includes 10 percent or about800,000 foreigners. Austria has evolved from a country through which persons seeking asylumtransited to a country of destination for refugees, but Austria changed itslaws and procedures in a way that grants most new arrivals who need protectionTPS rather than refugee status. The number of asylum applications in Austria peaked at 35,000 mostly Polesin 1981, fell to about 6,000 in the mid-1980s as a result of requiring visasfor Poles, and then rose steadily to top 25,000 in 1991. Most of the early1990s asylum applicants were from the ex-Yugoslavia. In June 1992, a new asylum law went into effect, and the number of asylumseekers dropped from 2,000 per month to about 500 per month. Virtually allasylum applications are filed as aliens enter Austria. Most first decisionsare made within one to three months, and final decisions within three to sixmonths, with less than 10 percent of the applicants eventually granted asylumin Austria. As in many other European nations, Austria grants TPS rather than refugeestatus to the 50,000 to 100,000 persons from the ex-Yugoslavia in the country.Austria spent about $125 million per year in 1993 and 1994 to care for YugoslavTPS residents, and these costs were about 85 percent of Austrian expenditureson refugees and asylum in 1994. Bosnians seeking TPS must apply at an official border entry post, and aresent back to any safe country through which they passed en route to Austria toapply for asylum there. Austria in June 1995 extended TPS for Bosnians in thecountry until June 1996. Austria has separate work and residence permit systems, administered bydifferent agencies, and with separate quotas. This means that a foreigner canhave a work permit but not be entitled to live in Austria, and viceversa. In Austria, a foreigner can lose a "secure" work permit if his housingbecomes insufficient. Similarly, the holder of an "unlimited" work permitvalid for five years can lose it if he was unemployed more than half thetime. There is a great deal of administrative discretion in handling migrationmatters. For example, courts overturned a case in which a foreigner was notallowed to naturalize because he had once distributed leaflets to protest hisdismissal from his job--the naturalization authorities rejected his applicationon the grounds that he had acted against Austrian interests, while the courtsheld that leafleting was merely free speech. As in many other European countries, Austrian political parties disagree onwhat immigration policy should be. For example, the Greens argue that rapeshould be grounds for granting asylum in Austria, and that family unificationshould not be limited by annual quotas. Instead of quotas, Austria and mostother European countries limit family unification by requiring the establishedhead of the household to have sufficient income and living space to supportfamily members wishing to immigrate. The Austrian government has come under increasing criticism for its failureto stop terrorist attacks on Austrians of foreign decent and those who havespoken out against the growing right wing activities. The most recent attackwas in mid-June, and the police have not determined who committed the attack.A Social Democratic-Conservative coalition drafted legislation to give lawenforcement more powers including wiretapping and electronic surveillance. The Austrian construction company BAU Holding plans to employ Portugueseworkers in Austria at a lower rate of pay than is paid to Austrian workers.This is believed to be a violation of Austrian law, which states that foreignworkers must be paid comparable wages if they are employed more than one monthfor in Austria.

During the first six months of 1995, some 58,700 foreigners applied forasylum in Germany, down about seven percent from 1994 levels. Almostone-fourth of the 1995 asylum applications were Turks, and another 25 percentwere from nationals of ex-Yugoslavia. Germany plans to reduce cash payments to asylum seekers by 20 percent, andto provide more in-kind benefits. On July 1, 1995, the backlog of asylum cases waiting for decisions was75,000, down from 500,000 in July 1993. Germany forcibly returned 35,000rejected asylum seekers in 1994, and 12,000 in the first six months of 1995.Courts differ on whether states can detain foreigners awaitingdeportation. The number of aliens apprehended at Germany's borders fell from about30,000 in 1994, versus 55,000 in 1993. In the first seven months of 1995, some8000 aliens were apprehended on the German-Polish border; 52 percent wereRomanians, and an average 60 Romanians are returned to Romania everyday. Germany is adding 500 Border agents to the current 4,800 on its easternborders with Poland and the Czech Republic. About 84 percent of the illegalimmigrants were caught along Germany's border with Poland and the CzechRepublic. In 1994, right-wing violence in Germany declined, but the number of violentacts committed by foreigners living in Germany increased. There were 1,500right wing violent acts recorded in 1994, and half involved violence againstforeigners. Foreigners living in Germany committed 262 politically-motivatedviolent acts in 1994, up from 195 in 1993. After an August wave of firebomb attacks against Turkish businesses inGermany, the Turkish prime Minister called upon the German government toprovide better protection. Interior Minister Kanther, considered a hard-liner on immigration issues,announced in August that he would support reducing from 15 to 10 years theresidency requirement to apply for naturalization. If foreigners wishing tobecome naturalized Germans know German, Kanther would also reduce theadministrative flexibility that the government currently has to denynaturalization on the grounds that it is not in Germany's interest for someoneto naturalize. Some 121,500 ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan left for Germany in 1994, and300,000 ethnic Russians left the Central Asian republic of 17 million. Thenumber of ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan fell from 960,000 to 526,000. Stalinmoved ethnic Germans from the Volga River and the southern Ukraine toKazakhstan in retaliation for their alleged collaboration with the Nazis inWorld War II. Kazakh is now the official language of Kazakhstan, andnon-Kazakhs complain of discrimination. The governments of two of Germany's 16 most populous states,Baden-Wurtemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, have proposed extending localvoting rights to non-German residents. In Berlin, the government estimates that it loses up to $700 millionannually in cigarette taxes as mostly rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers sellcigarettes that are smuggled into the country. Germany has pledged $142million to Vietnam in the form of individual grants and government aid to getVietnam to agree to take 40,000 Vietnamese back. The number of jobless workers who have been registered as unemployed forone year or more rose in 1995 to 835,000--or one-third of all the unemployed inthe former West Germany. The government has proposed that employers who hirelong-term jobless workers receive wage subsidies for two or more years, up fromthe current one year. The debate over Entsenderichtlinie--the posting of a foreign firm's workersin the German construction industry continued (August MN). There are also about140,000 unemployed German construction workers, representing about 10 percentof the 1.5 million persons employed in German construction. There are about 150,000 legal foreign construction workers inGermany--100,000 from other EU nations, and 50,000 from Eastern Europe. The German government wants to require the foreign workers posted toGermany by their firms to be paid German wages upon their arrival at Germanconstruction sites. The minimum hourly wage in German construction is DM 20.24($13); the total hourly costs for German construction laborers have beenestimated to be $35 in Germany, $31 in the US, and $14 and $12 in the UK andSpain. Germany's unions have endorsed proposals to require foreign workers to bepaid minimum German wages in construction for two years, but the proposalcannot go into effect until German employers agree that industry-wideagreements between unions and employers also apply to non-participatingemployers, such as those who hire non-German EU workers. The metal industryassociation, which includes autos and auto parts, opposes setting a precedentof applying union wages to non-association employers, for fear that its DM18minimum wage may be affected. Even if the equal wage law is approved in Germany this fall, some Germanemployers, or British or Spanish workers or firms, may ask the EU Court ofJustice to declare the proposed Entsenderichtlinie contrary to EU freedom ofmovement guarantees. The president of the German Craft Association was discovered in August tohave employed Romanian construction workers in Munich whose work permits hadexpired on July 31, 1995. Under so-called Werkvertrage, German firms makecontracts with Eastern European firms to supply both workers and other elementsnecessary to complete particular parts of projects. The German president'sfirm--despite the president's public statements against foreign constructionworkers who are paid less than Germans--was accused of violating Germany'semployer sanctions law. In response the employer asserted that all firms competing for publicconstruction contracts must employ foreign workers for up to 50 percent oftheir proposed work forces; winning bids sometimes include even higherpercentages of foreign workers. Critics noted that the proposed regulations would not affect the estimated500,000 illegal workers in the German construction industry, including 200,000from EU countries who enter as tourists and then go to work without getting thenecessary work permits to which they are entitled. In Berlin, authorities announced that Bosnians with TPS would be grantedone-year residence permits rather than six-month Duldung permits so that morecould find jobs and support themselves.

The International Centre for Migration Policy Development in Viennaserves as secretariat to the conference. The ICMPD estimated that labor smugglers grossed between $100 million and$1 billion taking some 300,000 aliens illegally across borders and into WesternEurope for $2,000 to $5,000 each in 1994. According to ICMPD estimates, halfof all long-term foreign entrants to Western Europe--aside from tourists andbusiness visitors--are asylum applicants without legitimate claims toprotection and illegal entrants. Alien smuggling in Europe has both a south-north and an east-westcharacter. In 1993-94, some 12,000 alien smugglers, and 125,000 aliens, wereapprehended by governments in Eastern Europe. Many aliens from Asia and Africa believe that, for a price double or triplethe usual ticket, they can get into Germany or Sweden and obtain work orwelfare. Many are flown by smugglers to Romania or Bulgaria, countries thatpermit the nationals of most counties to enter without visas, and then aredriven across eastern Europe. Another route is to go by boat from Albania toItaly. Governments have three major modes of attacking alien smuggling. First,there are general migration control laws and regulations, such as visarequirements and guards to enforce them. Second are internal controls,including employer sanctions to prevent illegal aliens from working, laws tocombat the use of false documents, and penalties on smugglers and aliens.Third are readmission/extradition agreements to facilitate the return ofpersons apprehended. There are two major ways to deal with illegal migration. The so-calledisland strategy is to have tight entry controls, and freedom from registrationand employer sanctions within the country. The so-called continental strategyis to recognize that, among the millions who pour across borders, some areillegal aliens, and then prevent them from settling with registration andemployer sanctions systems. Most European countries make most aspects of illegal migration criminaloffenses punishable by jail terms. For example, most countries have laws thatpermit them to jail persons who enter without inspection--often from one tothree years-- and persons who facilitate illegal entries, whether smugglersproviding assistance for money, or friends and family. About half of the European countries permit the confiscation of cars, vans,and money used by or found on smugglers, but many punish only smugglers who arephysically present on their territory, so that, e.g., a Pole who organized thesmuggling of aliens through Germany and into France, but did not accompanythem, is not guilty of smuggling in any country. In many cases, the penaltiesactually levied are only a fraction of the maximum punishment, and there arefew laws that provide for the compounding of penalties if e.g., severalimmigration and labor laws are violated simultaneously. Forms have been developed on which countries report (1) the number andnationality of persons refused entry--Hungary denied entry to more than twomillion aliens between 1991 and 1995-- and the number apprehended; (2) thenumber and nationality of resident illegals; and (3) the number and nationalityof alien smugglers caught. These data are to be used to develop aEuropean-wide data bank on alien smuggling. Fewer than 500 Bangladeshis applied for asylum in Europe in 1994, but whenit was rumored falsely in June that Portugal would be granting an amnesty, some500 traveled by bus to Portugal and applied for residence permits.

France has been chartering planes to return rejected asylum seekers toRomania and Africa, although it is reported that most of the 100 Malians senthome by charter flight in 1986 are back in France. In 1994, only 80 percentof the foreigners ordered out of France actually were expelled. The Frenchgovernment hopes that better cooperation between the police, the courts andprisons will increase the number deported. The French government has also proposed an increase in placements indetention camps, closer surveillance of work sites, higher employer sanctionsand increased cooperation with sending nations. France is dealing with complications resulting from regulations intended todeter immigration. For example, local mayors can refuse to approve marriages,and if they wrongly do so, can the foreign-French couple may be able to sue fordamages. Children in France do not need residence permits until they reach 18. Insome cases, parents brought children to France illegally, had them educated inFrance, and then the child learned at age 18 that he/she is not entitled to aresidence permit because e.g., the parents' application for family unificationwas originally rejected on the grounds that sufficient housing was notavailable. Since 1993, such children at age 18 can have their statusregularized only if they can prove that they arrived in France before the ageof six. The French Council d'Etat in July declared that the French governmentcannot ban all head scarves. Instead, each school administrator is to decidewhich head scarves are ostentatious and thus banned. France is grappling with an increase in asylum applications from Bosnians.On August 20, an eight-year old Bosnian boy was shot when the car he was ridingin attempted to illegally enter France at the Italian border. France has20,000 persons from the former Yugoslavia; Germany has 350,000. According to Luc Legoux of the Sorbonne University in "The Political AsylumCrisis in France," the French have spent the last 10 years dealing with acrisis in political asylum--asylum applications peaked at 60,000 in 1989. Thenumber of political asylum requests then dropped because the French rejectedmost applications. That resulted in a decline in the number of unjustifiedcases and a drop in the number of requests that are based onpersecution.

About one third of the 66,000 persons stopped entering theUK in 1994 were denied entry. British Home Secretary Michael Howard has proposed that employers be finedfor hiring illegal immigrants. The proposal was given a cool reception byimmigration advocates and industry leaders. Under the plan, it would be a criminal offense to hire illegal immigrantswithout proper work visas. A simple verification process may be implemented toensure that a worker has an authentic National Insurance number. Immigration officials say that because the National Insurance numbers areeasy to obtain, it would not be an effective means to cut employment of illegalaliens. The government had proposed issuing cards for benefit claims and addinga photograph to driver's licenses, but criticism of those proposals resulted intheir withdrawal. British immigration officers found 51 illegal immigrants in a truckarriving from France. The illegal aliens were shipped straight back to France.When reporters followed the immigrants, they found that the illegal immigrantstried immediately to sneak back into Britain. The illegal immigrants paid North African Arabs L1,000 per person for twoentry attempts. Nearly 3,000 trucks a day pass through Dover, giving smugglersmany opportunities gain entry illegally into Britain. Apprehensions haveincrease from 500 for all of 1994 to 600 between January and July 1995. The British government banned the employment of Polish au pairs, but willcontinue to allow au pairs from 11 Central and Eastern European nations. Thegovernment is particularly concerned with increasing number of Poles refusedentry. Last year, of the 141,000 Polish entrants to the UK, 2,000 were refusedentry, and over 500 were detained as illegal immigrants or overstayers. The UK is one of the few European countries in which asylum applicationsare rising--there were 28,000 in 1993, 41,000 in 1994, including dependents.Half were Africans. Two-thirds of British asylum seekers enter the UK astourists or students and then apply for asylum. There is a backlog of 56,000asylum applications in the UK.

The two countriessay that the quotas will allow them to protect the rights of migrants andprevent the forcible relocation of people. About 143,500 people left Kyrgyzstan in 1993, and more than one-third ofthe emigrants moved to Russia. About 49,500 left in 1994, but only 5,000 leftin the first half of 1995. Russia has one of the longest border's in the world--about 37,000 miles,and 200,000 Federal Border Guards, one of the largest border patrols in theworld. But officials complain that, especially on the Chinese-Russian border,visa-free short-term entry has led to an estimated 200,000 to 800,000 legal andillegal Chinese residents. The Russian Federal Migration Services said theyexpect nearly three million migrants from Central Asia over the next severalyears. Russian officials are expecting that the rise of Chinese immigrants will beoffset by an influx in about five million ethnic Russians from the formerSoviet republics over the next three to four years. Many of the immigrants aremoving to central and southern regions competing for the few jobs in the area. European governments, as well as the US and Canada, are providing training,vehicles, and some assistance to help Eastern European nations and Russiacombat illegal immigration and alien smuggling. However, as the westernnations tighten their immigration and asylum systems, and as countries such asHungary and Poland become richer, they become destinations in their own rightfor asylum seekers from Sri Lanka and other countries who previously onlytransited through Eastern Europe to the west. Russia has an early retirement age--55 for women and 65 for men--andconsequently, about 25 percent of Russia's 150 million people are in retirementage. But at least eight million of the 37 million people of retirement agestill work to supplement pensions that average 200,000 rubles ($45) permonth. There are an estimated 24,000 villages with fewer than 1,000 residents inRussia, down from 73,000 in 1960 as young people abandon farms for cities.More than half of the population of these villages is 65 and older.

Most the foreigners arefrom Russia, the Ukraine, and Belarus. Many work as nannies, gardeners,housekeepers, and in construction throughout Poland, others work seasonally inagriculture in eastern Poland. A proposed law will force foreigners wishing to enter Poland to demonstratethat they have enough money to cover their living and travel expenses. Thoseforeigners found illegally employed would be sent to a border crossing point orheld in special prisons. Anyone deported from Poland would not be allowed tore-enter for at least two years. The proposed law would also prohibit foreigners who passed through safethird countries from applying for asylum in Poland. The new regulations also include a six-month temporary visitor's card thatcould be extended for only one more six-month period. Anyone wishing to staylonger would have to apply to the provincial government for the right to staybetween one and 10 years. After three years of lawful residence, a foreigner could apply forpermanent residence, which would be the first step to Polish citizenship.Currently, foreigners enter Poland only on the basis of personal invitationsissued by Polish citizens. Under the new regulations, the provincial governorwould approve the invitation if the inviting person can meet any costs incurredby the visitor during the stay. If approved, the bill would become effectivein 1996. About 10,000 Vietnamese go to Poland every year with the intent to becomepermanent residents, according to the Polish Bureau for Immigration andRefugees. Many of the Vietnamese run restaurants or sell Vietnamese goods atbazaars. Many Vietnamese believe that their opportunities are better in Polandthan in Vietnam. Polish officials believe that Hanoi is trying to turn Poland into a transitcountry for Vietnamese people and products by influencing the numbers ofVietnamese going to Poland. Many Vietnamese arrive at the Polish border withofficial passports which exempt them from visa restrictions. They thenexchange them for personal passports, which makes it easier to obtain permanentresidency permits.

These resident foreignersincluded about 677,000 Koreans, 218,000 Chinese, 160,000 Brazilians, and 86,000Filipinos. Osaka has asked Japan's central government to pay some of the costs oflegal and illegal immigrants who received care, but failed to pay their bills.In some cases, illegal foreign workers were brought to hospitals in ambulances,and patients who promised to pay their bills after their release disappearedwithout paying. Only foreigners with visas that permit them to live in Japanfor a year or longer are eligible for coverage under the public medicalinsurance system. Japan's unemployment rate remained at the historically high level of 3.1percent in June 1995, and would have been at least two percent higher if notfor the lifetime employment tradition of large Japanese companies. Over the past 10 years Japan began to see more visible minorities, such asFilipinos, Pakistanis, Iranians and Africans, in their country. Foreignerscommit fewer crimes on average than the Japanese. Most foreign workers want toearn money, then return home. Discrimination against dark-skinned foreigners is common. Less thanone-tenth of the landlords will rent to a Pakistani or Iranian. Policefrequently ask blacks for their identification. Separately, the Japanese government reported that the number of Japaneseliving elsewhere in Asia reached 110,000 in 1994, up sharply from 70,000 in1988. The number of Japanese living in North America was 277,000 in 1994, downfrom the peak 281,000 in 1991.

Between 6,000 and 9,000 illegal immigrant workers are held at ninecamps around Malaysia. The Malaysian government has admitted that about 40 illegal immigrants havedied during the last 18 months in a detention camp near Kuala Lumpur. Some ofthe deaths were the result of beri beri or typhoid infections associated withmalnutrition or unsanitary conditions. The government said that many of the dead were Bangladeshis who arrived inMalaysia on foot from Thailand and were exhausted, although reports say thatmost had been in the camps more than six months. The Bangladeshi governmentcalled upon the Malaysian government to provide details of the deaths of 28Bangladeshis in the detention camps. There are nearly 3,000 Bangladeshisawaiting deportation in nine detention centers in Malaysia. The Malaysian government in response temporarily halted the recruitment ofBangladeshi workers. It was reported that Bangladeshis were paying $3,200 inDhaka to recruitment agents for jobs that paid $80 per month in Malaysia,suggesting that the Bangladeshi workers were expecting to stay in Malaysia forseveral years. Following criticism about worker exploitation by private recruitment firms,the Malaysian government's Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers announced onAugust 2 that employment agencies would no longer be allowed to recruit foreignworkers, except for domestic workers and shop assistants. Any contractualagreements between recruitment firms and foreign workers already in the countrywere declared null and void. The new policy may result in bankruptcy for mostof 169 Malaysian recruitment agencies. On August 30, the government announced that it was readying guidelines foremployers to recruit foreign workers directly in Thailand, Bangladesh,Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan under the terms of bilateral agreementsexpected to be concluded with these countries. Malaysian employers who receivepermission to employ foreign workers will apply to each country's employmentservice to obtain foreign workers, much as the German guest worker systemhandled recruitment in the 1960s.

Agovernment study will be conducted to examine where labor shortages areoccurring and how social problems caused by foreign workers should be handled. According to employers, fisheries need unskilled foreign labor, while thechemical, petrochemical and electrical sectors need foreign engineers. TheEmployment Department of Thailand announced on July 10 that it would begin acrackdown on illegal foreign workers, who are blamed for much of the crime andtheft in the country. A workers' group in Thailand asked the government to adopt an eight-pointprogram to protect Thai workers. One protection would be to prevent the entryof foreign workers. Employers have asked the government to create a special economic area nearthe Thai-Burmese border, known as Zone 4. Under the proposal, foreign workerscould be employed at low wages. According to employers, there are no Thaiworkers in the area. According to workers organizations, the local workersrefuse to work because of low wages. Since mid-December, up to 10,000 ethnic minority Karen people from Burmahave fled to Thailand. The Burmese government forces launched an offensiveagainst the autonomy-seeking Karen guerrillas in the southeast of the country.About 80,000 displaced Burmese are in Thailand. To encourage Laotian and Vietnamese refugees to voluntarily return home,the Thai government has closed shops, restaurants, cinemas, curbed economicactivities, and frozen cash remittances from abroad. There are approximately10,000 Laotians and 6,000 Vietnamese in the three camps. Most of the Vietnamese in Thailand arrived after 1989 and never receivedrefugee status. The Laotians arrived before 1985 and are officially refugees.About one-third of the Laotians are Hmong who turned down an earlieropportunity to be resettled in third countries, including the US. About 5,000 Bangladeshi illegal immigrants are believed to be hiding inThai forests with plans to enter Malaysia to look for jobs. They were givenfalse documents in Bangladesh, and promised jobs. The Thai textile producers association asked the government to permit theemployment of workers from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to lower their costs andto reduce illegal immigration.

Chapter 10 deals with international migration. The report says that "atleast 125 million people live outside their countries of origin," and that morethan half of these migrants are in developing nations (p. 65). According to the World Bank, both emigration and immigration nationsgenerally benefit from migration. The benefits of migration to sendingcountries are remittances that enable migrant families to diversify theirrisks--if the crops fail, at least the family will have remittances to liveon.

Threatened People,Threatened Borders: World Migration and US Policy. New York: Norton. The 86th American Assembly brought together 54 persons interested inmigration and refugee issues November 10-13 in New York to consider how US.migration policies should respond to a changing world. Many questions wereraised, from whether US. foreign policies increase, decrease, or have no effecton migration flows, to why acceptance of immigrants seems to vary across theUS., (for example, in New York political leaders have welcomed " hard-workingillegal immigrants", while in LA virtually all political leaders have pledgedto do more to reduce illegal immigration). Organizers framed the discussion around three sets of questions. First, isthe US. policy of permitting the settlement of almost all foreigners who arriveseeking safe haven viable? Second, does continuing illegal immigrationthreaten the US. policy of extending to immigrants many of the same benefitsavailable to citizens? Third, could a UN agency engage in "humanitarianintervention" to prevent mass or unpredictable emigration? What makes these questions difficult is that all represent tradeoffsbetween good or desirable goals. For example, if the US is generous to personsseeking safe haven, can it later persuade persons who were temporarilyprotected in the US to return to often poorer countries that the US considerssafe? There was much discussion of the "perception" that immigration imposescosts on Americans and American society, implying that there may not be a tradeoff between the number of newcomers and the costs of adjusting to them. Butone of the few principles of migration is that immigration occurs in waves,implying peaks and troughs--it is very hard to find a country or region thatadded one percent or more to its population via immigration for more than onegeneration. Although adjustment costs may be hard to estimate, since they may notinclude only measurable items such as taxes paid and benefits received, theyare real, and, if ignored, they can produce an anti-immigrant backlash thatdoes reduce immigration levels. Finally, there was considerable discussion of the costs and benefits ofhaving a supra-national authority responsible for preventing mass migrations.Does the US want to pay all of the costs associated with a Haiti emergency, andthen call the shots, or share the costs, and perhaps have to modify itspolicies? All of these tradeoffs echo one theme: a country can have more immigrants,or better conditions and benefits for immigrants, but rarely both. As a nation open to immigration, the US. must answer the three fundamentalimmigration questions: how many, from where, and in what status shouldnewcomers be admitted? US. foreign policy has influenced the answers to thesequestions for the past half century: virtually all persons leaving communistcountries were accepted as refugees in order to "embarrass" those countries anddemonstrate US. superiority. Once established in the US, "trans-national communities" use the familyunification-based US. immigration system to admit more immigrants from theircountries of origin. In this manner, the US has established migration flowsfrom Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia. Perhaps the clearest point of agreement was that the immigrationconsequences of foreign policy decisions can no longer be ignored. It wasagreed that, before the US unleashes foreign policy instruments from trade toaid to intervention, their migration consequences should be considered. The nine-chapter book includes overview chapters and at least sevenperspectives on the linkages between US foreign policy and the presence in theUS of refugees and immigrants. Most of the authors are sympathetic to refugeesand immigrants, meaning that they do not believe that the presence of refugeesand immigrants in the US raises insurmountable problems, only the PERCEPTION ofserious problems. _________________________________________ CIIPWorkshop On August 31, 1995 the Comparative Immigration and Integration Program ofthe UC Center for German and European Studies held a workshop on ImmigrationIssues in Germany and the US: Challenges and Options. The circumstances over which foreigners enter and stay in industrialdemocracies such as Germany and the US are a major issue at the end of the 20thcentury, just as they were at the beginning. Among the most contentious issuesare asylum--how to deal with persons who arrive in a country and ask to stay onthe grounds that, if they return to their country of citizenship, they willface political persecution--and guest workers, foreign workers who are to liveand work only temporarily in the host country. Asylum Germany's constitution includes an individual and enforceable right to stayin Germany while an application for asylum because the individual would facepolitical persecution at home is considered. The number of asylum applicationsjumped in the early 1990s, peaking at 438,000 in 1992, as migrant workersjoined genuine asylum applicants in a system that was taking three to fiveyears to reach the decision that 95 percent of all applicants were not entitledto asylum in Germany. A combination of costs, anti-foreigner violence, and the reality that manyforeigners were abusing the asylum process to immigrate to Germany led in 1992to a political compromise that left in place an individual constitutional rightto apply for asylum in Germany, but added a clause that denied nationals of EUmember nations, and persons who transited through a "safe third country" enroute to Germany access to the constitutional guarantee. The German Bundestaggenerates the list of safe third countries. Germany also adopted the safe country of origin concept. If an asylumapplicant is from a country that is presumed not to persecute its citizens forpolitical reasons, applicants from such countries can be sent home while theirapplications are considered. As soon as the German Bundestag put Poland,Hungary, and Romania on the safe country of origin list, the number ofapplications from these countries dropped sharply. Since Germany is surrounded by EU nations and safe third countries, theonly asylum applicants after this new asylum provision went into effect in July1993 should have been the 6,000 applicants who applied at Germany airports.But almost 140,000 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany in 1994, and asimilar number of applications is expected in 1995. There are several reasons why there are still an average 350 applicationsfor asylum daily in Germany is that Germany must prove that the applicant infact transited through a safe third countries en route to Germany. Since manyapplicants assert that they were placed, e.g., in a truck and driven toGermany, and they have no idea of which countries they transited, Germanauthorities must prove that they in fact transited through safe thirdcountries. One court has gone much further, ruling that asylum applicants in Germanyhave the right to present arguments that designated safe countries are in factnot safe. If this interpretation of the asylum compromise is upheld, thenapplicants may soon learn that e.g., it is easy to stay in Germany while theirarguments that Poland or Greece are in fact not safe countries in which toapply for asylum. US refugee and asylum practices reflect cold war policies. The 1980Refugee Act was supposed to bring the US into line with other industrialdemocracies in its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, but experiencesuggests that, in fact, the US continues to grant asylum to persons fleeingregimes that the US opposes (Nicaragua in the 1980s), and to deny asylum topersons from friendly nations (El Salvador). There were about 150,000 asylum applications in 1994, one-fourth filed byGuatemalans. In January 1995, the INS by regulation tightened procedures to"prevent abuse" of the asylum system--applicants are denied work permits for180 days after their applications (unless they are granted asylum), and moreare detained while their applications are considered. The INS believes that these reforms have reduced frivolous applications,but proposals pending in Congress would go much further. Under one proposal,for example, applications for asylum would have to be filed within 30 days ofarriving in the US, and could not be filed by persons that the US is seeking todeport. In both the US and Germany, one indicator suggests that these reforms have"worked"--the number of asylum applications appears to be dropping. But thediscussion that followed produced assertions that these "temporary fixes" willbe undone by events, such as court interpretations in Germany that re-introducelengthy applications procedures. GuestWorkers Germany in the 1960s initiated guest worker programs with its southernneighbors from Turkey to Italy to Spain. Guest or foreign worker programs aimto add workers to the labor force without adding permanent residents to thepopulation, but the world wide experience with such programs has produced oneof the few "principles of migration" --there is nothing more permanent thantemporary foreign workers. Between 1960 and 1973, some 18.5 million foreigners arrived in Germany, andalmost 5 million settled in Germany. This means that most guest workersreturned to their countries of origin as planned, but employer requests toextend the stay of what were in fact probationary immigrants, plus familyunification, produced a stable foreign population in Germany in the1980s. This changed in 1989. The demise of communism, and an economic boom inGermany, led to a sharp increase in immigration. Germany responded, in partwith five new foreign worker programs. There are three major differences between the guest worker programs of the1960s that gave Germany a peak 2.6 million foreign workers in a labor force of26 million in 1973 and the guest worker programs that in 1995 may add the fulltime equivalent of 250,000 foreign workers to a labor force of 40 million. First, in the 1960s, there was a single program or procedure to bringforeign workers into Germany, and it responded primarily to the needs of Germanemployers--German employers needed more workers on assembly lines and atconstruction sites, and the German Employment Service helped them to findforeign workers by establishing recruitment and screening offices from Istanbulto Lisbon. In 1972, some one million guest workers entered Germany. In the 1990s, by contrast, there are at least five distinct programsthrough which perhaps 300,000 legal foreign workers enter Germany for three to24 months. These programs range from a seasonal program that permits foreignworkers to be employed up to 90 days in Germany, a project-tied program thatpermits e.g., a German company to subcontract with a Czech company to completepart of a construction program and the Czech company to send Czech workers toGermany. There are also smaller programs under which border commuters,trainees, and nurses enter Germany to work. Unlike the 1960s program, which were mostly a response to domestic laborshortages, these 1990s programs respond to two distinct impulses. First,German employers requests for additional labor--despite an unemployment rate ofnine percent--and second, the need of restructuring economies in Eastern Europeto find an outlet for especially young workers. Foreign policy played a very significant role in the decision to establishprograms through which seasonal farm workers, construction workers sent bytheir home firms to Germany, and trainees can work in Germany. In fact, someGermans point to the real bilateral nature of 1990s programs to explain whyPoland and the Czech Republic are willing to cooperate with Germany to reducethe movement of illegal aliens through their countries and into Germany--Polesand Czechs do not need visas to enter Germany. Second, in the 1990s there are several distinct programs. In other words,rather than trying to satisfy all of the domestic and foreign concerns with oneguest worker program, there are today separate programs for very short laborneeds, for workers sent abroad by their home-country employers, and fortrainees and border commuters. Each program has its own rules on recruitment,labor market testing, etc. Third, there is not yet a consensus on whether the current German programswill prove to be a substitute for or an addition to illegal immigration fromEastern Europe. In the early 1990s, when over 200,000 seasonal Poles and otherEast Europeans worked for up to 90 days in Germany, there was undoubtedly somesubstitution of legal for otherwise illegal workers. But it is not yet clear whether Germany's decision to permit perhaps onepercent--(500,000) of the 50 million workers in Eastern Europe to work legallyin Germany will in the long run increase or decrease illegal immigration. IfEastern Europe can develop quickly, offering jobs and higher wages, supply-pushemigration pressures will decrease. However, demand-pull pressures in Germany are likely to increase as aresult of economic integration in Western Europe and around the world. Thesearch for cheap labor by farmers and construction companies is likely topersist, and it is not yet clear whether the slowly-deregulated German labormarket can continue to keep illegal immigrants a smaller percentage of theGerman labor market than they are of the US labor market. A review of guest worker programs suggests that most were initiated inresponse to macro "emergency" or temporary situations-- the wartime in the US,what was believed to be the end of a fragile postwar economic recovery inEurope, and a construction boom in the Middle East. However, today's US andGerman programs are responding to micro labor market shortages, such as inagriculture and construction, or political considerations. Second, employers wanting guest workers usually succeed in getting them,largely because they can point to real and measurable benefits if foreignworkers are admitted, while opponents offer hypothetical arguments againsttheir admission, such as wage adjustments will eliminate the labor shortageeasily. Third, guest worker programs everywhere tend to operate close to planin their initial stages, tending to reinforce employers who want them and tosilence critics. BorderControl Every day, the INS apprehends about 3500 mostly Mexican aliens along theMexican-US border, about 1.3 million per year. In September 1993, a local INSCommissioner introduced a new policy of deterring illegal entry rather thanapprehending illegal aliens in the US, and in August 1994, the INS officiallyadopted this prevention of illegal immigration through deterring entry strategyby massing INS resources at the several points along the border where mostaliens attempt to enter illegally. In October 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper along a 14 milesection of the 2000 mile border that typically accounts for half of allapprehensions. Along the Mexican-US border south of San Diego, a steel-platewall, lights, and 1300 agents were arrayed in three lines, so as to discourageattempts to enter the US illegally. If aliens did succeed in entering, agentshoped to apprehend them before they could slip into populated areas. Apprehensions dropped in the San Diego area after Gatekeeper was launchedin the fall months of 1994, but have risen sharply in 1995, and are up 10percent in the first 10 months of FY95 versus FY94. There were almost 50,000apprehensions in July 1995. A careful examination of the data indicates that apprehensions dropped mostsharply in the areas of the border where the INS concentrated its resources,and rose sharply in other areas. In other words, aliens now make their firstattempts at illegal entry at places further east of San Diego, or make a firstattempt in the westernmost section, and subsequent attempts elsewhere. There are no definitive data that indicate whether the prevention throughdeterrence strategy is in fact reducing overall illegal immigration to the US.The INS is fingerprinting all of those apprehended in the San Diego area, andfinds that a steady 20 to 30 percent are recidivists, aliens who were caughtbefore. Some informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70 percent ofthem succeed in entering the US illegally on their first try. Surveys ofaliens in Mexico find that, even though most of those planning to enter the USillegally know about Gatekeeper, the INS operation is not deterring them fromplanning to attempt illegal entry. This suggests that the INS can indeed shift aliens attempting illegal entryalong the border, but it is not yet clear whether the INS can in factsignificantly change the overall flow of unauthorized aliens into the US. TheINS initially asserted that the effects of Gatekeeper would be apparent withinone year, but internal INS documents say that it will take five years to"reassert control" over the border by adding fences, lighting, and agents fromwest to east. The German data, by contrast, suggest that the major new controlmeasure--the 1993 asylum reform--also reduced illegal entries. There wereabout 35,000 illegal aliens apprehended in Germany in the first half of 1993,and 17,000 in the first half of 1994. However, the second half year comparisonshows a smaller difference--19,000 apprehended in the last six months of 1993,and 14,000 in the last six months of 1994--suggesting that in Germany aliensand their smugglers may be adapting to the new law.

In a speech to the American Legion, Republican presidential candidate BobDole proposed making English as the nation's official language, and pledged toend federal support bilingual education if elected president. Dole'sendorsement of "English-Only" highlighted the fact that 22 states have now madeEnglish their official language for conducting public proceedings. When he wasArkansas' governor, Clinton signed legislation in 1987 making English theofficial language of Arkansas. Some 180 representatives and 18 senators have sponsored legislation thatwould make English the "primary, but not the exclusive, language ofgovernment." Other proposals would eliminate federal support of bilingualeducation, and amend the US Constitution to make English the nation's officiallanguage. Colin Powell, son of Jamaican immigrants, asserted on September 18 thatillegal immigrants should not receive welfare and other government benefits,but maintained that their children should continue to be allowed to attend USschools. According to Powell, children born to illegal alien parents in the USshould continue to be US citizens from birth. The Clinton administration in early September urged Congress to separatelegal and illegal immigration in reform legislation. This was the approachtaken by the Senate, but the House combined legal and illegal immigrationreform in one bill, and the Senate decided to follow the lead of theHouse.

Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee continued to mark upits version of comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Although the Administration has not offered a bill, President Clinton hasannounced that he would like to sign immigration reform legislation in 1995.Sponsors are not confident, however, that Congress can approve reformlegislation by year end. The legislation moving through Congress would make at least five majorchanges. It would reduce immigration from about 800,000 per year to about535,000 by eliminating several preference categories, such as the adultbrothers and sisters of US citizens; reduce refugee admissions from about120,000 annually to 50,000; require family sponsors of immigrants to assumemore financial responsibility for them; establish a national registry of SocialSecurity and alien numbers to help employers verify who is eligible to work inthe US; and tighten restrictions on the ways US employers recruits immigrantsto fill vacant jobs. Family In 1994, 804,416 were immigrants admitted to the US. About 31 percent or250,000 were spouses, children, and parents of US citizens, who can enter assoon as their US citizen sponsors have their paper work approved by theImmigration and Naturalization Service the Department of State. Under proposedimmigration reforms, only the parents category, under which 56,000 foreignersentered, would be changed. Under other family preferences, 212,000 immigrant relatives were admittedin 1994. Four of the five family preference immigrant categories would beeliminated--those that permit unmarried adult children of US citizens and legalresidents to immigrate, married children of US citizens, and brothers andsisters of US citizens. If current proposals are approved, some 2.4 million foreigners waiting inqueues to enter the US on the basis of family ties would find the familyunification door to the US shut. There are another 1.1 million spouses and children of legal immigrantresidents waiting in a queue to come to the US. To expedite the unification ofnuclear families, the Commission on Immigration Reform and Congress proposedthat the number of slots for such family unification would be increased by upto 150,000 per year for at least five years. Of the 3.5 million persons waiting to immigrate, about 1 million areMexicans, and 500,000 are Filipinos, followed by India, China, and Vietnam. PermanentEconomic/Employment. Unlike the House, which made few changes to the system through whichimmigrants are admitted for economic/employment reasons, the Senate proposalfollows CIR recommendations and would reduce the number of permanent immigrantsadmitted for economic/employment reasons. It would require employers who wantpermanent immigrants to fill vacant jobs to pay fees into a fund that trains USworkers to fill these jobs. The CIR released its recommendations on economic/employment-basedimmigration on September 12. Under the CIR's recommendations, employers couldbring in up to 100,000 economic/employment immigrants, including familymembers, each year, down from the current 140,000, but above the FY94 demandfor permanent visas granted on the basis of achievement and work. Under the CIR's recommendations, instead of applying to DOL to prove thatthe employer tried to find US workers and failed, a process termed laborcertification that costs the US government about $60 million per year toadminister, employers wanting foreign workers would pay $7,000 to $10,000 perpermanent immigrant into a private fund that would train US workers to fillvacant jobs identified by employer requests for immigrants. Employers willing to pay these fees would be presumed to have searched andfailed to find US workers, and thus save the up to $10,000 they currently paylawyers to complete the labor certification process. In FY94, about 123,000 permanent immigrants were admitted under employmentpreferences. However, 30,000 of them were Chinese students who were allowed toadjust their status, plus unskilled immigrants. This means that only 93,000persons were admitted under the skilled preferences that would remain if CIRimmigration reforms were adopted -- well under the 100,000 annual quotaproposed by the CIR. Of those admitted in 1994, 55,000 or 60 percent werespouses and children of the principal worker for whom a visa was sought. The 38,000 "principal workers" admitted for employment reasons in FY94would have generated $380 million for the training fund had a fee of $10,000per worker been charged. SenateAction The Senate discussed an even sharper reduction in numbers--Sen. AlanSimpson's (R-WY) draft bill would admit only 75,000 economic/employmentpermanent immigrants each year. Employers wanting to obtain immigrants to fillvacant jobs would have to pay a fee equivalent to 30 percent of the firstyear's salary into a training fund. Some persons representing employers attacked thefee-in-lieu-of-certification proposal, arguing that employers now demonstratetheir need for foreign workers by their willingness to pay lawyers andconsultants thousands of dollars to navigate through the current laborcertification system. Houseof Representatives Action The House Judiciary Committee on September 18 began to mark up its versionof immigration reform. The House markup is proceeding slowly, and is notexpected to be completed until mid October. On September 21, the committee approved by a 17 to 15 vote the developmentof a national registry of authorized workers that would include their names,Social Security numbers and immigration data. US employers would be requiredto call a toll-free number, or establish a computer link, report the name andSocial Security number or alien number of newly hired workers, and then be toldwhether the worker was authorized to work. The US attorney general would be required to establish the nationalregistry within four years. If the registry said that the worker was notauthorized to work in the US, he or she would have two weeks to appeal theregistry's determination. The system approved by the committee would permit workers to present any ofsix documents to employers, but one congressman promised to introducelegislation that would specify a counterfeit-resistant Social Security card asthe universal work authorization document. Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) announced on September 20 that he would offer anamendment on the House floor that would exclude illegal alien children fromfree K-12 education, i.e., incorporate the Prop. 187 provision in USimmigration law. California estimates that 355,000 unauthorized children arein California schools in 1995-96, and that their education cost $1.7 billion,or $4,800 each. Steven Holmes, "Congress Plans Stiff new Curbs on Immigration," New YorkTimes, September 25, 1995; Seth Mydans, "Narrowing the US Immigration Gate,"New York Times, September 24, 1995 _________________________________________ ImmigrationReform and GuestWorkers On September 28, the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration held a hearing onguest workers and other temporary workers at which multinationals and farmemployers called for amendments to the major immigration reform bills movingthrough Congress, HR 2202 and S 269, that would provide high-technologycompanies and US farmers with temporary nonimmigrant workers. HighTechnology and ForeignWorkers Under current US immigration law, US employers can obtain non-immigranttemporary foreign workers under at least nine distinct programs. High-tech andmultinational firms argue that, since they compete in a global economy, theyneed to have access to the best and brightest of the world's workers withoutunnecessary government-imposed costs and delays. Under one program that was discussed extensively, the H-1B program,employers who want to hire foreign "professionals" for up to six years "attest"by filing a labor condition application with the Department of Labor that theyhave tried and failed to find US citizens and legal immigrants by offeringprevailing wages, and then DOL must approve their request for temporary foreignworkers unless it is "obviously inaccurate." There is no government test of the employer's assertion that US workers arenot available because the H-1B program is meant to meet urgent and short-termbusiness needs, and DOL is prohibited from investigating until there is acomplaint filed. One witness testified that his application for 40 H-1Bprogrammers to be paid $4.50 per hour was approved by DOL in nine days. Under the H-1B program, the jobs for which temporary foreign workers areimported to fill must require professional skills, which is usually interpretedto mean that the individual filling them must have a BS/BA--it is not enoughthat the foreign worker has a BS/BA, the job must require such a degree. Thisleads to confusion in occupations such as nursing--many Filipinas have BSdegrees, but nursing in the US does not require a BS. The H-1B program permits up to 65,000 foreign workers to enter the US eachyear and, since each can stay in the US for six years, there can be a maximum390,000 H-1B workers in the US. There were 43,000 visas issued by DOS to H-1Bworkers in FY94, and the INS reported that there were 106,000 admissions ofH-1B workers in FY94--an INS admission occurs each time that an H-1B workerwith a multi-year visa enters the US. It is estimated that 40 percent of thenew H-1B visa approvals are for high-tech jobs such as programmers. Both employer and worker representatives agreed that the H-1B program hasbeen abused by so-called "body shops" or contractors in what one witness calleda "techno Bracero program." Syntel, a Michigan computer programming firm whoselabor force is 80 percent H-1B workers from India, supplied programmers forinsurance company AIG after AIG laid off its US programmers. Mastech, thecompany that maintains the White House's computerized correspondence trackingsystem, is under investigation for misusing the H1-B program to import over1,000 of its 1,200 workers. DOL reported that its investigations of complaints found that mostemployers with H-1B workers are paying the foreigners less than promised in theattestation, and that most treat H-1B workers as entry-level rather thanprofessional employees. This means that H-1B programmers paid $20,000 may beused to replace US workers paid $50,000 per year. DOL recommended that US employers requesting H-1B workers be required toattest that they did not lay off US workers to make room for the foreignworkers, that the employer lay out a plan in the attestation to recruit USworkers, and that H-1B workers be limited to three years in the US. In discussions with senators, DOL endorsed the principle that permanentimmigrants admitted for economic/employment reasons should be screened throughsome kind of point system, and that US employers wanting foreigners to fillvacant jobs should generally fill them with temporary foreign workers. DOL also agreed to review a ruling that universities must pay prevailingwages to H-1B researchers--universities pay much less to temporary researchersthan private industry--and DOL said that it was considering lowering thesalaries that universities must pay by making a distinction between basic andapplied research. Several senators questioned the use of research funds to support foreigngraduate students. According to one survey, over 70 percent of foreigngraduate students in science and engineering, versus 40 percent of US citizenstudents, reported that their primary source of support in graduate school wasuniversity research funds. One reason why foreigners predominate among graduate students in manyscience and engineering fields, it was emphasized, is because salaries in thesefields are low in the US relative to business, law, and medicine. In a related development, DOL announced that it would soon issueregulations covering part-time employment by foreign students studying in theUS. Students holding F-1 visas are permitted to work off-campus for up to 20hours a week while school is in session, provided the US employer who wants tohire them submits attestations to the Labor Department and the students'schools stating that efforts to recruit US workers were unsuccessful. FarmWorkers Farm workers were the other type of temporary foreign workers discussed onSeptember 28. Growers made three arguments in favor of a new program to import temporaryforeign workers. First, they asserted that illegal aliens comprise asignificant share of the current farm labor force. Although the best estimatesare that only about 20 percent of the 2 million people who work for wages on UScrop farms are unauthorized, growers testified that illegal aliens are 50 to 70percent of some harvest crews, and implied that this percentage is typicaltoday despite the legalization of over 1 million unauthorized workers in theSAW program in 1987-88. Second, growers asserted that the new control measures under considerationin Congress--more border controls, more interior enforcement, and a nationalregistry-- will prevent them from continuing to hire unauthorized workers whopresent fraudulent documents. Given the high percentage of unauthorizedworkers in the labor force, the growers' argued that effective controls onhiring illegal aliens will leave them with a labor shortage. Third, growers testified that the current H-2A program is too inflexible toprovide them with foreign workers if labor shortages appear. Most of thecomplaints about the H-2A program centered on US workers recruited foremployers at public expense who, according to farmers, do not show up, workhard, or remain with the employer. Other factors include the requirement thatgrowers pay the higher of three wages, prevailing, minimum, or AEWR, and theyprovide housing at no charge to the temporary foreign workers. Growers asked Congress to approve an "attestation" procedure similar tothat used by employers to obtain H-1B foreigners for them to obtain foreignfarm workers. The current H-2A program is a certification program, which meansthat the border gate stays shut until the US government opens it and permitsabout 16,000 legal farm workers to enter each year. Attestation, on the other hand, means that employers open the border gateby asserting that there are insufficient US workers available, and the bordergate stays open until there are complaints, and the government closes thegate. Under the growers' plan, US farmers, labor contractors, or employerassociations would "attest" that they face shortages of US workers despite theoffer of prevailing wages and working conditions, the listing of the jobs atlocal Employment Service offices, and preference to US workers who apply forfarm jobs. Growers would be able to submit the names of workers who should begranted nonimmigrant visas in Mexico and elsewhere to come to the US to do farmwork for up to 10 months each year. Growers would pay user fees to cover the cost of administering the program,and the workers would be encouraged to return to their countries of originbecause 25 percent of their US wages would be withheld and repaid to them onlyafter they returned. Some advocates of the program argue that easy access to foreign workers isnecessary to keep farm wages at a level that would keep fruit and vegetableagriculture competitive in the global economy. However, farmers get only aboutone-third of the retail value of most fruits and vegetables, and farm workersreceive only one-third of what farmers get, so that, for a $1 head of lettuce,farmers get an average $0.33, and farm workers $0.11. Even if farm wages rose 50 percent, from today's $4 to $6 range to $6 to $9per hour, and if all of the wage increases were passed on to consumers, thehead of lettuce would cost consumers $1.05. Retail prices may fall rather thanrise, as occurred when the end of the Bracero program encouraged farmers andprocessors to change the handling of the tomatoes that the Braceros picked. Inthe tomato case, the end of immigrant labor caused production to rise, andretail prices to fall. Growers offered a pre-emptive strike against critics who said that therewere no farm labor shortages by asserting that farmers cannot wait for ashortage to plan for foreign labor to harvest their crops, that their proposalwas not like the discredited Bracero program, and that, even if the governmenttried to push up farm worker wages, there would still be farm laborshortages. Farm worker advocates countered grower assertions on the availability of USworkers. They made two major arguments. First, there is no shortage ofworkers, only a shortage of decent wages, benefits, and workingconditions. Second, employers prefer vulnerable foreign workers to US workers. InNorth Carolina, for example, it was asserted that US citizen-Puerto Ricanworkers were sent to employers where they would not have work for two weeks,and told that they would have to live at their own expense until the work wasready to begin, while H-2A workers were sent to work immediately. It is nowonder, they conclude, that US workers under such circumstances, often abandonfarm jobs, while H-2B workers stay with their employers as required by theirvisas. It is not clear whether the growers will repeat their successes of theearly 1980s, when they, over the objections of the sponsors of immigrationreform legislation, persuaded Congress to approve a non-certificationalternative to the H-2A program. Two of the key allies of the growers in that battle still influenceimmigration policy--Leon Panetta, who led the fight for the growers in theHouse, is President Clinton's chief of staff, and Clinton reportedly assuredCalifornia farmers in September 1995 that "they would be taken care of" iflabor shortages developed. Governor Wilson, in an August session with the California Farm Bureau,asserted that he had not changed his position since the mid-1980s, when hepersuaded the US Senate to include the Wilson amendment in immigration reformlegislation. Had it been enacted, the Wilson program would have allowed foreignfarm workers to move freely from farm to farm in the US. An incentive fortheir eventual return to Mexico would have been provided according to Wilson,by withholding one-third of their wages for payment when they had gonehome. Wilson said it has been difficult to sell such a guest worker programbecause of public confusion between illegal immigrants and guest workers. As aformer presidential candidate, Wilson said that he would expand the US BorderPatrol to reduce illegal immigration, and push to have a guest worker programinstituted. Senator John Kyl (R-AZ) and Representative Elton Gallegly (R-CA) are makingthe case for growers in 1995 immigration reforms. President Clinton, the CIRheaded by Barbara Jordan, and Senator Simpson and Representative Lamar Smith(R-TX) are opposed to an new guest worker program for agriculture. Many commentators have urged Congress to approve a guest worker program.Linda Chavez of the Center for Equal Opportunity, argued that "A guest-workerprogram would allow the United States to benefit from the needed labor offoreign-born workers without entitling them to the myriad social and welfarebenefits that has caused so much resentment in states like California whilereducing illegal immigration."

The Housewelfare reform plan is tougher, denying both cash aid to teenage mothers, andincreased payments to mothers who have more children while receiving payments.The Senate plan gives states the option to cutoff such benefits. Both the House and the Senate reforms deny most federal means-tested aid tonon-US citizens, but the Senate bar applies only to immigrants who arrive afterthe welfare reform goes into effect. Immigrants must show that they have sufficient resources so that they willnot become a "public charge" in the US, or have a US-resident sponsor sign anaffidavit that he/she will support the immigrant so that the immigrant does nothave to apply for welfare benefits. The welfare reform makes these affidavitslegally binding, and "deems" the immigrant to have access to the income andassets of the sponsor when authorities calculate whether an immigrant applicantfor welfare qualifies for benefits. Immigrants advocates, such as the National Council of La Raza, decried themeasure saying that not only would it bar many legal immigrants from receivinggovernment assistance, it may deny support even after they are US citizens.They argue that the bill would create a "second-class citizen," who would betreated differently because they were not born in the US. The immigrationadvocates object to a provision in the bill which would require sponsors tosupport an immigrant even after they become US citizens. California is projected to lose $2 billion annually in federal welfarepayments if the Senate version of welfare reform is enacted, and 70 percent ofthe reduction in federal payments to California is a result of the bar onnon-US citizens receiving welfare payments. House Republicans are attempting to reduce eligibility for and the amountof the Earned Income Tax Credit. In one study, about one-fourth of thebenefits paid were fraudulent--some involved immigrants claiming more childrenthan they had. The EITC was first enacted in 1975, and significantly expanded in 1986,1990, and 1993. It provides the working poor with $0.07 to $0.40 for eachdollar earned. This means that a household head earning $4.25 can get anearned income tax credit of up to $2 per hour in extra take-home pay ($0.40 forevery $1 earned up to $8,900). A family with two or more children, and anearned income of less than $25,000, could receive a maximum $2,500 check in1995. An estimated 4.5 million US residents will have their incomes lifted abovethe poverty line by the EITC in 1995. About 35 percent of US families withchildren apply for the credit each year--in 1995, the IRS had paid about $21billion on 18 million claims. A disproportionately large number of newcomersare recipients of the credits; thus areas with large numbers of immigrantswould be disproportionately affected.

The New York hearing featured women employedin sweatshops telling Labor Secretary Robert Reich about how little they werepaid for long hours of work. Reich also met with 15 major retailers to discuss how better to enforcelabor laws in the shops that sew the garments they sell. One suggestion was toinclude adherence to the Fair Labor Standards Act in the contracts that flowfrom retailers and designers through intermediaries to the sewing shops--DOLhas only 900 investigators nationwide to enforce the nation's basic minimumwage and child labor laws. There are 22,000 sewing shops nationwide employing one million workers,including an estimated 140,000 mostly Latino and Asian workers--80 percentwomen-- who are employed in 5,000 legal sewing shops and 1,000 sweatshops thatoperate without authorization in California. There are estimated to be 4,500sewing shops employing 50,000 workers in New York City. El Monte was the Los Angeles area city in which the Thai slave sweatshopwas discovered in August 1995. Local officials argue that a sweatshop couldhave been found in any working class city in the Los Angeles area. El Monte'spopulation of 110,000 is 60 percent Latino and 25 percent Asian. A review of the evolution of the Los Angeles economy argues that the LosAngeles labor market experienced two subtractions and one addition that add upto a two-tier economy and society. The subtractions were the loss of consumerdurables in the early 1980s, and the loss of aerospace and defense jobs in theearly 1990s. The addition were low-wage jobs, as illustrated by sewing jobs,and the fact that, in the 1990 Census, the South Central Los Angelescongressional district replaced the Mississippi Delta as having the lowest percapita income in the US. A review of the INS efforts to enforce employer sanctions, and therebyprevent situations such as the Thai slavery sweatshop, criticized the agencyfor failing to follow up on tips as early as 1988 that Thai workers may havebeen held against their will in the apartment complex. DOL enforcement has also failed to ensure compliance. A DOL inspection onSeptember 15, 1995 of 50 registered sewing shops in Los Angeles foundviolations in 46. The Thai slave case prompted a review of other cases of immigrant smugglingand exploitation. A raid on a New York brothel found a madam "buying" Thaiwomen for $6,000 to $15,000 each, and then requiring the women to repay her byhaving sex with men--the $100 paid by each man was kept by the madam; theprostitute received only tips. Japan also faces a problem with Thai women who have been sold asprostitutes to work in Japanese brothels. Women's activist organizations saythat there are up to 50,000 Thai women working as prostitutes in Japan. Mostof the women have been bought for as much as $200,000 from Thai recruiters ormembers of Japan's underworld, the yakuza. On September 19, three Chinese men were arrested in California for killinga Chinese immigrant in New York whose family in China had failed to pay theransom demanded. According to authorities, the kidnappers were part of theFujianese Flying Dragons, a gang that specializes in kidnapping female Chineseimmigrants in the US and demanding that their families in China payransom.

One year later, the INS is reporting that Gatekeeper "worked."Apprehensions in the five-mile sector were down 40 percent to 114,460 inFY95. However, apprehensions in the entire 24-mile San Diego sector were up 14percent to 512,000, and critics assert that the sector-wide increase inapprehensions simply shows that controlling the border is like squeezing aballoon--concentrated efforts at one point simply transfer the aliens furthereast. Those who interview Mexicans attempting to cross, or Mexicans illegallyin the US, report that relatively few are discouraged by smugglers fees thathave risen by $100 or more from previous levels of $200 to $300. The INS counters that, as it strengthens the next 19 miles of borderfencing and add agents eastward, illegal aliens will be pushed further east,and smuggling fees will rise to prohibitive levels. Some smugglers who have todrive the extra miles east from Tijuana to Tecate complain that it just takes alittle longer to make a few extra bucks. Many believe that the best way to evaluate Gatekeeper is by determiningwhether unauthorized workers continue to arrive and find jobs inside the US, orwhether Mexicans considering illegal entry in rural Mexico are discouraged fromattempting to cross into the US. By these criteria, the ability of Gatekeeperto keep unauthorized workers out of the US is more mixed. Reports from the single most labor-intensive activity in North Americanagriculture--the harvest of about 200,000 acres of raisin grapes around Fresno,California from mid-August to October--found that newly arrived workers aregetting into the US and going to work despite Gatekeeper. Unauthorized workers report that, after several apprehensions in the SanDiego sector, they succeeded in entering the US further east, and thatsmugglers' fees rose from $200-$300 to $300-$400. In addition, workers notedthat they lost days of work in the US because of delays in crossing the border.Most seem to have persisted until they succeeded in reaching the Fresnoarea. Informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70 percent of themsucceed in entering the US illegally on their first try. Surveys of aliens inMexico find that, even though most of those planning to enter the US illegallyknow about Gatekeeper, the INS operation is not deterring them from planning toattempt illegal entry. Several southern California congressmen want the INS to build a triplefence at the San Diego border, with paved border roads in between lines offence to prevent digging. The House Judiciary Committee voted 17-11 to buildthe triple fence south of San Diego. The same congressmen also wants the INS to close its interior checkpointson Highways 5 and 15 that tries to prevent aliens who elude the Border Patrolfrom reaching Los Angeles, and move the agents to the border. The INSdisagrees, and the Senate on September 12 disagreed with the House and providedthe INS with funds to operate its inland checkpoints. Gatekeeper is part of a $540 million crackdown on illegal immigrationannounced in February 1994 that has nearly doubled the number of Border Patrolagents to 4,500. The INS will have a $2.6 billion budget in FY96, itshighest-ever budget. Many believe that the INS should devote more resources to interiorenforcement to prevent unauthorized workers from obtaining US jobs. OnSeptember 26, the INS announced that Operation SouthPAW (PAW - ProtectingAmerica's Workers) had removed 4,000 unauthorized workers--almost 90 percentMexicans--in 31 days of coordinated inspections by DOL and INS investigators inJune and September--from 300 US firms in Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas,Georgia, Alabama and Florida. One-third of the illegal workers were found in Georgia, and one-fourth inArkansas. Follow-up surveys by the INS found that local residents filled overhalf of the jobs from which illegal aliens were removed. Some employers werere-inspected, and ten were fined the maximum $15,000 for continuing to employillegal alien workers. Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker questioned the significance ofapprehending 600 illegal workers in his state when Tyson Foods alone employs20,000. Tyson Foods said inspections were disruptive, and the INS apprehendedonly 73 workers. According to Tyson, only 40 jobs were then opened up forlegal workers. Simmons Foods, a company that has worked closely with the INS to learn howto detect false documents, had six illegal workers in a work force of 650.Simmons officials said they would like to find a better way to check documentsto eliminate the need for INS inspections. If the cost of the enforcement team was $100 per inspector per day, thenthe total cost of Operation SouthPAW would have been about $3 million, implyinga cost of about $750 to open each job that paid an average $14,000. The raids have brought fear to illegal immigrants in towns throughout theSouth. After Operation Gulf Sweep in Texas, there were reports that in sometowns, streets and stores were empty because immigrants were afraid they wouldbe picked up on the street by INS. One woman said she even gave upbabysitting, and the $75 per week she earned from it, because she was afraidshe would be picked up in the raids. Grupo Beta is Mexico's US-trained border police unit, that some USofficials claim is working with the INS to help contain illegal immigration.Grupo Beta was formed in 1991 to protect migrants from crime, and it is only in1995 that some in the US government are calling the unit a Mexican effort tostop illegal immigration. The border unit is not permitted to stop Mexicancitizens from crossing the border because of their constitutional right tofreedom of movement. The INS until mid-September required airlines bringing passengers to the USwithout visas to pay for the cost of detaining them if they requested asylum.INS procedures require the detention of individuals without documents seekingasylum, but a New York court ruled that the INS could not force the airlines topay for detention costs. The INS will pay for detention costs in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont,but in other states, airlines will remain responsible for detentioncosts.

According to observers, social peacehas been maintained by extended family support systems, and by the opening ofthe Mexican political system to accommodate protest. Inflation is running at 50 percent, and real wages are falling. One waymany families survive is to send a family member to the US to earn dollars thatare worth 50 percent more in Mexico in 1995 than they were in 1994. In November 1993, President Clinton predicted that NAFTA would add 200,000US jobs in 1995. Critics have noted that, as of August 1995, the US Departmentof Labor had certified that 38,000 US workers had lost their jobs due toincreased imports from Mexico, and that another 30,000 US workers had appliedfor assistance, asserting that NAFTA had caused them to be laid off. Mexico has returned to foreign borrowers for loans, touting the fact thatthe country ran $3 billion trade surplus in the first half of 1995. However,unemployment is up, and the economy is expected to shrink by five to sixpercent in 1995. Economist Sidney Weintraub finds that one year after its implementation,NAFTA has been less significant than proponents expected, and more profoundthat those who believed an economic union was inevitable. Weintraub arguesthat after the peso devaluation, without NAFTA, there would not have beensimilar pressure on the US to bail out Mexico with International Monetary Fundhelp. As trade between the US and Mexico increases, there has been a push tocreate a NAFTA superhighway along US 35 and Mexico 85, connecting the Americanmidwest with Mexico City, so that a truck could travel from Chicago to MexicoCity within 36 hours. Under the plan, trucks would be sealed inside eachcountry, and then be waved through the border crossing in Laredo, Texas. There were 419 million legal crossings over the Mexico-US border south ofSan Diego in FY94, and frustration is mounting as US border inspectors do morecareful inspections to deal with drugs and illegal immigration. As a result,waits to cross the border can be 3 to 4 hours, and Tijuana shoppers havereported reduced the $2.6 billion they usually spend in the US because ofdifficulty in crossing the border. Most observers say that the INS needs to add more inspectors. Inspectorsnow are expected to check vehicles entering the US at the rate of 1 every 30seconds. Some have proposed a commuter lane for some of the 40,000 dailyMexican workers employed in the US, in which electronic devices would screenvehicles of persons for whom background checks had been completed. Thissystem, already in place on the Canadian border, is resisted on the Mexicanborder because of fears of corruption.

According to unionleaders, many immigrants work 72 hours for $250 weekly, which is less than the$4.25 minimum hourly wage. The Clinton administration has endorsed the call for an increase in theminimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour. In many immigrant neighborhoods, there are many more check cashingestablishments and pawn shops than bank branches. It has been observed thatmany immigrants, finding it hard to get loans in the US, have resorted tobanking arrangements that they used in their countries of origin. Most of these informal banking arrangements make borrowed money veryexpensive. Interest rates from so-called loan sharks are as high as sixpercent per week. The Service Employees International Union, the largest union in Californiawith 300,000 members, is protesting job cutbacks in Los Angeles county--most ofthe jobs eliminated are held by SEIU members. The SEIU is asking the federaland state governments to provide more funds to Los Angeles county to avoidlayoffs. More than half of the SEIU's 1.1 million members nationwide are in thepublic sector, and about 40 percent of US union members are public employees.The SEIU has become famous for its confrontational tactics--its Justice forJanitors campaign, for example, involved picketing household-name firms thatemployed non-union janitors through contractors. Such tactics have beensuccessful--the percentage of Los Angeles janitors in unions has risen fromabout 10 percent in 1987 to 90 percent in 1995. Stuart Silverstein and Josh Meyer, "Fast-growing union hits obstacles inLA," Los Angeles Times, September 19, 1995. David Gonzalez, "Unions Open Driveto Recruit Immigrants," New York Times, September 5, 1995. ____________________________________________ Immigrationand InternalMigration The percentage of US residents who change their residences every year hasfallen from about 1 in 5 to 1 in 6. Americans are also staying closer to homewhen they move--the percentage of Americans who moved from one state to anotherwas only 2.6 percent in the year ending March 1994. Several factors contribute to the decline in internal migration, from anaging population to two-income families to financial insecurity. Hispanicswere most likely to move; whites least likely. An estimated 1.2 million persons moved to the US from abroad between March1993 and March 1994. According to the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, California had no netimmigration--foreign plus domestic combined-- in 1994, for the first time inthe 20th century. Indeed, after gaining 414,000 people via migration in 1989,California lost a net 426,000 residents via domestic migration in 1994, and atotal of 1.1 million more Californians left California than entered from otherstates since 1990. UCLA nonetheless projects that net immigration to California will top100,000 by the year 2000, largely because employment and income growth areexpected to once again top national rates, but not by as much as in the 1980s.For example, there were 315,000 building permits issued in California in 1986,versus less than 100,000 per year in the 1990s, helping to explain why housingprices fell especially in Los Angeles country, which accounts for about 25percent of California's population, and why governments there are strapped fortax revenues. Most analyses find that it is lack of jobs in California, not the decliningquality of life, that encourages more US residents to leave than enterCalifornia. California's unemployment rate of 7.8 percent in August 1995 was2.2 percent higher than the US rate. California's population, 32.5 million in mid-1995, is expected to be 43.3million in 2000, and 42.5 million in 2015. This is a 30 percent populationincrease, versus a 50 percent increase between 1975 and 1995. According to Census estimates based on IRS tax returns, New York also lostover one million residents to other states between 1991 and 1994, Illinois lost230,000, New Jersey lost 185,000, and Massachusetts lost 170,000. Floridagained a net 500,000 residents via internal migration, Texas, 242,000; andArizona, 200,000.

The new category of refugeesis limited to 1,000 women each year. In early June, the INS issued new guidelines that permit foreign women toseek asylum in the US because they face gender-based persecution in theircountry of citizenship. The US joins Canada as the second nation thatrecognizes gender-based persecution as the basis for granting asylum. It is estimated that the new INS rule might produced 800 to 1,000 moreapplications per year. About 80 percent of the world's 24 million refugees are women and childrenbut asylum has most often been granted to men persecuted for their politicalactivities. In some cases, women who joined husbands seeking asylum in the USapply for asylum for themselves on the grounds that their husbands abusethem. INS offices report fewer asylum applicants in 1995. In Miami, for example,asylum applications have fallen almost 60 percent, from 1,400 per month to 600per month. In 1994, 147,605 aliens applied for asylum in the US--8,254applicants were granted asylum, 29,176 were denied asylum, 16,766 cases havebeen closed, as occurs when an application is withdrawn, and 93,409 cases arepending.

One result is that income is more unequallydistributed than at any time in the past 50 years. In August 1995, there were 125 million workers employed in the US labormarket, up 1.6 million from year earlier levels. The US Department of Labor divided the new 20 million jobs created between1983 and 1993 into 278 occupations, ranked these occupations by averageearnings, and found that job growth was concentrated at the top and bottom ofthe wage distribution. Almost 30 percent of net new jobs were in occupationsthat paid wages that were in the top 25 percent, and almost 30 percent were inthe bottom 25 percent. There were relatively few new jobs created in the middle ranges of theearnings distribution, jobs that pay about $7.50 per hour, $300 per week,$1,200 per month, and $15,000 per year. There were a total of 40 million new jobs created between 1983 and 1993,yielding net job growth of 20 million. About 60 percent of these 40 millionnew jobs required little education and training, such as fast food worker andjanitor and cleaner. This fact helps to explain why the real earnings of maleswith only a high school education fell 30 percent between 1973 and 1993, andwhy 30-year old high school graduates who were 30 in 1972 saw their realearnings decline 20 percent by 1992, even though they were getting older andpresumably more experienced. According to DOL data, the lowest paid 10 percent of all US full-timeworkers earned an average $225 per week, or $900 per month, with no fringebenefits, in 1992. A woman with two children on welfare receives an average$400 per month, plus about $300 in Food Stamps, and usually free health careand housing and transportation assistance. There is some downward mobility in the US labor force, in the sense thatover 20 percent of the production workers in manufacturing in 1994 attendedcollege, and 71 percent were high school graduates. Both figures are upsharply from 14 and 40 percent in 1984. Better-educated workers are willing todo factory work because wages and benefits can give them higher wages thantraditional white-collar jobs. Most explanations for these labor market and earnings patterns begin withsupply and demand. The demand for highly educated workers rose sharply in the1980s, putting upward pressure on their earnings, while foreign competition andtechnology reduced the demand for unskilled workers, putting downward pressureon earnings at the bottom of the labor market. The well-educated immigrants entering the top of the labor market have notslowed earnings growth there appreciably, but the influx of less educatedimmigrants has probably contributed to slow earnings growth at the bottom ofthe labor market. Some US-born persons with less than college education's are leavingCalifornia, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey--states where 80 percent of all immigrants settle--producing what has beencalled the "demographic balkanization of the United States ." Between 1990 and1994, Los Angeles gained 663,000 immigrants and had a net loss of 848,000native-born residents, while New York City gained 568,000 immigrants and lost861,000 native residents. If current immigration and internal migration patterns persist, somedemographers project that the US could have 11 states in which the minoritypopulation is more than 40 percent of the total population, while 13 stateswould have white, non-Hispanic populations greater than 85 percent. In some cases, immigrants starting at the bottom of the job laddersucceeded in climbing up the job ladder. A profile of several immigrants whomoved up the job ladder in Chicago-area McDonald's emphasized that thefast-food chain has adapted its training materials to Spanish-speaking workers,and can make entry-level workers productive with only a few hours ofinstruction. McDonald's has about 500,000 employees in the US and Canada, and every yearhires over one million new employees, i.e., turnover is more than 100 percent.It has been estimated that about 20 million of the 160 million Americans whohave worked in the US labor market over the past 40 years--one in eight--wasemployed at some point by a McDonald's. McDonald's provides immigrants with the opportunity to learn businessbasics. Management training takes place both on the job, and in regional andnational training centers. Most stories about immigration, trade, and US workers focus on the bottomrungs of the labor market, where US workers typically have less than a highschool diploma, or, in extended analyses, up to a high school diploma. But anAugust 28 story in the New York Times pointed out that the same technologiesthat permit multinational firms to hire local workers to process everythingfrom airline tickets to grocery store coupons overseas also permit firms tohave more sophisticated tasks done overseas, such as computerprogramming. Multinationals favor moving to or creating jobs in countries with lots ofengineers, English and low wages. India fits the bill for many computerfirms--an estimated 75,000 Indians are programming for US firms in India, atmonthly wages of less than $1500, compared to $5000 in the US. Bangalore, acity of three million in the south of India, is that country's SiliconValley. In 1993, about 23 million or 20 percent of average US employment of 120million were part-time workers, defined as being employed less than 35 hourseach week. About two-thirds of these temporary workers voluntarily wanted towork less than a full or 40 hour work week; the other one-third wereinvoluntary part-timers who wanted more hours of work. A survey of large US firms found that, in 1 in 5, so-called contingentworkers--temporaries, part-timers, and independent contractors--were 10 percentor more of their labor forces. The average number of hours of work of nonsupervisory production workershas been falling, from 37 hours per week in 1970 to 34.5 hours per week in1993. The 20 million workers in retail trade in 1993 averaged just 29 hoursper week in 1993. Some hope that unions can raise the wages of workers at the bottom of theUS labor market. There are 17 million union members in the US labor force,including 13 million in unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO, meaning that 1 in 6US workers is a union member, down from 1 in 3 in 1960. About 10 million ofthese workers are in the private sector, meaning that about 10 percent of allprivate sector workers are union members, and 7 million are in the publicsector, meaning that 39 percent of public sector workers are in unions. Unions are devoting significantly more resources to organizing especiallyunskilled service workers and immigrants, including garbage collectors, poultryprocessing workers, and golf course workers. In July, Guatemalan immigrant poultry processing workers voted 238-183 tohave the Laborers International Union represent them at a North Carolinapoultry processing plant, after a mid-May spontaneous strike to protest havingto ask permission to go to the bathroom. However, in California, the United Farm Workers has so far been unable toturn a 1994 election victory at a Gallo vineyard into a first contract, areminder that organizing elections does not always lead to contracts withhigher wages, a reminder that organizing may be necessary to add union members,but winning elections is not enough to assure collective bargainingagreements. Both candidates to head the AFL-CIO have pledged to spend up to one-thirdof the organization's $60 million annual budget on organizing. In New York, garment industry employment fell from 260,000 in 1961 to80,000 in 1995. These 80,000 mostly immigrant employees are scattered across1,000 mostly small firms, and they generate $14 billion in annual sales. The immigrant entrepreneurs who own many small businesses in inner citiesreportedly prefer to hire other immigrants rather than US-citizen Blacks. Thetendency of minority immigrant entrepreneurs to avoid hiring members of thelargest minority in the US is yet another obstacle for Blacks seekingentry-level jobs. Interviews with immigrant business entrepreneurs find that they believeimmigrant workers are more reliable, have the "right attitude," and are lesslikely to file complaints with labor law and other authorities. Networkhiring, in which current employees bring their friends and relatives to fillvacant jobs, eliminate many costs of recruitment and training while providinghigh quality employees, since co-workers are only likely to bring into theworkplace new workers who will be dependable. Immigrants, even those that benefit from affirmative action preferences,reportedly feel little obligation to overcome historic discrimination againstBlacks. Jobs that were once filled by Blacks, such as in hotels andrestaurants in Los Angeles, are today filled primarily by immigrants in citiessuch as Los Angeles. An estimated 17 million US households spent $12.5 billion on landscape andlawn services in 1993, including $5.6 billion on basic lawn mowing andfertilizing. Basic lawn service expenditures are growing by six percent peryear. Many "lawn-service businesses" begin with an investment of a few hundreddollars, and the distribution of hand bills. Turnover is high, in part becauseof "cutthroat" competition from new entrants. By the year 2020, between 25 and 30 percent of the residents of industrialnations such as the US, Germany, and Japan will be 60 or older--the share ofolder residents is highest in non-immigrant Japan. According to the OECD, theunfunded Social Security liability of the US is over 40 percent of thecountry's GDP, meaning that the US should put aside about $2.8 trillion so thatit can earn interest to pay today's levels of pensions and health care benefitsto future retirees without raising tax rates. In Germany, by contrast, about1.6 times the current GDP should be set aside, and in Japan, twice the currentGDP should be set aside today. Some US companies are complaining of labor shortages. The Wall StreetJournal profiled the problems of Lincoln Electric, a manufacturer of weldingequipment, in finding workers who knew basic math, were willing to learn more,and would come to work regularly. According to the company, most of the 26,000applications submitted over the past 18 months were rejected because theapplicants did not have basic math skills. Some observers believe that low wages and a poor image keep many of theapplicants that manufacturers would like to hire from applying for jobs. Mostof the high school graduates with math skills go to college, and there arerecruited for white-collar jobs that offer the potential for much higherearnings.

There are about five million Muslims in France,including two million ethnic Algerians. About half of these Muslims areforeigners, and half are French nationals. In the US, by contrast, there areabout six million Muslims. The wave of attacks is similar to assaults during Algeria's war ofindependence from 1954 to 1962. During that struggle, 6,000 Algerians and 400French lost their lives in France. There is some discussion about whether random police checks representdiscrimination against Muslims and Africans. Most established Muslim leadersand organizations have condemned the bombings, and not complained too loudlyabout the police checks. However, many North Africans complain that police checks of Arab-lookingresidents constitute discrimination. Some Arab merchants asserted that thesecurity crackdown has hurt their business. Most French residents reportedlyapprove of street checks, the same strategy that was used to deal with asimilar wave of bombings in 1986. Officials believe the current attacks are meant to stop the Frenchgovernment from supporting the Algerian government. Others think that theattacks are meant to encourage immigrants in France to pay "revolutionarytaxes." During the Algerian war of independence, Algerians in France were"encouraged" to pay about 25 percent of earnings to Algerian nationalists tosupport the struggle for liberation. Government officials say fundamentalists recruit jobless immigrant youth insuburban housing developments--vast blocks of apartment buildings dotted withsatellite dishes that pick up television shows from Morocco, Algeria andTunisia that allegedly inspire youth to support fundamentalist regimes in NorthAfrica. One Algerian-born historian, Benjamin Stora, disagrees, saying that most ofthe Algerians plan to remain in France. Their children are born in France, andmany do not speak Arabic, and are not fundamentalist Muslims. It is the newgeneration of French Muslims, according to Stora, who feel that France does notwant them so they rejected France. The young French Muslim who was accused ofthe recent spat of bombings in France was a member of this alienated part ofsociety. Other social scientists say that the spread of Islam in the Paris suburbsrepresents an effort by young people to put order in their lives throughreligion. For those isolated by or excluded by society, Islam gives a centerof reference. According to sociologists, Islam began to grow in the late 1980s whensecond-generation immigrants realized that their social and economicintegration was impossible in a society that would not refuse to accept them asequals. There has been a growing backlash against the newcomers as highunemployment persists. Some of the Algerians who have been in France for 30 years and havechildren who were born in France have chosen to leave the door open to bothFrance and Algeria. But many French officials believe that integration intoFrench society means adopting French language and culture. Some French say there can be no "melting pot." One mayor of a communitywith a large immigrant population banned satellite dishes that could receiveNorth African programs, saying that he did not want to transform France into anation of the Maghreb. Recent immigrants often find themselves stranded in housing developments inParis suburbs such as Montfermeil, with no direct transportation to Paris,little industry, and few jobs. The apartment complex of Los Bosquets, whichoccupies three percent of the town's area, has 20 percent of its 20,000population--most of whom are first- or second-generation immigrants.Unemployment is 25 percent. The gray concrete buildings of Los Bosquets and other housing complexesthrough Pair suburbs are covered with graffiti and satellite dishes. Some ofthe women at Los Bosquets have organized a group to assist new immigrantsbetter understand French society and integrate. But the young men remainisolated; resorting to drugs and petty crime. Foreigners found without papers are repatriated, some via weekly "charter"flights that carry about 50 people and cost the government between $8,000 and$16,000. Escorted by the police and a doctor, the plane puddle jumps acrossAfrica, dropping off illegal immigrants in their countries of origin. The government plans to double the number of illegal immigrants expelledvia charter to 15,000 in 1995, and 24,000 in 1996. For political and legalreasons, expulsion is difficult--there are 60,000 illegals found each year, yetonly one quarter of them are expelled. Detention centers will be expanded,although the government is allowed to hold illegal aliens for only 10 days. France requires Algerians to obtain visas to come to France, and the numberof Algerians applying for visas to visit France fell from 800,000 during thefirst eight months of 1989 to 80,000 in 1995. Many Algerians reportedly do notapply for visas because they believe that their applications for visas to visitFrance will be rejected. President Chirac on September 5 threatened to suspend France'sparticipation in the Schengen agreement that eliminates border controls betweenseven EU countries if neighbors such as Germany do not step up their efforts tostop terrorists from entering their countries, and thus gaining free entry toFrance. The Schengen agreement went into effect in March 1995 among six of theseven countries; France is currently scheduled to abolish border controls withSchengen partners in January 1996. Belgium and the Netherlands criticized France for threatening to delay theabolition of border controls. Belgian officials, for example, assert thatFrench police no longer have full control over the city of Lille, and criminalsfrom there cross the border to commit crimes in Belgium. Other EU countries were more muted in their criticisms. Since the Schengenagreement went into effect, it is reported that immigration inspectors arechecking entrants more carefully, and that non-Schengen countries such asSweden and Britain are checking entrants from Schengen countries morecarefully.

The Parliament also asked for the establishment of an EC Bureau to monitorpopulation shifts, and to issue a list of safe third countries. At an EUsummit meeting in October, the Parliament will press for a common definition ofrefugee to include all persecuted people, including those who are victims offundamentalist groups. Sexual violence against women, said the Parliament,should be regarded as a legitimate reason for granting asylum. On September 25, the European Union agreed on a list of 100 countries whosecitizens will need a visa to enter the 15-bloc nation. The UNHCR has asked all nations to accept more refugees from the formerYugoslavia. There are reports that the US will take in 25,000 more should itbecome necessary, and the UNHCR requested that the EU offer to take the other25,000 refugees in the contingency reserve. The Council of Europe, an organization of 39 governments in Europe foundedin 1949, held a three-day meeting September 20-23 in Cyprus to discuss how toaccelerate development and thus reduce emigration pressures. The conferencewas attended by government leaders, academics and business officials. Thecouncil working to develop economic, environmental and cultural cooperationbetween the richer northern Mediterranean and the poorer southernregion. Representatives of African nations complained that there were too fewsouthern Mediterranean officials attending the conference-- most of the 250delegates came from northern countries. From Turkey in the east to Morocco in the west are some 200 million peoplewho live on annual incomes of up to 15 times less than European nations.According to one official, this unequal economic development will lead toinstability in both the southern countries and Europe. At the conclusion ofthe conference, officials said that the Mediterranean should not become abarrier between rich and poor, and urged northern countries to assist with theeconomic development of the south. The final report noted that "the increasing migration due to demographicand socioeconomic imbalances, further exacerbated by the growth offundamentalist tendencies and the inadequacy of political structures in some ofthe countries concerned" is of grave concern on both sides of theMediterranean. Prior to the conference, the head of the council's Commission onEnvironment and Land Management said that Europe can no long economicallysustain large-scale immigration from North Africa and Middle Eastern countries.One way to assist the governments of those countries, the commissioner said,would be to control population growth and accelerate economic development. A second conference is scheduled for Italy in 1996 to draft an action planon immigration, racism and xenophobia. According to some observers, the fallof communism has allowed the "green threat" of Islam to replace the "redthreat" of communism. The European Union member states plan to discuss migration with the NorthAfrican nations that have EU association agreements November 27-28, 1995 inBarcelona. The EU is expected to pledge to help to reduce migratory pressuresby promoting job creation in countries of origin, including supplementing theinvestment of remittances of migrants living in EU states in their countries oforigin, and is asking North African countries to cooperate to reduce illegalimmigration, and to accept the return of nationals caught illegally in EUstates. There are 18 million unemployed workers in the 15 nation EU, and noreduction in unemployment is foreseen before 1997.

Holland, Germany, Norwayand Spain all set up detention camps and limited welfare claims to asylumseekers. The Netherlands expects about 25,000 asylum applications in 1995, down 50percent from the 53,000 in 1994. Asylum procedures were tightened in 1994, andfar fewer applicants are given full A-refugee status. The Netherlands Equal Employment for Foreigners Act (WBEAA) requires Dutchcompanies with more than 35 employees to report the number of foreign workersthey employ by June 1, 1995, but there is no penalty for non-compliance. Thepurpose of registration is to promote the employment of foreigners living inthe country; only two percent of the employers had reported by June 1. Denmarkconsidered and rejected a similar employment-reporting requirement. There were 52,000 asylum applications in the Netherlands in 1994, and theDutch government responded by building three detention centers, and 13 morecenters where applicants can come and go freely while staying for up to threemonths. Asylum applicants are prohibited from working. In 1994, 50,000 foreigners--half of them Turks-- became naturalized Dutchcitizens. One third of the new Dutch citizens were born in the Netherlands offoreign parents. The Dutch have threatened to stop paying workers compensation to somepersons abroad. Some 2,700 Moroccans are drawing benefits as a result ofinjuries suffered in the Netherlands, and Moroccan doctors have certified 100percent of those examined as too sick to travel to the Netherlands for secondopinions, and still in need of benefits. A bill has been introduced into the Dutch Parliament that would deny mostpublic services to illegal aliens. If approved, illegal alien children wouldstill be able to attend Dutch schools, and obtain emergency medicalcare.

Persons involved in criminalactivities will be the first to be sent home. Germany has committed $11million to Vietnam for reintegration projects, the first payment of a $150million return agreement. Under the plan, $5.7 million dollars will be spent on job creation for thereturning Vietnamese, primarily by making low-interest loans available. TheGerman contribution is part of the $142 million dollar package signed in Julyfor the repatriation of the Vietnamese living illegally in Germany. Some 1,400 Vietnamese applied for asylum in Germany in the first six monthsof 1995, but virtually none had their applications accepted. There was a crisis in Bonn on September 12, when the Interior Ministerordered the expulsion of seven Sudanese asylum seekers as soon as their appealswere rejected. The seven had arrived at Frankfurt airport in July, and appliedfor asylum on the grounds that they faced persecution in the Sudan because theywere student members of a political group opposed to the government. AfterStern magazine reported on September 20 that at least four of the claims werefalse--the men were taxi drivers etc, and not politically active--plannedprotests were called off. The number of asylum seekers rose to 11,900 in August, bringing the totalfor the first eight months of 1995 to 108,000. Germany houses hundreds of asylum seekers on boats in the Hamburg harbor,sometimes for a year or more. Some Germans have complained that the boats arefloating concentration camps, while others observe that conditions on the boatsare far better than in most asylum seekers' countries of origin. Asylum seekers held on the boats receive about $800 monthly for food andclothing. Many are allowed to work as e.g., janitors, but any wages earnedreduce their government payment. In many cases, groups fighting each other at home, such as Kurds and Turks,live side by side on the boat, sometimes producing fights. Ethnic German Aussiedler continue to arrive in Germany from the ex-USSR.Some 400,000 Aussiedler arrived each year in 1989 and 1990, leading toprocedural changes and a quota that has kept arrivals since then to about200,000 annually. Germany has begun 700 investigations of cases of EU and other foreignworker employment on German construction sites. Germany alleges that somefirms, especially British-owned companies, are quick to give their unemployedworkers E101 forms, which show that workers are self-employed, and thuseligible to ply their trade anywhere in the EU. In Berlin, currently the world's largest construction site, Russians andUkrainians were found working for $5 per hour. In the Ruhr, British and Irishworkers were found working for half of the usual German wage of 65DM per hour,including wages and fringe benefits. It is estimated that 40 percent of the80,000 British workers in Germany are drawing UI benefits in the UK whileworking in Germany. In most cases, Dutch agencies locate workers in the UK, fly them to theNetherlands, and then bus them to Germany. The German labor minister promised to introduce a bill that would requireGerman minimum wages to be paid to all workers, foreigners and local alike, in20 construction occupations for at least two years. However, the bill will notbe introduced until the various employer associations agree to supportit. Metal employers oppose extending the higher minimum construction wage of20DM per hour to their industry, where the minimum wage is 18DM. Theiropposition may kill the proposal. The German land, or state, of Saarland in September voted to give the14,000 residents from the other 14 EU countries the right to vote in localelections beginning in January 1995. Baden-Wurttemberg and NorthRhine-Westphalia have also indicated that they will extend local voting rightsto EU residents. The country most worried about high unemployment leading to a balkanized ordivided society is France, but Germany too is worried about jobless economicgrowth. According to employers, German unions resist granting employers theflexibility they need to remain competitive, so many are establishingproduction facilities abroad. They point to the IG Metall union's dealingswith Volkswagen, in which the union resisted Volkswagen's calls for flexiblehours of work. Some speculate that union-management confrontations in Germany are puttingthe country on the same path as Britain in the late 1980s, when the Britishgovernment stepped in and weakened the power of unions to help employers getwork and wage flexibility.

About 3.3 million Hong Kong residents now hold the status of Hong KongBritish Dependent Territory citizen or British National, British passports thatdo not guarantee the right to abode in Britain. A Hong Kong legislator argued that racism prevents the British governmentfrom permitting Hong Kong residents to immigrate. The legislator pointed outthat people in the crown colonies of the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar have aright to migrate to Britain. Conservative British MP John Carlisle respondedthat "Britain should not become a dumping ground for every traveling Chinaman." As 1997 approaches, there is a saying that there are only two things HongKong people can do: the middle class can emigrate, and the others can riot. A Preliminary Working Committee was unable to decide whether children bornof illegal immigrants in Hong Kong should be given the right of permanentresidence. Currently babies born in Hong Kong do not have automatic right ofabode unless the father has an unconditional right of residence in theterritory. Alleged corruption has reportedly encouraged expectant mothers to try toillegally enter Hong Kong for their births. On September 11, a truck with 10 pregnant illegal immigrants from Shenzhencrashed through the Hong Kong-China border. One hospital reported that 20percent of its pregnant patients were from the mainland, including illegalimmigrants, two-way permit holders, and overstayers-- all wanted to have theirchildren born in Hong Kong. The women believed that since their unborn child had a Hong Kong father,they would have a better chance of joining the father in Hong Kong after 1997if they gave birth in Hong Kong. The immigration department reports that 1,900babies were born to illegal immigrant women in Hong Kong in the first eightmonths of 1995, an increase of 30 percent over the same period last year. In the last three years, 25,000 mainland Chinese women gave birth in HongKong, and 7,000 of those were mothers who illegally entered Hong Kong. The governor of Hong Kong rejected a demand to halt the importation offoreign workers in order to curb unemployment. Unemployment is currently at3.5 percent, an 11-year high. The Democratic party, pro-China legislators andthe unions have demanded a ban on labor importation.

But during the 1990s, the number of Korean immigrants coming to the US hasdropped, to about 11,000 in 1994. According to Koreans, the 1988 Olympic Gamesshowed expatriate Koreans that their country offered economic opportunity.According to the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in each of the last fouryears, between 5,000 and 6,500 people returned to Korea, compared with about800 in 1980. There are many reasons why Koreans are leaving the US to return to Korea.Most begin with Korea's dramatic economic growth. The demand-pull ofopportunity in Korea is matched by the frustration some Koreans feel in the US. Some Korean professionals believe that there is a glass ceiling in the USthat restricts their advancement here, while their bilingual skills increasetheir opportunities in Korea. Korean-Americans seem to be well accepted inKorea--the governors of two of Korea's nine provinces recently were UScitizens. Some observers believe that self-employed Koreans have saturated the marketfor high-risk dry cleaners, vegetable stores, and liquor stores in the innercities of New York and Los Angeles, and are returning to Korea because theycannot make money in the US. Some Koreans who return say they never feltcomfortable with the casualness of American society and the English language. The number of foreign workers in Korea is on the rise. According to theMinistry of Labor, there were 6,475 legally employed foreign workers as of theend of July, 1995, plus 34,931 foreigners in various types of work and learnprograms, and over 61,000 illegal foreign workers, making foreign workers justunder one percent of the 12.8 million workers in the country. Another 20,000 foreign workers are expected to enter vocational trainingprograms in Korea in September, 1995. Legal foreign workers were concentrated in the fields of languageinstruction, arts and culture, teachers, technicians, researchers and otherspecialists. Almost half of the "trainees" come from China. Another 25,000illegal foreign workers are from China, including 20,000 ethnic Koreans. "Labor Ministry Reports Foreign Workers Account for Nearly 1%," ComlineDaily News, September 19, 1995.

By 1995, there were315,919 foreign workers, and they comprise about three percent of the laborforce. Over 67 percent of the guest workers are in manufacturing. Although the import of labor has kept labor costs low, there is increasingconcern about the social costs of foreign workers. Some observers have saidthat importing guest workers is only a temporary solution, and that the countrymust increase its domestic supply of labor and decrease its demand for laborthrough automation. According to government reports, over 77 percent of Taiwan'slabor-intensive manufacturing enterprises, many with foreign workers, facelabor shortages. The Council of Labor Affairs reported that Taiwanesemanufacturers received approval for 231,000 foreign workers at the end of 1994,up 73 percent from one year earlier. The council now plans to extend employers' quotas to hire foreign workersan extra six months. Foreign workers will also be allowed to change employers. The Taiwan Textile Federation is working with the Chinese NationalFederation of Industries to press for faster passage of the revised VocationalService Law, which would allow employers to extend the stay of individualforeign workers from two years to three years. The textile federation arguesthat the two-year limit has resulted in foreign workers running away from theiremployer during the last two months of their two-year contracts. A survey of Taiwan workers by the Labor Department found that over half ofthe workers in Taiwan province oppose the admission of Chinese mainlandworkers. Fourteen percent oppose the admission of all foreign workers. Kao Yurh-Shi, "Taiwan: Foreign Workers in the Domestic Labor Market,"Business Taiwan, September 11, 1995.

Political freedom is nonexistent, yetthere is no longer the sense of hopelessness because of improved livingstandards. Though many reported fearing a return to Vietnam, those who returnedreportedly soon realized that life was normal. The UN High Commissioner forRefugees and other relief agencies report no official persecution or harassmentof returnees. The biggest problem many of the returnees face is seeing family members whooften forfeited their life savings to buy them passage on boats. The UNHCRrepatriation grant of $440 per person helps--especially considering that theaverage per capita income in Vietnam is just over $200. There are alsotraining courses on business, and "micro-enterprise" grants to returnees whowish to start small businesses. Some Vietnamese who have settled in America have argued with their childrenabout returning to their native land to help rebuild the country. Many olderVietnamese say they could never trust the government. While their children,some who have spent most of their lives in the US, see returning as anopportunity to help. Most of the Vietnamese who came to the US before 1975 were professionalsand elite members of the US-backed government who were escaping the communist.Those who came between 1970 and the early 1980s were boat people, entrepreneursand others of modest means. As Vietnam and the US come closer to normalizingrelations, these difference create a schism in which older Vietnamese refugeesfeel that the younger ones are selling out to the "enemy " by normalizingrelations with Vietnam. In September, Austria agreed to take up to 60 Vietnamese refugees nowliving in Hong Kong detention camps. This is the first time since 1990 anycountry has agreed to take a group of detained Vietnamese. Spain has also agreed to take 19 refugees. There are about 1,600Vietnamese "refugees," and 18,000 other Vietnamese, in Hong Kong. Only 300 areexpected to meet entrance requirements for resettlement nations. The rest havemedical or drug problems. Linda Chong, UPI, September 17, 1995. Lena H.

The maid was originally sentenced to sevenyears in jail, but was retried at the request of the Philippines because, sheasserted, her employer had raped her. The Philippines sent three ministers tothe UAE to plead for her life. A Kuwaiti woman was sentenced to 10 years in jail for killing her maid,allegedly because the maid refused to clean the house. The Filipino governmenthas renewed its calls for an end to the posting of more maids to the MiddleEast. The Singapore government in September rejected a request by the Philippinegovernment to participate in the approval process of granting work permits forFilipino maids who work in Singapore. The Singapore government said thatbecause migrant workers come from many countries, it would be impractical tohave a separate system for workers from the Philippines. The government saidit will issue a work permit as long as the foreign worker has a valid traveldocument, and both employer and foreign worker meet the processing criteria. The number of overseas workers exported during the first six months of 1995declined by three percent. The Philippine Labor Department attributed thedecline to shrinking foreign markets, reduced pay for foreign workers, and thePhilippine policy of discouraging some overseas employment. According to the Philippine government, there are 4.2 million Filipinoworkers in 43 countries, and they remitted $6 billion in 1994.

There are anestimated 30,000 Palestinians in Libya. On September 29, the Libyan government announced that all the Palestinianworkers had decided to voluntarily leave the country en masse. Press reportsindicate it was not a voluntary departure. In addition, Egyptian and Sudaneseworkers have been ordered out of the country. According to Libya, the expulsions are part of an effort to reduce thenumber of illegal aliens, and to open up jobs for Libyans. There are reportsthat recent rioting between the police and Islamic groups in Benghazi, alongwith difficulties paying foreign workers in Libya. There are reports that a Libyan team has been sent to Baghdad to recruitmore Iraqis to join the 65,000 who already work in Libya. In some cases, the Palestinians expelled have not found a country willingto accept them. Some are stranded on the Libyan border with Egypt, othershave gone to the Gaza Strip or Jordan. Israel refuses to allow many to enterbecause they cannot prove they are permanent residents of the Gaza Strip. TheUnited Nations plans to build an emergency camp along the Egyptian-Libyanborder. There are also 15,000 Sudanese stranded in a Libyan border town awaitingtransport home. The remainder of the 200,000 Sudanese have until December 1995to leave the country. In most Middle Eastern countries, migrant workers have few labor rights.In most countries, workers can lose their work and residence visas forattempting to organize into unions--in Kuwait, a worker must be legallyemployed for at least five years before joining a union. Foreign workerscannot hold union offices, and thus cannot directly bargain withemployers. "More than 1,000 Palestinians headed out of Libya," Agence France Presse,September 29, 1995.

According to primary author Rep. Smith(R-TX), HR 2202 represents a consensus on what to do about legal and illegalimmigration. Republican leaders say the House may not consider HR 2202 until 1996, when itmay inject the immigration issue into the 1996 campaign. There were two major fights in the markup. The first, in September, waswhether to establish a national registry that includes data on persons legallyauthorized to work in the US. The registry stayed in the bill on a 17-15 vote,but it would begin as a pilot program in five states, sunset on October 1,1999, and could be expanded nationally only by a vote of Congress. The second major issue was resolved on October 11. The Committee voted 20-14along party lines to not to divide the immigration reform legislation intoseparate legal and illegal immigration bills. Treating legal and illegalimmigration together increases the chance that Congress will approve thereduction of places for family members by 30 percent. Extra slots would be made available during the first five years to reduce thebacklog of one million spouses and children of legal immigrants waiting to beunified with their families in the US, so that legal immigration is expected tobe about 700,000 per year over the next five years, down from 800,000 in 1994and 1995. The debate on reducing family immigration was marked by Democratic assertionsthat most immigrants are hard-working "super Americans," while Republicansclaimed that many legal immigrants live in the US "at taxpayers' expense." On October 12, the committee voted to require asylum applicants to requestasylum within 30 days of arriving in the US, an effort to deter applicationsfrom aliens apprehended in the US. HR 2202 sets a target of first 75,000, andlater 50,000, refugees per year. Near the end of the markup, the Committee added 27,000 diversity immigrantslots for persons from countries that have not sent many immigrants to theUnited States in recent times. An amendment that would have required allceremonies for the swearing in of new citizens to be conducted in English wasdefeated. Title 1 of the eight-title bill deals with deterring illegal immigration, whichthe bill would attempt to do by mandating a 14-mile triple fence on theUS-Mexican border south of San Diego, and adding another 1,000 Border Patrolagents. Title 2 increased penalties on illegal aliens who falsely claim to be UScitizens in order to vote, and Title 3 requires most persons in the USillegally for one year or more to remain outside the US for at least 10 yearsbefore immigrating legally. Title 8 of the House bill deals with non-immigrants. Under the marked-up bill,US employers wanting to bring foreign workers temporarily to the US would bedivided into two groups: those that were "H-1B dependent," and other employers. H-1B dependent employers -- those with 10 percent or more H-1B workers in theirlabor forces -- would be required to file certain attestations, but employerswith fewer foreign workers would not need to provide such documentation. Thisrepresents a considerable loosening of the regulations under whichnon-immigrant workers enter the US. Most newspaper editorial boards support immigration reform. For example, mostCalifornia newspapers endorsed the House bill in October, praising its emphasison nuclear family unification, and asserting that stopping the admission ofextended family members was a reasonable trade-off. Liberal papers often madetheir endorsement contingent on removing from the bill provisions that, e.g.,bar even naturalized citizens from some federal welfare programs. Opponents of HR 2202 include businesses that benefit from immigration, ethnicgroups, and civil liberties advocates. Ethnic and religious groups opposedreductions in annual immigration and refugee admissions--some 50 Latinogroups announced the formation of the "96 Coordination" to oppose HR 2202. The major new entry in the coalition against immigration reform are hightechnology businesses -- they want to easily bring immigrant andnon-immigrant professionals to the US. Microsoft, for example, asserts that1,000 positions remained vacant in 1994 because the company could not findqualified workers. Libertarian admissionists such as Wall Street Journal columnist Paul Gigotattacked immigration reform on September 29, 1995 because of the nationalregistry. Under Congressional plans, US employers would supply the nameand Social Security number of each new hire, and then be informed if thatworker was legally authorized to work in the US. Gigot and other Libertarians characterize the registry as an attempt todeputize US employers as immigration agents. They point out the potential forerror. With an estimated 65 million hires each year, including first entrantsand persons who change jobs, there may be millions of times in whichindividuals are denied jobs because of government computer errors. Another Libertarian, Glenn Garvin in Reason magazine, asserts thatPresident Reagan in the early 1980s followed the advice of domestic policyadvisor Martin Anderson, rather than accepting that of Attorney General WilliamFrench Smith to explore the development of a work authorization system.According to Garvin, the INS currently has a 19 percent error rate in a pilotprogram under which employers submit the A- or immigration numbers of non-UScitizens to verify their right to work in the US. If there is a 19 percent error rate in a national registry --sometimeafter the year 2000-- errors could cause severe inconvenience for over 12million of the 65 million new hires each year. Supporters of immigrationreform assert that the error rate would decline with experience. Restrictionists such as FAIR, Carrying Capacity Network, and some statechapters of Ross Perot's United We Stand Organization argue that HR 2202 doesnot go far enough to reduce legal and illegal immigration. CCN has called fora moratorium on immigration, permitting a maximum of 100,000 immigrants peryear to enter, including 70,000 spouses and children of US citizens, 5,000priority workers, and 25,000 refugees. Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) will soon introduce a bill patterned after theHouse version. Simpson's bill would reduce the number of immigrantsadmitted for economic/employment reasons from 140,000 to 75,000, require USemployers to pay permanent immigrants admitted to fill vacant US jobs at least10 percent more than the prevailing wage, and to also pay 30 percent of thefirst year's salary paid to the immigrant into a US fund dedicated to trainingUS workers to fill vacant jobs. Foreign-born persons were about 12 percent of the scientists and engineers inthe US in 1990, and up to half of all persons earning PhDs from US universitiesin fields such as computer science were born abroad. Even though foreign-bornengineers are typically less than five percent of the engineers at computercompanies such as Microsoft and Sun, these companies insist that they need theforeigners to remain competitive.

Over one-third of these projected savings come fromchanges in the federal medical program for older residents, Medicare, and inthe federal-state program that provides health care for poor residents,Medicaid. About 10 percent of the projected savings come from changes in federal welfareprograms. The federal government will make "block grants" to states, andstates will in turn have more discretion to decide who gets cash and otherassistance and how much recipients get. Most aid to non-US citizens is eitherbanned, or limited to five years. The exclusion of immigrants from many welfare programs reflects the addition ofa third question to two classic questions about newcomers--to the questions ofhow well do immigrants integrate and what impacts do immigrants have on the USeconomy and society, the question of do immigrants pay their way in the welfarestate has loomed large in the 1990s. At one level, it would seem that the concerns about immigrants and welfare aremisplaced. In 1970, about six percent of all households headed by anative-born person received some form of cash assistance in 1969, and thiswelfare rate for natives rose to eight percent in 1980, and was seven percentin 1990. About six percent of the households headed by foreign-born persons reportedreceiving cash assistance in the 1970 Census. The share of foreign-bornhouseholds receiving foreign assistance rose to nine percent in 1980, andremained at nine percent in 1990. However, cash assistance accounts for only about one-fourth of the roughly $180billion in federal expenditures for poor residents in 1990. Data from theSurvey of Income and Program (SIPP) participation, which follows households for32 months, suggest that the gap between households headed by a foreign-bornperson, and households headed by a native-born person, is larger for non-cashassistance such as Medicaid and food stamps than for cash assistance such asAFDC. For example, in 1990, SIPP data indicate that about eight percent of allhouseholds headed by a native-born person received in-kind federal assistance,versus 21 percent of households headed by a foreign-born person. InCalifornia, about 14 percent of households headed by a US-born person, and 40percent of households headed by foreign-born persons, received federal in-kindbenefits. Analysis of these data by George Borjas of Harvard suggests that the gap iswidening for more recent arrivals, leading him to conclude that immigrants are"assimilating into welfare." Borjas also believes that, once immigrants beginobtaining cash and in-kind federal assistance, they stay on the welfare rollslonger than native-born recipients, a tendency he attributes in part to theirrelatively low educational level. If current trends continue, Borjas believes that, in California, the welfarepopulation will increasingly be an immigrant population. Medicaid is the most expensive in-kind program that provides benefits to poorpeople, including immigrants, accounting for about half of federal welfareexpenditures in 1990. Medicaid reform pending in Congress would eliminate therequirement that states help to pay for the cost of emergency medical care forunauthorized immigrants. Under current law, the federal and state governmentsshare 50-50 the cost of providing health care to poor people, includingunauthorized immigrants. For California, this means that, in FY95, the state and federal governmentswill each spend about $414 million to cover the cost of emergency health carefor unauthorized aliens. House Speaker Gingrich on October 20 indicated thatstates with large numbers of illegal aliens would receive funds to cover theircosts of providing emergency care for illegal aliens--some $6 billionnationwide over seven years, or $400 million per year to California. Instead of paying Medicaid bills on a 50-50 basis after they are submitted byhealth care providers, the federal government would make block grants to thestates, and they could--but would not have to--use some of their block grant toprovide emergency health care to unauthorized aliens. However, the block grantwill be about 25 percent less than projected federal spending. The California Senate Office of Research released a report on October 11 thatconcluded that federal welfare and health care reforms would eliminatefederal help for 500,000 of the state's four million legal immigrants who arenot US citizens, costing California $6 to $7 billion over five years. Underlegislation pending in Congress, non-citizens now getting SSI would lose theirpayments beginning on January 1, 1997. In California, counties are the providers of last resort, required to offerservices to poor people regardless of legal status. An effort may be made tocopy the Congress and refuse to provide benefits to non-US citizens, but such ameasure might be held unconstitutional under the California and USConstitutions. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Chairman of the Congressional Task Force onImmigration Reform, offered an amendment to HR 2202 that would prevent parentswho are illegal aliens from accepting federal benefits, except for medical careand child nutrition benefits, on behalf of their US citizen children. On October 25, Gallegly introduced a new study by Donald Huddle that arguesthat the 22 million legal and illegal immigrants who settled in the US since1970 imposed costs on the US that were $51 billion larger than the taxes theypaid. This would imply that each immigrant, on average, generated costs thatwere $2,300 greater than revenues. The Urban Institute and other studies dispute these cost-revenue estimates,finding that immigrants pay more in taxes than they cost in taxes, and that thecost-benefit ratio shifts in favor of US residents the longer immigrants remainin the US. George Borjas estimated that the net benefits from immigration to the US areabout $7 billion per year, or about one-tenth of one percent of the $7 trillionUS GDP.

Attorney General Reno announced in mid-October, 1995 that the US Attorney forSan Diego, Alan Bersin, would be a "border czar" responsible for coordinatingUS law enforcement efforts along the 2,000 mile US-Mexican border. The INSwill open its first-ever courts at the port of entry, and prosecutesmugglers. In 1995, the INS has prosecuted 1,039 illegal immigrants for "felonious illegalentry," more than in the previous nine years combined. Most of those chargedare persons with criminal records in the US attempting to reenter the USillegally. To hold them in jail until their trials, Reno announced that the USNavy had agreed to make space available in its San Diego brig. Reno also announced that the INS would crack down on US employers whohire illegal aliens, presumably by adding investigators to do more workplaceinspections. As illegal immigrants attempting entry shift from the westernmost section ofthe border further east, homeowners in what were previously isolated areas havein a few instances taken vigilante action against them in retaliation forcutting fences etc. Several cases of homeowners beating aliens are underinvestigation. In mid-October, six New Jersey police officers who removed foreigners from aprivate detention camp in June after they rioted to protest mistreatment werecharged with abusing the asylum seekers while transferring them to a local jail(Migration News, July 1995). An investigation suggests that the police beatthe foreigners, and made them chant "America is number one."

Thecomplaints of Boeing workers, who earn an average $20 per hour or $3,500 permonth, include fears that US workers are cooperating in the export of theirjobs by training replacements who come to Seattle to learn how to do theirjobs. Boeing counters that, in order to win airplane orders from countries such asChina, it must subcontract the production of components to China. Chineseaerospace workers earn 1,000 yuan per month, or $120. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said that the Boeing workers have legitimatecomplaints, and the Department of Labor is working to tighten the system thatpermits non-immigrant foreign workers to enter the US. In addition toaerospace machinists, other skilled jobs that are gradually moving overseasinclude computer programmers, physical therapists and cinematographers. Many skilled US workers are astonished to learn that foreigners can come to theUS from India or the Philippines, learn their jobs, and then the company canshift those jobs without penalty to the newly trained workers abroad. USemployers are not required to justify shifting jobs overseas, or to retrainlaid-off US workers. In many cases, skilled foreigners in the US receive less than US prevailingwages. For example, DOL found many cases of foreign physical therapistsearning much less than prevailing US wages--in one case, 54 therapists werereceiving $500 a month in wages, compared with the prevailing US wage of$2,800. Foreign technicians working in the US for "half pay" have reportedlybeen employed on 200 US films so far in 1995. US employer groups are resisting any tightening of laws and regulations thatgovern the entry of non-immigrant foreigners. A common assertion is that theworld's supply of brilliant workers is limited, and to remain at the forefrontof global competition, US employers need access to the world's best brains, asdefined by employers. Some employers in the electronics industry lobbied Congress to relax rulesgoverning the admission of professional foreign workers under the H-1B program.In the computer industry, occupations often filled by H-1B foreign workers areprogrammers--about one-fourth of all such workers--and engineers. In January, 1995, DOL issued regulations that require close monitoring of anH-1B worker's activities and repeated written notification of the worker'sstatus and salary to his or her colleagues. Some US employers are trying toget this tougher enforcement relaxed, asserting that tight enforcement willmake the H-1B program "unworkable." A maximum of 65,000 H-1B workers can enterthe US each year, but each can remain up to six years, so that the program canpermit up to 390,000 skilled foreign workers to be employed in the US at anyone time. Reich continued to put pressure on US retailers who buy clothes from some ofthe 20,000 US sewing shops, employing 800,000 workers, that supply about halfof US garments. Many of these shops employ unauthorized workers.According to some sources, DOL plans to step up its raids in the next fewmonths, and to announce the names of retailers whose labels are found in thesewing shops. DOL has 816 inspectors to enforce federal labor laws in about6.5 million US firms that employ about 110 million workers. In the continuing debate over the economic benefits and costs of immigration,the home-building industry released data that suggests about half of allimmigrant households own their homes, so that immigration adds jobs in thecurrently one million strong home construction work force, where earningsaverage $13 per hour.

There are two distinct cases pending. Sections 7 and 8, which prohibit illegalaliens from obtaining tuition-free public education, is being challengedin a San Francisco state court by opponents who assert that the denial of freeK-12 education to illegal alien children violates the California constitution'sequal protection clause. Many observers expect the judge to strike down thesesections. A second case is pending in federal court in Los Angeles. All sections ofProp. 187 are being challenged there as an unlawful effort by California votersto regulate immigration, which is solely a federal responsibility. The stateof California is defending Prop. 187 on the grounds that it has the right andresponsibility to allocate its limited resources to provide services to thosevoters deem most deserving. On October 23, the federal judge in Los Angeles indefinitely postponed adecision on whether some parts of Prop. 187 can take effect even if othersections are found to be unconstitutional. Opponents of Prop. 187, includingstate-paid attorneys representing the elected State Superintendent ofEducation, are arguing that the initiative should be declared unconstitutionalbecause it is a state effort to interfere with federal immigration policy. If the Prop. 187 case goes to trial, social science research may take centerstage, much as it did in the 1954 US Supreme Court that ended "separate butequal" schools for blacks and whites. Among the issues to be resolved arequestions such as the role of benefits and services in attracting illegalimmigrants and their families to California, or encouraging them to stay, theimpacts of illegal immigrants on US citizen and legal immigrant workers, andthe effects of denying services to illegal immigrants on the quantity andquality of services available to other state residents. For example, if illegal immigrant children were denied K-12 public educationservices, California might argue that, given other propositions approved byvoters, implementing Prop. 187 might increase the funds available for K-12education by five percent, or $1 billion over three to five years. In Hispanic commentary on the Million Man March, it was noted that the largestdemonstration staged in the US by Hispanics involved 70,000 opponents of Prop.187 in Los Angeles in October 1994. In Sacramento, a law pushed by Democrats to head off Prop. 187 has led toprotests from some immigrants. In 1993, California enacted a law that requiredapplicants for drivers' licenses to prove that they are legal residents. Thelaw was interpreted to make the validity of drivers' licenses coincide with thelength of time the INS permits a foreigner to be in the US. But visas areoften renewed, forcing Japanese businessmen and foreign students to renew theirdrivers' licenses several times, and generating complaints from them about thetime and expense involved . A California poll found that 55 percent of the state's residents were"extremely concerned" about illegal immigration, versus about 75 percent whowere concerned about AIDS, public schools, and crime.

The US made available up to $20 billion to Mexico, part of a$50 billion international loan package. The meeting included an announcement that, in order to discourage illegalMexican entrants from attempting to re-enter the US, the federal governmentwould pay to return up to 10,000 apprehended aliens to their homes in theinterior of Mexico, instead of merely taking them across the border. Mexicoalso announced on October 27, that it plans to increase Mexican agents alongthe border to protect migrants from being victimized by smugglers and thieves.The Mexican agents will not try to prevent the migrants from illegally crossingthe border into the US. Before Zedillo's arrival, the Mexican ambassador to the US on October 4 decriedthe "demagoguery" of American presidential candidates who he said are trying toattract votes by pandering to voter fears of unstoppable waves of illegalMexican migrants. According to Amb. Silva-Herzog, Americans ignore the "economic benefits" ofMexican immigrants in the US. For example, he said, since most California farmworkers are Mexican immigrants, "what would happen if that flow of workerswould be interrupted?" A North Carolina grower told Silva-Herzog that, withoutMexican workers, he "would be out of business." Silva-Herzog said that the number one security problem facing Mexico are drugcartels, which are now capable of landing commercial jets in Mexico filled withcocaine. Mexican President Zedillo's October 10 visit to Washington prompted reviews ofNAFTA 21 months after enactment. NAFTA linked the Mexican economy to the US,and promised economic benefits to both countries. In urging Congressionalapproval of NAFTA in November 1993, the Clinton Administration predicted thatNAFTA would lead to the creation of a net 170,000 US jobs in its first fullyear, 1994. Most commentaries noted that NAFTA has not created many net new jobs, in the USor Mexico, in part because of the peso crisis of December 1994 and thesubsequent recession in Mexico. In the US, the DOL has certified that 42,000US workers lost their jobs due to NAFTA-related imports since January1994--21,500 of these workers are drawing special unemployment benefits fromDOL. Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics estimatesthat, since NAFTA went into effect, the US lost 225,000 trade-related jobs. The Clinton Administration argues that exports to Mexico and Canada created340,000 new jobs since January 1, 1994. NAFTA sharply divided US public opinion and the US Congress. Most supportersof NAFTA point to signs that NAFTA is working, increasing the efficiency of,for example, auto plants on both sides of the border, as factories specializein one model for a bigger market, rather than producing several models. Inother instances, US jobs that would probably otherwise have gone to Asia wentto Mexico, which increases the likelihood that US workers will produce partsfor the Mexican plants. NAFTA illustrates how freer trade produces winners and losers, and the loserstend to be more vocal and visible than the winners. In Mexico, the first new "pacto" in 10 months was announced in late October.The pactos are agreements between government, unions, and businesses thatinclude growth, inflation and wage targets. The pacto envisions economicgrowth of three percent in 1996, 20 percent inflation, and two-ten percenthikes in the minimum wage. In Mexico, manufacturing employment has dropped every month since September1990, and one million Mexicans lost their jobs in 1995, especially as largecompanies streamlined their operations to become globally competitive. Inrural Mexico, over two-thirds of the farmers questioned in one survey reportedthat their incomes had been reduced by a NAFTA-induced influx of corn,processed meat and milk products that lowered the prices they received for farmproducts in Mexico. The maquiladora industry is booming--employment rose 100,000 or 20 percentsince January 1, 1994, and today tops 600,000. Maquildora wages fell as aresult of the peso devaluation--from an average $2.54 per hour, includingbenefits, to $1.80 hourly-- many workers take home $25 to $45 per week. Mexican horticultural exports to the US rose about 30 percent in the first halfof 1995 versus 1994, enabling producers who had planted tomatoes in Fall 1994expecting a $1=3.5 peso exchange rate to reap windfall profits. But profitswere restrained by the fact that many costs of producing fruits and vegetablesfor the US are in dollars. In a few cases, NAFTA increased US production for the Mexican market in amanner that increased the US demand for Mexican workers. Several large USvegetable growers, for example, moved production from Mexico to California,finding that they could supply the Mexican market at lower cost from Californiathan from Mexico. Since Mexican workers pick most of the produce on both sidesof the border, this raised the US demand for Mexican workers, possiblyincreasing illegal immigration. As a result of Operation Gatekeeper, more immigrants are attempting to enterthe US illegally at the port of entry. A few have simply rushed the border,attempting to run or drive past inspection stations. But most are attemptingto pass themselves off as US citizens or legal immigrants--the number ofpersons who were detected attempting to enter the US using fraudulent documentsrose 44 percent in 1995 versus year-earlier levels. Women and children are now more likely to try to enter the US illegally withfalse documents or by being smuggled in vehicles, so that they can avoidcrossing at night through the canyons. US officials complain that Mexicopermits smugglers selling documents to operate openly near the border,including Mexican police who have been seen giving false documents to motoristswaiting to cross. In Mexico, the outlook for jobs is mixed. Banamex estimates that a two percentincrease in real GDP growth has been associated with a one percent increase inpaid employment in Mexico since 1980. There were a net 1.6 million paid jobscreated in Mexico between 1988 and 1994--the total number of paid jobs rosefrom 22.1 million to 23.7 million (Banamex, July 1995, 244) Over these years, Mexico's population rose from 78.4 million to 90.5 million,and its economically active population rose from 28.9 million to 35.4 million(persons 12 and older engaged in productive activity or seeking work). Anothermeasure of the gap between labor force and job growth can be found in MexicanSocial Security Institute IMSS data--the number of permanent and temporarybeneficiaries rose from 8.3 million in 1988 to 10 million in 1994. Some 950,000 additional persons are expected to become economically active in1995, a year in which economic growth is expected to drop by over five percent,and the number of paid jobs by over one million. Mexico is experiencing a "silent revolution" as "tens of thousands" of peasantfamilies move to Mexico City and northern industrial cities. Many of the newmigrants are moving directly to northern border states, where they can findwork as grape- or orange-pickers, and from there move on to the United States. In Mexico City, rural-urban migrants are sometimes forced to sleep on thestreets and make a living selling chewing gum to motorists, washing windshieldsor begging. In some instances, the migrants work at night to avoid extortionby the police; in September 1995, thousands of mostly Indian street-vendorswere banned from the city's central Zocalo square. According to the College of the Northern Frontier, more than half of allundocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States come from the central andsouthern states of Michoacan, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Zacatecas and Oaxaca--anestimated 1.8 million Mexicans moved north in 1994, and 800,000 entered theUS.

NAFTA has removed tradebarriers and many of the psychological barriers to moving acrossborders. At a seminar on immigration attended in October by immigration officials fromvarious Central American nations, the participants agreed that to haltimmigration, countries need to impose harsher fines on traffickers. Some Latin Americas countries have decided to take measures to curbimmigration. Argentina and Chile, which have traditionally welcomedimmigrants, are closing the door as unemployment rises in their countries.Nearly one million Paraguayans and Peruvians are reported to live illegally inArgentina. Police in Buenos Aires have been raiding buildings where illegal immigrants aresquatting. The Argentine government is also trying to stop "false tourists" atthe Bolivian and Brazilian borders. In a meeting in Mexico on September 20, the foreign ministers of El Salvadorand Mexico recommended creating a commission to propose measures to protectLatin Americans who suffer discrimination in the US because of Prop. 187. The Nicaraguan government estimates that every day about 200 aliens, primarilyfrom Peru, Ecuador, India and China transit through the country without visason their way to the US. Only one percent are captured by authorities. An estimated 175,000 Nicaraguans migrate to Costa Rica every year to harvestsugar cane and coffee and, in 1995, Costa Rican employers will issue themsix-month work permits that guarantee "a decent salary and social securitycontributions." The Costa Rican government, complaining of welfare costs,recently began deporting Nicaraguans, which led to tensions because manyNicaraguans are unemployed as a result of a wave of strikes there. In April, it was disclosed that Honduran government officials accepted $450million to naturalize illegally about 18,000 Russians, Chinese, Iranian andnationals of other countries. The officials collected about $25,000 per personfor Honduran passports, ID cards and naturalization papers.

The proposed controls includea measures to stop income support payments, council tax benefits, housingbenefits, family credits and medical treatment to those who have been deniedasylum. There are about 50,000 to 60,000 legal immigrants to the UK annually. Therewere 33,000 asylum applicants in the UK in 1994, and a backlog of 70,000 asylumapplicants. The estimated number of illegal aliens ranges from 25,000 to 1million. The Home Office obtained Cabinet approval to include penalties on employers inBritain's immigration control system. The Labour Party has opposed theproposal because they believe it would increase racial discrimination.Immigrant and business organizations, including the Confederation of BritishIndustry, oppose the idea because it would force businesses to verify animmigrant employee's legal status. The spread of temporary employment agencies has made it easier for illegalworkers to find jobs. Most employers check to ensure that workers haveNational Insurance numbers, and then send them straight to cleaning orrestaurant jobs. Despite repeated denials by the Home Office, Howard confirmed on October 25that he also plans to introduce as part of the Immigration and Asylum Act alist of countries that are considered "safe" from political persecution, sothat applications from asylum-seekers from those countries can be fast tracked.The Home Office scaled down the plan, which originally included 100 countries,to a short trial list composed of Ghana, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,Romania and Poland. Since January 1995, over 6,000 from Nigeria and Sri Lanka,have applied for asylum in Britain. Downing Street continues to deny knowledgeof the existence of the list. Human rights organizations say that such a list would be a violation of the1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, which requires signatories to treatevery application for political asylum--wherever it comes from--on itsindividual merit. Opposition Labour Party leaders claim that in offering the reported newproposals, the government was "playing the race card" in order to gain votes. British officials report that over 100 immigrants per day have claimedpolitical asylum in 1995. If this rate continues, it will be a 46 percentincrease over 1993. Government officials say that the increase of asylumseekers is due to the perception that Britain is a "soft touch," offeringliberal welfare benefits which continue throughout the appeal process. Theimmigration department estimates that each asylum seeker cost the taxpayer L100per week in income support and housing benefits. Former Minister of Immigration Nicholas Baker wrote in an article appearing ina British newspaper that Britain acts a magnet to asylum-seekers fleeingextremely poor countries and that the asylum process is being overrun by bogusasylum claims. He called for urgent action to halt the flows by strengtheningasylum controls as Germany did, resulting in significant decreases in thenumber of asylum seekers.

A mayor in southern France has asked the government for permission to preventimmigrants from settling in his city. The city council of Beaucaire, in theGard region of southern France, passed a resolution demanding that Parisdesignate the Gard region as off-limits to all new immigrants, both thosecoming from other countries and those who are moving to Gard from other partsof France. The mayor of Beaucaire has refused to register the children offoreigners in local schools. Although racist language is illegal in France, a member of the Regional Councilin Toulon says the National Front substitutes the word "immigration" for "NorthAfrican", using anti-foreign prejudices to create the image of a white raceunder threat by outside forces. The National Front argues that it wants curbson immigration, not restrictions on the immigrants themselves. On October 17, the eighth bomb exploded in what may be a terrorist campaign toprotest France's support of the current Algerian government, who canceled a1992 election that the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win. InSeptember, French police killed an Algerian immigrant suspected of planting anearlier bomb. Fred Coleman, "Toujours la guerre," US News & World Report, October 30,1995.

The draft law in the Italian Parliament includes provisions that wouldimmediately expel illegal immigrants; an identity card for workers withpermits; a certificate from the country of origin testifying that the foreignerhas not spent longer than 30 days in prison for any crime; the introduction ofa new offense-- trafficking in immigrants, carrying a sentence of up to 15years; heavy sanctions penalizing those employing illegal labor; delaying theentry of family members until an foreign worker has been employed two years anddemonstrated that they can be supported. The bill will be amended to include an amnesty for some illegal aliens,accelerated procedures for deporting criminal aliens, and an immigration systemthat permits the unification of families in Italy. If the controls are introduced, the government believes that an estimated60,000 illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Brazil will beexpelled. Italy's 1986 and 1990 immigration laws were adopted as emergency measures and,after a rape committed by two Romanians in daylight in early October promptedcalls to enact the 1995 crackdown as an emergency measure. Caritas estimates that there were 922,000 legally registered immigrants inItaly in 1994--37 percent came from Europe, 25 percent from Asia, 19 percentfrom Africa, and 18 percent from the Americas. Legal immigrants in the workforce are mostly maids-60 percent--or in the public sector--18 percent--or inagriculture--16 percent. A member of the right-wing National Alliance has demanded an investigation ofthe community aid program that gives money to non-EU immigrants. The NationalAlliance wants to halt the distribution of if it is being given to illegalimmigrants. North Africans have been brought in to Italy as seasonal agricultural workerson permit. Many stay in Italy because they are afraid that if they leave, theycannot return. Italy reported that 21,500 foreigners were employed temporarilyin agriculture in 1994, up from 17,000 in 1993. Another 30,000 are believed tobe working illegally in Italian agriculture. Expulsion procedures allow 14 days to elapse between a court order and itsexecution, except in the case of serious crimes. This permits the poorlysurveyed illegals to destroy documents and disappear. Thus, of 60,000 expulsionorders issued last year no more than 12,000 were carried out.

Prague,with an unemployment rate of just one percent, is a particularly hard place tofind workers. A new automobile plant on the outskirts of the capital city saysit is having a hard time finding skilled workers. Housing presents another problem. Workers who are laid off cannot move toanother area because of a severe lack of housing. The government approved aplan to subsidize mortgages to relieve the housing crisis. There are an estimated 45,000 legal foreign workers, and an unknown number ofillegal workers. Apprehensions of illegal foreign workers have been on therise. In 1993, 750 foreigners without proper permits were expelled. In 1994, some982 were apprehended. Between January and October, 1995, some 1,025 foreignersworking illegally in the Czech Republic were expelled. According to the CzechInterior Ministry, most of the illegal foreign workers are Ukrainians in theconstruction industry. Czech construction companies are said to earn largeprofits because of low labor costs, and nonpayment of taxes and insurance. The Labor Office inspects companies for illegal workers every six months, andthe police foreign department inspects more often. Foreign workers without awork permit can be banned form the Czech Republic for one year. Employersfound employing workers without residence or work permits are fined between$9,600 and $38,500.

Elections are scheduled for December 17, and the Freedom Party isexpected to get between 27 and 30 percent of the votes, which may enable theFreedom Party to join a coalition government. There are believed to be 100,000 unauthorized immigrants in Austria. Haiderdemands tough laws to free the country of illegal immigrants, wants to empowerthe police to make systematic identity checks and has suggested using air forceplanes to fly foreigners back to their country of origin. Haider's biggestappeal though, is to those who are tired of the cronyism propagated by theSocial Democrats and People's Party that has governed the country since 1945. Some observers argue that although many fear the resurgence of the right wing,the rise of the multi-party system in countries such as Austria and Italy, isnecessary to strengthen democracy. And, they say, the far right parties willonly win a small share of the power. Two letter bombs exploded in separate incidents on October 16, injuring anIranian-born doctor and a social worker who deals with immigration. A letterbomb sent to a South Korean-born doctor was deactivated prior to explosion.The attacks are similar to a series of letter bombs sent in 1993 to peopleinvolved in immigration.

The city government will also pay for a return ticket if theimmigrant fails in his/her native land. There are 30,000 immigrants from Morocco, 50,000 from the former Dutch colonyof Surinam and 15,000 from the Cape Verde Islands in Rotterdam. Dutch government auditors call the country's asylum policy insufficient becausethere is a backlog of nearly 50,000 applications from asylum seekers hoping tosettle in the Netherlands. A 1994 legislative amendment to reduce the numberof immigrants seeking asylum and reducing the processing time has not had theintended effect, according to the Regional Planning Bureau in a report issuedon October 5. The report indicates that part of the reason for the long processing time,typically about 11 months, was delays in the exchange of information betweenImmigration and Naturalization Services, and the office in charge of housingrefugees.

Not content with this reduction,six members of the Hong Kong legislature hope to pass a bill that would haltall importation of workers. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has said he willveto the bill if it is passed. Hong Kong began to import foreign workers in1989 because of labor shortages. Unions welcomed the move, and employers criticized it. The maximum 17,000foreign workers employed on the new airport are exempted, as are the 1,000Chinese professionals allowed to work in Hong Kong. There are now 19,062 foreign workers employed in Hong Kong--including 3,500 ascooks and waiters--plus 3,509 foreign airport workers, and 203 Chineseprofessionals. There are also about 130,000 foreign maids in Hong Kong. The ImmigrationDepartment is reportedly considering the issuance of a special identity cardfor maids, so that they do not move from household work to stores andfactories, and requiring all foreign workers to surrender their identity cardsupon their departure to help prevent their use by illegal immigrants. TheAsian Domestic Workers' Union, which represents maids, has been organizingdemonstrations in support of an increase in the minimum wage for maids. Beginning January 1, 1996, Hong Kong employers wishing to employ foreignworkers will have to prove that local workers are not available by registeringtheir vacancies with the local Employment Service office and advertising for atleast two months for local workers. Emigration has averaged over 60,000 per year since 1990, up sharply from 20,000annually in the early 1980s. An estimated 500,000 of Hong Kong's 6.5 millionpeople have passports that would allow them to emigrate. In 1994, some 43,400Hong Kong residents emigrated to Canada. Polls suggest that almost half of all Hong Kong residents may have or developthe means to emigrate; 35 percent of Hong Kong residents are related to someoneliving abroad. Several countries are attempting to encourage at least some Hong Kong residentsto emigrate. Some 40,000 Hong Kong residents have the right to immigrate toSingapore, although only 6,500 have moved. There continues to be debate over the fate of 3.3 million residents who areconsidered British Dependent Territory Citizens and not entitled to immigrateto the UK. The British Parliament has refused to consider permitting more than50,000 Hong Kong heads of households to immigrate, leaving an unknown fate forsome Hong Kong residents, such as East Asians, who will not automatically beentitled to either Chinese or British citizenship. Despite heavy lobbying by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, the Britishgovernment is not expected to yield on this matter because of the government'sconcern with reducing immigration (see story on British Immigration Reform inthis issue). Chinese law currently permits non-Chinese to acquire Chinese nationality onlyif the meet one of the following criteria: 1) they are close relatives ofChinese nationals; 2) they settle in China or 3) they have other valid reasons.Many ethnic minorities may meet the criteria of having lived in Hong Kong formany years, but most non-Chinese living in Hong Kong do not want Chinesenationality. The number of Chinese allowed to immigrate to Hong Kong increased in 1995 from105 to 150 pre day. Increasing, Chinese mainlanders are finding that Hong Kongis not the economic heaven they envisioned. Many mainlanders with high leveleducation find that they must take lower status jobs when they move to HongKong. The language barrier also makes it more difficult to find adequateemployment. Mainlanders must also make do with small apartments because of theexpense of housing in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong governor acknowledged that the transition from the mainland tothe territory is not easy and that the government should help provide a smotherintegration. Many mainlanders are not aware that there are social servicesavailable for them. Portugal is turning Macao over to China in 1999, and offering 100,000 of the467,000 residents the right to immigrate to Portugal. On October 24, 84 Vietnamese spent nine hours on the tarmac at Hanoi Airport,refusing to disembark from a forced repatriation flight. Finally, theVietnamese consented to get off the plane with the assistance of uniformedVietnamese immigration police. Observes say that some of those being forciblerepatriated had to be restrained when they were being placed on the plane inHong Kong. Hong Kong is under pressure from China to repatriate the 20,000 boat peoplebefore 1997. Since 1989, more than 45,000 have returned to Vietnam.

Whatever the exact amount, the number of migrants is up sharply from100,000 in the early 1970s. Many of the migrant receiving countries do not regard themselves as"immigration countries," encouraging them to see migrant workers as traineesand students or to tolerate the presence of illegal workers. The Migrant Forumin Asia, a coalition of 50 support groups, asserts that the major problems ofmigrants flow from the inability of host countries to decide what role migrantswill play in their societies and economies. Labor-importing governments are reluctant to acknowledge any long-term need forforeign workers and to make plans for the immigration, and possiblyintegration, of foreigners. For this reason, the legal status of foreignworkers is often unclear, and there are more announcements of new drives tocurb illegal immigration than there are of bilateral labor agreements. Many fast-growing labor importers fear being swamped by immigrants frompopulous nearby nations. Unlike North America and Western Europe, in Asialabor importers are typically dwarfed in size by labor exporters--there areabout 10 Chinese for each Japanese, and 10 Indonesians for each Malay. Thismeans that some Japanese and Malaysians see immigration that may get out ofcontrol as a national security threat. Labor-exporting countries are increasingly concerned about the treatment oftheir nationals abroad. As a result of capital punishment being meted out tomigrant workers from the Philippines and Thailand, most governments have agreednot to permit workers under 25 to emigrate or to immigrate. However, it hasproven very difficult to enforce age limits--Malaysian and Filipinos reportedlycomplained when it was proposed that only women 35 or older could be maids inMalaysia. There is some dispute about the sustainability of fast growth in East Asia.The Fall 1994 issue of Foreign Affairs carried an article by Paul Krugmanentitled "The Myth of Asia's Miracle," which argued that many of thefast-growing Asian economies grew by adding labor and capital, but not byincreasing total factor productivity, or the increased output that results fromusing scarce resources more effectively. In other words, according to Krugman, Asian economies grew fast because theymobilized resources, Stalinist style--they did not work smarter, which, Krugmanargues, is the only way to achieve rapid growth in the long run. Since TFP is the residual factor that explains economic growth, after measuresof labor and capital, much of the argument about Krugman's thesis that Asia hasexperienced little growth in TFP hinges on how labor, capital, and thus TFP aremeasured. Asia is expected to have higher growth rates than the US and Europein the decades ahead, due mostly to rising education levels and high savingsrates, but the "Asian edge" in growth may be only one or two percent ratherthan three or four percent. A study of manufacturing productivity and compensation in the US and severalNICs showed that Korea narrowed the gap with the US fastest between 1970 and1990--output per Korean worker rose from 22 percent of the US level to 45percent. In Mexico, labor productivity in manufacturing was about 30 percentof US levels in both 1970 and 1990, and in the Philippines, it fell from 30 to15 percent of US levels. Compensation rose relative to US levels in most NICS--in Korea, from 10 to 30percent of US levels, and in the Philippines from 15 to 17 percent--due torising real wages and currency appreciation. Only in Mexico did compensationfall--from about 30 to 25 percent of US levels. This means that labor costs per unit of output rose in all the NICS studiedexcept Mexico. The unit costs of manufacturing goods fell from US levels inMexico, but the US gained in relative efficiency compared to Asian NICs. Forexample, Korean unit labor costs rose from about 45 percent of US levels to 75percent, and Philippine costs rose from 50 to 110 percent of US costs.

As of September 1, 1995, almost 17,000 foreign workers who hadcompleted their work contracts had disappeared without leaving the island, and12,000 remain in Taiwan, presumably working illegally. The "runaways" included11,000 Thais and 5,000 Filipinos. The National Police Administration plans to apprehend 1,000 illegal alienworkers each month, largely by offering police who arrest three illegal alienworkers cash awards. Previously, police reportedly had little incentive toapprehend illegal alien workers. According to Taiwan authorities, about seven percent or 1 in 14 foreign workershave illegally broken their contracts, by not staying with their assignedemployers, or by not leaving Taiwan after the contracts expired. About 220,000foreign workers have been admitted to Taiwan since 1992. Despite this problem with illegal foreign workers, the Taiwan government plansto allow in by the end of the year an additional 30,000 foreign nationals towork in various manufacturing companies and factories. This will be thelargest quota ever extended to the manufacturing sector by the Council of LaborAffairs.

"Taiwan-Bounty Hunting," China Economic NewsService October 3, 1995 _________________________________________ SingaporeSees Rise in Illegal AlienEmployment Singapore has about 300,000 foreign workers employed under one of the strictestguest worker programs in the world, but illegal alien employment in Singaporeseems to be increasing, and authorities have stepped up their enforcementefforts. In Singapore, two employers were jailed the first time they were found to havehired illegal aliens--a construction employer who hired 18 foreign workers whodid not have work permits was sentenced to 26 weeks in jail--the illegalforeign workers had been at work from one day to two months. First-time violators of Singapore's employer sanctions laws can be fined theequivalent of two to four years of the foreign workers' levy, or be jailed upto one year or both. According to police, an average 41 employers per monthare prosecuted for hiring illegal alien workers. In Singapore, the construction industry can hire five foreigners for everySingaporean employee. Even though controls are tight, illegal immigrants and overstayers made up morethan 17 per cent of the people arrested last year for committing crimes atconstruction sites. Some 1,065 foreigners were charged with committing crimesin Singapore in the first half of 1995. The Singapore government in October announced that it would raise theretirement age to 67 to avoid over-reliance on foreign workers. According tothe government: "We are short of workers, and it is better for Singaporeans towork longer than for us to rely more heavily on foreign workers. Hence theGovernment's long-term objective is to raise retirement age step by step to67." The retirement age was raised from 55 to 60 in 1993.

Economic growth is very uneven within China--privately-owned businessesin the five economic zones of the southeast and urban areas are growingfastest--and an estimated 50 to 100 million internal migrants within China havetaken advantage of higher wages in the coastal areas and largest cities bymoving there, at least temporarily. China has about 180 million urban workers, and 450 million working age farmers.Officially, 2.8 percent of China's urban workers are unemployed--about 95million urban workers are covered by unemployment insurance-- and 130 to 150million farmers are "surplus." Farmers are migrating to urban areas despite recent analyses that suggest urbanunemployment is far higher than three percent, making China's job creationchallenge formidable. Recent estimates put the urban unemployment rate at 12to 20 percent--20 percent unemployment would imply 35 million jobless urbanworkers. Over the next five years, China expects an average five million young workersto enter the labor force each year, four million state workers to be laid off,and 24 million farmers to head for the cities, so that about 30 million jobsmust be created annually to prevent unemployment from worsening. If Chinagrows by 10 percent annually, there would be about 13 million new urban jobscreated each year. Many Chinese cities include large numbers of recently-arrived rural migrants.For example, about 20 percent of Shanghai's 15 million residents are believedto have arrived from rural areas within the past five years. Chinese cities have taken different approaches to dealing with what some call"liumang" or troublemakers, blaming them for crime and crowding urbantransportation systems. Many cities such as Beijing require migrant workers,most of whom are 17 to 35 year-old men, to buy temporary work permits, withsanctions imposed on workers and their employers if migrants are caught withoutwork permits. Until the late 1980s, China's household registration system preventedlarge-scale internal migration, since persons not registered could not securesubsidized housing or food coupons. As China has permitted markets and pricesto substitute for rationing, Chinese residents were freer tomigrate--three-fourths of China's 1.2 billion people live in the northern andinland areas that have not boomed with the rest of China. Today, well established networks guide young rural men to particularconstruction sites and, increasingly, young rural women to particularfactories. China is attempting to dampen the demand-pull of urban jobs bycharging ever higher prices for urban work permits, and reduce the supply-pushof low rural wages by accelerating rural growth. Even though unemployment in China is low--three percent of China's 160 millionurban workers are jobless--at least 100 million Chinese workers are consideredfree to look for jobs because they are not needed on the farms to which theyare assigned, or they work for a state factory that has stopped paying them.In Shanghai, where 400 state firms closed in 1995, laid off workers require anaverage three years to find a new job. An inspection of joint venture operations in Shanghai found that many firms areviolating China's labor laws by forcing employees to work overtime, not givingthem contracts, and not paying insurance. Many workers earn monthly salaries,and they are supposed to be limited to 36 hours of overtime each month, but onefirm ordered its workers to work 80 hours of overtime--it received a fine of3,000 yuan ($360).

Thereare believed to be one to two million foreigners and five million Libyans inLibya. Libya began to expel Palestinians to expose "Israel's plan to create aPalestine without Palestinians." Libya has begun dismissing many of the 30,000Palestinians from their jobs in Libya, confiscating their houses, and orderingthem to leave the country. Libya's leader Qadafi says that he is not deportingthe Palestinians, but pushing them to return to their own country.Unemployment in Libya is unofficially put at 30 percent, middle class salarieshave been steadily falling, and there is reported to be unrest. Egypt does not permit Palestinians without permission to enter Jordan or theWest Bank to enter its territory, which led to the creation of a camp on theLibyan-Egyptian border that held 1,000 Palestinians in tents in mid-October. In mid-October, Libya asked the United Nations for permission to fly home up to1.2 million foreigners from various African countries--Libya has been under aUN air embargo since 1992. By then, some 5,000 Palestinians, 13,000 Sudaneseand 7,000 Egyptians had been expelled from Libya. Libya told the UN that it wanted to fly home 500,000 Sudanese, 300,000nationals of Chad, 250,000 persons from Mali, and others from Niger, Ghana,Nigeria, Benin, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. Diplomats saidthat Libya ordered the foreigners expelled so that African countries wouldsupport the country's request to lift or soften the UN sanctions. The foreigners in Libya include 8,000 hotel employees, 26,000 truck drivers,70,000 masons, 300,000 factory workers and 500,000 agricultural workers.Iraqis are reportedly eager to work in Libya--teachers can earn $200 permonth. Qadafi says that the foreign workers, who have no permits or identity cards,may be allowed to return later because of the country's dependence upon them.

Since its establishment in1948, some 2.5 million immigrants arrived, and 70,000 per year are expected toarrive in the next decade, meaning that immigration will add 1.3 percent to its5.5 million population every year via immigration, one of the highest rates ofimmigration in the world. Some 700,000 immigrants, mostly from the ex-USSR, arrived in the past fiveyears. There are currently 72,000 mostly Thai and Romanian guest workers on two-yearcontracts in Israel, including 43,000 in construction and 12,000 inagriculture. The Romanians report that the $550 monthly they earn in Israel isalmost six times the $100 monthly they could expect to earn at home. Israeli employers began to import Arab workers from the West Bank and Gazaafter the 1967 war. At the peak, 120,000 Arab workers from these areas wereemployed on a daily or weekly basis in Israel, including 72,000 legal commuterworkers. Beginning in 1994, Israel turned to non-Arab foreign workers, afterfailing to get unemployed Israelis to substitute for the banned Arab workers. Some question Israel's replacement of Arabs with other foreign workers, arguingthat Israel can never be secure if it has thousands of unemployed Arabs on itsborders. Even the new guest workers cause problems--Romanians have taken todrinking beer in their off hours in Jerusalem. Each day in Gaza, a rectangle of 147 square miles, the 16,800 workers who dohave permits to work in Israel but are barred from entering Israel cost theterritory $1 to $2 million. It has been estimated that each Arab workeremployed in Israel supports 20 dependents. "Israel's immigrants," Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, October 24, 1995.

The government considers illegalimmigrants a threat because of their involvement in drug trafficking andweapons and they are a drain on the country's limited social services and jobs. Illegal immigrants make up about 16 percent of Karachi's 12 millioninhabitants. About 80 percent of the immigrants are from Bangladesh. The fishing industry is the largest employer, though some are employed asdomestic workers or set up roadside stands selling sugar cane juice orcigarettes. To keep immigrant workers out of the fishing industry, the government declaredthat foreigners were not allowed in the harbor area without permission. Butthe government admits that it is difficult for employers to know who is legalor illegal, especially since fake Pakistani identity cares and passports arereadily available. Work at the Karachi Harbor has come to a near standstill because more than10,000 Bangladeshis, representing more than 60 percent of the harbor workforce,have avoided work since October 21 for fear of being arrested.

The official target for immigrants is25,000 annually, but 50,000 immigrants arrived in the 12 months up to June1995. Most New Zealand immigrants came from the UK and Australia until the 1990s.Since 1990, South Africans and immigrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, SouthKorea, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore have arrived. New Zealand is trying toforge a bicultural system which recognizes the rights of the indigenous Maori,who fear being swamped by Asian immigrants. Asian immigrants are criticized for using New Zealand to obtain cheapEnglish-language education's for their children. According to critics, Asianswith established businesses deposit funds in New Zealand banks, move theirfamilies to New Zealand, and then commute to Hong Kong or Singapore, using NewZealand as a "bolt hole." New Zealand, it is alleged, is stuck with educatingthe children of immigrants who do not intend to integrate. A recent survey found that more than half of the New Zealanders do not wantmore Asian and Pacific Island immigrants. Opposition to those from Australia,Britain and South Africa is less, ranging from 15 to 24 percent. The surveyfound that the elderly and low-income New Zealanders are the least toleranttoward immigrants. Beginning October 1, 1995, immigrants to New Zealand must post a bond ofUS$13,000 that is forfeited if the principal immigrant cannot pass an Englishtest, and immigrants entering under the business investment program will haveto put at least one-fourth of their funds in a local enterprise, rather thanleaving it in certificates of deposit.

On October 28, he announced that the more than90,000 mineworkers will be granted permanent residency. The agreement wasreached to late to allow them to vote in the November 1 elections. The National Union of Mineworkers claimed that immigrants from Europeancountries were being favored over the mostly black migrant workers formsouthern African nations. The union says that the workers from other Africannations are being treated the same way they were under apartheid. According to the Chamber of Mines, more than 400,000 gold and coal miners areemployed in South Africa. It estimated that 45 percent of its 1994 workforceand 44 percent of its 1993 workforce were hired from outside the country,primarily from southern Africa. The union challenged the Aliens Control Act, under which workers are entitledto permanent status after five years of working in South Africa. The unionargued that many black workers have worked in South Africa for 20 years and aredenied permanent status.

The maid claims that she killed her employer inself-defense after he raped her. The Philippines government is still working to secure her release from jail andrepatriation. Although the death penalty has been dropped, the court mayimpose a jail term and award damages to the family. There are an estimated 27,000 Filipino overseas contract workers in the UAE.With a population of between 2.5-3 million, nearly 70 percent of the populationis foreign. Estimates from Asian embassies in Abu Dhabi and consular officialsin Dubai suggest there are more than 1.5 million Asian and Egyptian workers inthe UAE sending about $ 2.5 billion a year back to their own countries. Many workers are recruited by illegal agencies who offer a sponsor to anemployee, but the employee may be passed along to yet another employer. In theUAE, it is particularly difficult because of the ruling sheikdoms of the sevenemirates often interpret federal legislation to suit themselves. Federalofficials admit that the existing labor and immigration laws are not beingapplied and it is only a matter of time before a crisis erupts.

On November 29, 1995, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigrationapproved S1394 on a 5-2 vote, and sent the combined bill to the full SenateJudiciary Committee for markup. Both the House and Senate bills would reduce legal immigration, which was804,416 in FY95 and take new steps to reduce illegal immigration--1.4million aliens were apprehended in the US in FY95. Simpson's S1394 would allow the entry of 450,000 family-sponsoredimmigrants to per year (down from 535,000), plus 90,000 economic/employmentimmigrants (down from 140,000), plus refugees. Immediate relatives of UScitizens - spouses, unmarried minor children and parents - could continue toenter the US without restriction, but the definition of immediate relativewould be narrowed in one respect: parents 65 or older would qualify only if atleast half of their children live in the US. A limit of 85,000 visas annually would be available for spouses andunmarried minor children of legal immigrants who sponsor theirimmigration. There would no longer be visas for unskilled foreigners to fill vacant jobsin the US. American employers bringing foreign professionals to the US astemporary workers to fill vacant jobs would be required to pay the prevailingwage for that occupation and area, plus a fee of 10 percent of the foreignworker's first year total compensation, or $10,000, whichever is higher, to aprivate training fund that would prepare US workers to fill the foreigners'jobs. On November 13, a group of businesses led by the National Association ofManufacturers held a news conference to protest Simpson's call for fees onskilled foreign workers. The NAM and the American Civil Liberties Union issueda joint statement of opposition to Simpson's bill on November 29. Some US employers see US universities as a "probationary system" from whichthey can select the best and brightest foreigners as soon as they areidentified. The Simpson bill initially would have required foreigners whostudy in the US to return home for at least several years before seeking toimmigrate to the US, but this provision was dropped by November 29. In early November, a group of California representatives called for theHouse immigration bill to be split into parts dealing with legal and illegalimmigration. Having two bills, observers believe, would slow themomentum to reduce legal immigration levels. In the House markup of the comprehensive revision of the laws governingboth legal and illegal immigration, much of the debate centered on provisionsthat affect specific immigrants and businesses. For example, the inclusion of27,000 slots for "diversity immigrants" was widely considered a concession tothe Irish lobby and its representatives. The mandatory national registry ofworkers proposed in earlier versions of the bill was changed to a five-statepilot that would apply to employers with four or more workers, a concession toemployers. The House proposed few changes to permanent and temporaryeconomic/employment-based immigration. However, there was a change sought byemployers in the much-criticized H-1B program, under which US employers"attest" that they cannot find US workers to fill vacant jobs. There were a number of newspaper accounts of US employers laying off USworkers to replace them with H-1B foreigners, especially in routine computerprogramming. To curb abuses by so-called "body shops" that employ mostlyRussian or Indian programmers for up to six years, the House bill says that, ifmore than 15 or 20 percent of a company's labor force are H-1B workers, thecompany is considered "dependent" on H-1B workers, and is subject to heightenedDOL oversight. Non-dependent companies are subject to less DOL oversight. The welfare measures included in Congressional reforms would substituteblock grants administered by states for current federal entitlement programsunder which expenditures depended on the number of eligible persons who applyfor benefits. Legal immigrants who are not US citizens would generally be ineligible forfood stamps and SSI. Future legal immigrants would generally be ineligible formost federal assistance for five years after their arrival, but states wouldhave the option of providing cash assistance and Medicaid to legal immigrantscurrently in the US. Congress dropped a ban on immigrants receiving federal assistance forhigher education at the behest of colleges that feared they would losestudents. About 40,000 immigrant students at CCNY receive Pell grants, and7,000 receive student loans. Congress also permitted immigrant children to participate in Head Start,but both their parents' income, as well as the income of whoever sponsored themas immigrants, would be taken into account when determining eligibility forbenefits. The Medicaid reforms in Congress would create a $627 million fund to coverthe cost of providing medical services to illegal aliens in the 15 states withthe most illegal aliens. California spends $17 billion on Medi-Cal, theCalifornia version of medical assistance for the poor, that serves about fivemillion persons.

According tothe judge, "The authority to regulate immigration belongs exclusively to thefederal government, and state agencies are not permitted to assume thatauthority." Thus, California may not develop a system for having teachers, doctors, andother service providers report suspected illegal aliens, and state efforts todeny K-12 education to illegal alien children, or welfare benefits that arepartially federally funded, are unconstitutional. California may deny illegalaliens post-secondary education, and services that are completely state funded,which means that California colleges and universities may be able to ask theINS about an applicant's immigration status and deny admission to those who areundocumented. The judge's ruling means that the fate of Prop. 187 will be decided withouta trial, in which experts may have been called to testify about the number ofillegal immigrants, and the reasons why they come to the US and seek benefits. Governor Wilson on November 30 asked the Los Angeles judge to reconsiderthat part of her ruling that prevents California from denying K-12 education toillegal alien children. According to Wilson, the US Supreme Court in its 1982Plyer v Doe ruling said that Texas must educate unauthorized children becausethe state presented no evidence that educating such children caused the stateany hardship. Wilson asserted that California has such evidence--it estimatesthe cost of educating unauthorized children at more than $1.5 billionannually. The State of California plans to appeal the judge's ruling, first to the9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and eventually to the US Supreme Court. Most theprovisions of Prop. 187 will not be implemented during the appealsprocess. Many observers believe that approval of Prop 187 in November 1994, plusCongressional actions that restrict the access of non-US citizens to welfareand other benefits, is responsible for the upsurge in applications for UScitizenship. About one-third of the 25 million foreign-born persons in the USare naturalized US citizens, and another 10 to 12 million are eligible tonaturalize. There were 340,000 applications for US citizenship in FY92, 592,000 inFY94, and a record one million in FY95. A Los Angeles health clinic says that despite a seven-month campaign toeducate patients about Prop. 187, visits to the clinic remain 25 percent belowpre-Prop 187 levels. Doctors in Los Angeles estimate that there has been a 40percent drop in the number of women visiting the clinic during the firsttrimester of pregnancy.

The INS plans to expandthe service to 1,000 employers in 1996. Companies in Santa Ana and the City of Industry are voluntarilyparticipating in the screening. Critics asserted that even though a worker'sdocuments are supposed to be checked only after the worker is hired, employerswould use the computer system to pre-screen workers. Under the pilot computer system, companies transmit the INS A-numbers ofimmigrant workers, and they are told instantly whether the worker is legallyauthorized to work in the US. If the worker's A-number appears to be invalid,the INS promises a check within three days. If this second investigation alsofinds that the number is invalid, the worker can continue to work for 30 days,but must visit the INS to straighten out his or her status within thatperiod. The INS on November 30 announced that it would accept proposals fromemployers to complete the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification Formelectronically. US employers are asked to submit ideas for maintaining theintegrity of the check while reducing their paper work. During a three-week test in Anaheim in October 1995, police questioned eachperson arrested about their legal status, and 37 percent of the 750 personsarrested admitted that they were in the US illegally. The INS in Los Angelesbroke up a forged documents business that had materials on hand to create79,000 false ID sets. The INS continues to step up the number of aliens removed from the US. InFY95 the INS apprehended about 1.4 million aliens who were unlawfully in theUS. Almost all left the US voluntarily, but 49,000 were removed, either bybeing excluded from the US, or after deportation proceedings. Most of those who leave the US voluntarily, are excluded and deported areMexicans. For example, 80 percent of the criminals removed, and 73 percent ofthe non-criminals removed in October 1995 were Mexicans, followed by nationalsof Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. News articles on Operation Gatekeeper said that the INS had, in the $46million initiative, succeeded in sharply cutting the influx of illegal aliensin the westernmost section of the border with a three-tiered system of fences,lights, and agents. However, it is also clear that there are more illegalentries further east, where the INS has not yet developed the three-tieredborder control system. Residents in eastern San Diego, where apprehensions have jumped, arereportedly so upset by aliens crossing their property that some have beguntaking vigilante actions against the aliens. Local law enforcement officialshave warned residents not to shoot persons walking across theirproperty. In late October, the Border Patrol moved to fire five agents--one who, inNovember 1993, hit an alien over the head with a rock, and four who covered upthe incident. The Border Patrol agent who told the truth about the incidentwas threatened by other agents, and transferred away from the border for hissafety. The Border Patrol agents' union is appealing the terminations. In mid-November, the INS announced that it would have to close 25 interioroffices, including the INS office in Fresno, if Congress orders the agency toput yet more agents on the border. Critics noted that it appears thatCongressional Republicans would rather target Mexican workers at the borderthan the US employers who hire them. Catherine Yang, "Cheese It--the Boss!"

Somesupporters of separation blamed non-French speaking minorities for voting toremain part of Canada--the 82 percent of Quebec's seven million residents whospeak French mostly supported separation, while the 18 percent who do not speakFrench mostly opposed it. Quebec's premier blamed the narrow defeat on "money and the ethnic vote."He later said his remarks were too harsh but did not retract them. He resignedlater in the week. Quebec's deputy premier surrendered his cabinet post asimmigration minister on November 10 after a newspaper reported he had yelled ata Latina hotel desk clerk after the vote-- blaming her and her fellowimmigrants for the defeat of the independence referendum. Since the vote, many minority residents are concerned about the future,expecting that the next general election in two years will bring anotherseparatist referendum. Quebec absorbed 212,413 immigrants from 1990 to 1994, and only 11,747 camefrom France. Lebanon, Hong Kong and Haiti sent the largest numbers. After thevote, many immigrants in Quebec reportedly plan to leave Quebec for otherprovinces. Quebec accounts for about 25 percent of Canada's population and 22 percentof its GDP. A 1980 referendum resulted in 60 percent of Quebec voters votingto stay in Canada. US House of Representative Speaker Newt Gingrich said on October 30 thatthe referendum was a "warning" to Americans about the dangers of a bilingualsociety. He said that the possible split in Canada may give impetus to the"English First" movement in the US. Canada on November 17 announced changes in its system for selecting about25,000 skilled immigrants annually, and their 35,000 dependents. The purposeof the changes is to encourage the immigration of persons who have enougheducation to quickly change occupations, and minimize competition with youngand unemployed Canadians. The unemployment rate in Canada is 9.4 percent, and almost 16 percent forpersons under 25. Unemployment peaked in 1990-92, when 1.5 million personswere unemployed. Today, there are about 1.4 million unemployed Canadians,despite adding 1.4 million jobs, because 1.3 million workers joined the laborforce. Under the revised point system, immigrants seeking to come to Canadathrough the point system would receive up to 20 percent of the maximum numberof points for education, 20 percent for English or French, more points forpersons 25 to 35 to avoid competing with under-25 year old Canadians. The topfive sources of skilled worker immigration to Canada are Hong Kong, China, UK,Philippines, and South Africa. The changes affect about 40 percent of the immigrants who arrive innon-Quebec Canada; Quebec has its own immigrant selection system. Some Canadians who endorsed NAFTA hope to increase Mexican migration toCanada. Mexico has expanded summer programs under which up to 10,000 Mexicanscome to Canada to learn English or French, and some universities are recruitingMexican students. Canada plans to strengthen its affirmative action program with Bill C-64,expected to be approved in 1996. Under Canada's Federal Employment Equity Actof 1986, four groups of persons are afforded affirmative actionprotection--women, who were 46 percent of the Canadian labor force in 1991, andheld 46 percent of the jobs covered by the current law; some nine percent ofthe labor force were 'visible minorities,' and held eight percent were in jobscovered by the Employment Equity Law; aboriginals, one percent of the laborforce; and disabled persons, 2.6 percent. Almost 80 percent of the 1.9 million visible minorities in Canada's laborforce are immigrants. For example, Chinese-Canadians are about 26 percent ofCanada's visible minorities, and 81 percent are immigrants. Indeed, overthree-fourths of the visible minorities covered by Canadian affirmative actionare immigrants, and almost half of them arrived within the past decade. Canada's affirmative action law grew out of the Abella Royal Commission onEquality in Employment in 1983. The Abella Commission recommended thataffirmative action be based on Canada's 1983 Charter of Rights and Freedoms,which permits discrimination to ameliorate "conditions of disadvantagedindividuals or groups." In Ontario, a year-old affirmative action program based on workersself-reporting their status to establish firm-by-firm employment goals is underattack and may be repealed. The NDP government approved an employment equityprogram in September 1994, but the new provincial government has announced thatit plans to repeal the legislation.

The pacto projects real growth of threepercent in 1996, and an inflation rate of 20 percent. In 1995, the Mexicaneconomy is expected to shrink by six percent, and inflation is expected to be50 percent. Mexico has a series of minimum wages, and the pacto would raise mostminimum wages by 20 percent to about $3 per day at a $1 to 7 peso exchangerate. On November 8, the Mexican peso reached a low of 7.8 pesos=$1. Short-terminterest rates rose to 54 percent, threatening to prolong Mexico's recession.Despite more privatizations, Mexico expects to attract only $5 billion in FDIin 1996. Since 1987, Mexico has used pactos to establish its macroeconomic policies.The exchange rate was used as an anti-inflation policy, which means that Mexicoallowed the peso to depreciate against the dollar, but not enough to compensatefor Mexico's much higher inflation rate. This too-slow peso devaluationallowed the peso to become overvalued in 1994, which in turn encouraged Mexicancompanies to buy foreign companies and foreign machinery. Mexico could buy more from other countries than it sold to them becauseforeigners poured money into Mexico in the hope that it would be the world'snext fast-growing economy. Shocks in 1994, such as political assassinations,would normally have led to faster devaluation, but were not permitted to do so,in part because of the presidential election campaign. Mexico has a much lower savings rate than the Asian Tiger economies--savings are only 16 percent of GDP in Mexico-- causing Mexico to rely onforeigners' savings to finance development, and thus making Mexico vulnerableto wild swings in investment, interest rates, and the value of the peso. In aneffort to increase savings, the October 29 pacto includes reforms of Mexico's52-year old social security system (IMSS), which currently has about 10 millionworker-members and, with their families, covers some 39 millionMexicans. The comprehensive IMSS provides health care, pensions of $2 per day afterage 65, and offers a number of other services, from theaters to discountstores. When it was established, the average Mexican lived to be less than 50,so that funds were available to establish a hospitals and clinics and provideother services as contributions exceeded expenditures. Today, Mexicans live tobe 70, on average, and it is estimated that, by 2002, payouts and expenses willexceed employer and worker contributions. Workers and employers contributed about 25 percent of gross pay to IMSS;for a clerk earning $185 per month, the IMSS contribution is about $45, ofwhich the worker pays $11. The reform announced October 29 would permitworkers to establish Individual Retirement Accounts rather than join the IMSS,and permit self-employed persons, and those in the informal economy, to joinIMSS. The IMSS lost one million members in 1995 as workers lost their jobs, andthere are few jobs for workers joining the labor force this year. The economic recession in Mexico has highlighted severe rural poverty inChiapas, Guerrero, Puebla, Oaxaza, Hidalgo, Veracruz, Michoacan, and Durango.By one estimate, four million Mexican children under the age of five aremalnourished. US interest in and concern about Mexico has grown sharply since NAFTA wentinto effect on January 1, 1994. Most experts argue that NAFTA did more thansimply ratify inevitable economic integration, but it did not give Mexicans andAmericans a sense that their fates are intertwined in the manner in which theEU links the fates of Europeans in member countries. The number of maquiladoras rose to 2,600 by the end of 1995; some 600,000Mexicans work in these foreign-owned assembly plants in the border area. About40 percent of US-Mexican trade in manufactured goods is within one firm, aswhen Sony sends picture tubes to the Mexican maquiladora that makes TVs, andimports the finished televisions into the US. Each NAFTA country has established a National Advisory Committee toimplement the labor side agreement to NAFTA. The 12-member US NAO met for thefirst time in November 1995, and discussed tackling issues that include childlabor and migrant workers. The US NAO has a fax-on-demand service to provideinformation on the labor side agreement: (202) 273-3454 or (202)273-4315. As a result of complaints about Sony's firing of union activists in April1994 at its Nuevo Laredo factory, a tripartite meeting on union registrationand certification procedures was held November 8-9, 1995 in San Antonio. Thefired workers attempted to field an opposition slate of candidates in a unionelection and, when that failed, they called for a wildcat strike. The firedworkers accepted severance pay from Sony. Mexico's Labor Ministry allegedly failed to recognize the independent unionthat Sony's workers wanted to organize and, with the support of the establishedunion affiliated with the dominant Mexican union federation CTM, Sony fired theunion activists for not being union members of the recognized union. Mexican unions have supported a complaint by 235 Hispanic workers who losttheir jobs when Sprint closed a facility near San Francisco just before anelection in which the Communications Workers of America sought to representthem. Between January 1, 1994 and September 30, 1995, the Labor Departmentcertified 42,221 US workers as eligible for TAA assistance. Of those, 31,876were declared eligible in fiscal year 1995, compared with 10,345 in the firstnine months of 1994. The Labor Department has certified workers as eligible for NAFTA-TAAbenefits in 317 of the 589, or about 54 percent, of the petitions filed andreviewed since January 1, 1994. Cases in which US workers lost jobs becauseproduction shifted to Mexico include Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. of Syracuse,New York, which displaced 2,600 workers; Regency Packing Co. of Naples,Florida, (1,334 workers); Woodward Governor Co. of Stevens Point, Wisconsin(1,330 workers); Lockheed of Fort Worth, Texas (1,200 workers); LouisianaPacific Corp. of Portland, Oregon (1,143 workers); Copper Range Co. of WhitePine, Michigan (1,133 workers). The top three US imports from Mexico so far in 1995 are electricalmachinery, equipment and parts ($5.2 billion in 1995), Mexican oil ($4.1billion), and vehicles ($4.3 billion). Mexico's government noted and rejected a resolution passed by California'sRepublican party that asked Mexico not to implement dual nationality. Underthe proposal being considered by Mexico's Congress, Mexicans could retain theirright to own and inherit property in Mexico even if they became UScitizens. There have been fears that some of the 1.3 million Mexicans apprehended inthe US each year would apply for asylum to obtain the right to work at leasttemporarily in the US. However, no Mexicans who applied for asylum wereapproved between 1990 and 1993. In FY95, some 9,300 Mexicans applied forasylum in the US, and 54 were granted asylum, including environmentalists andgovernment critics. At the end of November, corruption in Mexico was highlighted when the wifeof the brother of ex-President Salinas was arrested in Geneva attempting towithdraw some of the $84 million Raul Salinas had deposited there under adifferent name. Even though Raul Salinas never reported more than $192,000 peryear in income, he managed to acquire a number of properties in Mexico, plusbank deposits in Switzerland and elsewhere. According to the Mexican AttorneyGeneral, 80 percent of the federal judicial police are corrupt. Sam Dillion, "Drug plane unloaded in Mexico, Maybe by Police," New YorkTimes, November 30, 1995.

Inmany cases, US employers and brothel owners finance the illegal entry, whichcan cost up to $35,000. The illegal workers then pay off the debt by workingin the US. According to US authorities, some Thai travel agents specialize insupplying false travel documents to Thais seeking US tourist visas, and corruptThai immigration and airline employees help them to leave the country. The UShas begun a crackdown on illegal aliens at the source--in Bangkok. A Chinese woman who was smuggled into New York by boat for $29,000 in 1994was killed by Chinese gangs in New York after her family in China did not paythe $38,000 ransom they demanded when they kidnapped her in 1995. The case illustrates the relative ease with which families in the Fujianregion of China, where per capita incomes are less than $500 per year, raisethe equivalent of 60 years local earnings to send a family member illegally tothe US. Most illegal Chinese immigrants to the US come from three counties outsideFuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, largely because of the readyavailability of smugglers, and the means and willingness to pay them --in part from remittances from those in the US. The case also illustrated the dangers faced by such illegal aliens in theUS. Competing "snakehead" gangs that smuggle Chinese aliens into the USsometimes kidnap illegal Chinese immigrants, as in this case, and then demandransom from relatives in China. There are reports that the Chinese exodus to the US is waning primarilybecause there are fewer Chinese taking the risk of placing themselves in thehands of smugglers who often exploit them. The Chinese government claims thata massive education campaign on the dangers of smuggling is responsible for thedecline. After the Golden Venture fiasco, dozens of smugglers were arrestedand imprisoned by the Chinese government. The main result of the crackdown on smugglers is that fewer Chinese areleaving by boat. With more money, those wishing to go to the US can pay to flyfirst to Central American or the Caribbean, then on to Puerto Rico, and finallyto the US.

Thedebate is also raising the issue of whether America is producing enoughhome-grown scientists and engineers. The Center for Immigration Studies in Washington DC reports that 12 percentof America's scientists and engineers in 1990 were foreign-born professionals.Many of the foreign science and engineering students in US universities remainin the US after graduation. The National Science Foundation reports that 49percent of the PhDs in computer science in 1993 were awarded to foreigners, upfrom 36 percent in 1983. Corporations and universities argue that the US does not have enoughskilled workers to fill all the jobs offered, and that, to keep the US economycompetitive, US companies must have easy access to the world's best andbrightest. Companies may not ask for foreign workers if American workers areavailable. But many companies get around that law by writing job descriptionstailored to fit particular foreign candidates. The most well-documented casesof US worker displacement occur in routine software programming. There,temporary H-1B visa workers have undercut some US programmers. Foreign doctors provide a classic example of the dilemmas involved inreversing the incentives to employ foreigners in a particular occupation andarea. About 149,000 foreign-born doctors are practicing in the US, making themabout 20 percent of all US doctors. In recent years, about 25,000 foreignershave entered the US each year for medical training . Some 75 to 90 percentstay in the US by agreeing to practice in "medically underserved" areas,usually by obtaining visa waivers from federal agencies, even though foreignerswho enter the US for medical education must sign a pledge to leave. According to critics, the federal policy of paying $150,000 per for eachdoctor in training, regardless of his/her nationality, has encouraged hospitalsin the inner cities and rural areas to depend on foreign medical schoolgraduates. The hospitals that employ foreign doctors argue that only foreigndoctors are willing to provide medical care in these areas. Doctors' median incomes dropped in 1994 to $150,000, while the medianhousehold income of all Americans rose slightly to $32,264 in 1994. One reasonwhy doctors' incomes fell is that the number of doctors more than doubledbetween 1965 and 1995, from 266,000 to 661,000. Despite the addition of150,000 doctors over the past decade, the number of medically underserved areashas increased. A panel of experts has recommended reducing the number of slots in medicalschools by 20 to 25 percent over the next decade. In 1994, there were some45,000 applicants for 16,000 slots in US medical schools. There were 23,500international medical graduates in training in US medical schools in 1994, andthe report urged their number to be reduced. In Calexico, California, a town on the US-Mexican border about 100 mileseast of San Diego, Filipina nurses recruited under the Nurses Relief Act of1989, which expired on September 30, 1995, were placed at a hospital that wentbankrupt, leaving them unpaid. The 10 nurses were recruited by GemsInternational in Manila; each paid Gems $3,500, plus 10 percent of their firstyear's wages, for transportation and fees. Gems has since gone out ofbusiness, although its president is operating another recruitmentagency. Under the NRA, nurses must stay with the hospital that recruited them orfind their visas invalidated. It was this requirement that reportedly kept theFilipina nurses in Calexico even though they were not being paidregularly. Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has latched onto the issue of foreignworkers in his campaign. He says that low-wage immigrants and low-wage foreignworkers compete with native-born Americans and drive wages down. His solutionis to restrict immigration and imports. The au pair program, which grants 10,000 young Europeans 13-month visas tocare for children in US homes, lapsed temporarily in October 1995, promptingprotests from families that were counting on the arrival of au pairs. Underthis "cultural exchange" program, European girls aged 18 to 25 are recruitedthrough one of eight US agencies and matched with US families willing to pay anagency fee and travel expenses of about $4,000, plus $115 per week, but noSocial Security or other payroll taxes. The cost of an au pair is about $200 per week over 13 months, or about$10,000 annually, versus $300 per week, plus payroll taxes and benefits, or$15,000 to $20,000, for US nannies. Complaints from US nannies about unfaircompetition, and questions about the cultural exchange value of child careduties of up to 45 hours per week, prompted changes in the program that requireau pairs to receive at least 32 hours of training, and to take at least sixhours of courses at a US college or university.

By comparison, only about 300 Haitians were picked upbetween the time 20,000 US troops entered Haiti in October 1994 and November15, 1995. Haitians are reportedly paying smugglers up to $3,000 each to betaken to the US. The 6,000 UN troops in Haiti are scheduled to leave inFebruary 1996. The fifth round of bilateral negotiations between the United States andCuba ended on November 28, 1995. Cuba and the US were unable to agree to areduction in the $750 fee imposed on Cubans who want to emigrate to the US.Cuban sources said they will seek to maintain the previously agreed upon 20,000minimum of US visas to be granted annually to Cubans who wish to emigrate tothe US. The countries also failed to agree upon the fate of 1,200 Cubans in USdetention centers who arrived during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. The US claimsthat the detainees have criminal backgrounds; Havana counters that the USgovernment is exaggerating the criminal background of the detainees. At theJuly talks, Cuba pledged to continue to prevent a mass exodus of Cubans boundfor the US. In the past 10 months, the US government issued more than 24,000 entryvisas to Cubans. The US promised to grant at least 20,000 immigration visasper year to Cubans in 1994. The Cuban economy has shrunk by almost one-third since 1990, including a 15percent drop in GDP in 1993. Cuba has opened its door to foreign investors tostimulate its economy, and keep migrants at home, but its efforts to attractforeign businesses have been hampered by anti-business regulations andattitudes. Since 1990, about $737 million in foreign investment has beenannounced--one third is from Mexico, and another third is from Spain andCanada. At the end of a conference in Havana on "The Nation and Migration," theCuban government announced that the 1.2 million overseas Cubans will be able toobtain travel documents that would allow then to come and go as they please forup to two years. Cubans abroad send an estimated $400 million to the island. There are about 11 million Cubans; they represent about one-third of thepopulation of the Caribbean. There are about two million Cubans living off theisland; half are in the US. Cubans can exchange their pesos for dollars, in Cuba's increasinglydollarized economy, at a mid-November rate of 25 to 30 pesos for $1. Anaverage salary in Cuba is 125 pesos per month. While foreigners are in theory allowed to buy land, the Cuban constitutionprohibits the sale of land, so foreigners must lease rather than buy the landon which their facilities sit. Foreign businesses are required to pay theirCuban workers in dollars at the official $1 to 1 peso rate, although the blackmarket rate is $1 to 25 pesos. The Cuban government pays workers employed byforeign businesses in pesos, and pockets the difference. There is widespread agreement that the US embargo on trade with Cuba willsoon be lifted; former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Benston, among others, assertedthat if the US can lift the embargo on Vietnam, where American soldiers losttheir lives, it can resume trade with Cuba. US businessmen are visiting Cuba,and signing letters of intent to do business there if the embargo islifted. Canadian mining and other businesses already operating in Cuba report thatthe educated Cuban labor force can run high-productivity facilities with fewexpatriate managers--Cuba's literacy rate is reported to be higher thanCanada's. However, it is reportedly difficult to make long-term business plansbecause the legal and regulatory framework is still evolving--the Cuban pesowas made convertible in 1993, a Central Bank was established in 1994, and theforeign investment law was approved in 1995. Some 200,000 Cubans have taken advantage of the right to be self-employed,but they are so far prohibited from hiring employees, a prohibition that may bedropped in 1996. The integration of Cuba into the North American economy is expected to haverepercussions throughout the Caribbean. Several of the larger Caribbeannations, including the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which together have over40 percent of the Caribbean's 36 million people, fear that current US interestand investment may move to Cuba. In some Caribbean nations, 10 to 20 percentof the population born on the island lives in the US. "Cuba rebuff US request to lower emigration fees, Agence France Presse,November 29, 1995.

Dubbed theBarcelona Declaration, the agreement was part of a blueprint for increasingeconomic progress in the Mediterranean basin through increased trade andpolitical cooperation. Germany had pressed to have the Mediterranean nations agree to take backtheir nationals who were caught working illegally in the northern Europeancountries. The final wording speaks not of an obligation to take backnationals, but of a vaguer responsibility to accept the return of nationalsapprehended in Europe--" the partners, aware of their responsibility forreadmissision, agree to adopt the relevant provisions and measures, by means ofbilateral agreements or arrangements, in order to readmit their nationals whoare in an illegal situation." German officials said they will continue to pursue the matter in bilateraltalks. As the officials argued over the final Barcelona Declaration, about 5,000people marched through the city streets protesting the "wall of shame" the EUis creating in immigration. The final declaration called for the establishment of an EU-Mediterraneanfree trade area by 2010, and $6 billion in EU aid to its Mediterraneanneighbors. Algeria and Egypt pressed to have agriculture included in theproposed free trade clause, but the EU rejected their request. Algeria'sforeign minister asserted that "The EU's common agricultural policy isprotectionist so you cannot talk about free trade and block a part ofcommercial activity." The EU has a GDP of $7 trillion; the 12 southern and eastern Mediterraneannations have a GDP of about $400 million. Germany and France are working on a four-point plan for the next round ofEuropean integration, which includes a proposal to yield more immigration andasylum powers to Brussels. The initiative will be finalized at the December 7Franco-German summit. The European Commission would draw up laws on visas and asylum rights, andensure they are enforced. The European Court of Justice would rule on caseswhere EU law had not been properly applied. France is reluctant to cedeimmigration authority to the EU. The EU's Justice and Home Affairs Council issued a list of 100 countriesthat will face strict visa requirements for the next six months. Bulgaria andRomania are the two of the six former Communist nations on theblacklist. The Bulgarian parliament requested that Bulgaria be removed from the list.The Bulgarian government is especially concerned because Bulgaria would like tojoin the EU. The parliament said that the removal of Bulgaria from the listwill support democracy and economic reform in the country. The EU signed an accord on November 11 with Morocco that will be combinedwith similar deals with Tunisia and Israel to form the cornerstone of thefuture Euro-Mediterranean free trade area. Illegal immigration has been asticking point because the diplomats argue that the issue is out of place inthe Morocco accord. Therefore, the ministers compromised, agreeing thatcountries should be allowed to negotiate individually with Rabat aboutimmigration. On December 1-2, the EU is scheduled to tackle the smuggling of prostitutesinto Western Europe. The International Organisation for Migration reports thatmost of the women are Eastern Europeans are under 25, and smuggled into WesternEurope by gangs. One million foreigners became nationals of one of the present 15 EU membernations between 1990 and 1993, according to Eurostat, the EC statistical officein Luxembourg. Most of those naturalized in Europe were from Morocco, Turkey,or ex-Yugoslavia. France naturalized the most foreigners-- 233,000--followedby the UK, with 218,000; Benelux, 204,000, Germany, 129,000, and Sweden,116,000. The number of naturalizations doubled between 1981 and 1993. Most of thosenaturalized were from non-EU nations, rather than e.g., Germans opting forFrench nationality--only nine percent, or 26,000, of the 290,000naturalizations in 1993 were citizens of one EU nation who were naturalized inanother. In France and Germany - traditional destinations for migrant workers -rates of naturalization for the most populous groups (Algerian, Moroccan andPortuguese in France, Turkish in Germany) remain low. There has been a sharprise in the number of Asians naturalized in Sweden--most arrived as refugees --a development not observed elsewhere in the EU. The UK had the highestpercentage of Asians who naturalized - nearly 18,000 or a third of the EUtotal. Most of the EU nationals who became citizens of another European countrybecame naturalized Swiss citizens--some 6,046 Europeans were naturalized in1993.

Howard alsoannounced that asylum seekers who come from neighboring third countries, suchas Germany or France, will be returned to those countries within 24 hours.Asylum seekers wishing to appeal will have to remain in the third country, andwill not be allowed to return to Britain during the appeal process. In a newspaper article outlining his reforms on November 20, Howard saidthat Britain "should be a haven (for refugees), not a honey pot." The immigration package also includes employer sanctions: employers wouldbe required to check the immigration status of new hires and makes it acriminal offense to hire illegal aliens. Employers are displeased with themeasures, especially the criminal sanctions. One business leader argued duringa television interview that the new rules would dissuade employers form hiringany new workers. As expected, the Home Office confirmed that the bill will include a "whitelist" of countries that the UK government deems safe. Although the final listhas not been released, Howard has confirmed that Nigeria, Algeria and Sri Lankaare not included. The first safe countries on the list are expected to includePoland, Romania and Bulgaria; India and Pakistan; states of the former SovietUnion; and some countries in South America and Africa. Labour's Tony Blair called for the bill to be referred to a Commonsstanding committee, and for expert witness testimony to deflate the "racecard," instead of having the bill considered in the charged atmosphere of theCommons. Although initially sympathetic to Labor's proposal, Prime MinisterJohn Majors rejected the idea, according to Labor, to make the Labour Partyappear to be soft on immigration. On November 2, it was revealed that Home Secretary Howard, who hassteadfastly said that British immigration policy will be decided in Britain,had secretly agreed with other European ministers on a coordinated immigrationand asylum policy. Two key proposals in the Immigration and Asylum Bill wereagreed to behind closed doors in 1992. The first of the proposals was thedevelopment of the "white list," which was adopted by EU home affairs ministersin London in 1992. The second proposal - the abolition of full appeal rights to those refugeesarriving via a safe third country - appears in an EU resolution, adopted byHoward in Luxembourg in June. The Home Office said in response that theresolutions were agreed to because they did not conflict with proposals forstopping illegal immigration to Britain. At a November 23 European Union meeting in Brussels, Howard voted against aset of far-reaching proposals aimed at stopping racist violence in Europe. TheBritish Home Secretary's lone veto was enough to block the resolution, drawn upover the past several month within the Council of Ministers. The measures defeated included: enacting laws in each member state toconfiscate racist or inflammatory publications, videos, films and TV programs,a European wide intelligence center to monitor extremist activities, andenacting uniform penalties for racist materials.

The decree tightens loopholes in the five-year old Martelli law. Underthat law, only about one-sixth of the illegal immigrants served with expulsionorders left the country. There are approximately 500,000 illegal immigrants,and another one million foreigners living legally in Italy. Reaction to the decree was split. The far-right felt that the decree didnot go far enough, and urged Dini to arrest all illegal immigrants andimmediately expel them from the country. One Northern League party membersuggested returning illegal immigrants in air force transport planes, andparachuting them into their country of origin. The Northern League, who holds the parliamentary balance of power, walkedout on November 17, and threatened to withdraw from Parliament to protest theweak immigration law. This could have led to the fall of Dini's 10-month oldgovernment. The Italian president signed the measure on November 18 which, effectiveimmediately, allows the deportation of illegal immigrants and makes employerswho hire them liable to fines. The decree permits undocumented aliens who havejobs in Italy to regularize their status within four months. The decree mustbe approved by Parliament within 60 days. The left wing parties do not agree with immediate expulsion, and theCatholic Church urged tolerance and finding a way to solve the problemscreating immigration. Foreign language teachers from Spain, Germany, and France have sued Italyunder the freedom of movement clause (Article 48) for failing to provide theforeigners with the same benefits as Italian teachers. The specific complaintis that, under Italian law, working mothers are guaranteed 80 percent of theirsalary for five months after birth, with employers paying the remaining 20percent. Italian universities pay the 20 percent for Italians, but not forforeigners. Foreign language teachers in Italy are usually hired under privatecontracts, which provide fewer protections and benefits than the publiccontracts under which Italian teachers are hired. The European Court ofJustice has twice ruled in favor of the teachers, and against the Italianuniversities. John Hooper, "Italy's League Suffers Defeat," The Guardian, November 20,1995.

As one result, many asylum seekersdeclared that they did not know how they got to Germany--they reported thatthey were put in a truck container in Romania, and stepped out inGermany. Lawyers for asylum seekers argued that, in such cases, asylum applicantshave the right to seek asylum in Germany unless the government can prove thatthe asylum seeker in fact passed through a safe country en route to Germany.This would have rendered the "safe third country" clause ineffective, since itwould have been very hard to prove exactly how any particular asylum seekerreached Germany. On November 7, 1995, an administrative court in Berlin ruled that theburden of proof is on the alien, not the government. In other words, thegovernment can assume that the alien passed through a safe third country enroute to Germany if he or she arrived by land, even if the alien claims not toknow how he entered Germany. Lawyers began an appeal in the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe onNovember 21 in the case of five foreigners whose asylum appeals were rejectedbecause they arrived into Germany via safe third countries. A ruling in thecase is not expected until February, 1996. German courts ruled that civil wars are not sufficient grounds to preventthe repatriation of individuals whose requests for political asylum have beenrejected. repatriating individuals whose requests for political asylum havebeen rejected. The Berlin-based Federal Administrative Court ruled in lateOctober that the "general dangers and consequences" of civil wars ought notdeter German immigration authorities from sending rejected asylum-seekers backto their native lands - unless the individual faces "targeted inhumanetreatment" from the government in his/her native land or from a "state-likeauthority" there. Rejected asylum seekers may not be returned home if the individual wouldface "concrete, serious danger." This ruling came in the case of a man seekingrefuge from the civil war in Afghanistan, who argued that bombing raids andfood shortages endangered his family. The court ruled that the dangers ofcivil war were not directed at him specifically, and therefore he did not havean adequate basis for an asylum claim. The CDU proposed at the party conference that the Schengen accord beextended to cover the rest of Europe. The proposed additions would include,former Eastern Bloc nations, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, andMalta. The number of asylum seekers in Germany increased slightly in October. Atotal of 12,389 people applied for asylum in October compared with 12,065 inSeptember--one third were from ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey. The number of asylumseekers is up for the first 10 months of 1995 compared with 1994. In 1994, about 31,000 foreigners were prevented from entering Germany,mostly at Polish and Czech border crossings, down from 54,000 in 1993. BetweenJanuary and July 1995, some 4500 aliens who arrived at Frankfurt airport wereprevented from entering Germany. ForeignWorkers in Construction The German cabinet on September 1, 1995 approved a proposal that wouldrequire foreign firms sending workers to Germany to pay those foreign workersat least as much as the minimum wage negotiated between German unions andemployers. On November 30, Germany's Bundestag approved the proposal. However, the equal pay law will not go into effect unless a wage commissioncomprised of equal numbers of employer and union representatives approves.Employers are reportedly reluctant to approve, since approval would, some fear,open the door to a minimum wage. The EU Social Affairs Council is scheduled to discuss similar EU proposals,COM(91)230 and COM(93)225, on December 5, 1995, but EU member nations remaindeadlocked over whether local wages should be paid from day one, as Germanyinsists, or after 10 to 30 days, as Ireland and Italy prefer. France andBelgium already require EU workers posted to France to earn at least Frenchwages from their first day in the country, the so-called zero option. According to German unions, some construction firms, and the government,equal pay for local and foreign workers would prevent workers on the same worksite from receiving different wages, and reduce the incentive of firms toprefer foreign subcontractors and foreign workers. There are about 150,000 foreign workers from EU nations such as Greece,Portugal, and the UK at work on German construction sites, and 140,000unemployed German construction workers. With non-EU and illegal alien workers,the German building union estimates that there are as many as 500,000 foreignconstruction workers in Germany. The Portuguese, many of whom live on-site inmobile homes, earn about DM 8-10 per hour. The Poles earn about DM 4 per hour,while the British workers earn an hourly wage comparable to the Germans of DM30 per hour. Construction workers in Germany have since 1959 received bad-weather money(Schlechtwettergeld) between November and March. Beginning in 1996,construction workers will be guaranteed 75 percent of their gross pay, plus DM2 per hour ($1.33) for each hour that they cannot work due to bad weather inthe winter months. The payments are financed one-third by workers--who agreeto give up five vacation days--and two-thirds by employers, with somegovernment subsidy. In an attempt to limit the number of foreign workers, a new regulation wentinto force in 1995 that allows only two foreign cooks per restaurant. Germanlabor officials would like restaurant owners to hire from the pool ofunemployed cooks. State authorities are allowed to make exceptions and grantadditional work visas, but an establishment must prove that it needs additionalforeign chefs. Chef visas are valid for three years. Some efforts to encourage German employers to hire German workers have beenunsuccessful. In January 1995, the German government ruled that non-Germanworkers on German ships could receive the wages prevailing in their homenations. This meant that mostly Indonesian and Filipino sailors are paid farless than German sailors. In mid-October, Chancellor Kohl lamented the demise of the work ethic,charging that too many Germans are taking prosperity for granted. Kohl wouldlike to reduce labor market regulations that allegedly keep the unemploymentrate at 9.2 percent, or 3.5 million. Wolfgang Schaueble, the head of the Christian Democrats in the Bundestag,said that Germans must lower their expectations. According to Schaueble, up toone million foreign workers are employed temporarily in Germany, suggestingthat there are jobs for some of the unemployed Germans. German employers and unions are increasingly negotiating "secret" sidedeals to industrywide employer-union agreements that reduce wages, usually byarguing that the future of the company is at stake. Germany's IG Metall union,the world's largest, has declined from a unification peak of 3.7 millionmembers to three million, as workers ask what the union can do for them. Voting About 54,000 non-German nationals of EU states voted in municipal electionsin Berlin on October 22. They had to be 18 or over, a resident of Berlin forat least three months, and not barred from voting in their own country. Turks, many of whom have lived in Germany for many years, are reportedlyfrustrated because they were barred from voting. The right to vote in localelections is included in the Maastricht treaty, but each country is allowed todetermine residency requirements. For instance, the Netherlands and Denmarkrequire longer periods of residency. The Spanish allow three nationalities tovote, based on reciprocal arrangements. A 20-year Turkish resident of Germany has begun the German DemocraticParty, whose purpose is to obtain voting rights for long-term residentforeigners. The lawyer-founder of the party may not lead it--a majority of theparty members and its leadership must be German citizens. The Greens and theSocial Democrats have supported voting rights for foreigners. There are 12,500 Russians registered as living in Berlin, but the truenumber is believed to be 40,000 or more. Most are concentrated in theCharlottenburg area, where it is believed that "hot money" seeking safeinvestments is pushing up real estate prices. Each German Land has an aliens' commissioner, and at their annualconference in late October, the commissioners called for more public servicesand public sector jobs for foreigners. They noted that foreigners are, onaverage, 16 percent of the populations of large German cities, but foreignershold only seven percent of public sector jobs in these cities, mostly asjanitors. VietnameseRepatriation On November 14-17, Helmut Kohl, the first German chancellor to visitVietnam, began a 10-day, three-country tour of Asia to boost German investmentin the area. One stumbling block to German investment in Vietnam has been thedisagreement between the two countries over the repatriation of Vietnamese inGermany. In July 1995, Germany and Vietnam agreed to return 40,000 Vietnamese, whohad been imported by East Germany as guest workers, and came after unificationillegally, over five years--the first 2,500 were to be returned in this year.On November 17, during his Vietnamese trip, Kohl announced that the quota wouldnot be fulfilled this year because the agreement did not go into effect untilSeptember 1995 and that there are problems with implementing their massdeportation. Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet set out new conditions for therepatriation of Vietnamese living aboard. The new conditions includedemonstrating that those returning do not have dual nationality, that theylived in Vietnam, and that they were being sponsored by economic or socialorganizations or individuals. The new conditions are expected to further delaythe repatriation of Vietnamese from Germany. Germany must provide Vietnam with a list of who it plans to return, andVietnam must approve the list. Some fear resistance and protests over what maybecome forced deportations. Germany agreed to provide up to $140 million to returning Vietnamese andthe Vietnam government. There are believed to be 100,000 Vietnamese inGermany, so that Germany will be left with a significant Vietnamese populationafter the deportations. After unification in 1990, Germany offered Vietnamese guest workers $2,000and a ticket home, and an estimated 50,000 Vietnamese left. Vietnam refused toaccept the Vietnamese who did not accept Germany's payment offer, andVietnamese who had been imported to work in other Eastern European countriesmoved to Germany. Germany granted these Vietnamese in the early 1990s two-yearresidence permits if they had jobs and no criminal records.

In 1992, over 84,000 foreigners--80 percent from the ex-Yugoslavia--applied for asylum in Sweden, and Sweden, which was relatively generous inproviding some form of Temporary Protected Status as well as welfare benefits,discovered that costs of asylum-related costs were SEK 20 billion ($2.7billion). Sweden responded by changing its immigration laws and procedures. Inmid-1995, a Swedish Parliamentary committee released a report that, inter alia,recommends that Sweden tighten immigration by restricting family unification tochildren 18 or less (versus the current 20) to reduce the number of relativeswho join each recognized asylum seeker from the current eight to six. The committee also recommended that refugee status no longer be granted todraft evaders from other countries, and that TPS be granted for a maximum twoyears. The Swedish government plans to reduce the number of residency permitsgranted in 1996 to about 9,200. Nearly 36,500 people received residencepermits in 1993, and about 18,640 refugees and asylum-seekers applied for themin 1994. Scandinavian countries have offered to finance the resettlement of refugeesfrom the former Yugoslavia, if they settle in Hungary. Hungary says it cannotaccommodate a large number of refugees, but has 1,500 vacant places forrefugees, but no money to care for them. The Hungarian government has notofficially responded to the offer. Sweden often epitomizes the welfare state, the notion that full employmentand social service programs will maintain incomes and narrow economicdifferences by the government. However, structural changes are threatening theviability of an extensive welfare state operated by governments. Immigration may have contributed to popular calls for scaling back thewelfare state. Unemployment insurance benefits, which were 90 percent of usualpay, are now 75 percent. Unemployment, which is eight percent among Swedes, is21 percent for foreign nationals. Few immigrants receive work permits. Racial violence has broken out in communities with refugees. More than 100incidents of ethnic violence have been reported this year. The small town of Orbyhus, 80 miles north of Stockholm, has become a symbolof the xenophobia threatening Sweden. Fifteen refugee families from Bosnia andKosovo have been the target of violence and intimidation. Nightly vigils byskinheads are held outside their homes. The Orbyhus chief of police placesblame on the local council for "dumping" 20 or 30 refugees in a small town.Most are moving to other parts of the country. In a November 3 report, the UN human rights committee praised Sweden forits human right record, but expressed concern about the growing racism andxenophobia in Swedish society. The committee urged the Swedish government totake "appropriate measures," to counter the trend. The committee alsocomplained about the prolonged detentions of illegal immigrants and foreignersawaiting deportation. Sweden's reputation for humanitarianism suffered a severe blow when theEuropean Commission for Human Rights intervened in mid-October to stop thedeportation of a one-year old girl to Peru. The girl's mother was scheduled tobe deported with her, even though she has been declared unfit to care for thechild, who has been in state care since her birth. The case is complicated by the fact that the father of the child, aPeruvian opposition member now in Sweden, abused and killed their first child.The mother was denied asylum, and the father is now jail for the murder of thefirst child. The case has been front-page news for several weeks because severalinternational organizations are concerned that Sweden is violating the UNChildren's Convention by not protecting welfare of refugee children. The childrights' organization, Save the Children, has said that the children ofasylum-seekers are by law denied the same health and dental care as Swedishchildren. A bill scheduled for consideration in the Swedish Parliament thisyear would provide refugee children the same benefits as Swedishchildren.

Funds to create an additional 100,000 jobs overthree years were promised. A day after a cabinet reshuffle on November 7, France's Interior Ministertold the National Assembly that immigration was a top government priority. Thegovernment announced that it will not call for a suspension of immigration, butwill continue to impose strict limits on the number of immigrants allowed intothe country. The leader of the far right, Jean-Marie Le Pen, at a November 11 NationalFront rally, told his supporters that he is not a racist; "we prefer theFrench, but we don't hate foreigners." Le Pen criticized several National Front mayors in early November for notcarrying out his policies regarding immigrants. Le Pen had hoped that themayors of Orange, Toulon and Marignae would become showcases for his policy of"national preference," giving priority to French nationals for housing, jobsand welfare. The National Front mayors have not been able to practice "nationalpreference" because such policies are racially discriminatory and thereforeillegal in France. After the meeting, Le Pen announced that the mayors wouldnot make grants to groups and associations that favored immigrants, and thatthere would be more rigorous checks carried out on foreigners applying forstate benefits in these cities. It was unclear what action, if any, the mayorswould take once they returned to their cities. At the same time, it was revealed that Le Pen's daughter, a lawyer andNational Front member, was in court trying to keep an Algerian from beingdeported. Le Pen's daughter argued in court that the Algerian had lived inFrance since he was one year old, and "felt in his heart that he was aFrenchman and would feel like a foreigner in Algeria." She defended herhandling of the case, saying that though the National Front is opposed toFrance's immigration policies, it is not against individual rights.

Swedenaccounted for almost half of the $2.5 billion spent to care for the average262,000 foreigners in these countries for the equivalent of 12 months in1994. The average costs of caring for asylum seekers in Scandinavian countrieswere more than twice the $4,000-$4,500 average in Switzerland and Austria.Sweden spent an average $10,000 per year to care for an average 64,000 asylumseekers or persons granted humanitarian status or TPS, while Switzerland spentan average $4,500 on an average 121,000 asylum seekers and refugees in itssystem in 1994. The costs of processing asylum seekers and refugees is typically less than10 percent of the overall costs of the asylum-refugee system. The major factorin the cost estimates is the number of persons who depend on public assistance,either because they do not or are not allowed to work. Most of the asylum costs are associated not with the selection andresettlement of refugees recognized under the Geneva convention of 1951, whichdefined refugees as persons unable or unwilling to return to their countries ofcitizenship because of a well-founded fear of political persecution. Instead, most of the costs are incurred to care for non-Geneva conventionforeigners who are granted Temporary Protected Status, or whose applicationsfor asylum are rejected, but not returned to their countries of citizenship.For example, as of December 31, 1994, there were some 282,000 foreigners inGermany whose applications for asylum had been rejected, but who had yet to bedeported, including Kurds who some German states refuse to deport. In many European countries, the cost of operating the asylum and refugeesystem has been stable or rising, even though the number of new applicationsfor asylum has been falling. For example, the number of asylum applications inGermany fell from over 400,000 in 1992 to less than 200,000 in 1994, but thecost of operating the German asylum system rose to an estimated $10 billion in1993. Costs seem to have fallen to $8 billion in 1994. The chief of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that the UNHCR ischallenged because of a worldwide decline in asylum rights. Refugees now facemany closed borders because of an increased weariness about the large number ofasylum seekers seeking sanctuary. Some experts say that the tougher anti-asylum legislation throughout Europehas meant that asylum-seekers have had to depend upon professional smugglerswho often force them into crime and prostitution.

Barry James, "Europeans are shutting the door ever tighteron asylum-seekers," International Herald Tribune, November 24, 1995. _______________________________ SwissReferendum to RestrictForeigners A referendum, Article 69, which would restrict the number of foreignersallowed to live in Switzerland, gathered enough signatures to force a popularvote. The proposal would create a constitutional clause limiting non-Swissnationals to 18 percent of the population, down from the current level of 19percent. Under Swiss law, the government has until August 1997 to present its viewsand compromise with the proposal's authors. Another one or two years couldthen pass before the referendum is actually held. The proposal would cover foreign workers and their families, who currentlymake up 18.8 percent of the seven million residents of Switzerland. If asylumseekers and those fleeing war are included in the figure, the proposed maximumwould be already exceeded, effectively ending immigration to Switzerland. Official figures show 62.5 percent of non-Swiss residents come from westernand southern Europe, and 21.9 percent from ex-Yugoslavia. In October 22 elections, the anti-immigrant parties, anti-Europeanconservatives, and socialists made gains. The Swiss People's Party (UDC) ofbusinessman Christopher Blocker ran a campaign based on a platform ofEurosceptism and anti-immigration. The UDC received about 30 seats. Last year Swiss voters approved increasing police powers to crack down onasylum-seekers and illegal foreigners. In June, they rejected a governmentproposal to make it easier for foreigners to buy property in Switzerland. Switzerland is not an EU member, but it is a member of the EuropeanEconomic Area, and the EU negotiating a seven part agreement that the Swissgovernment hopes will put Switzerland back on the path to EU membership. TheEU is demanding, and Switzerland is resisting, a proposal that EU citizens havethe right to look for work for up to three months in Switzerland and, ifoffered a job, have the right to any necessary work and residencepermits. The Swiss are reportedly resisting changes to their current policy, whichdistributes a quota of work permits by sector and nationality each year on acanton-by-canton basis.

Indonesia would like its migrants to earn at least$500 per month, which implies that more skilled and professionals, and fewermaids, will be sent abroad. Indonesia has upgraded some of its vocationalschools to train workers for foreign labor markets. Indonesia plans to post more labor attaches overseas to protect its migrantworkers. Bangladesh officials worried in mid-October that increasing illegalemigration to Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and South Korea may encourage thesenations to restrict the employment of Bangladeshis, and thus threaten the $1.5billion Bangladesh earns annually in remittances-- Bangladesh earned $911million in remittances during the first nine months of 1995. Some 156,000Bangladeshi workers were deployed abroad in the first 10 months of 1995. Saudi Arabia is Bangladesh's largest foreign labor market, accounting fornearly 720,000 of the 1.6 million Bangladeshis working abroad, and Saudi Arabiahas said that over 40,000 illegal Bangladeshis in the country should bedeported. There are an estimated 70,000 illegal Bangladeshis in Malaysia, plus161,000 with valid work permits, and South Korea recently ordered 5,500 illegalBangladeshis to leave or face deportation. Government officials blamed Bangladeshi labor agents for collecting feesand issuing forged documents to Bangladeshi workers eager for jobsabroad. The Philippines would also like to upgrade the skills of the migrantworkers that it sends abroad, both to increase remittances, and to preventexploitation. There are about 25 million Filipinos employed in thePhilippines, and two to four million employed abroad. There has been a continuing public outcry over the conditions that Filipinamaids sometimes experience abroad. In July 1995, the Philippines announcedthat women would not longer be allowed to emigrate legally to work as maids inSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, andthat maids already employed there would have to return within five years. ThePhilippines also announced a phase-out on the migration of entertainers toCyprus, Greece and Japan. The Philippines Overseas Employment Administration may have troubleenforcing these bans on sending maids to certain countries. The POEA admits,for example, that Filipino nurses enter Jordan as $200 per month maids, butthen go to work as nurses. The Philippines officially argues that exporting workers is a transitionalpolicy that will stop as per capita incomes rise. However, most analysts notethat the Philippines has been unable to create manufacturing jobs forex-farmers--about 28 million Filipinos are considered to be poor, andtwo-thirds of them live in rural areas--and new labor force entrants. By someestimates, one in three Filipino households has or had a member employedabroad. In the meantime, the culture of emigration that is taking root in thePhilippines has led, some argue, to a rupturing the social fabric by breakingdown traditions of kinship and community. The Philippine sense of self-worthis believed to be eroding, as Filipina women abroad are viewed as either maidsor entertainers. Some studies show that relatively few returned Filipinoworkers are able to maintain the improved lifestyle that their remittances madepossible, encouraging some to attempt to re-emigrate. In some villages, five to 10 percent of the population is abroad, thatpractically everyone knows a migrant worker. A 1989 census of Pozorrubio, forexample, found 3,500 overseas workers -- nearly all of them women--from a cityof 49,000. Almost 60 per cent of the 258,984 Overseas Contract Workers OCWssent abroad in 1994 were female. Some 153,000 Filipinos--of 300,000 onavailable to go-- are employed on ships around the world, often at salaries ofabout $300 per month. The Philippines is the largest supplier of seafarers toworld shipping. Many of the Filipino women going abroad to work as maids are collegegraduates, with degrees in everything from chemical engineering to nursing, whoare escaping low wages and limited opportunities, and sometimes failingmarriages. Stints abroad that were planned to last for one or two years have,in some cases, turned into ten-year jobs. A study by the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration (IOM)of 170 Filipino domestic helpers in Hong Kong recommended that the Philippinesdo a better job of encouraging the countries in which its nationals work toenforce their labor laws. The Philippines both promotes labor exports andattempts to protect its workers overseas, goals that sometimes conflict withone another. The report urged the government to form coalitions with other laborexporters to remind labor importers of the benefits of migrant workers, and topress collectively for better conditions, especially for maids. The Philippines GDP is growing at a 5.5 percent rate, and this rate isexpected to climb to six percent or more in 1996 and 1997. However, thePhilippines has very low domestic savings, and high domestic and foreigndebts. The Philippines Department of Labor and Employment announced that it hasabout 250 inspectors to police the nation's 400,000 workplaces. Some 35,000 of67,000 workplaces inspected in the first nine months were in violation of laborlaws, usually minimum wage, 13th month pay, and social security paymentobligations. Vietnam's Department for Labor Management Abroad announced that it plans tosend 100,000 workers abroad annually to relieve unemployment pressures. Thereare currently about 15,000 Vietnamese contract workers abroad, and 20,000 areexpected to be deployed in 1995, mostly to in South Korea, Libya and thePersian Gulf. China has at least 270,000 contract workers employed abroad, 60 percent inAsia, and some hope that overseas employment will be a safety valve as Chinaprivatizes state-owned enterprises that once guaranteed lifetime employment.According to Chinese officials, China will earn $7.5 billion from labor exportsin 1995, up from $5 billion in 1994--China includes the total value ofChinese-supplied goods for e.g. construction projects abroad as well as wagesin these estimates. There are currently 50 to 100 million internal migrants looking for jobswithin China, a number estimated to rise to 200 to 300 million by 2000. Chinarecently began to promote the export of contract workers.

It will be the largest additional increment offoreign workers to be approved by the Council of Labour Affairs since Taiwanpermitted the legal entry of foreign workers in 1991. On November 23, 1995, the CLA announced that the number of foreign workersto be admitted to the country would fluctuate with the unemployment rate.Current regulations limit the number of foreign workers to 35 percent of thenumber of Taiwanese workers in the labor insurance program. According to a recent poll, 75 percent of Taiwan's small- and medium-sizedbusiness owners cannot find enough workers. However, Taiwan's unemploymentrate hit two percent in September, 1995, the second-highest rate in 10 years.The Ministry of Economic Affairs reportedly favors the free entry of foreignworkers, while the Council of Labor Affairs wants to preserve strict controlsover the number of foreign workers. Nearly 4,000 illegal foreign workers were arrested between September 1 andOctober 25 in a nationwide crackdown. Most of the illegal workers are detainedin the Sanhsia detention center or in police holding cells until they arerepatriated. The names of over 1,000 employers who illegally hired foreignworkers, and 49 agents accused of smuggling aliens into Taiwan, were turnedover to the district prosecutors. There are an estimated 32,000 illegalworkers in Taiwan, including 11,000 who have abandoned jobs with the employerswho recruited them. Taiwan is concerned about foreign workers using the pretext of entering thecountry to study Chinese. There are 5,000 to 6,000 foreigners studying Chinesein Taiwan, and they are permitted to apply for work permits that allow up to 12hours of work each week. However, only 30 such permits have been issued;leading to suspicions that many foreign students are working illegally. Taiwan began to import foreign workers legally in October 1989, whenemployers requested 65,000 foreign workers to work on high-priority nationalinfrastructure projects. Labor costs had risen sharply as Taiwan's currencyappreciated in value. The government permitted almost 44,000 foreignconstruction workers to enter Taiwan. In October 1991, an additional 10,000foreign workers were approved. The legal basis for importing foreign workers into Taiwan was establishedin May 1992, and approvals of almost 13,000 maids, 175 health care providers,2,000 fishing boat workers, and 27,000 foreign workers for other industriesfollowed in the next four months. The number of foreign workers, and the industries in which they arepermitted to work, has expanded steadily ever since--the CLA has grantedapproval for some 270,000 foreign workers to work in Taiwan, and 193,100 arecurrently in the country--131,000 from Thailand, 54,800 from the Philippines,5,100 from Indonesia and 2,200 from Malaysia. There are also about 8,000foreign maids, mostly from the Philippines. In mid-November, Taiwan beganradio broadcasts for Thai and Philippine workers to help ease social isolation.The broadcasts include news and popular music in Thai, English and Tagalog. Taiwan limits the number of foreign workers admitted, so that the number ofemployer requests for foreign workers is at least twice the number approved foradmission. In November, 1995, several officials in Taiwan's Council of LabourAffairs were accused of accepting bribes to approve employer requests forforeign workers. In order to obtain approval to employ foreign workers, employers mustadvertise for local workers, prepare a plan to increase productivity, and offeran orientation program for the foreign workers. There are more than 100agents--with names like Top International Manpower--that provide these servicesto Taiwanese employers. These agents typically have connections to a labor recruiter in thePhilippines or Thailand who recruit workers there, and they compete in Taiwanto provide a package of services to Taiwan employers. For example, a typicalagent's offering is to request a NT$25,000 (about US$1000) one-time fee tocover recruitment costs, visa and other fees, and round-trip transportation toTaiwan. Employer's then pay the foreign workers Taiwan's minimum wage ofNT$14,880 per month, plus NT$2100 in government fees that are used to trainlocal workers, and NT$867 for workers' compensation coverage, or NT$17,847 permonth (about $700). Foreign workers receive individual two-year contract; a TYPICAL CONTRACT (acopy is available on the Migration News Home Page) includes a 40-day probation,specifies an eight-hour, six-day work week, employer-provided housing and mealsat no charge, seven days paid leave after one year, and lists ten reasons forterminating the contract, including getting married in Taiwan or acting againstthe public order. In early November, several CLA officials were charged with accepting bribesof NT$ 3,000 for each foreign worker they approved from labor brokers. Agentsalso negotiate their fees; they can reduce or waive recruitment fees and travelcosts, for example, knowing that foreign workers can be induced to pay partneragents in the Philippines or Thailand for the privilege of working abroad.The Chinese National Federation of Industries, the largest manufacturingorganization, says that the bribery cases reflect the outdated regulations ofthe CLA. The council blames the bribery scandal on a lack of manpower tohandle the applications for foreign workers. A typical foreign worker in Taiwan will earn about $600 monthly at theminimum wage, or $7,200 annually. Many workers pay agents in their homecountry 20 to 30 percent of their first year's wage to find them an overseasjob, or $1,800. About 2.5 million Taiwanese work in manufacturing, about the same as in1985. Even high-tech firms in the Hsinchu industrial park are having troublerecruiting workers--2,000 of the park's 36,000 workers are Filipinos. There isa limit of 30 percent on the number of foreign, blue-collar workers at eachcompany, a stricter limit than the 30 percent of a total company's work forcethat can be foreign in other factories. Labor migration in Taiwan and throughout Asia is distinguished by thissignificant wedge between what an employer pays for foreign workers, and whatthe worker receives. In the US, Mexican workers pay $300 to $500 to be smuggled into the US. Ifthey work seasonally, earning $5 hourly for 1,000 hours, or $5,000, the cost ofgetting to the job site is equivalent to 10 percent of their earnings. But USemployers rarely pay for workers housing and meals; these costs can easily be$50 per week, reducing a $200 weekly wage to $150, so that smuggling fees of,say, $400, plus living costs of $50 per week for 25 weeks ($1475), can make thecosts of working illegally in the US equivalent to almost 40 percent of theworker's earnings. Costs decline as wages rise and workers stay longer; a Mexican workeremployed full-time at $5 hourly earns $10,000, so that smuggling and livingcosts of $500 plus 50 weeks times $50 make the cost of working in the USequivalent to 30 percent of the worker's earnings. Foreign workers in the US, and guest workers in Europe, used to keep moreof their earnings. Under the US Bracero and European guest worker programs,workers sometimes paid bribes to be selected to work abroad, but employers paidtransportation and other costs associated with getting to the job, as well asliving expenses. Many foreign workers in Taiwan are employed in construction for over 190hours each month. According to a recent survey, the average monthly wage paidin Taiwan's construction sector was NT$ 41,994 in April 1995, and the averagedaily wage was NT$ 2,089. Taiwan is a country of 21 million with a labor force in 1994 of 9.1million. About 12 percent of the labor force is employed in agriculture, but75 percent of Taiwan's farmers and farm workers are expected to be displaced by2005 because of Taiwan's 1996 World Trade Organization entry, which will forcethe country to open itself to imported food.

As in the past,almost 700,000 or half of the foreign residents in Japan were Koreans, followedby about 200,000 Chinese and 150,000 Brazilians. There were 106,000 foreigners with work permits in 1994, including 35,000entertainers, 25,000 foreigners employed in humanities and internationalrelations, and 5,800 intra-company transfers. The number of foreigners withwork permits exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1994. At the end of 1994, there were 61,500 foreign students in Japan, including10,300 who arrived in 1994. Of those arriving in 1994, about 26 percent werefrom China, 22 percent from South Korea, and 12 percent from the US. About2400 foreign students who graduated from Japanese universities in 1994 werehired by Japanese companies. For the first time, Japan employed foreigners to help take the nationalcensus. About half of the one million foreigners living in Japan are Koreans,and the cities of Tokyo and Osaka requested foreigners to help enumerateresidents in their cities. Some 3,527 foreigners were deported in September and October 1995 forviolating Japanese immigration laws, including 812 Koreans, 538 Chinese, and435 Thais. Many foreigners caught working in Japan are sentenced to 18 monthsin jail, but granted suspended sentences and deported-- under Japaneseimmigration law, foreigners who have been sentenced to prison terms of over oneyear are denied reentry. According to one report, the number of illegalforeigners in Japan dropped from 300,000 in May 1993 to 12,000 in May1995.

The new guidelines are expected to permit localemployers to undertake direct recruitment of foreign workers in Thailand,Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan. The Malaysian government doubled the levy on foreign workers effectiveJanuary 1996. The increase in levies--aimed at encouraging Malaysian employersto reduce their dependence on foreign workers-- is expected to generate anadditional M$ 215 million--some M$300 million in levies was collected betweenSeptember 1992 and December 1993. Employers must pay a monthly levy for allforeign workers; the levy ranges from M$100 PTKs to M$200 senior management toM$35 for an unskilled manufacturing and construction workers. The monthly levyon foreign maids is M$30, and for agricultural workers, the levy ranges fromM$25 to M$60. There were 553,658 registered foreign workers in the country in 1995, ofwhom 252,877 were Indonesians, 82,796 Bangladeshis, 26,602 Filipinos, and21,965 Thais. However, the number of illegal workers is widely believed toexceed the number of registered workers, bringing the total to over onemillion. In June 1995, there were about 81,000 foreign maids in Malaysia, 125,000foreign farm workers, 123,000 foreign construction workers, 45,000 foreignmanufacturing workers, and 10,000 foreigners in other sectors. The Malaysian Labor Minister warned employers in mid-October that theywould not be allowed to recruit foreign workers until after they had madehonest efforts to find local workers. The minister urged employers to raisewages, and to establish workplace nurseries, to attract Malaysian womenworkers. The Labor Minister said on September 24 that foreign workers are notallowed to join unions because they are living in the country on the temporarybasis. He also added that there are sufficient labor laws to protect them fromexploitation. He added that if foreign workers were permitted to join unionsit might make local workers unhappy. The Malaysian Electrical Industry Workers Union and the Malaysian TradeUnion Congress have said that the immigration department is breaking tradeunion laws by not allowing foreign workers to join unions. It has been reported that thousands of Bangladeshis are trying to registerthemselves to work in Malaysia following a report that the Bangladeshgovernment will punish those who illegally look for work in Malaysia. Indonesia, which has over 500,000 workers in Malaysia, has announced thatin the future it will only allow skilled workers in agriculture, industries,construction, services and transport to work in Malaysia. The two countrieshave still not signed an agreement on the new procedures for the recruitment ofIndonesian workers in Malaysia. The signing of an agreement has been delayeddue to an Indonesian demand that maids be paid a minimum wage of M$1,800. The Sabah state government announced that it is considering an amnesty forthe more than 500,000 illegal immigrants in Sabah. Under the proposal, illegalforeign workers would be offered work permits. Malaysia is in the midst of a debate over whether the unskilled foreignworkers who increasingly staff its plantations, construction sites, factories,and homes are an asset or liability. On the one hand, it is clear that theforeigners find jobs, earn incomes, and spend much of what they earn, both onlocal goods, on transport, banking, and other services, and some of theirremittances are spent on imported Malaysian goods. On the other hand, it is also clear that most of the foreign workers inMalaysia are unskilled workers, and that Malaysia's goal of being anindustrialized country by 2020 may be threatened if the presence of manyunskilled workers keeps the country on a low-skill, low-tech trajectory.

Under the act, employers who hire illegal workers will be finedup to S$ 15,000 to S$30,000, and jailed up to 12 months. Repeat offenders canface double penalties. These penalties can be extended to shipyards andfactories by the labor ministry. If illegal workers are discovered at construction sites, the burden ofproof shifts to the primary employer to show that he did not know they werepresent or illegal. If more than five illegal workers are discovered, theemployer can be caned, or fined S$50,000 to S$100,000. Primary employers atwork sites can escape the penalties if they can prove that they checked theworkers' papers, and restricted access to the site with e.g., fences, guards,and IDs. An average 31 employers each month of 1994 were found to be employing anaverage 37 illegal alien workers. Some 10,000 illegal workers were apprehendedin 1994, double the number caught in 1988. Most of the illegal workers wereapprehended at construction sites; e.g., a late November raid found 178 illegalforeign workers, including 143 with no documents. The construction industry opposed the new law. Constructionrepresentatives point out that fencing is impractical at some sites, such asroad construction. In November, two men were jailed for inducing the Work Permit andEmployment Department to issue a permit by falsely stating an foreign workerapplicant did not have Aids. All foreign workers in Singapore must becertified Aids-free.

The ministry currently does not havethe power to import unskilled labor, despite shortages. In September 1994, Thailand's National Security Council estimated thatthere were 525,000 illegal aliens in the country, two-thirds of whom are fromBurma. By the end of 1994, the number of Burmese had increased at least 10percent, bringing the total to 600,000. Most illegal immigrants in Thailand work in farming, fishing, construction,and footwear and textile factories. Most Thai employers pay migrants 30 to 50percent less than Thai employees. The Thai minimum wage is 145 bahtdaily. According to some estimates, there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Burmeseworking in the southwest Thai province of Ranong. In one province of Thailand, businesses hiring Burmese immigrants mustregister their names with the local government and pay guarantee money of 5,000baht ($200) for each worker. The Thai employers had to register all foreignworkers by September 21, 1995. The deadline was extended one month becauseonly one in four employers had deposited the guarantee money. Some employershave demanded that the Burmese immigrants pay the 5,000 baht guaranteemoney. Many of the Burmese working illegally in the northwestern city of Tak haveleft because of the fear of being arrested. As a result, several manufacturersare considering moving out to an area where more labor and infrastructure ismore available. According to some observers, the demand for unskilled immigrant workersincreased after 1993, when Thailand extended mandatory education from six tonine years (about age 15), with nationwide enforcement scheduled by 1997.About 15 percent of the 1.5 million workers employed in the textile industryare expected to disappear because they are in school. Some textile factoriesare automating, and others are moving to border provinces, where illegalworkers are more available. Bangkok has become one of the major transit points for foreigners trying toillegally enter the US. US government officials in Thailand estimated that2,000 people per month try to leave Thailand for the US. Most use false papersor lie to get Thai passports and US visas, some travel without papers. The USgovernment says that only 20 percent of the 2,000 are Thais, the rest areChinese, Indians, Bangladeshis and others using Thailand as a starting point tothe West. Thai police in November 1995 arrested in Bangkok a native of Taiwan who isbelieved to have arranged for the smuggling of 300 Chinese aliens on the GoldenVenture, the ship that ran aground in New York in 1993. As the case unfolds,it appears that "investors" collected $30,000 each from migrants and theirfamilies in Fujian province, and hired the Taiwanese man arrested as a contractsmuggler.

This is in major change inBritain's previous position, that Hong Kong emigrants should be unconditionallyoffered permanent residency if they return after 1997. London hopes that bymaking this concession, it can secure China's consent on other arrangementscontained in a residency package aimed at enabling the return ofemigrants. There are about 300,000 foreign workers in Hong Kong, and the unemploymentrate is expected to remain at 3.5 percent in 1995, the highest rate in 13years. The government announced plans to reduce the number of foreign workersadmitted. There are about 300,000 foreign workers in Hong Kong. In an unprecedented migration, the remains of thousands of Hong Kong deadare being dug up and shipped to California. Hong Kong's Chinese worry thatwhen the mainland Chinese take over in 1997 they will build over theterritory's cemeteries. Ironically, San Francisco's Chinese community used tosend their dead back to China. Hong Kong is racing to finish its new airport by June 30, 1997, when Chinatakes over Hong Kong's government. In October 1995, about 20 percent of the18,200 airport construction workers were foreigners. Minimum wages are $1,280per month, but many workers complain that contractors and subcontractors takesome of their salaries in illegal charges.

China announced that it has one million people who have one million($120,000) or more yuan in assets, and 70 million poor people, with annualincomes of less than 300 yuan or $36. China has emerged as a major exporter of manufactured goods--China produceshalf of the world's toys, and two-thirds of its shoes, as well as most of theworld's bicycles, lamps, and sweaters. According to US calculations, China mayexport $50 billion more to the US than it imports, putting China in the racewith Japan ($66 billion trade deficit) as the country with the largest tradedeficit with the US. To head off trade tensions with the US, China in mid-November announcedplans to reduce tariffs on 4,000 of the 6,000 items it imports from an average36 percent to 22 percent. There are an estimated 25 to 30 million "overseas Chinese," and almost halflive in English-speaking societies such as the US and Canada, Australia, andSingapore, plus Malaysia and the Philippines. Authorities in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou announced a crackdownon labor brokers who charge workers 100 to 200 yuan ($12 to $24 dollars) to"introduce" migrant job seekers to potential employers. There are 10,000 foreigners living in Shanghai, usually managers offoreign-owned businesses in the region. "China's capital to clean up migrant community ," Reuters World Service,November 6, 1995. Joseph Kahn, "China swiftly becoming an export colossus,straining western ties," Wall Street Journal, November 13, 1995 _______________________________ OTHER _______________________________ GulfStates Saudi Arabia's five-year plan for 1995-2000 aims to eliminate foreignworkers in the public sector, including civil aviation, social security andsocial insurance. Foreigners are currently about 70 percent of the laborforce. Most of the 500,000 Saudis expected to find jobs in the next five years areexpected to be employed by private employers. However, Saudis reportedlyprefer public sector jobs, where pay and benefits are better. Saudi employersreportedly prefer foreigners because they have higher productivity, high skillsand experience, and the cost of recruiting them is lower. In 1985, Saudi Arabia announced plans to substitute 600,000 Saudis forlocal workers, but, by 1990, there were 275,000 more foreigners wereemployed. The Bahraini government is studying a plan to allow foreign workers whohave left the country to return after one year to work for another employerwithout requiring a no objection certificate from the previous employer. Theplan would also facilitate the identification of foreigners who have overstayedtheir residency permits. The new regulations are expected to take effectbefore the end of the year. A three-and-a-half-month amnesty program in Bahrain resulted in 9,250foreign workers legalizing their residency in the country. Under the amnesty,people who have stayed in Bahrain illegally after their residence permits haveexpired were granted exemption from fines. The sponsors of illegal immigrantswho did not regularize their stay will be fined. Some employers would giveforeigners their passports so that they could legalize their residency. A member of the Kuwaiti parliament said the country should make it easierfor foreign workers to bring in their families to boost the economy and helpstabilize the country's male-dominated expatriate community. Nearly onemillion of Kuwait's 1.8 million population are foreign guest workers, most ofthem men from Egypt and Asia. Most do not bring in family or keep theirfinancial assets in the country because of the strict residency rulesintroduced after the 1991 Gulf War to reduce the country's reliance on foreignworkers. Kuwaiti merchants complain that this policy has significantly reduce theamount the foreign workers spend in Kuwait. Earlier this year the government abandoned a minimum salary rule anddecided to charge foreigners $200 for every dependent they brought into thecountry. An August law passed by Parliament abolished all new fees imposed in1995 for state services so in late September the government halted thecollection of the flat fee and reinstated the minimum salary. The new rulerequires that foreigners in the private sector who want to bring in theirfamilies mush earn a minimum of $2,155 a month and those in the public sectormust earn a minimum of $1,500. Most foreigner workers earn less thanthat.

In one insistence, a Shanghai native went to Australia in 1989 to studybecause Australia had the easiest visa policy. He used contacts with familyand friends to help build business with Hong Kong, Shanghai and Malaysia. Nowthe Shanghai native is helping the shoe company break into the Chinese market. Australia sent back nearly 100 Sino-Vietnamese to China on October 25. thiswas the largest group to be repatriated under the agreement between Australiaand China. The first group was repatriated in May 1995. The remaining 370Sino-Vietnamese boat people will be processed under the same agreement, whichallows for monitoring by the Australian government to ensure that the returneesare not persecuted in China.

A November 14, 1995 meeting in SanFrancisco reviewed the extent to which land degradation is contributing tolegal and illegal Mexico to US migration. There is no doubt that many of Mexico's agricultural resources such as landand water have deteriorated over the past two decades, but it is very hard todistinguish between the effects of such long-run trends and the results ofshort-run variables that encourage migration. For example, rural Mexicans are reducing their dependence on farmingnon-irrigated lands. Some households reduce their dependence on farming byearning other income. Nonfarm income can be generated by having one or morehousehold members migrate seasonally to the US, or within Mexico, or having theentire household leave the rural area where it is established. Most economists believe that individuals and households change theirbehavior in response to price changes. If land degradation makes the land lessproductive, and if agricultural policy reform, plus trade agreements thatpromise different prices, change the outlook for particular crops, then landand crop prices will change, and rural households will respond, in part bymigrating. Mexico made changes in the 1990s that altered prices in rural Mexico in amanner that signaled rural Mexicans to get out of agriculture. Mexico freed upthe land market, reduced agricultural subsidies, and signed NAFTA--steps thatwill probably cause the price of crop land used to grow field crops, such ascorn in non-irrigated areas, to fall, and the value of irrigated land used toproduce avocados or vegetables to rise. In areas where land prices fall, some people will respond by selling orabandoning land and migrating to urban areas in Mexico or to the US. There areseveral ways to counter such migration--raise prices in order to keep people onthe land, or make investments to reverse land degradation. In today's Mexico,it would appear easier to raise prices than to obtain the funds needed forimproving land quality. Contact Michelle Schwartz, Natural Heritage Institute, nhi@igc.apc.org UNHCRon Refugees The UNHCR reported on November 15 that 50 million persons had beendisplaced from their homes. Some 14.4 million persons are considered refugees,down from 18.2 million in 1993, which means that they are outside their countryof citizenship, and unable to return for fear of political persecution.Another 36 million persons have been displaced from their homes, but remaininside their country--they are not considered refugees. A UNHCR report released on November 23 criticized European countriesdetaining asylum-seekers. The report said countries were holding asylumseekers for week, month and sometimes years in closed camps, prisons andairport transit zones while the awaiting a decision on their claim forasylum. The report recognized that some migrants were using the asylum process toseek economic or other opportunities in Europe, but asked countries to make adistinction between the situation or refugees and asylum-seekers and that ofother aliens.

The December 7 hearing was the first one devoted entirely to guest workersin the 1995 round of immigration reform. Growers testified that they supportefforts to reduce illegal immigration, but that they also want a"viable, legal work force." The only way to guarantee such a work force, they argued, is with a newstandby guest worker program that would permit farmers to employ foreignworkers after attesting that they had attempted to hire domestic workers.After filing such an attestation with the US Department of Labor, a farmerwould be allowed to recruit, have admitted into the US, and employ foreignersunless complaints led the US government to revoke his right to do so. Most observers do not believe that US farmers need a streamlined guestworker program, because, by measures that range from wages to unemploymentrates, there are surpluses rather than shortages of farm workers. Many growersacknowledge the current labor surplus, but they assert that, with new effortsto control illegal immigration, they will no longer be able to employunauthorized workers who present them with false documents. The effect of proposed new immigration enforcement measures on the farmlabor supply depends on two unknowns: first, on how many people now inthe farm work force are unauthorized immigrants, and second, on how effectivethe new measures will be. Farmers assert that the share of unauthorizedworkers is high--in excess of 50 percent of the farm work force--and that thenew measures to control illegal immigration will be both effective andquickly-felt. Opponents say that the illegal-immigrant share is lower (the US Departmentof Labor estimate is 25 percent), and that any impacts of immigrationenforcement on farm labor supplies will be gradual and incremental, not suddenand dramatic. Furthermore, they say that growers could adjust to fewerunauthorized workers by recruiting US workers and temporary foreign workersthrough the H-2A program, or reducing their demand for labor throughmechanization or better management of farm labor. Both President Clinton and the US Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR)oppose a new agricultural guest worker program, arguing that a new guest workerprogram would increase illegal immigration and reduce employment, wages, andwork standards for American workers. President Clinton stated in June that ifa crackdown on illegal immigration, which he favors, should create laborshortages for perishable crops, he will instruct the Departments of Labor andAgriculture to work together to improve existing programs to meet agriculture'sneeds. At the December 7 hearing, representatives skeptical about a new foreignfarm labor program, including Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith(R-TX), agreed withthe majority of economists and immigration specialists, who say that if 20 to40 percent of the current farm work force is unauthorized, farm employers willbe able to adjust gradually to the loss of unauthorized workers by employing USworkers and getting legal foreign workers through the H-2A program. Academic researchers and representatives of farm worker organizationspointed to the current farm-labor surplus in the United States, falling realwages, benefits, and working conditions for farm workers, and high levels ofunemployment and underemployment. A new guest worker program, theycontended, is neither justified nor workable in such a surplus-laborenvironment. The most outspoken opponent of a new agricultural guest worker programpresent at the December 7 hearing was Howard Berman (D-CA). On December 14, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claimsand the Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops held ajoint hearing on guest workers. USDA testified that the Clinton administrationis opposed to the establishment of a new guest worker program; the existingH-2A program is a "sufficient means to provide relief to farm employers fromserious labor shortages as well as to improve the wages and working conditionsof US agricultural workers." Growers argued that the H-2A program fails to meet their needs andcannot be made to work. They urged approval of the simpler attestationprocedure for obtaining temporary foreign farm workers. Although the growers program has not yet been released in detail, growersassert that, under it, they would attest that they had tried recruit US workersand promise that if they consequently employed temporary foreign workers, theywould pay them at least the prevailing wage rate; provide housing or ahousing allowance when it is the prevailing practice; confine the guest workersto jobs that last less than 10 months; notify existing farm workers they havefiled attestations; give preference to qualified US workers in hiring; andavoid using guest workers when there is a strike or lockout. Growers would pay for the cost of administering the program withcontributions to a trust fund equivalent to the payroll taxes that would not bepaid on the guest workers' wages. Some growers argued for a better employee verification system. One Floridafarmer was reportedly fined $150,000 for hiring illegal alien workers, and thenfined again - $120,000 - for firing 40 workers whose documents did not appearto be in order. Growers are gaining allies. An op-ed article in the Wall StreetJournal on November 9 advocated a guest worker program for agriculture. Itsauthor, Rael Jean Isaac, argued that the Bracero program "worked," and, forthis reason, the current H-2A program through which temporary alien farmworkers are admitted for US farm work should be revamped to resemble the 1950sBracero program. The Isaac article and a summary of grower testimony to the SenateImmigration Subcommittee on September 28 (MN, October, 1995), prompted manyresponses in the Wall Street Journal. For example, it was noted that, when allthe costs are counted, there may be nothing more expensive than cheap farmworkers. In Santa Barbara county, strawberry acreage increased almost fourtimes between 1986 and 1993, and the resulting farm worker poverty helped alocal employment training agency to win a $500,000 training grant by arguingthat the number of poor farm workers in the area had increased. Isaac and other writers often overlook significant details ofthe Bracero program. First, there was not one program, but several programs,some administered by the USDA, some by DOL. For a few years, farmers couldrecruit workers in any manner they chose, as in the H-2A program. Second,there was always opposition to the Bracero program--the President's Commissionon Migratory Labor in 1951 recommended against a Bracero program. Congressoverrode this recommendation, but included several of the protective featuresthat the Commission recommended. Farmers not wishing to follow Bracero program guidelines encouraged illegalimmigration and employment in the early 1950s. They were shielded by the"Texas proviso" of the 1952 INA, under which the only punishment for employmentof illegal aliens, even when it was deliberate, was the removal of the aliensfrom the employer's premises. Farmer resistance to PL-78 Bracero programguidelines in the early 1950s, plus the dependence of hundreds of thousands ofMexican workers on US jobs, are what produced the "wetback crisis" of 1954. Third, the undoing of the Bracero program began in the late 1950s, when theSecretary of Labor in a Republican administration decided to enforce therules under which Mexicans worked in the US Farmers complained bitterly, butwhen it became clear that, starting in 1961, Democrats would enforce the ruleseven more vigorously, research aimed at saving labor grew enormously. TheUniversity of California alone was engaged in over 300 labor-savingmechanization research projects in the early 1960s, including the successfuleffort to mechanize the processing tomato harvest. A guest worker program can always convert illegal into legal workers, aswas done in the mid-1950s. But the Bracero program proves that admittinghundreds of thousands of unskilled workers for as little as six weeks can haveunforeseen and undesired consequences. In early November, several of the House Republicans spearheadingimmigration reform efforts toured California fields to hear growers' proposalsfor a guest worker program. Immigration subcommittee chair Smith was quoted assaying that he hopes his immigration reform bill will not have "an adverseeffect on the labor supply," which some growers interpreted as support for aguest worker program, since they maintain that 30 to 50 percent of theircurrent work force are illegal aliens. The grower strategy is to exaggerate the share of unauthorized workers inthe farm work force, agree with Congress that new controls will quickly reduceillegal immigration, establish that the H-2A program is not a sufficient safetyvalve, and thus justify a new guest worker program now, while Congress isdealing with immigration reform, rather than in the future, when there may befarm labor shortages. The purpose of guest or non-immigrant worker programs is to add workers tothe labor force without adding permanent residents to the population. Criticspoint out that, from Japan to Germany, guest worker programs have failedto do that, inspiring the adage that there is nothing so permanent as atemporary workers. Over time, employers, investors, and local workers begin to makedecisions that assume that foreign workers will continue to be available, sothat the familiar argument, "we will go out of business without foreignworkers," becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Professor Mark Miller of the University of Delaware noted that France'sseasonal worker program admits primarily alien farm workers, but it shrank from200,000 in 1974 to 11,300 in 1994, when mostly Moroccans and Poles wereadmitted. Many of the illegal alien farm workers who became legal residents in the1987-88 Special Agricultural Worker program got green cards in December 1990,are now eligible to apply for US citizenship. About 52 percent of the 1.3million SAW applications were filed in California, and 82 percent of allapplicants were from Mexico. The INS received one million applications fornaturalization in 1995. The effects of a wave of farm worker naturalizations are the subjects ofdebate. The INS and most farm worker advocates encourage naturalization as ameans of promoting inclusion-- giving all residents full rights. However, someimmigration control groups, as well as some local officials, assert thatnaturalization will increase family unification and welfarecosts.

The INS noted that no such mass migration is expected, butthat the Haitian and Cuban migration emergencies in 1994 demonstrated the needto plan for such contingencies. A Mexican official said that the exercises was not appropriate, and thatthe cyclical flow of migrants into the US for employment is now a structuralfeature of the North American labor market. In late December, the US announced that a ring headed by a woman in CostaRica had been broken up after smuggling 10,000 aliens annually into the US.According to an interagency working group on the smuggling of illegal aliens tothe United States, "some 100,000 aliens from outside the region" pass throughone or more Central American countries annually on their way to the UnitedStates. The money to be earned from alien smuggling is reportedly fuelingcorruption. In 1995, immigration officials in Panama, Belize and Guatemalawere fired for accepting bribes from alien smugglers. Honduras is the onlyCentral American country in which smuggling of humans is a crime. The interagency report estimated that 500,000 illegal aliens enter WesternEurope each year, many transiting through Moscow, where an estimated 200,000illegal aliens may be in temporary residence at any time, including 60,000Chinese and 40,000 South Asians. The report criticizes Taiwan for"unsatisfactory" cooperation against alien smugglers despite repeated USrequests for action. The Department of Justice's Inspector General issued a report on December1, 1995 that criticized INS for negotiating low fines and easy settlements withemployers discovered to have hired illegal aliens. About 10,000 US employersfaced fines of about $70 million between FY90 and FY94; these fines weresettled for $29 million, or less than half the initial levy. Most of the fineswere for paperwork violations, not for hiring illegal alien workers. Some 2,200 California employers were initially charged $14 million. Thelargest potential fine was against the Walt Disney company, which faced$400,000 in fines for improper paper work on 1,200 new hires. The INS announced that, after March 20, 1996, I-151 green cards issuedbefore 1970 will not longer be valid. The INS is attempting to reduce fraud byissuing new and harder to counterfeit cards to permanent resident aliens whohave the right to live and work practically anywhere in the US. The new cardwill require a photograph, fingerprint and signature. The new card costs $75,but the INS will waive the fee for those who cannot afford it. The INS and other agencies that screen arriving US citizens and aliensannounced steps aimed at speeding up the process beginning in March 1996. InFY94, some 444 million persons entered the US over the northern and southernborders, and 57 million international passengers arrived at US airports. The INS is one of the fastest-growing federal agencies--it has 21,800full-time employees, including almost 5,000 Border Patrol agents. Its FY96budget is expected to be $1.7 billion, and with fee income, $2.6billion--budget language instructs INS to add 1,000 more Border Patrol agentson the US-Mexican border. The INS announced that the Systematic Alien Verification for EntitlementsProgram (SAVE) won an innovative technology award. SAVE includes data on 50million non-US citizens, and federal and state service providers, from the FoodStamp program to AFDC to federal housing assistance to the CaliforniaDepartment of Motor Vehicles, use the system to verify the immigrant status ofalien applicants for benefits and services. SAVE was implemented in 1989, and through June 1995 had dealt with over 21million inquires--about 149,000 persons were denied benefits, about seventenths of one percent. The SAVE system has recently been expanded to verifythe status of newly hired private sector workers in southern California. In FY95, the INS apprehended 524,234 illegal immigrants in the San Diegosector. Some 1,200 criminals trying to re-enter the country have beenprosecuted so far this year, and 3,000 people arrested with counterfeitimmigration documents were detained for 72 hours, taken before an immigrationjudge and deported. The INS announced on December 28, 1995 that it had removed a record 51,600criminal aliens from the US in 1995, two-thirds of whom were criminal alienswho were deported after serving prison terms in the US. The INS also prevented9,400 aliens from entering the US in 1995, up from 5,700 in 1994. California Governor Pete Wilson asked the federal government to takesymbolic custody of one of California's 16,000 criminal aliens to show that thefederal government is responsible for criminal aliens. California's 1993lawsuit for federal reimbursement of costs associated with illegal immigrantsis still pending--California estimates that it costs $21,000 per year toaccommodate prisoners. Some 147 of the 282 Chinese aliens aboard the Golden Venture, the smugglingship that ran aground in New York in June 1993, remain in US jails. Some havebegun hunger strikes. The crew that smuggled them to the US received jailterms of one to 4.5 years. The New Jersey Senate in October approved legislation that would requireemployers with state contracts to certify that all of their employees areentitled to work in the US. A second measure would make undocumented workersineligible for worker's compensation and temporary disability payments forworkplace injuries.

House Immigration Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX) invited eight House members andformer Congresswoman Barbara Jordan to testify for and against the possibilityof constitutional amendments or changes in federal immigration law to curtailthe benefits of citizenship to illegal immigrants. The US Constitution contained no definition of citizenship until theadoption of the 14th Amendment in 1868. It states: "All persons born ornaturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, arecitizens of the United States and the state wherein they reside." The 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that all persons born inthe US--except children born to parents not subject to the jurisdiction of theUS because they are diplomats or representatives of internationalorganizations-- are automatically US citizens. In 1898, the US SupremeCourt ruled that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents who could notbecome citizens themselves was automatically a US citizen. According to Rep. Lamar Smith(R-TX), "The original intent andpurpose of the 14th Amendment was not to grant birthright citizenship." Rep. Brian Bilbray, (R-CA) sponsored H.R. 1363, the "Citizenship Reform Actof 1995, which "would deny automatic citizenship at birth to children born inthe United States to parents who are not citizens or permanent residentaliens." According to Bilbray, the bill would reinterpret the Constitution, anapproach that would be faster than a Constitutional amendment. The JusticeDepartment has said that such a change would not be in keeping with USconstitutional history and tradition. If the bill were enacted, no discretioncould be exercised by public officials on the questions, the departmentmaintains. Another bill, introduced by Sonny Callahan (R-AL) would also denycitizenship to the children of legal immigrants. The emotional hearing featured testimony of opponents, such as Rep. Jose E.Serranno (D-NY), who said that the bills were "a reaction to little brownbabies that simply aren't welcome here." The hearing was dominated byCalifornians who are concerned about he impact illegal immigration has on thestate. In 1992, undocumented immigrants gave birth to 92,000 babies inCalifornia under the Medi-Cal program, making such births 40 percent of the237,000 publicly funded births in the state. Proponents of change say that such a situation was not imaginable in 1868;opponents say changing the 14th amendment affects core American values--birthright citizenship. Bilbray argued that it is unfair to offer generous health and welfarebenefits to the children of illegal immigrants: "The gift of citizenship is thegreatest gift we can bestow. To give it to those who break the law is an insultto every legal immigrant." Commission on Immigration Reform Chair Barbara Jordan countered that: "Todeny birthright citizenship is to derail the engine of American liberty." In a study of 38 countries, the Center for Immigration Studies found that13 --including Mexico, Canada, Brazil and Spain-- grant citizenship based onplace of birth. Twenty-five require also that at least one parent be a citizenor of that country's ethnicity, and six of the twenty-five specifywhether it is to be the mother or the father who provides the link.

Wilson, Case No. CV 94-7569 MRP--available on theMigration News Home Page), declared most parts of Prop. 187 unconstitutional, adecision that the state of California vowed to appeal--one official called thejudge's decision the first round in a ten-round fight. The US Supreme Court has ruled that the "power to regulate immigration isunquestionably exclusively a federal power," and the judge held that"Proposition 187's verification, notification and cooperation/reportingrequirements directly regulate immigration by creating a comprehensive schemeto detect and report the presence and effect the removal of illegalaliens." After her ruling, the judge said that she wants a quick appeal, but gavestate lawyers until the end of January to decide if they want to push aheadwith a section cutting health benefits to illegal immigrants. She also saidthat she supports a permanent injunction of Prop. 187 to speed the finalresolution of the legal issues. The key distinction in most of the ruling is the source of funds. If anassistance program is funded with both federal and state funds, the judge ruledthat California could not unilaterally make illegal aliens ineligible forbenefits. But if the program is funded with state funds only, thenCalifornia can make illegal aliens ineligible for benefits. Only in K-12 education is the source of funds irrelevant--in this case, a1982 US Supreme Court decision requires states to educate illegal alienchildren. The judge ruled, however, that under federal law California can denyentry and in-state tuition status to illegal aliens seeking entry to collegesand universities. A California state judge has so far prevented this policyfrom taking effect. Attorneys representing California argued that the state has a rightand duty to conserve scarce state funds, and to spend them as voters wish. Thefederal judge, by contrast, emphasized that only the federal government has thepower to regulate immigration. Some commentators noted that the judge's decision may prompt Congress toenact a Prop.-187 measure, since Congress--but not the states-- has theconstitutional right to make aliens ineligible for benefits. Since 1964,judges have invalidated six of the 36 initiatives approved by Californiavoters. The 1978 Proposition 13, which limited property taxes, survived legalchallenge K.L.

Mexicans opting for US or othercitizenship would lose their right to vote in Mexican elections, but couldretain their Mexican passports. President Zedillo made dual citizenship a key plank in his foreign policy,and on several occasions reminded the estimated two to three millionMexican-born nationals in the US who are eligible to apply for US citizenshipthat they are Mexicans who happen to live north of the border. Some USobservers fear that Mexico is "interfering" in US politics by urging itsnationals living in the US to become US citizens, and then support Mexicangovernment positions in the US. Mexico has 51 consulates throughout the US,while the US has 16 consulates in Mexico. Over 8,000 Mexicans applied for asylum in the US in 1994 and 1995, andabout 60 were granted asylum, most in 1995. In FY94, Haitians were most likelyto receive asylum in the US (1,060 Haitians were granted asylum) and in FY95,946 Indians were granted asylum. On December 18, 1995, NAFTA was to permit trucks that satisfy nationalstandards to cross the border and to deliver goods within border states withforeign drivers, not just the current 20-mile commercial limit. After pressurefrom the Teamsters Union, the US Department of Transportation announced thatthere would be a delay in free access, pending the outcome of discussions withMexico about highway safety. Although US truckers can carry goods into Mexico, few US companies permittheir drivers to take goods into Mexico because of fears of theft, so the majorbeneficiary of this NAFTA provision would have been Mexican truckers. The US Teamsters union and border state politicians pressured the ClintonAdministration not to permit Mexican trucks to move beyond the 20-mile zone.According to those favoring a delay in free Mexican truck movement, 1,200 ofthe 5,000 Mexican trucks entering Texas every day are time bombs because theycarry fuel or explosives in unsafe trucks--in many cases, Mexican trucks meetMexican safety standards, but not US safety standards. Instead of making cross border truck traffic easier, on December 19, therewere stepped up US safety checks of Mexican trucks entering the US. SomeMexican drivers, who reportedly earn $62 per week, complained ofdiscrimination. The trucking delay illustrates the problems involved inintegrating two very different economies. Along most of the US-Mexican border, the Mexican city is more populous thanits US counterpart. Juarez, a city of 1.5 million residents across the RioGrande from El Paso, a city of 600,000, has about 25 percent of Mexico'smaquiladora employment--some 150,000 Mexicans work in 310 maquiladoras. Juarezhad a city budget of $37 million in 1994, and the mayor notes that, with thissmall budget, Juarez is unable to build the infrastructure needed in thisfast-growing city. The minimum wage in Juarez was raised to $20 per week onDecember 4, 1995. Border residents complain that the Mexican government hasbegun to collect import taxes from Mexican shoppers who return from the UnitedStates with more than $400 in consumer goods. In 1995, total compensation--wages plus benefits--paid to maquiladoraworkers is expected to average $1.80 an hour, down from $2.61 in 1994. TheNAFTA labor commission ruled in a case involving a Sony TV assembly plant inMatamoros that the Mexican government failed to enforce the right of workers tofreely organize. In the US, by comparison, the total compensation paid to private sectorworkers averaged $17.10 an hour in March 1995, with straight-time wages andsalaries averaging $ 12.25 an hour and benefit costs averaging $ 4.85, makingbenefit costs 29 percent of total compensation. Benefit costs accounted for 36percent of total compensation for union workers in March, 1995, and 27 percentfor non-union employees. Mexico in 1994 had a $1.4 billion trade deficit with the US, as Mexicansimported more than they exported. In 1995, Mexico exported $15 billion more ingoods than it imported from the US--in 1996, Mexico may export a total $100billion worth of goods. The corruption scandal involving Raul Salinas, brother of ex-PresidentCarlos Salinas, prompted calls for the return of the ex-President to facecorruption charges. Raul Salinas, on a government salary of less than $200,000per year, bought numerous properties in Mexico, and stashed at least $100million in accounts abroad.

South Koreans operate more about 1,000 businesses inArgentina, many in the garment districts of Once and Flores. There areabout 300 Korean cultural, athletic and business associations, andsome 30 Protestant churches with predominantly Korean congregations in thecountry. Some Jewish shop owners said that the South Koreans were "takingover." The South Koreans work 12 to 14 hours per day, sell merchandise at lowprices, and hire cheap labor from Bolivia. The first wave of South Korean immigrants to South America went to Brazilin 1961. The South Korean government persuaded Brazil to accept theimmigrants, and allowed each to take $40,000 to South America. The second waveof South Koreans came four years later to Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile. From1965 to 1985, about 6,000 South Koreans emigrated to Argentina and, by 1985,there were 50,000 South Koreans in the Southern Cone nation. Sociologists say that the South Koreans were successful in Argentinabecause they shared credit and employment inside large families and becausethey brought in cheap labor from neighboring countries. A series of newspaperarticles published several years ago tarnished the image of South Koreanentrepreneurs, who were accused of operating sweat shops with undocumentedBolivians . The South Koreans charge that their success has led to discriminationagainst them, aggravated by recession. Argentinean police broke up a smuggling ring that helped smuggle Chineseand Hong Kong residents through Argentina to Canada and the United States. Theillegal immigrants paid about $30,000 dollars each for the voyage. Many of theimmigrants were employed in Chinese restaurants while their documents to besmuggled into the US or Canada were prepared. Seventy-five immigrants werecaptured and between 30 and 40 were deported. After growing by over seven percent in 1994, economic growth in Argentinaslowed to one percent in 1995, prompting the government to crack down onillegal immigrants.

"Asian smuggling ringbusted in Argentina," Agence France Presse, October 13, 1995. _______________________________ Welfare,Health, andPoverty In 1993, the US government spent $300 billion on programs for poorresidents through six major programs--Medicaid ($132 billion), food stamps andSSI ($26 billion each), AFDC ($25 billion), low-income housing assistance ($20billion), and Head Start and other compensatory education programs ($10billion). Under most of these programs, all individuals who qualify and applyreceive assistance, so that the annual cost of the program cannot be determinedprecisely in advance. Under welfare reforms approved by Congress, many of these federalassistance programs will be capped at a certain level of funding, and themoneys turned over to states in a block grant for the state to spend underrules that they devise. States would have to spend 25 cents of their funds toassist the poor for every 75 cents received in the federal government blockgrant. Welfare reform with a time limit on cash assistance is moving closer toreality. Whether the time limit turns out to be two or five years, experts arebracing for the movement into the labor force of four to five million adultswho now receive cash payments. So far, 24 states have asked for federal approval of time limits on welfareand, in one state, Michigan, one-third of the adults receiving generalassistance in 1992 found full-time jobs within two years of being forced offthe rolls. On November 13, a House-Senate conference committee agreed to create a $3.5billion fund to cover the cost of providing emergency health care tounauthorized aliens in the 15 states with the most such residents over the nextfive years. In 1994, Congress for the first time approved funds to reimbursestates for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens who commit crimes in theUS; the health funds are the first federal funds specifically earmarked forcovering states' health care service costs. If approved, the welfare reforms would make ineligible or restrict theaccess of legal immigrants to federal welfare programs from food stamps toAFDC. In addition, U.S. residents who sponsor their relatives to be immigrantswould have the affidavits they sign to show that the immigrant will not requestwelfare benefits become legally binding until the immigrant becomes a UScitizen. California has more than half of the estimated 1.5 million legal immigrantscurrently receiving either Aid to Families With Dependent Children orSupplemental Security Income. There are 3.2 million foreign-born people in LosAngeles county, and the county estimates that, if welfare reforms are enacted,207,000 of the county's legal immigrants on Aid to Families With DependentChildren, 276,000 on food stamps and 68,000 on Supplemental Security Incomecould be cut off. A profile of newcomers to the Sacramento area reported that families fromthe ex-USSR arriving as refugees knew one English word--welfare. Almost halfof the 75,000 refugees who settled in the Sacramento area since 1975 are onwelfare. California's four million welfare recipients receive about $30billion annually, and refugees reportedly receive about 10 percent of allwelfare benefits in the state. One profile of a Pentecostal refugee family with 13 minor children notedthat, with AFDC payments of almost $1,300 per month, plus $1,000 in FoodStamps, and health care, the family would have to earn $61,000 per year to bebetter off working, an unlikely event since the parents did not speak English. Adult children in refugee families get $399 per month for eight monthswhile they attend English and job search classes, and then $299 per month ingeneral assistance. Older family members get $513 per month in SSI payments.There are about 20,000 Christians from the ex-USSR in the Sacramentoarea. Many other Russian immigrants denounce the tendency of Baptists andPentecostals with large families to arrive as refugees, and to get and stay onwelfare in the US. According to some established Russians, California has madeit too easy to transfer from the Russian to the California welfare system, sothat, in the words of one, moving to the US is truly moving to the "promisedland." California has relatively generous welfare benefits, and automaticeligibility, plus a weak economy, could lead to the surprise that so many,rather than so few, refugees get off welfare. St. Louis has about 80,000 immigrants and refugees, and expects to receiveanother 20,000 before the end of the century. Immigration to St. Louisincludes a wide range of ethnic groups, from Russians to Ethiopians. Theheterogeneity of the newcomers means that many languages and specialcircumstances must be provided for, leading to gaps in services. The US State Department has deemed St. Louis a favorable site forresettling refugees. In the mid-1970s, many Vietnamese refugees who were sentto St. Louis soon left for California.

Britain's Asylumand Immigration Bill includes employer sanctions, fines of up to L5,000 ($8000)for knowingly hiring illegal workers, and a rule that would oblige schools andhospitals to report suspected illegal immigrants. There were a record number of asylum applications in the UK in 1995: 36,000to December, 1995, almost double the number in 1993. The government isproposing to deny them welfare and other benefits that total L215 million peryear. Asylum seekers would be ineligible for welfare benefits, andthose from "safe" countries of origin would be sent home while theirapplications were considered. On January 8, 1996 some 6,000 asylum applicantsin the UK were expected to lose their benefits, but in mid-December, thegovernment postponed the cut-off until Parliament has a chance to debateit. Critics of the measure contend the loss of benefits for asylum seekers willresult in homelessness. About 70 percent of UK asylum applicants apply after they are inside theUK, and half apply after being arrested in the U.K. for a criminaloffense. In Italy, the government added criminal penalties to its employer sanctionslaw by decree, and permitted the immediate expulsion of persons who lackresidence permits, and foreigners who commit crimes in Italy. Italy reportedthat 15,000 foreigners, mainly from Albania, were caught in the southern Pugliaregion between May and November, 1995. The European Parliament on December 13, 1995 discussed the report on theEU's progress on issues covered by Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty. Thatsection of the 1992 Treaty on European Union (TEU) provided the legal frameworkfor a reinforcement of intergovernmental cooperation between the EU Membergovernments in the field of Justice and Home Affairs - the so-called "ThirdPillar of the Treaty". Under the Maastricht treaty, immigration policy isclassified as a "question of common interest" and thus subject to the adoptionof minimum EU standards. The European Parliament has been urging the European Commission to play amore active role in promoting freedom of movement, including the movementinside Europe of third-party nationals settled in one EU country, and tomonitor the treatment of asylum seekers. For example, a majority of the EP voted to make sexual violence arecommended ground for EU nations to grant asylum, and to broaden Article 1A ofthe Geneva Convention to make eligible for asylum all persons persecuted intheir countries, even if the persecution is not carried out by the government.A majority of the EP also voted to recommend that employers with illegalworkers who fail to contribute required payroll taxes should pay such taxesinto a fund to promote the reintegration of returned illegal aliens. The EPalso urged EU nations to permit dual nationality for legal residents. However, EU activities in immigration and other social issues are governedby "subsidiarity," the principle that national governmental units should dealwith the issues they are best equipped to handle. Subsidiarity and an ongoingSocial Dialogue between employers and workers are arguments used againstfurther EU activities in social issues. In June 1995, EU Justice and Interior Ministers adopted a resolution thatestablished the general principal that asylum seekers should have the right ofappeal if their applications are rejected, and should be allowed to remain inthe country while the appeal is pending. However, this principal of appeal andtemporary stay does not apply if the ground for rejection is that the applicantcould and should have sought asylum in a "safe-third country" through which hepassed en route to the country of application. France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Germany have nationallegislation that follows this principal; the other EU members are expected toadopt such legislation by January 1, 1996. In France, a December 1994 law targeted at alien smugglers caught several"ordinary people" in its web, such as the French woman who received a suspendedthree-month jail term for failing to report her illegal Congolesefiancé. Both France and Spain have warned African countries that theiraid and trade concessions depend on these countries' help in curbingemigration. Most European countries have separate systems for dealing withunaccompanied asylum applicants aged 16 and under--they are often housed andcared for at least several months before their applications for asylum aredealt with. As one result, some parents in Turkey and ex-Yugoslavia aresending their children abroad alone. In the 1990s, European nations have unemployment rates that are double theUS rate, a sharp reversal from the 1960s, when European unemployment rates werehalf the US rate--the EU's unemployment rate for 1995 is expected to average10.7 percent. There are many analyses of causes and cures, with the mostcommon prescription being to scale back the welfare state--reduce the amountand duration of unemployment insurance payments, reduce minimum wages andpayroll taxes, and make it easier to dismiss workers-- so that unemployedworkers are more willing to lower their expectations and accept new jobs, evenat lower wages or in a different area, and employers are more willing to hirethem. In the US, workers tend to leave areas experiencing high unemployment,which is why differences in state unemployment rates do not persist. InEurope, by contrast, the adjustment to higher unemployment often involves ashrinking of the labor force, as women and older workers drop out of the laborforce. One analyst of why "Euroschlerosis" is much discussed and little tackledobserves that the clear winners from more flexible and presumably lower wagelabor markets are relatively few--stock owners, some unemployed workers who getjobs, and the skilled workers whose wages rise because the unemployed workersare employed. There is no obvious relationship between the percentage of foreigners inEuropean populations and the unemployment rate--Portugal had relatively fewforeigners (one percent) and a low unemployment rate (four percent), whileBelgium had about nine percent foreigners, and 10 percent unemployment. Theseexamples imply that the more foreigners, the more unemployment. EU officials and national governments are attempting to deal with problemsarising from the recruitment of "hostesses" and "dancers" for jobs inwestern Europe. In some cases, smugglers have been able to take advantage oflaws that provide relatively easy entry for "artists." Women, who suffer much higher unemployment rates in Eastern Europe thanmen, are induced to be prostitutes in western Europe. An estimated 75 percentof the Netherlands' 10,000 prostitutes are foreigners. Switzerland offered1800 visas to "dancers" in 1994, one-third of whom were from easternEurope. EU leaders in mid-December agreed to consider the applications of easternEuropean nations to join the EU at the end of 1997. Migration was discussed extensively at the "EuroMed" conference inBarcelona in late November, with North Africans complaining that illegalimmigration was often discussed in conjunction with terrorism and drugs ratherthan trade. According to some Europeans, migration from North African andTurkey is simply repeating 1960s migrations from southern Europe to northernEurope. Some 2.6 million Moslems are believed to have legally migrated to Europe inthe past five yeas, and the Barcelona summit aims at stabilizing Algeria,Tunisia and Morocco to prevent more migration. However, Spain is building withEU assistance a $25 million road and fence between its Cueta enclave in NorthAfrica and Morocco, and requiring the 2,000 Moroccans who commute to Gibraltarto obtain visas if they wish to leave Gibraltar for Spain. Cueta is aseven-square mile Spanish city of 75,000 in North Africa. Africans trying toreach Europe rioted in October 1995 to protest Spain's refusal to move them toSpain.

In addition, there are 350,000 Bosnians livingin other European countries, 820,000 in other ex-Yugoslavia states, and 1.3million displaced within Bosnia. Under the peace plan, the Bosnians in Europe will be the last to bereturned to Bosnia, and some wonder if they will be willing to return. TheBosnians scattered around Germany live rent-free in accommodations provided bylocal authorities-- a family of four receives about $250 per week for food etc.Many complain of boredom, but note that conditions in Bosnia remainuncertain. Between 35,000 and 30,000 Bosnian refugees live in Berlin. Berlin spendsabout US $333 million per year on them. One refugee couple -- the woman is Croatian and the husband is Serbian-- announced that they plan to divorce and marry German partnersif they are threatened with expulsion from Germany. On November 23, 1995, the German foreigners' commissioner, CorneliaSchmalz-Jacobsen, released her second 150-page report on the status offoreigners in Germany with the observation that German policies towardforeigners are changing for the better. As evidence, the report notes thatsome foreigners now have the RIGHT to German citizenship(Einbürgerungsansprüche)--meaning that the burden of denying someforeigners German citizenship falls on the government. The report advocates further liberalization, "so that long-term 'foreign'residents become part of German society." The report uses the word migrantrather than foreigner. There are about seven million foreigners or migrants in Germany (the numberrose by about 100,000 in 1994, largely as a result of about 113,000 births toforeigners in Germany) including two million Turks, 1.3 million nationals ofthe ex-Yugoslavia, 572,000 Italians, 356,000 Greeks, and 263,000 Poles. Inaddition there were 1.75 million registered war refugees and asylum-seekers inGermany at the end of 1994. In Germany, cities such as Munich have begun a debate over furtherrestrictions on foreigners in public housing. Under current procedures,foreigners can be a maximum of 20 percent of the residents of localpublic housing, a percentage that may be lowered. Almost one fourth ofMunich's 1.6 million residents are foreigners, many of whom have formedassociations. For example, there are believed to be over 3,000 associationsfor Turks living in Germany. About nine percent of the 2.5 million foreigners in the German labor forcewere self-employed in 1992. Thus about the same percentage of foreigners andGermans are self employed. About 17 percent of the 222,000 foreigners who wereself-employed were Italians, followed by 14 percent Turks, and 10 percentGreeks. About 25 percent of the foreigners' businesses were hotels andrestaurants, followed by 20 percent in manufacturing, and 14 percent inretailing. About 2.1 million foreigners were German wage and salary workers in 1994.The unemployment rate for foreign workers was 17 percent in 1994, versus ninepercent for Germans. Most of the Schmalz-Jacobsen report is devoted to the status of foreignersin Germany. More than half of the 20- to 30-year old foreign women in Germany,and almost half of the young men, do not have a secondary school leavingcertificate, which in Germany usually includes certification that the schoolleaver has learned one of 435 occupations. The major reasons for theseeducation deficiencies include lack of the German language and familycircumstances that fail to emphasize the importance of education. Schmalz-Jacobsen notes that foreigners cannot apply for many public sectorjobs, and that they are entitled to less priority for scarce higher educationslots than German citizens. The report ends with recommendations for steps topromote the integration of migrants in Germany. The weekly news magazine Der Spiegel carried a cover story on illegalimmigration and employment in Germany in December. According to the article,about 100,000 aliens illegally enter and stay in Germany each year, despite anincrease in the number of German border guards from 2,000 in 1993 to 5,300 in1995. Day labor markets are evolving in major cities such as Frankfurt andBerlin, where illegal workers seek child care, construction, and servicejobs. Germany's labor ministry is responsible for preventing illegal workers fromgetting jobs in Germany, and it enforces laws against the employment of illegalalien workers, as well as against German workers unlawfully drawingunemployment insurance or other aid while working for cash, by comparingpayroll tax and employment data, by checking foreign worker employment dataagainst a central register of data on foreigners, and by visiting constructionand similar workplaces and apprehending workers who run away, or inspecting thework papers of those at work. There are 44 special labor offices with some 1,000 inspectors thatconcentrate on illegal employment, plus another 500 inspectors available ifneeded. In Germany, workers receive an identification card showing theinsurance number that each person is required to have to be employed. Theymust show the ID to their employer when they begin to work, and the employermust report the number to the local labor office within three days. In someindustries, such as construction, janitorial services, and restaurants, workersmust carry their ID cards with them at work. Workers must leave their ID cardsat the labor office while drawing unemployment insurance benefits--and check inat the labor office frequently to prove that their availability forwork. There were about 78,000 inspections for illegal foreign workers in 1994,which resulted in 42,000 closed cases in which fines of an average of 550 DMwere levied on employers. In 5,300 cases, criminal penalties were imposed. The number of inspections was about 75,000 in 1993, 37,000 caseswere closed, and fines averaging 405 DM were levied---in 5,900 cases, criminalpenalties were levied. Between 80 and 90 percent of the inspections and finesare in the former West Germany. Violations are most common in construction,janitorial services, restaurants, agriculture, and food processing--inspectorsnoted an increased number of cases in manufacturing, especially metalprocessing. In addition to employing illegal alien workers, German employers can befined for unlawfully lending their foreign workers to other employers--theforeigners are to work in the job in which they were certified to come toGermany. In 1994, there were 5,800 inspections for unlawfully lending foreignworkers between German employers (illegale Arbeitnehmerueberlassung), versus5,100 in 1993, and 3,100 closed cases (2,900 in 1993), and 370 criminalpenalties assessed (190). Fines are much higher for transferring foreignworkers to another employer than simply employing unauthorized workers--a total of 23 million DM in 1994, and 21 million DM in1993. In October 1995, German authorities inspected the attendants in over 500public toilets along highways and in department stores, and found thatvirtually all were illegal aliens who had paid 500 DM each for the right towork in the toilets for tips. The firm that placed them is disputing a chargethat it knowingly employed illegal aliens--it maintains that the attendants areindependent contractors. Germany invests more to restrict immigration than many other countries inpart because its relatively inflexible labor markets permit foreign workers todepress German wages--Germans who do not move away from immigrant areas wind upcompeting with immigrants for jobs. According to some estimates, a onepercent increase in the number of foreigners reduces unskilled and semi-skilledworkers' wages by six percent. In November 1995, there were about 3.6 millionunemployed workers in Germany, for an unemployment rate of 9.3 percent. There continues to be a debate in Germany over whether the country needs animmigration system modeled on either the US or Canadian systems. Mostsocial scientists recommend that Germany adopt an immigration system that wouldadmit a certain number of foreigners each year, and that labor certification ora point system be used to determine priority to enter Germany as aneconomically-useful immigrant. According to Der Spiegel, about 100,000 family unification immigrantsarrive in Germany each year. Spiegel seems to agree with those who argue thatGermany should follow the US and try to reduce illegal immigration byestablishing an annual ceiling on legal immigration--in this way, it isargued, currently illegal aliens would wait for their turn to immigratelegally. Germany's foreign population increases by another 100,000 each yearthrough births to foreign permanent residents. Adding slots for the entry ofpermanent immigrants selected by German employers or on the basis of pointswould presumably increase immigration, since family unification wouldcontinue. German academics have designed immigration systems that they believe willraise German incomes and reduce unemployment. For example, a proposal to useunemployment rates, job vacancies, and wage increases to establish an annualimmigration quota would, according to one proposal, give extra points to, orpermit employers to obtain immigrants, in banking and insurance, research, andmachinery, but not construction. In cases where there is both highunemployment and job vacancies, and the work is unskilled, such as agriculture,practical nursing, and restaurants, some academics propose a Swiss-stylerotational guest worker program. Many Germans believe that they are recommending a US-styleimmigration system. However, the US selects only about 15 percent of itsimmigrants (including their families) on economic grounds. The US hasconsidered and rejected a Canadian-style point system, and the US programadopted in 1990 to permit the immigration of persons investing money andcreating US jobs is widely considered a failure--very few foreigners with moneyfind it attractive. The arrival of 225,000 so-called ethnic German Aussiedler each year fromthe ex-USSR does not add to the foreign population because these newcomersreceive German passports upon their arrival. There are about four millionethnic Germans in eastern Europe and the ex-USSR, and two million have alreadymigrated to Germany. Some 90,000 ethnic Germans have already completed thepaperwork that permits them to move to Germany, but have not yet doneso. Representatives of over 3,000 Turkish groups and organizations met onDecember 2 in Hamburg to establish an umbrella organization to promote theinterests of Germany's 2.1 million Turkish residents. The non-partisanorganization, called TGD, wants to secure civic equality for all Turks livingin Germany. One of the key changes the organization wants is dual citizenship,though that is not wanted uniformly by all Turks in Germany. All the debates in Turkey over the future of that country aremirrored among Turks in Germany, especially over the role that Islam shouldplay in daily life. For example, in Germany there are less expensiveburial sites, in which remains are plowed over after 15 years, and the spacereused for new burials. Turks who selected this burial option for relativeshave sued Cologne to argue that Islam prohibits disturbing the remains of thedead. At the end of November 1995, the German Bundestag approved a resolutionthat would permit the government to require 150,000 foreign constructionworkers, many from other EU nations, to be paid at least the German minimumconstruction wage from their first day of work in Germany (MN, December, 1995).This two-year attempt to prevent "wage dumping" may not go into effect,however, because non-union German employers must first negotiate minimum wageswith relevant unions, and then this minimum wage could be made bindingthroughout the construction industry.

France continues toinsist that it must maintain strict border controls because of terroristattacks. Another sticking point is the availability of drugs in its northernneighbor, the Netherlands. The French government pledged to give labor inspectors and customsofficials more powers to report migrant smuggling. The government acted inresponse to complaints of unfair competition from small businesses, and toavoid the loss of social security and other payroll taxes. French public sector employees struck to protest plans to reduce theirwages and benefits in late November and early December. The Frenchgovernment needs to reduce government expenditure to meet the Maastrichtrequirements for a single currency. Hence the plan to cut $55 billion over twoyears. The single largest savings would come from reducing state expenditures forhealth care. Other savings are expected from reorganizing the money-losingrailroads, from raising the retirement age for government employees from 60 to65, and requiring 40 rather than 37 years of service to get the maximumpension. The 1.5 million students in 79 state-supported universities areprotesting plans to only modestly expand funding for higher education. Unemployment in France is running at 11.5 percent. In a trade-union vote by policemen in France, the extreme-right unionaffiliated with Jean-Marie Le Pen won 13.4 percent. A left-wing publicationinterpreted the vote as meaning that there is now a one in eight chance ofbeing stopped for an identity check by an extreme-right policeman. Citizens of the French port city of Toulon are reportedly pleased with theresults of the June election, which elected a National Front mayor. Toulon hasa population of 170,000, and an unemployment rate of nearly 20 percent.

TurkishPresident Suleyman Demirel said that it was an historic day for Turkey, andthat the country has "now entered a phase of much closer links with Europe." Under the terms of the 1963 Association Agreement between the EEC andTurkey, Turks were to have freedom of movement with the EEC by 1976. Thisso-called Ankara Agreement was never fully implemented, but under the agreementand subsequent protocols, Turks have preference over other "third-countrynationals" in gaining admission to EU nations to fill vacant jobs. In 1973, an "additional protocol" was signed between the EU and Turkey thatplanned for a customs union by 1995. In March 1995, the EU and Turkey agreedto a customs union effective January 1, 1996, if the EU Parliament approved.Turkey modified its anti-terrorism law in October 1995 to permit some personsjailed for "incitement" to be freed, paving the way for EU approval. Under the free-trade agreement, tariffs that average 14 percent on $20billion in trade between Turkey and the EU will be eliminated; Turkey willforego about $1.5 billion in tariff income, but it hopes to gain far more in EUinvestment. On December 24, Turkey held general elections in which the fundamentalistWelfare Party (Refah) did better than expected, gaining 158 seats in the 550member Parliament with 21 percent of the vote. The Welfare Party promisedcheap bread, and delivered on its promises after winning municipal elections inAnkara, Istanbul, and 22 other cities in 1994. Turkey bills itself as a secular Moslem state, a stable friend of the Westin an unstable but strategic region. However, its economy has faltered, withinflation running at 80 percent, interest rates are 100 percent, andunemployment is at least 20 percent. Turkey on June 12 began to permit Turks who lose their Turkish nationalityby becoming a citizen of another country to retain their rights to property andinheritance in Turkey. However, Turkish youth living abroad are at age 18obliged to perform 18 months of military service in Turkey, or pay DM10,000($7,000) and have their service obligation in Turkey reduced to two months.Turks who fail to perform military service or pay do not get their Turkishpassports renewed. A report released by the Turk-Metal union finds that thousands of Kurds whomigrated to western Turkey have developed a radical brand of Kurdishnationalism due to disillusionment. The survey compared Kurds in the 10southeastern provinces under emergency rule with those who lived in the sixwestern provinces, where many Kurds have gone to escape the effects of unrest. The report found that more than 20 percent of the Kurds living in westernTurkey said they accepted Turkish nationality for lack of choice; many wantedmore ethnic freedom. Most Kurds living in the southeast wanted to remain partof one nation. The survey found that most Kurds leaving the southeast areseeking employment and investment opportunities, rather than escaping thesecurity problems.

The president is also prepared to sign agreementswith Russia and Belorussia to return asylum seekers who transit through thosecountries. In a meeting with the Swedish prime minister in October, the Latvianpresident asked other European nations to help fund the building of a camp forasylum seekers. The camp would cost an estimated $1.5 million. Latvia is considering legislation that would impose up to 10-year jailterms, plus confiscation of any vehicles used, on persons caught smugglingaliens into the country. In March, a "train of despair," carried 100 Kurds between Latvia,Lithuania, and Russia for several weeks as each country rejected the Kurdishasylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran --half of whom werechildren--and argued that they were the responsibility of the other. In earlyApril, the refugees were moved to the prison building in a small town nearRiga, Latvia. They have remained there for the past nine months, waiting forRussia to agree to accept their return. The Kurds, most of whom had paid $2,500 each to be smuggled to Sweden, wereon a ship that ran aground in Estonia, from which they were returned to Latvia.Sweden, according to Latvia, announced that it would help Latvia to deport theKurds to Russia. About 50 Middle Eastern asylum-seekers a month, or 10boatloads a year, are smuggled into Sweden via the Baltic states. Latvia is being criticized by Russia for its response to the suicide of aRussian citizen in a Latvian town in July, 1995. The Russian, who was unableto obtain a residence permit, immolated himself to protest his impendingdeportation. Lithuania is continuing to try to set up mechanisms to deal with illegalimmigration. Under pressure for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees andScandinavian governments, Lithuania promised to convert a former Sovietmilitary base into a detention center for asylum seekers, instead of forcingthem to depend upon the benevolence of the local people. Lithuania hopes toget financial support from Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. Lithuania's Border Protection Service welcomed Russia's offers to provideequipment to police the borders of the Baltic states. The Commission of BorderServices hopes that the strengthened border guard will stem the flow of illegalimmigrants who travel through Lithuania on their way to the West.

Thecamps have North Korean workers who provide cheap labor to log the birch andpine forests in Siberia. Moscow and North Korea then divide the profits fromthe sale of the logs to countries like Japan. There were widespread claims of abuse after the labor camps became wellknown following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The North Korean workers arenow guaranteed protection under Russian labor laws, but there are reports thatworker abuse continues. Many North Koreans are running away from the camps tolook for jobs because of food and equipment shortages. Some Chinese and Korean migrant workers reportedly accept low wages whileworking seasonally in Siberia in exchange for the ability to take home wildginseng for longevity potions and tiger bones and reindeer antlers foraphrodisiacs. The year-long Operation Foreigner, which cracked down on illegalimmigration in Russia's Maritime Territory, came to an end in late October,1995. Over 10,00 Chinese were returned to their homeland during the operation.The operation also stopped attempts by Vietnamese and North Koreans to smuggleout of Russia rare animals and plants. According to the Russian government, some 40 million of Russia's 148million residents have below poverty level incomes of less than $68 per month.

Haider, who opposesimmigration, is considered the most successful far-right politician inEurope. During the campaign, Haider asserted that "Immigration cannot be continuedin our country." At a rally he added that "We must adopt the principle'Austria First' if we don't want to disappear slowly in a land full offoreigners." Haider's Freedom Party issued its own "Contract with Austria,"which pledged to cut taxes and budget deficits, fight crime, reduce the size ofgovernment, and prevent Austria from becoming an immigration country. Austrianpundits compare him to Newt Gingrich. The neighboring Czech Republic has come under fire for using strictcitizenship laws to prevent some of the 200,000 gypsies from becoming Czechcitizens. After the breakup of Czechoslovakia in January, 1993, the CzechRepublic enacted some of Europe's toughest citizenship laws, requiring newcitizens, for example, to renounce their old citizenship, to prove that theyhave a record clean of any criminal acts for five years, and to pay relativelyhigh fees. Some 360,000 Slovaks have become Czech citizens since 1993, but most arenon-Gypsies. The Council of Europe, founded in 1949, calls Czech efforts todeny citizenship to Gypsies the "largest denationalization" since World WarII.

Instead of deriving comparativeadvantage from large numbers of cheap unskilled workers, as they have for thepast two decades, many commentators urge Asian nations to upgrade theireducational systems to produce more professionals, scientists, andengineers. For example, Hong Kong has an historically high unemployment rate--3.5percent--and, simultaneously, large numbers of vacancies for skilled andprofessional workers. At the same time, professionals such as accountants,nurses, and computer programmers from India to the Philippines cannot find jobsthat use these skills in their own countries. Even countries attracting large amounts of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)suffer from shortages of skilled and professional workers. In Indonesia, forexample, about half of the university graduates entering the job market eachyear are unemployed, but foreign investors complain that they cannot find localsupervisors and mid-level managers. Foreign investors have similar complaintsin China, Malaysia, and Thailand about shortages of skilled workers andtechnicians. Many governments concerned about foreign workers and wanting to maintainrapid economic growth agree that "the higher-end manufacturing base envisagedby government planners will not materialize unless local education and trainingsystems are able to provide the sort of skilled workers required by potentialforeign investors." However, in the US and Australia, countries that accept large numbers ofpermanent and temporary foreigners on the basis of their skills, there is agrowing belief that easy access to foreigners discourages local workers fromtraining for occupations that have a significant number of foreignworkers. Singapore. Singapore Economic Development Board began to sendmissions abroad in 1991 to recruit new graduates for jobs in Singapore. The missions permit local companies to screen candidates in India, the US, andAustralia for professional jobs in computer science and engineering. In 1994,about 500 jobs were offered to foreign professionals--40 percent Indians andSri Lankans--and 40 percent in computer science and engineering. There are over 100,000 mostly unskilled Malaysian workers in Singapore, buta decision of the Singaporean government to exempt after August 1, 1995 foreignworkers and their employers from contributing about 20 percent each of theirgross pay to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) was expected to attractadditional skilled and professional workers to Singapore. The 300,000 workpermit holders whose employers are required to pay the Foreign Workers' Levywere exempt from CPF contributions. Under Singapore's levy system, employers pay a levy of S$200 (US $150) perskilled worker each month instead of S$440 for unskilled workers. Malaysia. Malaysia established a Human Resources DevelopmentFund (HRDF) in 1992 to promote the training of skilled workers, with highestpriority for the printing, plastics, steel and iron, electronic and electrical,and textile industries. The Fund makes grants to firms that establish trainingfacilities, and rebates up to 20 percent of the firms' contributions to theHRDF if the firm establishes training facilities at its production site. Japan. The number of foreigners employed in Japan has decreased byabout three percent since 1993, but the number of foreigners employed asengineers and managers increased about 15 percent. Many Japanese firms arehiring foreigners as permanent workers, hoping they will become candidates forjobs in overseas offices. Outside Asia. The US, Canada, and Australia have programs throughwhich professionals and skilled foreigners can enter as temporary or permanentimmigrants. In all three countries, these immigration systems are coming underattack. In Australia, unions in April 1995 complained that the government waspermitting the entry of 30 British tool makers for 18 to 24 months despite highunemployment. Australia uses a point system to select permanent immigrants onthe basis of their skills, and the 1993-94 intake included 445 doctors, 324civil engineers, 537 secondary school teachers, 210 lawyers, 149 economists and114 architects, as well as 652 accountants, 830 computing professionals, 543nurses, 288 carpenters and 366 vehicle mechanics.

New policies to curbillegal immigration are expected to be implemented by June, 1996. The Thai government has been frustrated because current immigrationcontrols such as fines and deportation have not worked. A majority of theillegal immigrants are Burmese, who have not been stopped by a requirement tohave work permits. An estimated 100,000 Burmese have fled the unrest in theirown country over the past two years and have settled in Thailand's borderareas. A total of 500,000 Burmese are believed live in Thailand. To retaliate against the Burmese who have left for Thailand, the DemocraticKaren Buddhist Army has been encroaching into Thailand to harass Burmese inrefugee camps. According to reports, the Thai guards, who are sometimes warnedof an impending attack, view the raids as an internal problem between the twoKaren groups and ignore their intrusion onto Thai soil. There has been little coordination between the various Thai ministries toagree upon a government policy toward Burma. Therefore, there is no firmpolicy about security at the refugee camps. The guards at the camps do nothave the authority to retaliate against the attacks, and even if they did, theyare not equipped to halt the attacks. Thai officials have dissuaded reliefworkers from helping the Karen refugees because the government says it wants tosend the Karens back as soon as possible. The UN has been unable to assist the Karens in the camps because the Thaigovernment has termed them "displaced" persons rather than refugees. One reason there has been a reluctance to establish a firm policy isbecause the illegal foreign workers are considered a benefit to Thailand-- theyfill vacant unskilled and semi-skilled jobs at low wages.

The last Vietnamese were expected to be home be the end of 1995, butonly 5,000 were returned in 1995, versus 12,500 in 1994. Under the US plan, Vietnamese in the camps would be taken to Ho Chi MinhCity by the UN, and interviewed as they returned to Vietnam by US immigrationofficials. If the "several thousand" among the returning Vietnamese can provethat they worked with the US during the war, and can qualify as politicalrefugees, they could come to the US. Most of the other Vietnamese would beexpected to resettle in Vietnam. The UN planned to empty Vietnamese from the camps in 1995, but Vietnamesein the camps refused to return after US House approved $30 million to bringVietnamese in the camps to the US. The legislation was not approved byCongress, but many of the 20,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong believe that China's1997 takeover will force the US to accept them. Many Hong Kong residentsbelieve the Vietnamese should return; the UNHCR owes Hong Kong $130 million forcosts it incurred to house the Vietnamese. Many of the refugees do not want to be returned to Vietnam and someRepublican legislators are reluctant to send them forcibly back to Vietnam. ARepublican amendment attached to the federal budget bill would prohibit theforced repatriation of economic migrants, and would block US payments to UNHCRif UNHCR continues forced repatriations. Thailand, Vietnam and UNHCR signed a memorandum of understanding torepatriate the last 5,000 Vietnamese refugees in Thailand by the middle of1996. Vietnam has asked for more time to repatriate the remaining 2,600Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines. The delay is partly due to the budgetimpasse in the US Congress, because the US agreed to help pay for the refugeesreturn. The UNHCR has said it will not fund the refugee camp in thePhilippines past December 31, 1995, so the Philippine government has said itwill pay for the cost of housing and feeding the Vietnamese refugees. UNHCRwanted to move the refugees to a UN center in Vietnam until the repatriationagreement had been signed. On December 12, the Australian government deported 68 Sino-Vietnameseasylum seekers. The 68 asylum-seekers were from a group of about 900 whoarrived in Australia from the Beihai region of China late last year. Under anagreement between Australia and China, Sino-Vietnamese refugees who had beenresettled in China are not permitted to apply for refugee status in anothercountry.

However, Australia reported in December that 4,000 of the 5.8 millionforeigners seeking to enter the country were turned back because they hadforged documents. Some Asians reportedly pay up to $5,000 each to buy papersthat say they are managers or accountants, travel to Australia for businessreasons, work as factory workers and, if apprehended, apply for asylum. Thereare an estimated 75,000 illegal aliens in Australia, mostly British andChinese. APEC, established in 1989, includes 18 nations that produced over half ofthe world's $24 trillion GDP in 1993, with the US and Japan accounting foralmost 80 percent of APEC's economic output. There are enormous differences inper capita incomes between APEC member nations--per capita GDP ranged from$34,000 in Japan in 1993 to $450 in China. APEC member nations account for almost half of global trade, worth $7.4trillion in 1993. The November 1995 APEC summit in Osaka, Japan was supposedto take steps to implement free trade among the richer APEC members by the year2010, and free trade among all APEC members by 2020. ASEAN, established in 1967, includes Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines,Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam--Burma, Cambodia and Laos areexpected to join by the year 2000. In 1992, these nations agreed to establisha free trade zone--AFTA-- by the year 2000 which would include 450 millionpeople. One International Labour Office estimate puts the number of migrant workersemployed outside their country of citizenship worldwide at 25 million,including 13 million in Asia. A recent study by the University of Indonesia found that 19 percent offoreign workers in Indonesia were South Koreans, followed by Japanese, 15percent; and Taiwanese, nine percent. UNCTAD--the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development-- reportedin mid-December that foreign direct investment (FDI) topped $235 billion in1995--including 37 percent or $87 billion to LDCs-- the worldwide stock of FDIis now $2.5 trillion. The US is the major overseas investor, investing $46billion abroad in 1994, and receiving $49 billion in FDI from other countriesin 1994. Japan and Germany combined invested only $39 billion abroad in 1994. Japanwas the number one overseas investor between 1986 and 1991, with a peakoverseas investment of $48 billion in 1990, but the US has been the leadingoverseas investor since 1991. Most FDI comes from the world's 40,000 multinationals, most of which arebased in industrial countries, and invest in other industrial nations. Chinareceived $27 billion in FDI in 1994, and FDI in LDCs is expected to top $90billion in 1995. However, LDCs invested $33 billion abroad in 1994, andMexico's Cemex, with $3.6 billion invested abroad, is the developing world'slargest foreign investor. The world's 40,000 multinationals account for about two-thirds of all worldtrade, and half of multinational trade is between affiliates of the samemultinational. There are 40,000 multinationals, and they have 250,00 foreignaffiliates with sales of $5.2 trillion in 1994.

The current Law of the People's Republic of China on Entry andExit of Aliens has only general principles, so that it is implementeddifferently by local authorities. According to Chinese authorities, the government must "exclude foreignersentering China in search of high salaries and a low cost of living." Unskilledforeigners seeking to work will be denied work permits. One official saidthat, "With China's opening up and rapid development, more and more aliens arecoming to this ancient country, attracted by its long history, profound cultureand relatively more employment opportunities and better pay." There are about 70,000 foreigners employed in China, and 80 percent of the30,000 foreigners who work in China for more than one year are employed byforeign-funded enterprises. The crackdown is due in part to an clash that occurred when a wealthyvillager in Shenzhen rode his motorcycle through a blockade onto a road whichhad just been tarred by migrant workers. A melee began when the villagercalled police--in the ensuing violence, 11 workers were killed by paramilitarytroops with submachine guns. Shenzhen is a special economic zone in Guangdong province, which bordersHong Kong's New Territories, that relies on cheap migrant labor to attractforeign investment. The migrant workers were mostly from the poor provinces ofHunan and Hubei. According to a public security official, 80 to 90 percent ofall crimes in Guangdong province were committed by migrants. South of Beijing, the army began a crackdown on migrants by razing a ghettoof 100,000 peasants who had ventured there from the southern province ofShejuang over the past 10 years. Zheijiang "village" was the capital's mainshoe and garment making district. The village also ran its own clinics,schools, recreation halls, shops and had its own police. The army claimed thatthe ghetto was a slum that harbored criminals. According to the Chinese official media, the army is prepared to razeanother 18 migrant villages around Beijing. The villages are home to aboutthree million people, about one-fourth of the capital's population. The citiesof Shanghai and Canton (Guangzhou) are also expected to raze migrant ghettos. One Chinese city, Xiamen is honoring ten outstanding youths from among thecity's 300,000 migrant workers. The honors are a first for China. The winnersof the competition will get long-term contracts and become permanent cityresidents. China's population policy is reportedly threatened by its growing migrantpopulation. Chinese officials say that migrancy makes it difficult to carryout family planning. Experts estimate that about two-thirds of the unplannedbirths are in transient families. China's 250 million urban residents are required to obtain permission fromneighborhood officials before having a child. Those who have children withoutpermission cannot get a household registration and welfare benefits. In central China's Henan province, local government officials have reducedthe number of births among the migrants by requiring them to produce "familyplanning certificates" before applying for transient identification cards orbusiness licenses. Currently, about 85 percent of the migrant workers in Henanhave the certificates. Maggie Farley, "China Tries to Control Nation's Migrant Workers," LosAngeles Times, December 26, 1995.

The government's Task Force on ForeignWorkers recommended that all foreign workers be paid at least a "reasonablewage" of RM350 per month. The Minister of Human Resources has threatened to blacklist employers foundunderpaying their foreign workers. The minister has said he will conductsurprise inspections of at least 10 sites to track down underpayingemployers. The 30,000 Malaysian construction employers have been told to registertheir workers with the Construction Industry Development Board " to control theforeign workers." The Bangladeshi government proposed to pay the increased levy on foreignworkers in Malaysia or have employers pay workers more to allow them to pay thelevy. The Malaysian government rejected the request, saying that the employershould be responsible for the levy. The levy was raised 100 percent for all foreign workers except domestichelpers and unskilled agricultural workers. There are more than 84,000Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, with another 6,000 to 7,000 waiting forapproval to work. There is a backlog of 100,000 applications from employers seekingforeigners to work in Malaysia. The deputy prime minister explained that hisoffice is investigating why there is such a long backlog, but made it clearthat the government would not relax procedures for foreign workers seekingemployment in Malaysia.

The fingerprintingrequirement has long been seen as a symbol of discrimination againstforeigners, since it suggests a similarity with criminals. The Japanese SupremeCourt ruled that since the procedure involved only one finger, it "should notcause excessive psychological or physical pain." There were about 94,000 foreigners working legally in Japan in 1994, downabout 3,000 from 1993. About 60 percent of these legal foreign workers are notmanagers and professionals, and their number declined by 10 percent. An article in the Fresno Bee compares the work done by illegal foreignworkers in Japan with California. In both places, illegal foreign workers arehired primarily in jobs natives do not want. In California, it is work inagriculture or factories, and in Japan it is in construction or machineryplants. The primary difference is that in California the foreign workers donot stand out the way they do in homogenous Japan, where national identity ifparamount. Pamela J.

In Saudi Arabia, the interior minister asserted that "the private sector isunder an obligation to find jobs for citizens." Saudis hold four per cent ofthe jobs in the industrial sector and 12 percent of service sector jobs--foreigners fill the rest. There are about 6.2 million foreigners from 190countries among the 17 million residents. Saudi foreign workers remitted about $15 billion to their countries oforigin in 1994, up from $4 billion in 1980. Indians, Egyptians and Pakistaniworkers are the largest nationalities. There are 200,000 foreigners among Bahrain's 540,000 residents, and Bahrainis attempting to substitute native for foreign workers by raising the tax onforeigners beginning in 1996. Unemployed, educated youths from Bahrain'smajority Shi'ite Muslim community demonstrated in the streets of Bahrain andattacked foreign worker compounds. In the United Arab Emirates, about 75 percent of the 2.3 million residentsare foreigners. Jordan ordered illegal foreign workers out of the country by October 26,1995, and 70,000 illegal workers--mostly Egyptians and Jordanians--of the totalforeign work force of 250,000 reportedly left by the deadline. Most of theillegal foreign workers had agricultural work permits, but were employed innonfarm jobs. Employers could legalize their illegal foreign workers, andabout 102,000 foreign workers were regularized by their employers. Egyptians are 80 percent of the 200,000 foreign workers in Jordan, followedby Syrians, who are eight percent of Jordan's foreign workers. About 37percent of Jordan's foreign workers are in agriculture, followed by 26 percentin services. Over 93 percent of the foreign workers in Jordan earn less than$140 per month. Arabs do not need visas to enter Jordan, and many Egyptians entered thecountry and took mostly low-wage jobs in agriculture, cleaning, andconstruction--there are an estimated 60,000 foreign construction workers inJordan. Jordan's unemployment rate was 18 per cent of a work force of onemillion in 1995. In August 1995, foreigners were banned from 15 professions,including medicine, engineering, administration, secretarial and retailbusinesses, hair dressing, drivers, messengers, cars mechanics andeducation. The number of Afghani refugees in Iran continues to decline. From a peakthree to four million, there are now only 1.5 million left in Iran. The closure of the Israeli territories has lead to a shortage of pomelopickers, according to the Citrus Marketing Board on October 30, 1995. Theboard reported that if the Israeli government does not supply more foreignworkers, large orders of pomelos for the Japanese market will be lost.

Further violations could extend the bar. An estimated 26 million persons are employed by federal contractors andsubcontractors. Clinton said: "After years and years of neglect, this administration hastaken on a strong stand to stiffen protection on our borders. We areincreasing border patrols by 50 percent; we are increasing inspections to findillegal immigrants in the workplace. And tonight, I announce I will sign anexecutive order to deny federal contracts to business that hire illegalimmigrants. But let me be clear: we are still a nation of immigrants, and wehonor all those immigrants who are working hard to become new citizens. But weare also a nation of laws. " Employers could still get federal contracts if they were fined forpaperwork violations, such as incomplete I-9 forms. Most INS fines are forpaperwork violations--in Northern California, for example, only about 10percent of the INS fines levied on employers since 1988 have been for knowinglyhiring illegal workers. Since 1988, there have been 16,570 INS notices ofintent to fine US employers, including 1,427 in FY95. The Executive Order would establish a system for federal agencies to benotified if a company is caught employing unauthorized workers. Under oneversion of the plan, the INS would notify the federal agency that does the mostbusiness with an employer who hired illegal aliens. The federal government let85,000 new contracts in 1994, and purchased goods and services worth $200billion. One agency frequently criticized is the General Services Administration,which has in some cases not taken action against contractors who have hiredillegal aliens to build or maintain the 7,000 owned and leased buildings inwhich federal government employees work. Some see the proposed Executive Order as another symbolic effort to showthat the Administration is getting tough on illegal immigration. Federalcontractors are already required to obey federal and state laws, and thegovernment publishes a monthly list of firms ineligible for federalcontracts. If enacted, it is not clear how soon the Executive Order would enter intoforce. A March 1995 Executive Order that makes ineligible for federalcontracts businesses that permanently replace striking workers has been held upin court, and is not yet in effect. Republicans sponsors of immigration reform proposals in Congress supportedthe President's action, suggesting that it would further their efforts tocombat the employment of illegal immigrants. Former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, chair of the US Commission onImmigration Reform, died on January 17, leaving the CIR without a nationalspokesperson. Jordan had been instrumental in shaping a consensus immigrationissues. Michael Doyle, "Hiring Crackdown: Much ado about little?" Sacramento Bee,January 27, 1996.

To prevent what some feared would be a massivesurge of illegal immigrants, the INS on January 16, 1996 added 300 more agentsto the California-Arizona borders to discourage illegal entrants returningafter Christmas visits to Mexico and Central America. The INS offered Spanish language videos to broadcast systems in theCaribbean and Latin America that warned potential illegal aliens that thestepped-up border controls will make it harder to return to the US illegallyafter holiday visits home. The INS also said that it intends to prosecuterepeat violators of US immigration laws. Some Mexican workers who viewed the 30-minute broadcast on December 20doubted that it would deter them from returning to the US. The broadcast isscheduled to be repeated at least two more times. The stepped-up border control efforts include an agreement to reimburselocal police forces for cooperating with the INS by, e.g., helping to transportaliens apprehended. The Border Patrol is being backed up by 350 members of theMarine and Army units deployed under the military's Joint Task Force 6, whichhas been helping to battle drug trafficking since 1988. While the Army isprohibited by law from performing immigration-related duties, the troops canassist in operating night scopes, motion sensors and communications gear. National Guard units from California and Arizona will also assist theBorder Patrol. The California Assembly, on a 41-32 vote on January 30, 1995,approved the sending of the National Guard to the border. Republican Presidential candidate Lamar Alexander on January 30, 1995proposed that the Immigration and Naturalization Service be replaced with a newbranch of the armed forces to patrol America's borders. Mexican officials expressed their "deep concern" on January 12 about theuse of US military units at the border; several asserted that stepped-up borderenforcement could harm US-Mexico relations and increase human rights abuses.Several Mexican officials said that the US did not consult with the Mexicangovernment before taking the action. On January 14, Mexican lawmakers announced that they plan to ask the UnitedNations to demand that the US stop using troops along the Mexicanborder. Many newspapers attributed the stepped-up border enforcement toelection-year politics. For example, a Los Angeles Times editorial assertedthat the major reason for the stepped-up border enforcement was to garnercritical California votes. The paper argued that it would have been better tospeed up naturalization to get votes. The INS has three special border control operations: OperationHold-the-Line in El Paso, Texas; Operation Safeguard south of Tucson, Arizona;and, Operation Gatekeeper, south of San Diego, California. The INS has 25,000, including 5,600 Border Patrol agents. About 40 percentof the Border Patrol agents are Hispanic. On January 6, President Clinton signed legislation that raises the INSannual budget from $2.1 billion in FY95 to $2.6 billion in FY96. The INS isplanning to more than double the number of investigators assigned to enforcingemployer sanctions, from 320 to 704. There were about 6,000 INS investigations of employers for immigrationviolations in FY95, down sharply from almost 15,000 in FY89. The INS assessedemployers $4 million in fines in 1989, and $4.1 million in 1995. The northern border states are reporting increased illegal immigration. InIdaho, the border chief reports that the number of apprehensions rose 11percent from FY 1994 to FY 1995. The Border Patrol reports that most illegalaliens are apprehended in the Twin Falls area, and are attracted there byagricultural jobs. Some critics have noted that the Clinton Administration's approach tosanctions enforcement seems to be targeting illegal workers rather than theiremployers. They see INS operations such as Southpaw as similar to early 1980sOperation Jobs, which removed aliens from jobs that were to be filled by USworkers. The INS apprehended 1.3 million aliens in FY95, up from 1.1 million inFY94, including 525,000 aliens in between October 1994 and November 1995 in theSan Diego sector, and 227,000 in the southern Arizona sector. About half ofthose apprehended were caught at least once before. A review of the mission of the inland California checkpoints, which havecome under fire regularly because of budget considerations, is now beingconducted. The INS is now looking at a plan to open the checkpoint in SanClemente 24 hours a day. Over 30,000 illegal immigrants were captured at theSan Clemente checkpoint in FY 1994. The INS announced at the end of December 1995 that it had deported 52,000illegal aliens, including 32,000 criminal aliens who were finishing US jailsentences. These data do not include aliens who leave the US voluntarily afterbeing apprehended: about 98 percent of the 1.3 million aliens apprehendedannually at the southern border, and about 90 percent of the 20,000 to 30,000aliens apprehended at US work sites, return to their native countriesvoluntarily, without formal deportation proceedings. On January 30, California Governor Pete Wilson had an illegal immigrantdelivered to an INS facility in El Centro, California to protest the refusal ofthe federal government to supply sufficient federal funding for illegalimmigrants. Wilson wants the federal government to take custody of the inmate to "showgood faith" that it will pay for the 20,000 criminal illegal aliens inCalifornia prisons. The INS refused to accept the convicted Mexican drugdealer, saying it is only responsible for holding aliens who are beingdeported, not those serving sentences for crimes committed in the US. California got $33 million in 1994-95 from the federal government to helpoffset what the state claims is a $400 million annual tab for confining illegalaliens. About $30 million is expected in 1995-96. The California State Attorney General filed documents in federal court onJanuary 31 claiming it could exclude illegal aliens from 23 programs rangingfrom state-funded abortion to child abuse prevention. The state is asking thejudge to rule on whether these programs can deny benefits to illegal aliens.The programs were identified as wholly state-funded programs. The federalcourt judge ruled on November 20 that California could legally deny benefits toundocumented immigrants under Prop. 187, if the state could prove that theprograms were wholly state funded. On January 4, 1996, the INS released its report card on asylum reformsimplemented one year earlier. The number of new asylum claims filed fellsharply, from 122,589 in 1994 to 53,255 in 1995. The number of cases handledby the INS more than doubled, to 126,200. INS Commissioner Doris Meisser attributes the drop in asylum applicants tothe reforms that limit the availability of work permits and require applicantsto come in person to an INS office to learn whether their application wasaccepted or rejected. If it is rejected, the asylum applicant is placedimmediately in deportation proceedings. There is a backlog of about 460,000 asylum applications, including about250,000 so-called ABC cases filed by Central Americans, and entitled to specialconsideration because of 1980s policies that denied virtually all claims fromSalvadorans. The Salvadoran government has urged all of its nationals in theUS who can to apply for asylum under the ABC rules so that they can remain inthe US and send remittances to El Salvador (see story below).

The CIR endorsed "Americanization," or immigrants accepting the corecivic culture of the US, and becoming naturalized US citizens. There is no single definition of Americanization, but many of thoseworried about the immigrants arriving today focus on the tendency of manyrecent arrivals not to speak English and not to naturalize. Language in the work place, in schools, and in government has become aflashpoint. In San Francisco, a closely-divided federal appeals court onOctober 5, 1995 struck down Arizona's official English law on a 6-5vote. Arizona is one of 22 states that has made English language the language tobe used exclusively in conducting state business. The Arizona caseinvolved a state insurance worker who challenged the law because, she said, shehad to speak Spanish to her clients, and she wanted to prepare reports inSpanish so that clients could understand her decisions. Her supervisor,however, could not read Spanish. The majority opinion referred to the "importance of establishing acommon bond and a common language [in a] diverse and pluralistic society," butsaid that such a society also requires a "tradition of tolerance." California approved Prop. 63 in 1986, which called for the preservation ofEnglish as the state's "common language," while Arizona's initiative was morespecific, requiring that state and local governments "act in English and in noother language." There is a continuing debate over how fast immigrants and their childrenare learning English, and how to teach them English. A study of immigrantchildren ages five to 14 in 1980 found that, by 1990, the percentage who spokeEnglish well increased from 33 to 70 percent. The USC mobility study, releasedNovember 3, 1995, tracked immigrants who arrived in the 1970s who were countedin both the 1980 and 1990 censuses. One central finding of the study is that non-Latino immigrants who arrivedin the 1970s learned English and increased their incomes faster than Latinoimmigrants. For example, among men 25 to 34 in 1980, the proportion of Asianmen who "spoke English well" rose from 39 percent in 1980 to 53 percent in1990, versus 13 to 21 percent among Latino men. The percentage of Asian menwith incomes below poverty level fell from 17 to six percent, while forLatinos, the poverty rate fell from 21 to 18 percent. The USC study defined assimilation as "adjustment, integration, andadvancement over time," and used five variables as indicators ofassimilation--English proficiency, US citizenship, occupational mobility,average personal income, and poverty rates. A study to be released in February by George Mason University professorsfinds that students first taught in their own language do better than thoseimmersed quickly in English. The researchers found that the most effectiveprogram, which is also the least found in US schools, is two-way immersionclasses where English speaking students and foreign-language speaking studentslearn each other's languages together. Critics of the study say that it is not reflective of what goes on inCalifornia classrooms where native-language instruction keeps students frombecoming proficient in English. In California, there are 1.2 million studentswho do not speak English. One linguistics' professor says that if a student isnot transferred out of bilingual education by sixth or seventh grade will notsucceed academically. In some areas, special schools have been established to teach immigrantchildren. In New York, a $400,000 Newcomers School in the borough of Queens,opened to serve up to 1,000 high school students who have been in the US lessthan one year. The school plans to teach students in their own language and inEnglish, and to provide a variety of services to parents. There are currently 400 students from more than 40 countries enrolled inthe program. Students are placed in classes based on their fluency in English,not by age or nationality. Students are taught primarily in English. The theory is that immigrants have a better chance of learn English andassimilating into American society if they first learn in an educationalsetting that serves their specified needs. Students are expected to beenrolled in the Newcomer School for a year or longer. Critics of the program say that segregating the immigrants may stigmatizethem and that it may violate federal civil rights law. The New York CivilRights Coalition recently filed a complaint with the US Department of Educationagainst Newcomer High because they were basing admission solely on nationalorigin. The New York Times blasted bilingual education in New York City in aneditorial that argued that the practice of teaching foreign-born students intheir native language in all subjects, and offering only one class each day inEnglish, was putting such students in a "prison" from which they will find itdifficult to escape. The number of "limited English proficient" students in New York City hasalmost doubled from 85,000 in 1986-87 to 154,000 in 1993-94. The increase,according to the editorial, came about because a bilingual educationbureaucracy that assigns students to bilingual classes even when their parentsprefer them in regular classes. One University of California-Santa Barbara professor who has studiednewcomer schools says that it is uncertain how effective these type of schoolsare because the students are not tracked after they leave the school. Also,the immigrant-only schools have high profiles and are susceptible to publicbacklash. She says that the schools should be considered transitional and thatstudents should not spend more than one year in them. Economist Lowell Gallaway estimates that households headed by someone whospoke poor or no English in 1989 earned $7,400 less than households headed bysomeone who spoke good English. According to Gallaway, households headed byforeign-born persons received in 1995 on average $5,600 in federal welfareassistance, $200 more than the average $5,400 received by US-born householdheads. The bilingual education studies each vary in their findings, and that isattributed by some to the time frame which the researchers used. The GeorgeMason study had a long term time frame which spanned from elementary school tohigh school. The New York study tried to test whether its students could testout of bilingual education within three years. One finding of the George Mason study was that students family backgroundwas an important factor in academic success. Students with the best-educatedparents and the most schooling before coming to the US did better than thosewhose parents are not as well educated or who had little education in theirnative country.

Thenumber of applications for naturalization is expected to be even larger in 1996because the 1.2 million illegal aliens who became immigrants under the SAWprogram will be eligible to naturalize. In the northwestern US, SAWs areexpected to be half or more of the applicants for naturalization. Mexicans were about 30 percent of the five million foreigners recognized asimmigrants in the past five years and, historically, only 17 percent of Mexicanimmigrants, but 41 percent of all immigrants, have become naturalized UScitizens. There are 2.5 to three million Mexican nationals in the US who could applyto be US citizens. Over half live and work in California, 11 percent are inTexas, and 12 percent are in Florida and Arizona. There is a debate among political observers about the effects of largenumbers of naturalizations on US politics. One view is that manyimmigrants are naturalizing to preserve their access to benefits and inreaction to Prop. 187 in California, and, therefore, the mostnewly-naturalized immigrants can be expected to vote Democratic. Other observers point out, however, that immigrants, especially Latinoimmigrants, live in districts that are already represented by Latino or BlackDemocrats, and that the effect of naturalizations is to increase the number ofvotes in these districts, and perhaps to replace Blacks with Hispanics, but notto change the party representing the district. A federal appeals court in November 1995 ruled that aliens cannot bedeported from the US because of their political activities in the US. Whenseven Palestinians on student visas were arrested in 1987, the INS tried todeport them for membership in a offshoot of the PLO, even though none of theseven had been found guilty of a terrorist act. The appeals court ruled thataliens have the same rights of free speech as US citizens. The State Department announced that the 1996 immigrant visa lottery willpermit up to 55,000 foreigners--almost half from Europe--to apply for USimmigrant status. Applications for the so-called "diversity lottery" will beaccepted between February 12 and March 12, 1996 from all but 11 foreigncountries--only nationals of countries that have sent 50,000 or more immigrantsto the US over the past five years are ineligible. In 1995, some 4.5 million applications for green cards were submitted inthe lottery. Many applicants are illegal aliens living in the US who want to legalizetheir status. When Mayor Giuliani announced his support for immigration onJanuary 30, and praised the lottery, more than 1000 immigrants who understoodthat the INS was giving out greencards descended on INS offices in New YorkCity. The upsurge in naturalization is expected to renew the debate over whetherforeign-born or US born residents are most dependent on welfare. Under theSenate version of welfare reform, the sponsors' income would be attributed toimmigrants applying for federal assistance for five years after arrival and, inthe case of some programs, until the immigrant had worked and paid taxes forten years, even if the immigrant had become a naturalized US citizen. A working paper by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that immigrationdepressed the wages of US-born high school dropouts by as much as four percentduring the 1980s, accounting for about half of the decline in that group's realwages. A recent report by published in the American Journal of Public Health byUCLA public health researchers found that immigrants are more likely to bevictims of homicide than people born in the US. From 1969-1992, immigrantswere victims in 23 percent of homicide in the California, even though theyrepresent only 17 percent of the population. Some researchers think that onepossible reason for the higher risk is that they live in areas marked by highrates of poverty. There are an estimated 2.6 million Americans living overseas, plus 600,000military and government employees and their dependents stationed overseas.About one million Americans live in Mexico, Canada, and the UK, and over100,000 live in each of three other countries: Germany, Israel, andItaly. Increasingly, US companies are using local rather than expatriate workersto save costs. The US State department estimates that it costs about $230,000to station one mid-level American overseas; $60,000 for salary, $75,000 foroperating expenses, and $95,000 for overseas allowances.

The National Association ofManufacturers sued DOL in April 1995 to protest changes in the regulationsgoverning the program, and in October 1995, DOL reissued the changedregulations for comment. NAM and other employers are protesting a regulation that requires thedevelopment of an objective wage system for non-H-1B workers that would enablea third party to calculate actual wages owed to H-1B workers, so that DOL cancheck to determine whether H-1B workers are being paid as much as comparableworkers. High-tech companies such as Microsoft and Motorola want to avoidhaving to establish such a wage system. Under the Senate immigration reform bill, S1394, employers would have topay a fee of 10 percent of the H-1B's annual compensation or $ 10,000,whichever is greater, into an industry-specific training fund to prepare USworkers for the jobs that are being filled by foreigners. There is a great deal of controversy over how easy to make study and workin the US, especially for foreigners post-college education. Many high-techcompanies argue that, since they compete in global labor markets, they needaccess to the global labor market to hire the best and brightest scientists andengineers. Employers are prohibited from firing workers in order to replace them withcheaper labor. However, companies get around the law by out-sourcing--layingoff their own workers, and having the work done by a subcontractor who in turn,hires foreign labor. US workers at Sea-Land Services in New Jersey, for example, claim they werefired and replaced by lower paid foreign workers from the Philippines.Sea-Land says that laid off the US workers and switched to a subcontractor forprogramming services for cost reasons. The US workers were being paid about$50,000 a year. Colorado's ski industry has an estimated 86,000 workers for the Novemberthrough March season, and unskilled hotel, restaurant, and ski operatorworkers, who typically earn $7 per hour or more, are increasingly foreigners.Scarce and expensive housing in the resort areas may be partially toblame--many workers live in trailers that are wall-to-wall mattresses. The United States Department of Labor has certified local shortages of skiinstructors and motel janitors, allowing Colorado resorts to import workers ontemporary visas. The estimated number of illegal aliens in Colorado has grownto about 22,000 in 1995, up from 17,500 in 1992. In December 1995, the INSapprehended 45 illegal workers at 12 businesses in ski country. Some critics fault ski operators for thinking more about million dollarcondos than housing for employees. In December, 1995 there were a record 156homes priced at $1 million or more for sale in Aspen. Richard Estrada, "Misguided Excuses Against Immigration Reform," ChicagoTribune, January 17, 1996.

The report distinguished between countries of origin, transitcountries, and destination countries. According to the report, smuggling fees for transport to the US range from$200 to $300 for Central Americans to $35,000 for Chinese. In most cases, thealien being smuggled pays a small up-front fee, with the balance paid byrelatives already abroad once the alien reaches his destination. Most aliensmuggling rings are ethnically-based, and many who have knowledge of smugglingsee it as a "victimless" crime. The interagency task force report on alien smuggling prompted a review ofestimates of how many aliens are smuggled into the US. Then-CIA director JamesWoolsey testified in 1994 that 100,000 Chinese were illegally smuggled into theUS at a cost of $25,000 to $35,000 each, generating over $3 billion annually.In some cases, the Chinese being smuggled to the US by so-called triads arrivedirectly with false documents; in other cases, they are taken by ship toCentral America, and then come overland to the US. Alien smuggling is not a crime in most of the Central American countriesthrough which Asians transit--many smugglers operate openly as travel agents--so that the worst that happens to smugglers is that the aliens are takenaway. The report says that alien smuggling is facilitated by "staggering levelsof official corruption." Several Central American officials have lost theirjobs for auctioning off consulate jobs in Hong Kong and Taipei, places wherevisas to visit Central American nations are distributed that allow Chinese toleave their country by airplane for Central America. There are believed to be50 gangs, many based in Taiwan, that smuggle Chinese to the US. Two high ranking immigration officials were fired in Uruguay after beingimplicated in smuggling Chinese immigrants to Uruguay and then to Argentina,where they were turned over to employers or pimps. The smuggling networkreceived about $5,000 for each person sent to Argentina. The INS claims that alien smuggling has gotten so lucrative that drugsmugglers have been switching to people smuggling. A University of Bangkokstudy recently reported that alien smuggling generates $3.2 billion annually inThailand alone, a figure based on an estimate of the number of Thai womensmuggled to Japan, Germany and Taiwan for prostitution.

Sam Dillion, "Illegal immigrants urged toremain south of the border," Austin American-Statesman, January 7, 1996. _______________________________ ForeignStudents inUS In April 1993, about 10 percent of US residents holding Bachelor's degreesin science and engineering, and seven percent of non-science and engineeringBAs, were foreign born, as were 23 percent of the science andengineering PhDs, and 12 percent of the non- science and engineeringPhDs. The share of foreign-born PhDs was highest in engineering (40percent), math and computer science (33 percent) and physics, chemistry, andeconomics (31, 26, and 24 percent). About 55 percent of the immigrants withPhDs in science and engineering are naturalized US citizens. Most US residents with PhDs in most major fields of study were born in theUS. Many foreign born scientists were educated abroad and immigrated aftergraduation--one-third of the foreign-born PhDs in science and engineering gottheir doctorates abroad, and then moved to the US to work. In January, a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences concludedafter a ten-month study that the US has too many doctors, and that the majorreason for the excess was the arrival in the US in 1993 of 23,000 doctors whostudied abroad, almost double the 12,000 foreign-trained doctors who arrived in1988. The US' 125 accredited medical schools graduate about 17,500 doctorseach year. The number of doctors in the US has been growing --from 150 per 100,000residents in 1970, to almost 250 per 100,000 today. About one-fourth of the661,000 doctors in the US were born abroad. According to some experts, the reason why more foreign-trained thanUS-trained doctors are enrolled in US hospital residency programs is that theUS government pays hospitals about $150,000 for each doctor in training,regardless of his/her nationality (MN, December 1995). The panel recommendedreducing the number of residency slots, and giving preference to US-traineddoctors for the slots that remain. According to the Institute for International Education, there are about 1.5million students enrolled in institutions of higher education outside theircountry of citizenship around the world, including 450,000 foreign students inthe US. About 60 percent of the foreign students with temporary F-visas in the USare from Asia, and nine of the top 10 counties of origin are Asian. Accordingto IIE, Japan sends more foreign students to the US than any other country,followed by China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, andThailand. The US universities where most foreign students enroll are BostonUniversity, University of Southern California, University of Wisconsin, NewYork University, Ohio State University, and University of Texas. About 60percent are male. According to IIE, about two-thirds of the foreign students in the USfinance their education privately; only one-sixth receive assistance from USinstitutions. IIE reports that only 1.2 percent of the foreign students aresupported primarily by the US government, primarily through the Fulbrightscholarship program. The GAO in November 1995 released a report that said 390,000 foreign-bornstudents received $662 million in Pell grants (maximum $2,400 per year) in1992-93--these students were primarily legal immigrants who can continue tolive in the US. In California, 120,500 immigrants received Pell grants, makingthem one-third of the 369,000 recipients, in New York, 96,300 immigrantrecipients were 26 percent of the 364,000 Pell recipients, and in 30,200immigrants were 16 percent of the 188,000 Pell grant recipients in thestate. The welfare reform bill pending in Congress would require immigrantstudents applying for federal education aid to report the income of theirsponsors, and to assume that the student has access to the sponsors' incomewhen determining eligibility for federal student aid. There have been more stories about the dismal job market for new PhDstudents. Budget problems at many universities and the end of mandatoryretirement has reduced the number of new job openings, and new PhDs desperatefor work have led, by some estimates, to 40 percent of US college courses beingtaught by part-time faculty. The San-Jose Mercury News in December 1995 published a report that accusedthe California State University system of not implementing the section of Prop.187 that requires higher education institutions to deny admission to illegalaliens. There are believed to be at least 1,000 illegal aliens among CSU's325,000 students; CSU said it sent hundreds of letters to suspected illegalalien students, many of whom claim to be California residents to pay $1970resident rather than $8,522 in out of state annual fees.

Soothing the Establishment: TheImpact of Foreign-Born Scientists and Engineers on America: Data Brief 95-15,available from databrief@nsf.gov, or on the world wide web--http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/stats.htm _______________________________ MexicanMaquiladoras Mexico ran a trade surplus of $7.4 billion in 1995, versus a deficit of$18.5 billion in 1994. Exports were $80 billion, including $67 billion ofmanufacturing goods, both from maquiladoras ($30 billion) and fromMexican-owned factories. Maquiladoras buy only about two percent of theircomponents in Mexico. Maquiladoras are foreign-operated assembly plants, most along the USborder, that import components into Mexico, assemble them into products thatrange from televisions to auto parts, and re-export from Mexico the finishedproducts--Mexican taxes are paid only on the value added by Mexican workerassembly activities. The maquiladora sector expanded in 1995 while domestic manufacturingshrank, so that over 3,000 maquiladoras employed 743,000 workers at the end of1995-- maquiladoras now provide about one-in-five Mexican manufacturingjobs. The value of the finished products exported from Mexican maquiladoras wasover $30 billion in 1995, or 34 percent of the total value of Mexican exports,second only to oil. The US in 1994 made a net $3.3 billion in new investment in Mexico,including $2.4 billion in manufacturing. About 40 percent of the new 1994manufacturing investment was in vehicles. In response to US pressures, the US has taken three steps that have theeffect of slowing the implementation of NAFTA--indefinitely postponingcross-border trucking, shifting to a weekly measure of Mexican tomato imports,and defining Florida winter vegetables as an "industry" so that growers therecan more easily petition for relief from injury. Mexico's GDP shrank seven percent in 1995, and inflation was 53 percent.Mexico denied rumors that it was going to raise its 15 percent value-added tax. Borrowers of up to one-third of the loans made in Mexico are not payinginterest on their loans. Mexico has a banking crisis--money was lent forbuildings and other purposes that cannot be repaid, and the cost of rescuingthe banks could be equivalent to 12 percent of Mexican GDP (the Savings andLoan crisis in the US cost about 3.5 percent of the GDP to clean up). The Mexican government expects to phase out subsidies in 1996 that keep theprice of tortillas at about 1.10 pesos per kilogram, or about seven US centsper pound. Mexicans eat about 10 million tons of corn tortillas each year, orabout 200 pounds per person--these tortillas currently cost about $14 peryear. In December 1994, the US and 33 other western Hemisphere nations met inMiami for a Summit of the Americas that ended with a pledge to create a FreeTrade Area of the Americas by 2005. Some 23 working groups have beenestablished to implement the summit's goals. There were year-end protests in several areas of Mexico, with some ruralresidents and members of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution(PRD) protesting several ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)electoral victories in October, 1995. For example, on January 3, 1996, policeevicted campesinos who had occupied the La Gloria ranch on the Pacific coast,arresting about 25 PRD members.

Even though 85 percent of those surveyed wereborn abroad, virtually all said that they speak English well, and 74 percentwere naturalized US citizens. Filipinos are so well integrated in California that there is no Filipinocounterpart to Korea town or Chinatown. Over 90 percent of those polled saidthat they were happy with life in the US. Some 85 percent of the Filipinos polled said that they had close ties tothe Philippines, and two-thirds reported that they sent money to thePhilippines. Remittances are the number one source of foreign exchange for thePhilippines. There were 1.4 million Filipinos counted in the 1990 Census, and theirnumber is expected to reach two million in the year 2000, making Filipinos thelargest Asian group in the US. Over five percent of all immigrants to the USsince 1990--about 250,000 persons--were Filipinos. Korean-Americans in Los Angeles coined the term 1.5er to refer to thoseKorean-born immigrants raised in the US and caught between the first and secondgenerations of Koreans in America. Most are young adults who came to the US aschildren. After the 1992 Los Angeles riots, they became active, speaking upfor their parents whose businesses suffered. Many Koreans fled Los Angeles after the riots for nearby Orange County,doubling the Korean population of around 40,000. Los Angeles County still has400,000 Koreans. The 1.5ers took on the tasks of helping out their community though work incity, county and state government, health care, the legal system and politics.Observers say the 1.5ers are full of passion and intellect. They areeffective because they are bilingual and bisocial, bridging the gap betweenKoreans and Americans. In response to Congressional efforts to reduce legal and illegalimmigration, several Asian groups have formed organizations to lobby againstplans to reduce legal immigration and eliminate slots for extended familymembers. Asians are about four percent of the US population, but almost 40 percentof recent immigrants. Immigration reform would eliminate the 23,400 slots available each year forthe married adult children of US citizens, and the 65,000 slots for thebrothers and sisters of US citizens. About 70 percent of the 260,000 adultchildren, and of the 1.6 million the brothers and sisters, on immigrationwaiting lists are Asians. Many Asian immigrants are well educated, and economically successful in theUS. About 66 percent of recent immigrants from India have a college degree ormore, as do 46 percent of recent Filipino immigrants, and 42 percent of Chineseimmigrants. Their education and earnings, some predict, could make Asianimmigrants formidable players in US politics, as exemplified by the successfulpush to permit many of the 60,000 Chinese students and their family members inthe US in 1989 to become US immigrants in 1992.

The Salvadorangovernment opened 10 offices across the US in the Fall of 1995 to helpSalvadorans apply for asylum in the US. The ABC program began in 1991, when the American Baptist Church charged USauthorities with unfair treatment of political asylum requests from thousandsof Salvadorans and Guatemalans. Salvadorans who applied for TemporaryProtected Status or asylum in the US before 1990 are covered by the ABCsettlement. The Salvadoran government's aim is to "guarantee that all Salvadorans whowant to stay in the United States do so legally and continue working." ElSalvador officials estimate that in 1994, one million Salvadorans in the UnitedStates sent $800 million back to their country, and that the figure could reach$900 million in 1995. Applicants for asylum complete a seven-page form I-589. Under proposedimmigration reforms, asylum applications would have to be filed within 30 daysof arriving in the US. The INS on December 28, 1995 extended the Deferred Enforced Departurestatus, and work authorization, of Salvadorans with ABC status who have appliedfor asylum in the US, until April 30, 1996. The INS has said there will be nofurther extensions. During El Salvador's civil war that ended in 1992, in which 75,000 werekilled, between 800,000 and one million Salvadorans migrated to the US. El Salvador's GDP is $8 billion, and annual imports of $1.2 billion arelargely paid for with remittances--coffee, the number two export after labor,generated $275 million in 1994. In some regions, remittances are 60 percent oflocal income. Salvadoran President Armando Caldero'n Sol is trying to attractmaquiladoras to El Salvador--he says that he would like the country to become"one big duty-free zone." He denounced efforts to boycott retailers in the USwhose products are allegedly made under poor conditions in maquiladoras. In December 1995, US retailer Gap Inc. agreed to renew a contract with theTaiwanese-owned Mandarin International maquila in El Salvador, if Mandarinrehires 330 workers fired in June, 1995 for union activities. Some 45,000 Guatemalans fled to southern Mexico in the 1980s to escapefighting between the army and guerrillas, and 30,000 returned since a 1992agreement between the Guatemalan government and guerrillas. However, some15,000 children--most with dual citizenship--were born in the camps, and theGuatemalan population in southern Mexico is still 30,000. Returning Guatemalans face problems, from continued fighting to the loss ofelectricity to new ideas, such as using Spanish to bridge a multitude of Indianlanguages. As part of the 1992 agreement, the government has bought land forreturning farmers, but inflated land prices have raised from $2,000 to as muchas $20,000 the cost of land needed for subsistence farming.

In 1994, over half of the young foreigners 16 to 18 did not apply forFrench citizenship, the first year the new law went into effect. There wereabout 80,000 foreign youth eligible to apply for citizenship in 1994, and about41,000 did so, and 98 percent of the applications were approved. Only 40percent of those applying were of North African origin--most were of Europeanorigin. The purpose of the law was to promote the integration of foreign youth bymaking them consciously choose French nationality. The Schengen open borders group of nations is expected to be extended toDenmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1996. Iceland and Norway arenot EU members and thus cannot join Schengen, but they have pledged tocooperate with Schengen members to facilitate travel. Many hope that France will remove its border controls with Schengen membercountries on March 25, 1996, the first anniversary of Schengen's border freeimplementation. France has led the search for EU harmonization on immigration issues,persuading EU member nations in November 1995 that persecution bynon-government agents does not entitle a person to asylum in Europe--cynicsasserted that France did not want to offer asylum to Algerians fleeing Islamicterrorists. Similarly, merely belonging to a banned group, such as ananti-cleric organization in Iran, does not entitle a person to asylum--theindividual must show that he or she was personally subject to persecution bythe government. About 309,000 foreigners applied for asylum in the 15-member EU in 1994,when 44,000 persons were recognized as refugees, including some who had appliedbefore 1994, and 56,000 were granted some form of temporary protected status.Temporary protected status is expected to continue to be more common in EUwelfare states because TPS foreigners are not usually eligible for extensivewelfare benefits. In the US and Canada, by contrast, there were 170,000 asylum applications,and 23,000 foreigners were recognized as refugees. The US received 87 percentof the asylum applications, and made 35 percent of North America's positiveasylum decisions. A RPR Gaullist work party, composed of mayors, issued a policy paper onJanuary 25 that recommended that tourist visas should be granted only toforeigners who could show a return ticket upon their arrival in France, be ableto prove that they earned the equivalent of France's minimum wage, have medicalinsurance, and register within 24 hours at the mayor's office. Under these conditions, many visitors to France from Eastern Europe, theformer Soviet Union, and North and West Africa would be barred. The workinggroup proposed that mayors should have the right to make random inspections ofthe accommodations of foreigners, refuse to issue residence certificates insuspect cases, and demand the immediate expulsion of foreigners who violate theconditions of their stay or present a threat to public order. The Council of Europe reported on January 22 that the Paris police lock-upsfor foreigners about to be deported are substandard. The detainees spend alltheir time in cells with no opportunity for outdoor exercise. The French government announced that it would henceforth recognize only onespouse per marriage, thus ending a 1980s policy of tolerating polygamy amongAfrican immigrants. During the 1980s, additional wives were informallyadmitted to France with the argument that immigrants were entitled to "normal"family life. There are an estimated 200,000 people living in polygamousfamilies in France. Eric Raoult, the French urban policy/integration minister, announced plansfor 30 tax free zones to stimulate investment and job creation in suburbanareas with high concentrations of foreign youth. The plans for tax exemptionsand new job creation efforts fulfill President Chirac's 1995 pledge to launch aMarshall Plan for French suburbs, and the government has pledged about FF5billion(about $1 billion). The French government now spends about FF9 billionon its urban policy. According to Raoult, it is urgent that France act--more than 30 cars areburned each evening in the suburbs of France.

The case was unusual because a British home minister explicitly said thatthe reason for deporting the dissident was to preserve the trade relationship.Since 1985, Saudi Arabia and the UK have had an oil-for-arms trade, in which BPand Shell sell about 600,000 barrels of Saudi oil daily, and the proceeds areused by Saudi Arabia to buy mostly British arms. Some 400,000 people areemployed in the British defense industry. A leading Dominican politician said that the deportation could cause civilunrest on the Caribbean island and be blocked by the Parliament. Britain's Trades Union Congress has joined employers in opposing the HomeSecretary's proposal to impose fines and criminal sanctions on employers whoknowingly hire illegal alien workers, arguing that sanctions will exacerbateracism. Criticism from churches and immigrant welfare groups about eliminatingwelfare benefits for up to 13,000 asylum seekers persuaded the Britishgovernment to maintain benefits. Originally planned to take effect on January15, the new rules will not take effect until February 5, and no asylum seekerswill automatically lose benefits on that date. The government will allow continued welfare benefits for those asylumseekers who have appealed against rejection since October. As of February 8,new asylum seekers who fail to make a claim as soon as they arrive on Britishsoil will lose their right to claim benefits. The Labour Party launched a bid to block the new rules on January 23, butthey survived by a vote of 279 to 264. The new rules received support from the all-party Social SecurityCommittee, which says that the number of bogus asylum claims is a seriousproblem. The Home Office estimates that about 70 percent of all asylum claims aremade by people who enter the UK as tourists, students or businessmen. TheBritish government allows 16 percent of asylum seekers "exceptional leave tostay," usually for three years. Prior to 1993, Britain granted asylum to about35 percent of the applicants, but for the past several years only about fourpercent have been granted asylum. A British High Court judge ruled on January 19 that asylum-seekers areentitled to have only one claim considered by immigration authorities beforebeing deported. The ruling came in the case of a Nigerian student who askedfor reconsideration after his case was rejected. The court ruled that the HomeOffice did not need to consider new evidence about oppression in Nigeria, andthe fate of the student's father, who was deported to Nigeria and has not beenheard from since. The lawyers for the student are expected to appeal. On January 22, a Westminster conference entitled "London--A Safe Haven?"examined how the government's proposed changes to immigration control, housingentitlement and social security regulations will affect asylum seekers in thecapital. During the conference, one Opposition MP said that the governmentasylum plan is neither practical nor humane and is an "attempt to put race onthe election agenda." The UN spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has said thatthe proposed British Asylum and Immigration Bill would penalize genuine asylumseekers. A position paper by the UNHCR and sent to the Home Office says thatthe UN recognizes and supports the efforts of governments to streamline theirprocedures and to curtail abuse, but emphasizes that minimum standards ofprocedural fairness must be maintained in the system from determining asylumapplications. It concludes: "UNHCR is concerned that the proposals currently beforeParliament focus on restricting access to asylum procedures in a way that maymake it just as difficult for genuine refugees to enter the process as it wouldfor fraudulent applicants." It goes on to warn that withdrawing welfarebenefits to many asylum seekers "would undoubtedly cause hardship to manygenuine applicants, including vulnerable individuals such as women andchildren." Home Secretary Michael Howard spent three days in Pakistan to talk to thegovernment about trying to stem the flow of Pakistanis seeking political asylumin Britain. More than 2,000 Pakistanis apply for asylum in Britain every year. Cal Mccrystal, "The New Britons," The Guardian, January 28, 1996.

About half of 1995's asylum applications came from twocountries--ex-Yugoslavia (33,000) and Turkey (25,000). German authorities processed 200,000 asylum applications in 1995, andgranted asylum to nine percent or 18,000 applicants. On January 18, ten asylum seekers were killed in a suspected arson attackon a hostel that housed asylum seekers in Luebeck, prompting German PresidentHerzog to assert that stronger action must be taken against anti-foreignmovements to protect foreigners living in Germany. A Lebanese resident has been arrested for setting the fire. There have been 30 foreigners killed in firebombings in Germany since 1990,including five Turks in a 1993 fire bombing in Solingen. A poll of 2,000 Germans found that crime and unemployment topped the listof German concerns, followed by environmental concerns and the extreme right.Fear of "too many foreigners" was ninth on the list of 22 fears. Some 218,000 ethnic Germans resettled in Germany in 1995, down from 223,000in 1994. There were 219,000 Aussiedler in 1993, 231,600 in 1992, 222,000 in1991, and a peak 397,000 in 1990. Virtually all of the 1995 Aussiedler camefrom the ex-USSR. Since July 1990, there has been an annual quota of 225,000 ethnic Germansper year, and those wishing to resettle in Germany must apply outside Germany. There were about 1.8 million ethnic Germans in the ex-USSR in 1991, with 46percent in Kazakhstan, and 44 percent in Russia. Kazakhstan, with 17 millionpeople and a per capita GDP estimated to be $1600 in 1993, is poorer thanRussia, which has 149 million residents, and a per capita GDP of $2,300. In addition, Kazak has been made the official language, a factor thatencourages more ethnic Germans to leave, including some who have moved toRussia--the number of ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan has fallen from about828,000 in 1991 to 614,000 in 1994 . On January 26, Germany announced that in July 1996 it would start sendingthe 320,000 Bosnians who are now tolerated in Germany to Bosnia. The firstwave of about 200,000 people should be repatriated by about the middle of 1997.The UNHCR said that resettlement was premature. About 30,000 of the Bosnians in Germany have applied for asylum. Most ofthe rest have six-month tolerance permits, but up to 40 percent have residencepermits valid for one to two years. The Christian Social Union on January 24 called for cuts in the payments toBosnian refugees and asylum seekers in Germany in order to safeguard theGermany economy. Bosnian refugees in Germany are estimated to cost the stateand local governments between $9 billion to 12 billion per year. Germany declared the fight against unemployment to be the country's toppriority in 1996, after German unemployment reached almost four million or 10percent of the labor force in December 1995, the highest level ever recorded.In the 15-member EU, there are about 17.5 million unemployed workers, a rate of10.6 percent. Germany's auto and steel union, IG Metall, pushed for an "Alliance forJobs" agreement with employers to restrain wage increases in exchange foremployers creating 330,000 new jobs. According to government estimates, eachone percent wage increase costs German employers DM 18 billion, or $12billion. The employers group first recommended the alternative of a lower entrylevel wage and more regional independence from national agreements but, withgovernment promises to lower payroll taxes, a tripartite deal was reached onJanuary 23 that will cut public spending from 50 to 40 percent of GDP and aimto reduce unemployment by two million over the next five years. Workers who are paid less than DM 580 ($400) per month are exempt fromsocial security and unemployment taxes in Germany. There are some 4.5 to sixmillion "580-mark jobs" in Germany, including as many as 1.5 million low-wagejobs in private households, often filled by immigrant women. The US, bycomparison, has about one million persons employed in the occupation of privatehousehold help. Germany had 9.4 million union members in 1995, down from a peak 12 millionin 1991. The DGB operates on 12 percent of the dues of its 17-member unions,and its budget will fall to DM300 million ($200 million) in 1996. IG Metall,with three million members, is the largest union in Germany, and one of thelargest unions in the world. Union chiefs from Britain, Ireland and Germany met in Holland inmid-January to plan a protest at Berlin's many construction sites about harshconditions for foreign workers. The German construction union IG Bau estimatesthat there are 30,000 unemployed German construction workers in the Berlinarea. The German government has been unable to introduce the National PostedWorkers Directive, which would force firms to pay foreign construction workersthe same as locals. A 1993 McKinsey report on productivity in manufacturing found that USoutput per hour worked in 1990 was as high or higher than output per hourworked in Germany in nine key industries, from metal working and steel, whereUS and Germany output measures were equal, to beer, where German productivitywas less than half US levels. The key to high productivity is designing products that are easy tomanufacture, and organizing workplaces to make products efficiently. Thereport recommended that industrial countries open their lagging manufacturingsectors to import competition, and that they set up transplant operationsabroad in sectors with high productivity. In a report said to be typical of how some medium-sized German companiesare coping with slower growth at home, German power engineering firmBalcke-Durr bought an Indian firm to get engineers for DM 10 hourly, versus DM130 or $90 per hour for a German engineer. According to the company,successful international bids for infrastructure costs must be able to doengineering work for less than DM 50 per hour. A study by the Rhineland Westphalian Institute for Economic Researchestimated that guest workers in 1991 paid about DM 30 billion($20 billion) intaxes and insurance contributions, but claimed only DM 14 billion inbenefits.

Hungary has also beensuccessful in attracting foreign investment--$8.5 billion since 1989. One result is that there are a large numbers of Romanians working illegallyin Hungarian agriculture and construction--by some estimates, 50 percent of theworkers in these sectors are illegal aliens. Under pressure from Hungarianunions, the government is trying to crack down on illegal immigration, but thecrackdown is complicated by several factors, including the large informaleconomy --an estimated 40 percent of Hungary's GDP is from the informal sector,and the fact that Romanians can enter Hungary without visas and, if they findjobs, they can usually obtain work permits. Hungary already has employer sanctions laws on the books, but they arerarely enforced, especially in eastern Hungary. The penalty for not obtaininga work permit is a fine which amounts to twice the salary paid to the foreignworker throughout the period that the employer did not have the permit. Thefine is paid into the Hungarian Unemployment Fund. In eastern Hungary, ethnicHungarians from Romania can enter fairly easily, and sometimes friends andrelatives help them to find jobs. Like Germany, Hungary is trying to tackle both the underground economy andillegal immigration. The trick is to bring the underground economy aboveboard, and curb illegal immigration, without further slowing down theeconomy. Between 8,000 to 10,000 Chinese are in Hungary, mostly retailers operatingin 30 markets. In Budapest, there are two major Chinese markets, one of whichhas 1,000 Chinese retailers. The cheap prices of Chinese products make thempopular with Hungarians. One Chinese businessman in Hungary says that 80 percent of the Chineseretailers working in Hungary make between $100,000 to $200,000 a year-- tenreportedly have $2 million annual incomes. The Chinese community has 20 interest associations, established aneducation foundation and opened an elementary school. There are four Chinesebusiness papers in Hungary. An estimated 40,000 Chinese were in Hungary between 1989 and 1990, but thenumber dropped in 1995 because of changes in visa requirements. Hungary's immigration quota for 1996 is 2,000, the same as 1995. In orderto apply for permanent residence status, a foreigner must live in Hungarylegally for at least three years. Last year, only 118 foreigners were grantedpermanent resident status. "Chinese Traders Say Customs Tariffs Are Too High," MTI Econews, January18, 1996.

As one sign of the changed Japanese labor market, in 1990, there were140 jobs available for every 100 persons seeking jobs; today, there are 60 jobsavailable for each 100 applicants. Japan has 3.2 million persons employed in agriculture, 14.6 million inmanufacturing, 15.5 million in services, 14.6 million in trade, and 6.8 millionin construction. Despite rising unemployment and over 60,000 deportations a year, about288,000 foreigners did not leave Japan even though their visas expired in 1995,about the same number as in 1933, a boom year. About 70 percent of theapprehended foreigners had been in Japan one year or more, up from 30 percentin 1990. Most male illegal foreign workers are in construction or factory jobs andmany female illegal workers are hostesses or waitresses. Many of the foreignworkers are used during periods when firms next extra help. For example one employer needed 10 extra workers for one day. He pays abroker 13,000 yen per day for each worker (about $120) and the broker pays theillegal foreign worker 8,000 yen (about $75). Many of the brokers are also theforeign workers' landlords. Japanese firms are beginning to restructure the way that US firms did inthe 1980s, threatening traditions such as lifetime employment and heftybonuses. In Japan, wages are about 70 percent of total pay, bonuses 25percent, and overtime five percent. Bonuses tend to be adjusted to reflect thefirm's profitability. An earthquake relief organization has written a book that details howforeign workers are excluded in Japanese society. The Osaka-base ForeignersEarthquake Information Center was formed after the Kobe earthquake to helpnon-Japanese speaking foreign quake victims. It recommends that Japan treat foreigners as members of the community,rather than viewing them as temporary visitors. The center, re-named theCenter for Multicultural Information and Assistance, is an all-volunteerorganization that assists non-Japanese speaking foreigners. In Iran, two men were arrested for taking $266,000 from 45 Iranians bypromising to get them illegally into Japan. The Iranians paid about $600 eachto be flown to Malaysia, where they were abandoned rather than given thetourist visas for Japan that they expected. A study by the National Police Agency, "Japan's Foreigner Problem andPolicies for Dealing with It," concluded that foreigners, who are nine-tenthsof one percent of the population, are 2.3 percent of the persons arrested forcriminal offenses.

The conference didnot address what to with the millions of overseas workers. The Philippines, host of APEC in 1996, and several other labor exportingnations had hoped that APEC might make a general statement in support of freerlabor mobility, much as the OECD encouraged labor migration in western Europein the 1950s and 1960s. This might have been expressed as pledges to shareinformation on job and worker availability and to protect foreignworkers. However, labor importing nations fearful of massive unskilled immigrationlimited the encouragement of labor migration to "qualified persons," andAustralia explained that it already facilitated such migration. The ministersdiscussed the possibility of future free flows of qualified workers. The Malaysian Human Resources minister came closest to asserting the needfor an APEC-wide labor market when he said that APEC members "must be preparedto facilitate movement of skills and workers across national boundaries."Philippine President Ramos said that such a regional labor market "would bemore conducive both to better protection of workers and to expand opportunitiesfor their gainful employment." There continues to be debate over whether Asia's rapid economic growth overthe past two decades was due more to one-time gains from mobilizing resources,and thus cannot be sustained, or whether it was due to productivity increases.Growth accounting skeptics of the "East Asian Miracle" emphasize the rapidincreases in labor and physical capital in Korea and Taiwan--they argue thatthe miracle was based on perspiration, not productivity.

There are 70 million (Ministry of Agriculture estimate) to 100million (media estimate) people living away from the place where they areregistered, and thus generally unable to obtain subsidized housing andfood. About 70 percent of China's 1.2 billion people live in rural areas, wherehousehold incomes average about $225 per year, versus $425 in urban areas. Anestimated 150 million rural workers--one third of the rural labor force of 450million--is unemployed or underemployed. Most of China's 25 millionconstruction workers are migrants from the countryside. Near Shenzhen, 500 migrant construction workers in December burned thelocal communist party headquarters to protest police harassment. Beginning in1996, persons wishing to leave their registered residence for more than onemonth must obtain a temporary residence permit for their destination; employerswho hire migrants who do not have such permits can be fined 1000 yuan ($120), arelatively small fine for construction workers who earn about $150 permonth. The inequality that prompts migration also fuels social tension. Accordingto the World Bank, the 1978 agricultural reforms lifted 170 million Chineseover the "absolute poverty" line, currently $43 per person per year. But mostof those helped by the agricultural reforms were helped between 1978 and 1984;since then, the rural poor trapped in backwater areas see only one route toopportunity: internal migration. If the government restricts rural-urban migration, there could berebellions in poor areas. According to one Chinese analyst, economicdifferences between the North and South led to the US Civil War, and he urgedthe government to redirect foreign investment away from coastal areas to reducepoverty. There are reported to be three million migrant workers employed inShanghai, a city of 15 million at the mouth of the Yangtze River with 2,000construction sites. At the worksites that employ local and internal migrant workers, there arefrequent clashes between employers and workers. In the first half of 1995,there were about 13,000 labor disputes referred to the arbitration committeesestablished by China's labor law, which went into effect in January 1995. Officials note that many Chinese employers fail to provide workers withcontracts, as required, so that the workers can be fired at will. Some of thedisputes involved sexual harassment and other practices, such as having workerskneel before supervisors as punishment. Most of the investigations of labor disputes involve foreign-owned firms,which account for 44 percent of the jobs in the Beijing area, versus 25 percentfor state-owned firms, and 31 percent for other local entities, such ascollectives. However, over half of the job applicants in Beijing reportedlywant to work for foreign-owned firms because they pay higher wages. Chinese border police captured over 7,000 Chinese who were attempting tomake illegal exits in 1995. The police claim that they caught the majority ofpeople trying to leave from the coastal provinces of Fujian, Shandong andLiaoning. On January 29, China announced new regulations to regulate what it says isan annual influx of 70,000 foreign workers. The foreign, public security,labor and trade ministries outlined a three-step process in which foreignersseeking jobs in China must get work permit prior to being granted work visas.Unskilled foreign workers are banned. China is preparing for the mass movement of 152 million people who returnhome every year for the Lunar New Year, February 19. The Chinese governmenthas urged all regional government to keep at least 60 percent of their migrantworkers in the factories before and after the Spring Festival, to help ease thestrain on transportation. Officials and businessmen say the governmentdirective will be very difficult to enforce. China has demanded that Britain take responsibility of the Vietnamese boatpeople because they have the responsibility to solve the problem created whenthey permitted Hong Kong to become a port of first asylum 16 years ago. TheBritish government says that the problem will become Hong Kong's when authorityis turned over in 1997.

The UNHCR plan launched a funding appeal in Bangkok on January 14 to raise$30 million to carry the Comprehensive Plan of Action to return the Vietnamesein camps to Vietnam. The governments of Vietnam and the Philippines have agreed to a program torepatriate about 2,500 Vietnamese nationals housed in a refugee camp. Startingin March, the Philippine government will start an "orderly return program."The UNHCR, which stopped funding the refugee camp in December, will cover thetransport costs as long as the refugees are returned without resistance.Officials will try to convince the Vietnamese that they should not fearretribution when they are returned to Vietnam, and should thus go voluntarily. In Malaysia, the UNHCR issued passports to about 2,000 Vietnamese illegalimmigrants housed in a Sungai Besi detention center outside Kuala Lumpur. Therepatriation program is expected to be finished by the end of June. The Malaysian government is anxious to repatriate the boat people after ariot on January 18. During the riot, the refugees burned down two livingquarters. One refugee was killed, and 23 people were injured. The incidentbegan after refugees refused to allow a routine police inspection of the camp.Afterwards, the police found a cache of weapons. This was the third riot in ayear at the camp. There are two other plans to dealing with the remaining Vietnamese. The USis seeking to have boat people induced to return to Vietnam, where they wouldbe screened by State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Serviceofficers charged with determining whether the returnees were likely to facepersecution. The second proposal is that of Rep Chris Smith(R-NJ), whopersuaded the House to include funds in a bill to resettle up to 18,000Vietnamese in America. Vietnam says it will stick to its plan to repatriate 3,600 people eachmonth. Vietnam's growth, which was about 9.5 percent in 1995, is strikinglyuneven. In the region around Ho Chi Minh City, growth averaged about 17.5percent from 1990-1993, but in the south central coastal area, the economy grewonly 1.7 percent. Vietnamese economists claim the annual per capita income inHo Chi Minh City is $900, versus $120 in the poorer regions of thecountry.

Their total salaries amounted to about $200 million. By nationality,South Koreans were on top, followed by Japanese, then Taiwanese. The rise ofthe number of Korean workers is attributed to an increase in Korean investmentin Indonesia. Concerned about the number of foreign workers, the Indonesia governmentplans to find out how many skilled Indonesians and professionals are available.The government is also planning increased job training and employment centers. Indonesia and Malaysia have finalized the first official fee structure forIndonesia maids working in Malaysia. Effective January 1, RM2,000 (about $800)is the maximum fee the 900 licensed Malaysian employment agencies can chargeMalaysian employers for a foreign maid. The governments of Indonesia andMalaysia hope the fee structure will stop exploitation of workers in Malaysia.

The South Korean government will permit the entry of 10,000 more foreignworkers in 1996 to ease a labor shortage in manufacturing. The additionalforeign workers will go primarily to companies with less than 50 employees inthe textile and fabricated metals industries. The foreign workers will come from 12 countries, including China, thePhilippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. The Korean Federation of Small Businesseshad asked the government to bring in 30,000 more foreign workers in1996. The Philippines barred 1,000 Filipina brides from leaving for South Koreaon January 23 because government officials were concerned that the brides werebeing tricked and would instead be turned into housemaids. An investigationhas been ordered by the Filipino government. The women were married to their Korean partners in the Philippines byUnification Church Rev. Sun Myun Moon. The Filipino government has bannedmail-order marriages because of complaints of husbands turning them into maidsor prostitutes.

Today, with Hong Kong booming, and many Chinese migrating insearch of jobs, Hong Kong is now becoming the primary destination for Chinesemigrant workers. Hong Kong has labor laws to protect foreign workers, but labor contractorshave devised ways to evade them. Some sub-contractors have won construction jobs with low bids, making theirprofits by paying workers less than the minimum wage. Many workers importedfor jobs also got substandard food and accommodation. Since many migrantsborrow money to pay the labor contractor, they put up with the abusiveconditions until the debt is repaid. Some Chinese construction workers, with two-year contracts, were dismissedearly. Hong Kong law does not allow them to seek alternative employment sothey must leave within two weeks after dismissal. This same law applies tomaids, who have been trying to get the rule amended. There is currently a government investigation into allegations that foreignconstruction workers at the new Hong Kong airport are having illegal deductionsmade from their wages. On January 12, 1995, some 239 mainland workers who werefired from airport construction jobs agreed to accept $5,000 each to end theirdispute. The workers argued that they had bought their jobs for about $30,000each from a subcontractor, and should get this fee back because they wereterminated early. One restaurant worker was paid only half the salary stated in the worker'scontract approved by the labor authorities. The contractor was convictedsupplying false information on an employment contract, and given a one-monthsuspended sentence and $10,000 fine. The worker had been promised $2,500 per month minus food and lodging, butwas paid only $330 per month after deductions. "Labour pains," South China Morning Post, January 13, 1996.

The Philippine government persuaded the UN General Assembly to poll its185-member nations to determine whether the UN should convene a summit meetingon international migration in Manila. However, most of the nations contactedby the UN opposed a migration summit, including the 15-nation EU, which arguedthat international summits are too expensive and that, in any event, there waslittle basis for positive recommendations that could come out of a migrationsummit. In October 1995, the UN decided not to hold a migration summit, but to askthe ILO to coordinate a meeting of UN agencies that deal with migration. As of Fall, 1995, 17 countries had ratified ILO Convention 143 on theprotection of migrant workers, and five signed the UN Convention on migrantworkers. The Turkish president of the International Chamber of Commerce asserted inJanuary that the industrial nations will eventually have to open themselves toworkers from developing nations. According to Rahmi Koc, "if capital isallowed to move freely...labor cannot remain static." Free labor movement,according to Koc, is inevitable. Some believe that migration patterns in the 21st century will be differentfrom those of the 19th and 20th century. In the past, it was easy forunskilled workers to cross the Atlantic and begin anew. In the 21st century,the globalization of business promises to make it easier for professionals tocross borders for temporary or permanent employment, and perhaps harder forunskilled workers to work legally, or to settle, in the richer countries towhich they want to migrate. The 30 fastest-growing "emerging economies" of Latin America, Asia, andEastern Europe are expected to attract about $175 billion in private foreigninvestment in 1996, about the same as 1995. About half of this privateinvestment will be to Asia. Official government and international organizationlending will provide a net $11 billion to these economies. Vasuki Rao, "West must let cheap labor enter borders," Journal of Commerce,January 23, 1996. _______________________________ GulfStatesForeign Workers The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has started to enforce a law which says thatonly foreigners earning 3,000 dirhams monthly or more ($817) and receiving freehousing, or more than 4,000 dirhams without housing, can bring a wife, sonsaged up to 18 years, and unmarried daughters into the UAE. Foreigners earningat least 6,000 dirhams ($1,634) monthly can employ a foreign maid as long asthey pay the government an annual fee equivalent to her annual salary-- maidsmust earn at least 400 dirhams ($110) a month. All foreigners working in the UAE must have a local sponsor. The countryhas eased the rules on the number of foreigners eligible to sponsor residencevisas for their families. For the first time, foreign women professionals cansponsor their families and housemaids. The UAE has about 2.4 million residents, of whom 75 to 80 percent areforeigners. Males outnumber females two to one. Saudi Arabia announced that foreign workers in the kingdom transferredSR38.1 billion in the first nine months of 1995 compared with SR 43.7 billionin the first nine months of 1994. The Saudi government wants to create moreemployment opportunities for its college graduates, especially because of theincrease of 500,000 in labor visas given in 1995. The number of expatriates inthe private sector has doubled in the past five years according to thegovernment. There are now about 6.2 million foreigners from 190 countries inSaudi Arabia. Four million are employed and the remainder are dependents. Kuwait is attempted to reduce the number of foreign employees in governmentfrom the current 46 percent to 35 percent. The Kuwaiti government plans to dothis by returning hiring authority from individual ministries to the EmployeesDiwan, the department in charge of ministry workers. Five years ago theKuwaiti Cabinet decreed that foreigners should occupy only 35 percent ofgovernment jobs, but the country has been unable to meet that goal. Bahrain has a national unemployed rate of 1.8 percent or about 4,409people, out of an estimated work force of 239,000. There are about 130,000foreign workers among 550,000 residents. In January 1996, Bahrain raised its work permit fees for foreigners and thefunds raised will go to job training for nationals. Baluchis from Pakistan andIndians dominate Bahrain's public security force, which is responsible forputting down anti-government protests.

There are also thousands of Bangladeshis in India,many of whom stayed after Pakistan was partitioned in 1971. Some Indianpoliticians consider the Bangladeshis to be illegal immigrants, and want themexpelled. More than 300 Bhutanese refugees demonstrated at the Indian-Nepal border onJanuary 24. The Bhutanese want Indian officials to allow them to proceed totheir homeland to press for democratic reforms and early repatriation for theircountrymen living at camps in Nepal. The protesters also demanded the releaseof 150 refugees detained by Indian police in west Bengal on January 17. Theywere detained after they tried to march to Bhutan through West Bengal fromcamps in Nepal. The protesting refugees had planned to travel through India and into Bhutanto appeal to Bhutan's king to allow them back into the country. Indian policeon January 23 erected barricades on a bridge over the Mechi River, whichdivides Nepal and India, and the marchers subsequently set up camp on theNepalese side of the border. The refugees are staying in Nepal, where they are being assisted by the UNHigh Commissioner for Refugees. Five years ago they were allowed to travelacross India unhindered after they were evicted from their homes. Bhola Rana, "Bhutanese continue Indian border protest, "UPI, January 24,1996.

Monthly LaborReview. Vol 118, No 11. November. This issue presents the BLS's biennial projections. The US in 1994 had alabor force in 1994 of 131 million; the labor force is expected to grow by 16million to 147 million in 2005. In 2005, about 48 percent of US workers areexpected to be women. The 1994 labor force was 77 percent White (median age 38), non-Hispanic, 11percent Black (median age 36), nine percent Hispanic (median age 34), and fourpercent Asian (median age 36). In 2005, the labor force is expected to be 74percent White, non-Hispanic, 11 percent Black, 11 percent Hispanic, and fivepercent Asian. The number of men 25 to 54 working or looking for work isdeclining slightly as some unskilled workers give up the search forjobs. Nonfarm wage and salary employment is expected to increase from 113 millionto 130 million, with 12 million of the 17 million net new jobs in services. In1994, four major US industries employed 83 percent of wage and salaryworkers--services 31 million, wholesale and retail trade, 26 million,government 19 million, and manufacturing, 18 million; about one in six US jobsis in one of the ten largest counties. Among the 127 million US workers assigned to occupations in 1994, therewere 23 million persons in administrative support positions, such assecretaries, insurance processors, and reservation agents; 20 million inservice occupations, from janitors to nursing aides to private guards; 17million professionals, from engineers to social scientists and social workers;17 million operators and laborers, from sewing machine operators to electronicsassemblers; 14 million craft workers, from carpenters to mechanics to butchers;14 million in marketing occupations, such as cashiers and salespersons; 13million managers and executives, and 4 million have agriculturaloccupations. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 1995. The State of theWorld's Refugees. In 1993, UNHCR assumed responsibility for 17 million people around theworld; by the beginning of 1995, that number had grown to more than 27 million,including 14.5 million refugees, defined as persons outside their country ofcitizenship and unable or unwilling to return because of politicalpersecution. The UNHCR also counts 5.4 million "internally displaced people," refugeeswithin their country of citizenship. Founded in 1951, UNHCR is governed by an executive committee made up ofrepresentatives from 50 governments. Most of its $1.1 billion budget in 1994came from voluntary contributions of $1.06 billion in 1994. Jacobsen, David. 1995. Rights Across Borders: Immigration and theDecline of Citizenship. Available from The Johns Hopkins University Press,800-537-5487, fax(410) 516-6998 The admission and exclusion of outsiders is a fundamental expression of howa nation defines itself. Jacobsen argues that government control overimmigration is slipping, and a growing population of foreigners andundocumented immigrants in Western Europe and the United States is raisingquestions about the meaning of national community. Jacobson believes that citizenship has been increasingly devalued, asgovernments extend rights to foreigners, and that international human rightslaw increasingly constrains national actions on immigration. Jacobson arguesthat the ethnic basis of citizenship in Germany, versus its political basis inthe United States, have shaped each country's response to immigrationchallenges.

The INS budget was $1.5 billion in FY93. The INS will hire 500 new Border Patrol agents for the San Diego sector,augmenting the over 1,660 agents already stationed there. The INS will alsolink its fingerprint IDENT system to its case ENFORCE system to more quicklyidentify aliens previously caught. The INS has been fingerprinting all personsapprehended in San Diego since October 1994, and now has 550,000 fingerprintsin its computers. In January 1996, apprehensions along the US-Mexican border were up 66percent from January 1995, to 169,500. About 40 percent of the apprehensionswere in California, 25 percent in Arizona, and 33 percent in Texas. Thelargest increase occurred in Arizona--apprehensions more than doubled betweenJanuary 1995 and January 1996. According to Mexicans attempting to illegally enter the US, the cost ofbeing smuggled to Los Angeles is about $500, up from $200 to $300 in 1994.Many unauthorized Mexicans hope to earn about $1,000 per month in theUS. The INS will more than double the number of workplace inspectors, from 317to 701, and target employers in garment, agriculture, and other industriesknown to employ unauthorized aliens. The program under which employersvoluntarily submit information on newly hired aliens to the INS will beexpanded from 200 to 1,000 employers in the Los Angeles area. Los Angeles has already seen a sharp increase in worksite inspections. OnFebruary 5, the INS arrested 23 suspected illegal aliens in two clothingfactories in eastern Los Angeles, then hit a popular gathering site for daylaborers in the city of Industry. Some aliens were apprehended as they visiteda mobile county health clinic. Some critics worry that more interior inspections will lead todiscrimination against Asians and Latinos. INS Commissioner Doris Meissnersays that the INS is emphasizing border enforcement to prevent illegal aliensfrom entering the US, and targeting only employers who hire illegal aliens.Meissner has said that interior enforcement is a vital part of the illegalimmigration issue and is "critical and importantly linked to borderenforcement." The Mexican government met with top INS officials on February 21 to discusstheir concerns that increased border enforcement could lead to the use ofexcessive force and abuses of the human rights of Mexicans apprehended in theUS. On February 13, 1996, President Clinton signed the executive order thatbars companies that have knowingly hired illegal aliens from receiving federalcontracts for one year. Of the 1,029 employers fined by the INS in FY95, 576committed paperwork violations, and 453 had knowingly hired illegal alienworkers--only the 453 employers would be affected by the new order. Being fined does not automatically mean loss of a federal contract.Instead, the INS notifies the federal agency involved with the contractor, andthe federal agency may--but does not have to-- take the INS violation intoaccount when it decides whether to renew a contract. Many observers expect construction and food service firms working underfederal contracts to be most affected by the executive order. On February 11,20 illegal workers were arrested while helping to construct a new federaloffice building across the street from the INS office in downtownAtlanta. The INS announced that additional funds will be made available to handlethe one million applications from aliens who applied to become US citizens in1995. The INS launched a CITIZENSHIP USA initiative in cities with many of thenaturalization applications, including Los Angeles and New York. A poll of 412 adult Latinos in California released by the Tomas RiveraCenter, found that one-third favored more restrictions on immigration, and 40percent supported the issuance of a national ID card to deter illegalimmigration. Most of those polled support tough measures to deal with crime,yet many mistrust the police. A Roper poll of 1978 adults in December 1995 found that 83 percent ofrespondents wanted fewer immigrants--people were asked whether the estimated1.1 million entries in 1994--800,000 legal and 300,000 illegal-- should bereduced. Some 54 percent said they wanted less than 100,000 immigrants peryear. About 20 percent of those polled wanted to stop immigration, and twopercent favored more immigration. The Christian Science Monitor ran an eight-part series in February aboutlife on the US-Mexican border. The second article explored the impact ofincreased border enforcement on residents in eastern San Diego County. As theINS pushes illegal immigrants toward the remote eastern San Diego County,residents are becoming more passionate about stopping immigration at theborder.

Theimmigration issue will likely increase in importance as the Republicanpresidential candidates woo California voters in the March 26 winner-take-allprimary. Buchanan won the Louisiana primary, came in second to Senator Bob Dole(R-KS) in Iowa, won the New Hampshire primary, and came in second or third inthe next three primaries. Buchanan, campaigning in Arizona in late February,promised to "halt the invasion" over the southern border with a fence andtroops within six months of becoming president. Arizona's population is 20percent Hispanic. Buchanan also promised to push for a five-year moratorium onimmigration--only spouses and children of US citizens would be admitted.Buchanan opposes any kind of financial assistance for illegal aliens, and wantsto make English the official language of the United States. Pundits noted that immigration brings together three GOP issues--crime,illegal behavior, and welfare, and that Buchanan's rhetoric encouraged othercandidates to speak out on immigration. Lamar Alexander in January 1996 in San Francisco proposed that theImmigration and Naturalization Service be replaced with a new branch of thearmed forces to patrol America's borders. In the same statement he said thatthe federal government should pick up the tab for illegal immigrants in statessuch as Florida and California. Bob Dole has promised to increase the size of the US Border Patrol andstreamline deportation procedures. Dole opposes welfare benefits for illegalimmigrants. In an April 1995 interview, Dole said that he thought Prop. 187was a message to Washington that the American people have reached the limits inpaying for illegal immigrants. Steve Forbes, would like to increase legal immigration, and opposes theregistry concept endorsed by the CIR to deal with illegal immigration. In July1987, Forbes asserted that "You cannot be a great power without a largepopulation." Forbes in 1995 wrote that "Legal immigrants have consistentlyprovided the US with energetic workers and entrepreneurs." In 1985, Forbes asserted that the "The American Southwest would suffer adepression without them [illegal aliens]."

One year later, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) unveiled the NCAEproposal as the "Alternative Agricultural Temporary Worker Program" or"Temporary Agricultural Worker Amendments of 1995." Its purpose is "to providea less bureaucratic alternative for the admission of temporary agriculturalworkers." Gallegly's proposal, to be offered as an amendment on the House floor inMarch 1996, would permit growers, labor contractors, or associations wanting toemploy foreign farm workers to file at least 25 days before the job was tobegin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with their state Employment Serviceoffice. The House Agricultural Committee is expected to endorse the Galleglyproposal at a hearing on March 7, 1996. Employer LCAs would have to promise to pay the higher of the localprevailing wage or the minimum wage; spell out working conditions, housing andtransportation arrangements that do not adversely affect local workers; andpromise to give preference to US workers who apply for jobs until five daysbefore work begins. Local ES offices would review these LCAs "only forcompleteness and obvious inaccuracies." Farmers, labor contractors, or employer associations could apply forworkers, and the workers who could be employed under the program could be inthe US or abroad. If the workers were outside the US, growers would submittheir names to INS and consulates abroad, and these named workers would begiven H-2B visas to enter the US at the consulates or at a port of entry.Growers could recruit foreign workers anywhere and in whatever manner theywished. Foreign workers would have to leave the US when their jobs end or besubject to deportation, unless another employer promises to hire them within 14days. To encourage workers to leave the US, 25 percent of the foreign workers'wages would be placed into a federal trust fund, which foreign workers couldreclaim with interest in their country of origin. Program costs would befinanced by contributions equivalent to social security and unemploymentinsurance taxes that would not be paid by growers. No one knows how many foreign workers might be requested under the Galleglyproposal. There are, at most, two million workers employed some time duringthe year for wages on the nation's crop farms, and perhaps one million of themwork six months or more. If 25 percent of the current farm work force consistsof unauthorized workers, and there is a one-for-one substitution between newH-2B and unauthorized workers, then there may be 250,000 to 500,000 foreignworkers admitted under the Gallegly H-2B program each year. If H-2B workers averaged $1,000 per month, then 500,000 workers employedfor an average six months would generate $3 billion in wages, of which $750million would be withheld. The employers who hired these workers wouldcontribute about nine percent of their wages to pay for the administration ofthe program, or about $270 million per year. The NCAE proposal is remarkable for the enormous differences between it andthe current H-2A program. The H-2A requires farm employers wishing to employH-2A temporary foreign workers to take a series of steps to prove that USworkers are not available, and then to offer US and foreign workers housing atno cost, contracts that guarantee work for at least three-fourths of the periodthat the employer asserts workers are needed, and other benefits andprotections. The NCAE proposal, by contrast, extends the procedure used to admit H-1Btemporary foreign professionals to agriculture. Under the H-1B program,employers "attest" that they are paying prevailing wages and satisfying otherconditions so as to have no adverse effects on similar US workers, and then theUS Department of Labor relies on complaints from US workers and other employersto investigate charges that employers are violating their attestations. In February 1996, the agricultural guest worker issue is about where it wasin early 1984. At that time, Congress was considering the legislation thateventually became IRCA, and the major sponsors of the Simpson-Mazzolilegislation, as well as the Reagan administration, were opposed to a specialagricultural program. In June 1984, Congress nonetheless adopted the Panetta-Morrison amendmentthat would have established a free agent guest worker program foragriculture--what the New York Times termed one of the top ten politicalstories of 1984. Then-Senator Pete Wilson (R-CA) persuaded the Senate toapprove a similar free agent program in 1985. Two of the key allies of the growers in 1984-85 still influence immigrationpolicy. Leon Panetta, who led the fight for the growers in the House, isPresident Clinton's chief of staff, and Clinton reportedly assured Californiafarmers in September 1995 that "they would be taken care of" if labor shortagesdeveloped. California Governor Pete Wilson, who led the growers' fight in the Senate,in an August 1995 session with the California Farm Bureau, asserted that he hadnot changed his position since the mid-1980s. The Wilson program would haveallowed foreign farm workers to "float" from farm to farm in the US, andencouraged them to return to Mexico by withholding, according to Wilson,one-third of their wages. Wilson said it has been difficult to sell such a guest worker programbecause of the public tendency to link illegal immigrants and guest workers.Wilson said that, if he were President, he would expand the US Border Patrol toreduce illegal immigration, and push to have a guest worker programinstituted. The rationale for guest workers is that the labor market is not respondingproperly to market signals such as rising wages, or that governmentintervention is needed to prevent market adjustments that would have negativeeffects, such as rising food prices. However, if a new guest worker programbegins before any of these adjustments can be observed, it will never be knownhow easily the farm labor market can adjust to changes in its laborsupply. The Clinton Administration and the House Judiciary Committee opposeGallegly's proposal, arguing it would only lead to more illegal immigration.Fourteen organizations, from the American Friends Service Committee to theUnited Methodist Church sent a letter to House Speaker Gingrich on February 14,1996 opposing the Gallegly's proposal, and the effort to include it in theimmigration bill without hearings on its features. About 60 farm organizations, from the American Farm Bureau Federation tothe Wisconsin Christmas Tree Producers sent a letter to senators andrepresentatives on February 12 to urge the inclusion of the Gallegly proposalin immigration reform legislation.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to take up Sen. Alan Simpson's(R-WY) S. 1394 bill on February 29, and the full House is expected to debatethe Immigration in the National Interest Act HR 2022 of Rep Lamar Smith (R-TX)the week of March 18. The Simpson bill would reduce the number of immigrants admitted foremployer/economic reasons from 140,000 to 90,000, and require US companiesseeking immigrants to fill vacant jobs to pay foreign workers five percent morethan the prevailing wage. In some cases, business would also have to pay thegovernment a fee of $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreigner's salary, which everis higher, to train Americans to fill the jobs. Simpson's bill also modifies the system under which US employers can haveadmitted to the US non-immigrant foreign workers who temporarily fill US jobs.The US Department of Labor says that US employer applications for H-1B workersrose 82 percent between 1992 and 1994. Non-immigrant foreign workers areconcentrated in California and Florida--an estimated 35 percent of the computerprogrammers in Silicon Valley were born abroad. Simpson's bill would cap thenumber of foreign H-1B workers at 65,000. In urging swift passage of his bill, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) asserted that"one-quarter of all federal prisoners are foreign born; ... one- quarter oflegal immigrants are on welfare." The bill has 120 co-sponsors. The Smith bill would enact new penalties for alien smuggling, build atriple fence along 14 miles of Mexican border, streamline asylum, and authorizeanother increase in the Border Patrol. The bill would eliminate immigrationslots for adult brothers and sisters and most adult children of US citizens,while increasing the number of wives and minor children of legal immigrantsallowed in legally each year. Legal immigration would be capped at 595,000 by2002, down from 800,000 in 1995. Businesses prefer the Smith version because it keeps the number ofimmigrants admitted for employer/economic reasons at 135,000 a year, and doesnot impose fees. Most observers expect Congress to approve legislation that, inter alia,step up efforts to reduce illegal immigration by adding more Border Patrolagents and at least experiment with a system under which employers would berequired to check whether newly-hired workers are eligible to work in the US.The number of legal immigrants would be reduced through the elimination ofimmigration slots for adult brothers and sisters of US citizens, offset in partby more immigration slots for the immediate families of immigrants in theUS. Opponents of immigration reform will first attempt to split comprehensiveimmigration bills into legal and illegal components, in the hope that separatebills can be tough on illegal immigration, but not drastically change the legalimmigration system. Senator Simpson and Representative Smith countered effortsto split their bills by arguing that Americans want reductions in BOTH legaland illegal immigration. Welfare. The Senate Immigration Subcommittee on February 6, 1996held a hearing on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) usage by immigrants. SSIis a federal program that provides $25 billion annually in federal benefitsthat average $325 monthly to six million poor persons who are disabled orelderly. Since most US residents have US work experience, they obtain benefitsfrom Social Security rather than SSI. Under immigration law, immigrants coming to the US must prove that theyhave sufficient assets, or a US resident sponsor, so that they will not becomea public charge in the US. In many cases, the US relatives of immigrants signaffidavits that assert that the US resident will provide support for theimmigrant so that the immigrant will not need welfare. Elderly. However, the courts have held that these affidavits ofsupport are not legally binding, so that especially elderly immigrants with fewassets, and no ability to earn a US income, apply for SSI despite theaffidavits signed by their often adult children who promised to supportthem. In testimony February 6, 1996, a Social Security Administration officialtestified that the number of noncitizens receiving SSI increased from 128,000in 1982 to 738,000 in 1994. In 1996, one million resident aliens are expectedto be receiving SSI payments totaling $5 billion, and they are expected toobtain an additional $9 billion in Medicaid payments. US immigration law declares that aliens who become "public charges" withinfive years of entry are deportable unless the reason for their application forwelfare occurred after their arrival. Many welfare programs have a waitingperiod during which newly arrived legal immigrants are not eligible forbenefits--three years for SSI, five years for other programs. Many non-US citizens apply for benefits as soon as this waiting period isup--25 percent of non-citizens receiving SSI applied in their fourth year inthe US. Simpson's bill would extend the period in which legal immigrants could notget SSI and other benefits from three to 10 years, which means sponsors ofimmigrants would have to promise to support their relatives for 10 years aftertheir arrival in the US. Immigrants who received welfare payments for 12months or more in any 60-month period would be subject to deportation. Immigrants can become US citizens after five years, so some proposals inCongress would make aliens ineligible for benefits even if they becamenaturalized US citizens. The US Census reported that, in an average month of 1992, about 34 millionUS residents --13 percent--were receiving benefits under one or more of sevenprograms--AFDC, General Assistance, SSI, Medicaid, Food Stamps, Federal orstate rental assistance, and public housing. In calendar years 1991-92, themedian duration of participation in these assistance programs was eight months,and the average recipient got $436 per month from AFDC/GA, SSI, and FoodStamps. Almost two-thirds of the welfare recipients--20 million US residents--gotassistance in each of the 24 months of 1991-92. About half of these long-termrecipients got Food Stamps. It was reported that the foreign born account for eight percent ofhouseholds on public assistance and, because they tend to have larger families,they receive 14 percent of federal benefits. In California, foreign bornaccount for 21 percent of the households and receive 40 percent of thebenefits. The US Census reported that about 13 percent of the nation's 4.2 millionforeign-born mothers received Food Stamps in 1993, versus 15 percent of the31.5 million US-born mothers. About one-fourth of all Hispanic mothersreceived Food Stamps, versus 13 percent of non-Hispanic mothers. In 1993, 43 percent of refugees in the US received publicassistance. Asylum. One provision of both the House and Senate immigrationreform bills would require foreigners to apply for asylum within 30 days oftheir arrival in the US. Currently, an estimated five percent of asylumapplicants apply within 30 days of their arrival by completing an eight-pageI-589 form. The Clinton Administration opposes the 30-day limit. It argues thatreforms already undertaken--doubling the number of asylum officers who hearclaims to 325--cut the number of new asylum applications in half, to 53,000 in1995, and 95 percent of the new claims filed are dealt with within sixmonths--asylum applicants must wait six months for work permits. Rep. Randy Tate (R-WA) has offered a bill that would make it impossible forany who has tried to illegally enter the US to enter as a legal immigrant. HR2898, the One-Strike-You're-Out Immigration Act of 1996, has been embraced byFAIR, which says that it would give aliens a good reason not to try to enterillegally or overstay their visa.

The US had 16.4 million union members in 1995, andunion members were 15 percent of the labor force. Sweeny has made union organizing a high priority. About 35 percent of USnonfarm workers were union members in 1955, 24 percent in 1979, and 16 percentin 1995. The AFL-CIO pledged to spend $100 million on union organizing in 1996-97,and announced a program under which the AFL-CIO would provide $1 for every $4that its 78-member unions spend on organizing. The AFL-CIO also welcomed backinto the federation the 117,000 National Health and Human Service EmployeesUnion, one of the most aggressive organizers, with 15 full-timeorganizers. The number of strikes involving 1,000 or more workers fell to 32 in 1995,the lowest number in 50 years, and far below the 400 per year of the early1950s and late 1960s. The average duration of strikes has risen to an all-timehigh of 53 days. Several cities and unions are spearheading the organizing campaign.Sweeny's SEIU reportedly spends 30 percent of its budget on organizing, hasorganizers who speak 14 languages, and publishes information in a number ofLatin America and Asian languages. The SEIU's organizing drives among janitorsand health care aides at the end of the 20th century are sometimes compared tothe efforts of manufacturing unions to organize factory workers at thebeginning of the century. The SEIU is targeting health care workers; in many US cities, hospitals arethe largest private employers, and the US health care industry employs ninemillion workers, half as many as US factories. In California, the SEIU istrying to organize the 160,000 home health care aides who, as independentcontractors, assist about 190,000 persons who live at home. The home health care aides have work contracts with the disabledperson whom they assist--the disabled person is their supervisor who signstheir time sheet. The aides are paid $4.25 per hour and receive no benefits orlabor law protections. The SEIU has dues of $7.38 per month deducted from the$300 to $400 that most home health care aides earn. The unions that represent workers in sewing shops, who are oftenimmigrants, merged in the summer of 1995 in UNITE--Union of Needletrades,Industrial, and Textile Employees, a 300,000-member union headed by Jay Mazur.UNITE runs an immigration assistance center and provides language classes formembers. In Texas, most of the small-town garment shops that employed primarilypart-time women to sew garments have closed, with owners and workers blamingeverything from free trade and NAFTA to the failure of the US Department ofLabor to stamp out urban garment sweatshops. The number of apparel jobs in theUS fell to 846,000 in 1995, down more than 10 percent from 945,000 in 1994.Half of the apparel sold in the US is imported. However, many of the unions that immigrants are most likely to come incontact with have been charged with corruption. The Laborers InternationalUnion of North America, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant EmployeesInternational; the International Longshoremen's Association, and theInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters have been charged with beingcorrupt. Los Angeles leads the list of cities in which many unions see newmembers--only about 16 percent of the Los Angeles labor force belongs tounions, versus 27 percent in New York City, and 24 percent in Detroit. Insteadof organizing workers company-by-company, unions hope to use community-basedorganizing--work with churches and other trusted institutions to make immigrantworkers aware of unions. Los Angeles is considered ripe because although itdepends heavily on immigrant workers, who despite former reluctance to joinunions, are now receptive to organized labor. On February 20, the AFL-CIO unveiled its new $35-million Reclaim Americacampaign to get out the vote and to spur voters' support for issues importantto organized labor. Most of the funds will be collected through a special 15cent per member assessment that is expected to be approved at a special unionconvention scheduled for March 25. Unions are leading a drive to increase the minimum wage state by state.The federal minimum wage was last raised in 1991, to $4.25 per hour, althoughsome states, including California raised their minimum wages earlier. Today,about 20 percent of the states have minimum wages higher than $4.25--NewJersey, at $5.05 is the highest. Despite President Clinton's call for a $5.15 minimum wage, the Republicancontrolled Congress is unlikely to act. Thus, unions and other supporters of aminimum wage hike are gathering signatures to put initiatives on the ballots inseven states, including California and Washington, that would raise the minimumwage. The California initiative, for example, would raise the state's minimumwage from $4.25 to $5 in March 1997, and $5.75 in March 1998.

Canadian residents are allowed to sponsor aspouse, fiancé, dependent children, parents and grandparents forimmigration to Canada. New rules prevent residents from sponsoring immigrants if the Canadianresident has received social assistance in the previous 12 months, is inprison, or is facing trial on charges that could lead to deportation. The metropolitan Vancouver area, with 1.8 million residents, is home to300,000 people of Asian origin. In communities such as Richmond, Asians are 30percent of the population. Most of the Asian immigrants are from Hong Kong andTaiwan, and have been attracted to Canada by an immigration policy that favorswealthy immigrants with investment funds. About 50 percent of the 57,000 students in Vancouver's public schools listEnglish as their second language. According to a recent survey by Statistics Canada, immigrants from HongKong invested about $6.5 billion in Canada between 1987 and 1991. BritishColumbia benefited from a tripling of direct investments from Asian countriesand the Pacific Rim is now the major source of foreign investment over the USand the European Union. As 1997 approaches, more Hong Kong residents are expected to move toCanada. The number of immigrants settling in British Columbia quadrupledbetween 1986 and 1994, and the percentage of Asians among these immigrants rosefrom 37 percent to 68 percent.

Central Americans whofail to make it across the border are reportedly turning Tecun Uman, aGuatemalan city of 20,000, into a staging area with more than 20,000transients, coyotes and guides. Getting illegally into Mexico is a lot easier than getting into theUS--usually only a quick trip on a homemade raft across the Suchiate River.But once inside Mexico, non-Mexicans headed for the US reportedly suffer abuseat the hands of the police and criminal gangs. According to one priest: "Thereare more human-rights violations here [Mexico] in one day than there are in ayear in the United States." According to a regional Mexican official, border apprehensions have jumpedfrom 150 a day in January, 1995 to 250 a day in January 1996. The Mexicangovernment claims that any military build-up at the border is for nationaldefense. In mid-February, leaders of the so-called Zapatista rebellion who took overgovernment offices in Chiapas January 1, 1994 agreed to sign an accord with theMexican government that spells out the rights of the 10 million Indians inMexico. The agreement recognizes the right of Indians to "autonomy," whichmeans, inter alia, that Indians can use traditional forms of government intheir communities, and run for office without being members of a formalpolitical party. Mexico's economy shrank by almost seven percent in 1995, and mostforecasters expect two to three percent growth in 1996. Mexico is considering ending tortilla subsidies, which cost 8.5 billionpesos ($1.2 billion) in 1995, as Conasupo paid farmers high prices for corn,and sold the corn at lower prices than it paid to tortilla makers. Onecompany, Maseca or Mission Foods in the US, reportedly receives most of thesesubsidies. It allegedly used its close ties to the government to force aswitch in the way tortillas are made. Instead of boiling corn kernels in waterand lime, and then grinding the pulp into dough (nixtamal), Maseca suppliestortilla makers with corn flour. The tortilla subsidies benefit mostly urban Mexican residents who can buysubsidized tortillas. Mexico's rural poor usually do not buy ready-madetortillas. Mexicans returning home from the US for the holidays in December reportedmany encounters with bandits who robbed them and stole their cars. This,despite a program that increased federal patrols along north-south highwaystraveled by tourists. For years, Mexicans have been victims of bandits, andthey claim they are getting no police assistance because of corruption. The Teamsters Union began running radio ads in January 1996 that urged theUS to maintain the ban on Mexican trucks delivering goods in border states.Cross-border trucking was scheduled to go into effect under NAFTA on December18, but was delayed indefinitely by the US. Mexico says it is prepared to permit US trucks into Mexico, as NAFTAstipulates, but most US experts expect the trucking ban to remain in placeuntil after the November 1996 US election. US companies have complained thatMexico is not letting them invest in Mexican trucking companies, as NAFTAstipulates. Under NAFTA, US companies can own up to 49 percent of Mexicantrucking companies that specialize in international transport--domesticcabotage, or movements of goods within Mexico, remains off limits to foreigninvestment. The Clinton administration reportedly considered not certifying Mexico as acountry making sufficient progress to stop drug smuggling. The US ForeignAssistance Act requires the president to announce by March 1 of each year whichnations will be officially listed, or certified, as cooperating in the effortto halt drug trafficking.

There are 800,000 to one million foreigners working illegally in Argentina.Most are from neighboring countries, including perhaps 500,000 Bolivians, andforeign workers are maids, construction, or agricultural workers. Argentina has a 16 percent unemployment rate, and many experts believe thatthe government is scapegoating immigrants. Some note that only four percent ofthe residents of greater Buenos Aires are foreigners, but 20 percent areinternal migrants desperate for jobs. Many employers prefer to hire workerswho will work outside the social security system--up to one third ofArgentina's employment is outside the social security system. Several high ranking members of Uruguay's immigration service were fired inJanuary for smuggling Chinese immigrants to Argentina.

After Cubans and Haitians set out for the US in the summer of 1994,the US erected a tent city at Guantanamo, on the eastern tip of Cuba, to housesome 29,000 Cubans and 21,000 Haitians who were picked up by the US Coast Guardat sea in Operation Sea Signal. Most of the Haitians were sent home, and mostof the Cubans came to the US. The Guantanamo base maintains materials to house up to 10,000 people infuture emergencies. The Cuban exodus was halted by a US-Cuban agreement that guaranteed Cubansat least 20,000 immigration visas annually, provided Cubans applied inHavana--although the US reported in February 1996 that 280 Cubans have beenintercepted since May 1995 attempting to flee the island on small boats, or toenter the Guantanamo base. The Haitian exodus halted after President Aristidewas returned to power, and the US stood firm on its policy of not admittingHaitians to the US. Under an agreement with Cuba, the Bahamas will return Cuban boat people andCuba will accept them. More than 30,000 Cubans who are detained or living inthe Bahamas will be returned. The conditions and a timeline for the returnedhave not be released. Some of the Haitians and Cubans in the Bahamas wereemployed as low-wage farm workers while there. Cuban President Fidel Castro agreed to lower, in some needy cases, the feeCubans are charged for migrating to the US. Castro agreed to lower fees for1,000 cases immediately and an additional 1,000 cases each year. The fees willbe lowered from $600 to $300 dollars. The migration fees have meant that itcosts up to $900, including airfare to emigrate to the US.

In another blow to Schengen, Spain suspended its participation in theextradition treaty after Belgium freed two alleged Basque terrorists. TheSchengen agreement came into force among six EU nations in March 1995.Currently, only Germany, Portugal, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are operatinga full open borders policy with other Schengen nations. The number of requests for asylum in Europe in 1995 declined. The decreasehas been gradual since 1992, when there was a record 674,000 requests, comparedto only 305,000 in 1994. Britain in the only country in Europe where the number of asylumapplications is still rising. There were 44,000 asylum applications in Britainin 1995, up 12,000 from 1994. The EU in February 1996 postponed plans to make occupational pensionsportable, citing interference with member nations' pension programs.Government-run pension programs are already coordinated, but notemployer-provided supplements, which often exceed government pensions. Germany is considered the major obstacle to EU-wide employer pensions. Topromote loyalty to a firm, Germany "vests" or makes portable pension benefitsonly after 10 years of employment. This discourages worker mobility. Germany argues that there is no need to reduce the vesting period to fiveyears because only two percent of the EU's workers are nationals of one countryemployed in another. Critics counter that it is precisely because of pensionrules such as Germany's that there are so few intra-EU migrant workers.

Bosnians without families in Germany are expected to leave by June 30,1997; other Bosnians are expected to be out of Germany by August 31, 1997.Most of the 70,000 Croatians who fled to Germany have returned. Under German law, the 16 interior ministers have considerable discretion inarranging for the return of Bosnians. There were 12,050 asylum applications in Germany in January 1996, including2,400 each from the ex-Yugoslavia and Turkey. Germany changed its asylum lawand procedures on July 1, 1993, and the number of foreigners applying forasylum in Germany was about 127,000 in 1994 and 1995, down sharply from 322,599 in 1993 and 430,191 in 1992. The chairman of the opposition Social Democrat (SPD), Oskar Lafontaine, wascriticized by the ruling government parties for suggesting in the run-up tostate elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, andSchleswig-Holstein on March 26 that ethnic Germans were overburdening theGerman job market and welfare system. According to Lafontaine, "A millionpeople have come as job-seekers and it's about time to stop this influx,otherwise we'll have 100,000 more unemployed at the end of the year." About two million ethnic Germans have emigrated from the former East Blocto Germany since 1989, and four million ethnic Germans still live in easternEurope and the former Soviet Union. In 1995, some 217,898 ethnic Germansarrived in Germany, down from 222,591 in 1994. Some 100,000 Germans in easternEurope have valid immigration documents that would permit them to move toGermany. The German Parliament on February 9 approved laws aimed at reducing thenumber of foreign workers on German construction sites. The new laws willenforce minimum wage and social security payments for all employees effectiveMarch 1, 1996. Companies found violating the new law could be blacklisted frompublic works contracts. Some construction supervisors predict that the new law will force thousandsof foreign construction workers into the black economy--one German employernoted that the total costs of hiring an illegal foreign worker can be as littleas 5 DM per hour, versus 60 DM to 80 DM per hour for a German. On February 14,1996, German authorities inspected a major construction site in Berlin, takingaway some of the foreign workers for questioning, and promising moreraids. At most construction sites, the foreman is German, the skilled workers areBritish and Irish, the hod-carriers are Portuguese, and the laborers are Poles. European Union officials believe that there is enough support, despiteBritish opposition, to pass an EU law ensuring that EU workers seekingemployment in other EU nations receive the same pay and conditions as localemployees as of the first day they are employed abroad. The four year oldproposal is getting a new look because of complaints of "social dumping" inGerman construction. Under the EU's freedom of services proviso, the company leasing thelow-cost workers is providing a cross-border service to the firm that actuallyemploys the worker. France, the Benelux, and now Germany have national lawsthat require such "seconded" workers to be paid at least the local minimum wagefrom their first day of work--some EU countries want a one to three monthperiod during which workers from other EU nations can be paid less. Under EU voting procedures, Britain must have the support of two otherlarge countries to veto the proposed regulations. On January 30, 1996, Germany announced a 50-point plan to stimulateinvestment and create jobs. Germany in January 1996 had 35 million employedand 4.2 million unemployed workers--10.8 percent of the labor force wasjobless, and one-fourth of those without jobs are 55 or older. To persuadelong-term unemployed workers to accept jobs, assistance payments will bereduced for each year of joblessness. Many companies reportedly lay off older workers so that they can push thecost of older workers onto the government--laying off a worker over 55 coststhe German unemployment/welfare systems an average $150,000, of which theemployer pays less than 10 percent. German workers are eligible to draw statepensions at age 58. There is a great deal of debate over how to create jobs and reducejoblessness. One issue is termination. In the US, a worker who is permanentlylaid off when a plant shuts typically gets one week of severance pay for eachyear of employment--in Germany, the ratio is one month's pay for each year ofemployment, or four times more. When a firm lays off 10 percent or more of its workers, the employer mustwork out a social plan with the plant's workers' council-- a group of electedworkers--and an interest reconciliation, which means that a company closing aplant must try to sell the plant to another buyer to preserve jobs, or give theworkers a chance to buy it. According to some US companies operating in Germany, the cost of "bribing"workers to agree to job cuts discourages US and other foreign investment inGermany. Many employers want Germany to permit five-year and other limited-termcontracts, which would enable employers to dismiss workers after a fixed periodwithout giving a reason or paying severance. Under German law, employers andworkers can agree to one maximum 18 month contract--employers want 24 monthcontracts that could be renewed. About six percent of West Germany's workers,and 12 percent of the East's workers, are on fixed time contracts. Most Germans reject labor market deregulation that, they argue, mightcreate a class of so-called working poor residents in low-wage jobs. There were 226,000 foreigner-owned businesses in Germany in 1993, almostdouble the number in 1988. Half of these foreigner-owned businesses wererestaurants, and Turks owned about one in six foreign-owned businesses. Some four million Germans are receiving social assistance--about one-thirdof them are long-term unemployed. Poverty in Germany is defined as an incomeof less than half the average income of all households. Peter Bild, "Germany bans low-wage foreign builders," UPI, February 9,1996.

The bill will now be considered by the Houseof Lords. Britain may add to its "white list" of nations deemed safe frompolitical persecution Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya--some 3,000 nationals ofthese countries applied for asylum in the UK in 1995. The current list of safe countries includes Bulgaria, Cyprus, India, Ghana,Pakistan, Poland and Romania. Nationals of safe countries can apply for asylumin the UK, but the burden of proof is on them to show that, contrary to thegeneral absence of political persecution, in this case, the applicant waspersecuted. New regulations went into effect on February 5, 1996 that requireapplicants for asylum to apply at the port of entry if they want to obtainwelfare benefits. Applicants whose claims are rejected are not allowed tocollect benefits during the appeal. However, posters in English, Turkish, French and Spanish warning refugeesat Heathrow Airport that they must immediately register or risk being deportedhave been banned by the British Airports Authority as "too political." A judge prevented the implementation of the welfare ban--there will now bea trial on its legality. Another court will decide in mid-February whether theBritish government should be prevented from enforcing the regulations. Thegovernment argues that the burden of proof is on asylum applicants to provethat they deserve refugee status and welfare benefits. In a related ruling, a Court of Appeal ruled that the Westminster housingauthority is under a statutory duty to house nationals from other EU countrieswho entered the UK lawfully to work, have not been told to leave, and who arenow unemployed and homeless. The ruling is expected to be appealed to theHouse of Lords. Saudi dissident Mohammed al-Masari argued before an immigration appealscourt on February 23, 1996 that his life would be in greater risk in Dominica,where the British government plans to deport him, than in Britain. The island nation of Dominica has acknowledged that it agreed to accept theSaudi dissident in exchange for financial aid and a guaranteed market for itsbananas. The number of British unions has fallen from about 500 in the mid-1970s to250 in 1995, and the number of union members fell from a peak 13.5 million in1979 to about nine million today. Unions are strongest in Britain's publicsector--62 percent of public employees in the UK are union members, versus 23percent of private employees. The Conservatives, who have governed the UK since 1979, enacted laws thate.g., required secret postal ballots before unions could call strikes, outlawedsecondary strikes in one company to put pressure on another company, and endedclosed shops, which required workers to be union members before working incertain workplaces. These laws are likely to remain in place if Labour comesto power in the next election, but British unions hope that a new government,plus EU labor legislation, will require employers to formally adopt workplacerepresentation plans.

At the same time, Spain announced a plan to permit aliens who have spent atleast six years in the country on temporary permits to become permanentresidents, a liberalization pushed by unions and immigrant rightsgroups. About one third of the 500,000 immigrants residing in Spain will beeligible for permanent-resident status, which allows them to have theirchildren join them in Spain. Spanish police announced on October 16 that they had broken up a network ofChinese restaurant owners who illegally smuggled 100 Chinese immigrants intothe country over the past four years. The immigrants were flown to Moscow, taken by train to Prague,smuggled across the border from the Czech Republic into Germany, and then takento Spain. The illegal Chinese immigrants would work in restaurants, garmentfactories or in prostitution in conditions of semi-slavery. Thousands of illegal immigrants arrive in Spain each year, paying up to2,000 pounds for a trip from Africa to the southernmost point in Europe, thebeach of Tarifa in Spain. Officials estimate the number of aliens arriving onSpain's southern shores at about 50,000 in 1995. Once an illegal immigrant lands on Spanish soil, he cannot be sent themback to Morocco, because that country refuses boat people who may have embarkedfrom there. Many of the aliens live in tents or hostels, where they are freeto move about the country, but they cannot work.

Under the November 19, 1995 decree, illegal immigrants accused of a crimecan be deported immediately, while other illegal immigrants are served withexpulsion orders that give them 10 days to leave. Immigrants allegedly usethese 10 days to disappear, or to begin endless appeals. Since the new decree was issued, about 2,000 expulsion orders were issued,but, according to the ex-minister, probably no aliens were expelled. In 1995,about 56,000 expulsion orders were issued, and 7,400 aliens wereexpelled. The Italian government can re-issue the decree, or the Parliament can enactit into law. The failure of the Parliament to act is the explanation offeredfor why only 74,400 illegal aliens regularized their status since November 19,1995, when aliens who made social security payments and got letters from theiremployers could become legal immigrants. On February 3, between 10,000 to 30,000 immigrants demonstrated in Romeagainst racism and called for the withdrawal of the November decree.

Employees are constantly being wooed awayto higher-paying jobs, leading to high job turnover. There are currently about 27,000 Ukrainians illegally employed in the CzechRepublic, Ukrainians rank second behind Slovaks. Czech businesses have saidthat once the Czech Republic completes its restructuring, it will turn to theUkraine for guest workers. The Czech Republic and the Ukraine already have a guest worker agreement.In addition to a 12-month pass, the Czech government will introduce three- andsix-month permits for seasonal workers, and project-specific permits foremployees of Ukrainian firms contracted for jobs in the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is considering a change in its citizenship law to removethe requirement that applicants for naturalization have a clean criminal recordfor five years. The Council of Europe and Helsinki Commission criticized Czech citizenshiplaw on February 21 for causing thousands of residents who previously heldCzechoslovak citizenship to become "aliens." Slovakians are consideredforeigners in the new Czech Republic, and many Slovak Romanies living in theCzech Republic are unable to acquire Czech citizenship because they havecriminal records. Many of the Slovakians were labeled criminals by the Czech Republic becausethey had a police file--though the Czech government admits that a police filedid not mean a person collaborated with the secret police. The citizenship lawbans from public office everyone registered in the secret police files,regardless of whether they worked for or cooperated with the secret police. An opinion poll by the state-funded Institute for Public Opinion Researchof 1,022 Czechs found that about one-third do not like other races,particularly Gypsies, Germans, and Vietnamese. More than one quarter of therespondents thought that there should be stricter laws on foreigners visitingand conducting business in the Czech Republic.

The provinces inwhich foreign workers would be allowed include Bangkok, the border regions, andcoastal provinces. If approved by the labor ministry and the cabinet, employers would registertheir foreign workers by paying a Baht 5,000 ($200) deposit per worker, and aBaht 1,000 per worker fee. Foreign workers would have to be paid the Thaiminimum wage. There are an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 mostly illegal foreignworkers in Thailand. A pilot program involving deposits and fees failed because many foreignworkers disappeared, so their employers forfeited their deposits. Some in the government proposed to allow illegal immigrants already in thecountry to register for work with the Employment Division, but the Thaiemployment department director countered that illegal foreign workers should beallowed to work only in provinces with acute labor shortages. Under the recommended plan, illegal immigrants would report to theimmigration police, and then be registered by the labor ministry prior to legalemployment. Work permits would be valid for two years, and could be extended. Employers must register each foreign worker with the employment department,and pay a 5,000 baht guarantee. Employers caught with illegal workers couldface up to three years in jail or a fine of not exceeding 60,000 baht or both.Each employer will be allowed to have a maximum half of his work force consistof registered foreign workers. The Thai government estimates that there at least 330,000 Burmese, 100,000Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi, 100,000 Chinese, and more than 10,000 Khmeror Laotian workers in the country. Brokers are paid between 3,000 to 5,000baht for each migrant they bring to factories in Bangkok. Several Thai labor councils have objected to the foreign workers planbecause it could mean fewer job opportunities for native workers. One memberof Parliament suggested the foreign workers be restricted to industries thatThais avoid, such as fisheries and pig and chicken farms. The Labour and Social Welfare Ministry has agreed to expand from nine to 22the provinces who will be allowed to recruit foreign workers for fishing.Before trawler owners may legally hire foreign workers, the FisheriesDepartment must amend the Fishing Rights Act.

In response, theMalaysian government extended the program until the end of February. The Malaysian government estimates that 40,000 Indonesians have overstayedtheir visas. Under Ops Check-Out, these Indonesians can pay a fine of RM 1,000or $400 for entering the country illegally or staying without proper permits(the normal penalty is RM 3,000); pay for the return trip home; and befingerprinted--they can then leave Malaysia legally. The government admitted that many Indonesians may not have signed up forfear of being unable to return to Malaysia later due to the finger-printingrequirement. In early February, police in Kuala Lumpur detained 1,600 foreignerssuspected of being illegally in the country. The government announced that a total of 608,000 foreigners were registeredwith the Immigration Department in early 1996-- 249,185 Indonesian nationals,79,688 Bangladeshis, 1,999 Pakistanis, 21,870 Thais, 26,049 Filipinos and229,431 other nationals. The three major sectors of legal foreignersemployment were plantations, with 180,688 foreigners, manufacturing 177,252,and maids, 117,203. The Malaysian Cabinet approved a fee structure for Indonesian maids. Underthe new agreement with Indonesia, maids will pay RM 300 ($115) there for"training" before their departure for Malaysia. If Indonesian recruiters attempt to pass this fee onto Malaysian householdsthat employ them, the government may expand the source counties of maids fromthe current Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand to also include Sri Lankaand Bangladesh. Malaysian households already pay a fee of RM 1,870 to the Malaysiangovernment to receive permission to hire foreign maids, plus RM 500 to aMalaysian recruitment agency to find them a foreign maid. Indonesian maidswill have to pay RM 1,083 to recruitment agencies in Jakarta for placement feesand services such as documentation, health examination, training, visa andtransportation. Indonesian maids must be paid a minimum RM 350 ($135) per month inMalaysia, or RM 450 if they have experience. The Philippines requires Filipinamaids to be paid a minimum RM 500 ($190) per month. The Malaysian government changed their policy of not granting work permitsto the spouses of foreign workers. In granting work permits to spouses, thegovernment argued that the foreign spouses are already at home in Malaysia andthat it would be better than employing "strangers." In an effort to eliminate the need for foreign workers at gas (petro)stations, the first phase of installing 514 self service stations will becompleted in January, 1997. The approximately 5,000 foreign workers nowemployed as petrol kiosk attendants will lose their jobs. A 1995 report by a non-governmental organization called Tenaganitacriticized the detention camps that hold illegal foreign workers as"concentration camps." The report detailed physical abuse, poor food andsanitation and a lack of medical care. The government admitted that 40 foreignworkers died in the camps in 1995. Since the report, doctors visit the campsweekly, and water is available all the time. "Only 5,000 Indons responded to check out offer," New Straits Times,February 22, 1996.

Taiwan's unemployment rate is expected torise to 2.5 percent in 1996, prompting the government to slow down the entry offoreigners. A union official asserted that, in the six years since Taiwan permitted theentry of foreign workers, some 450,000 have arrived or received approval towork in Taiwan. Some of the foreign workers have already departed, as havesome of the 90,000 illegal aliens. Some 18,000 foreign workers were reported to have abandoned theircontracts, and 6,600 were apprehended. Between January and October 1995, 390foreign workers were arrested by police on criminal charges. The Council of Labor Affairs has decided to allow some legal foreignworkers who lose jobs because of plant shutdowns to change jobs; they will beallowed to go to work for affiliated companies who have received permission tohire foreign workers, but have not yet brought them to Taiwan. The Taipei city government is proposing stiffer penalties for employers whohire illegal immigrants. Officials estimate that nearly 11,800 legitimatelyhired foreign workers have fled their jobs and overstayed their visas inTaiwan. There are an additional 18,000 foreign workers in Taiwan.

Unexpectedly, in 1995, emigration dropped to itslowest level in six years. In 1995, 43,000 people left the British colony,compared to 62,000 in 1994. Some officials predict the emigration in 1996 will be only slightly higherthan in 1995. Other experts predict that the number of people emigrating fromHong Kong will reach 90,000 to 100,000 in 1996, and may reach 200,000 by July1, 1997, versus 43,000 in 1995 and 62,000 in 1994. An estimated 10 percent of Hong Kong's 6.3 million residents could leave,i.e., up to 600,000 have foreign passports. Hong Kong's population rose by160,000 in 1995, in part because of the immigration of 150 mainland Chineseeach day and more births than deaths. An increase in foreign domestic helpersand Hong Kong returnees also contributed to the rise. Pregnant mainland Chinese women come to Hong Kong to have their babies; in1995, about 240 babies were born to "illegal mainlanders" each month. TheChinese women hope that their children, by being born in Hong Kong, will have abetter chance of gaining residency there. The Chinese government has announced that it will no longer give permits topregnant women to enter Shenzhen's Shatoujiao restricted zone, from where mostof the women cross to Hong Kong. The women wait until birth is imminent, crossthe border, and run to the nearby fire station. The firemen are obligated totake the women to the hospital. After birth, most of the women are repatriated to China, leaving theirnewborns with their Hong Kong resident fathers. Once in China, they can applyfor permits to return, but most must wait 10, 20 or 40 years to rejoin theirfamily. Some mothers are allowed back into Hong Kong temporarily on visitorsvisas. One Hong Kong judge has said he will try to stop the incarceration ofpregnant illegal immigrants because he does not feel it is proper for thebabies to be kept in prison with their mothers. The head of the Illegal Immigrant Control Center in Hong Kong reports thatsnakeheads, who have been smuggling CD-Roms, computer software and drugsbetween Hong Kong and China, are now smuggling pregnant women into HongKong. A survey by the Hong Kong Association for Continuing Education gives poormarks to education courses designed to help mainland Chinese children integrateinto Hong Kong society. The association surveyed 50 voluntary agencies thatprovided newly-arrived mainland children with four to six week English courses. More than 90 percent of the 535 replies from parents, students andteachers, said the courses did not offer age and ability-appropriate education.Many children complained that it they had to search for a school that wouldtake them--some were rejected by up to 20 schools.

Most workers pay farmore for foreign jobs--the going rate for going to Hong Kong as a maid is25,000 pesos, and 60,000 pesos for a job in Taiwan. The Philippines is also considering exempting maids working abroad frompaying Philippine income taxes. With workers in over 40 countries, manyFilipinos abroad learn that they must pay income taxes on their earnings bothto their host country and to the Philippines. After returning forcibly on February 14, 1996 at least one of 84 Vietnamesefrom a camp that opened in 1978, the Philippines reversed course and announcedthat the last of the 2,700 Vietnamese in the country who refused to returncould stay in the country. There are still 36,000 Vietnamese in camps aroundsoutheast Asia, and in January 1996, the Philippines agreed with Hong Kong,Malaysia, and Thailand to return the remaining Vietnamese in 1996. The Philippines reportedly reverse course under pressure from the Catholicchurch. Edward Luce, "Philippines to let boat people stay," Financial Times,February 16, 1996. C.

Uganda became an economic backwater--its 18 million people in 1995 had an annual per capita income of lessthan $200. In 1990, Asians were allowed to return or file claims for their lostassets, and 7,000 have returned, investing perhaps $500 million of the $2billion in foreign investment in Uganda over the past five years. Kenya in November, 1995 swept hotels and other housing in Nairobi anddetained foreigners who allegedly were in the country illegally. Kenyaannounced that many illegal foreigners were involved in criminalactivities. Men who migrate from interior areas of the sub-Sahara to coastal cities forwork are bringing AIDS home. In many villages of Niger and Burkina Faso, whereup to 80 percent of the working age males migrate to Abidjan, Accra, Lome, andLagos, and polygamy is common, AIDS is believed to be spread from the coastalcities to the interior by migrants. Zaire in February stepped up the pressure on Rwandans living in 40 camps inZaire to return to Rwanda. The Kibumba camp, with 190,000 Rwandans, was closedin mid-February when Zairian troops surrounded it to put economic pressure onRwandans to return. The Hutu camps in Zaire were established 19 months ago, and have sincedeveloped extraordinarily sophisticated markets, according to refugeeofficials. For example a 1995 survey of four camps in Goma found 82,000businesses, including 2,300 bars and 450 restaurants, sometimes stocked withwar booty brought from Rwanda for what Hutu leaders thought might be a longexile. Zairian authorities have closed the Hutu businesses, on the groundsthat they do not pay local taxes. At the request of Mozambique, the South African Cabinet on February 21,1996 agreed to grant an amnesty to illegal immigrants from Southern AfricanDevelopment Community countries if they have been in South Africa for fiveyears. Illegal aliens from Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia and theisland of Mauritius who have been in South Africa for five years, had a formalor informal job, or a relationship with a South African spouse or child, couldreceive permission to stay. South Africa repatriated 72,000 people to Mozambique in 1994. There are an estimated three million illegal immigrants are in South Africaand the government contends that they are creating a problem with cross-borderdrug dealings. South Africa and Botswana deported more than 24,000 Zimbabweans betweenJanuary and November, 1995. According to South African police, most of theillegal immigrants were searching for employment, while some were trying toescape the police. "S.

Half of the 51,000 permits for foreign construction workers willbe renewed for the first six months of the year and the other half will beextended until the end of 1996. The Israeli Employment Service plans to studyif the continued employment of so many foreign workers is justified. Israel's Labor and Social Affairs Minister has announced a plan to tightenthe criteria for importing workers from the Philippines and to crack down onpeople who illegally employ them after repeated complaints of abuse. Theaction was taken after a sharp rise the number of requests for workers inDecember 1995. There were 930 requests instead of the average of 150 in 1994.The ministry has seen a gradual increase in monthly requests for Filipinoworkers who care for invalids. At the current rate, their number could exceed12,000 a year. An Israeli government document said that there are 100,000 foreignersworking illegally in Israel. This number does not include Palestinians for theWest Bank or Gaza who are working in Israel without permission. The InteriorMinistry has decided to issue newly licensed foreign workers with a specialidentity card. Israel received 77,000 immigrants in 1995, down from 80,000 in 1994--22,750from Ukraine and 19,500 from Russia. Some 609,000 people moved to Israel from the former Soviet Union sinceMoscow changed its emigration policies in 1989. There are about 13 millionJews worldwide; half are in North America.

Since lateSeptember, 1995, Col. Mohammar Qaddafi began expelling several hundredforeigners each week. His aim is to expel one million people. Qaddafi hopes to replace the foreigners with unemployed Libyans--theunemployment rate among them is about 30 percent. After expelling 30,000Palestinians, Qaddafi relented and allowed the remainder to stay. About 8,000Iraqi teachers were brought in to replace the Palestinian teachers who wereforced to leave. Africans in Libya continue to be expelled. About 70,000 of the 500,000Sudanese in Libya have left, as have 5,000 to 10,000 Egyptians. About 10,000Mauritanians were threatened with expulsion when their government talked toIsrael. On January 18, 186 Eritreans were expelled, and in February, 154 Ethiopiansleft Libya. A Libyan government official reported that over 335,000 foreigners weresent home in 1995. Of those, 200,000 were deported--the remainder leftvoluntarily.

Howard losthis party's leadership in 1989, in part because of a 1987 speech that asserted"too many" Asian immigrants were coming to Australia. Australia anticipates 83,000 immigrants in the year ending June 30, 1996.Over half of these immigrants are not from the UK, and an increasing percentageare from Asian countries. If elected, Howard promised to spend ($40 million)on English-language training and other programs to integrate immigrants. Labor Party MP Graeme Campbell, who lost his party's endorsement due to hiscriticism of the government's policies on immigration, has threatened to run asan independent on an anti-immigrant platform in Australia's upcomingelections. One Australian researcher says that Australians are beginning to see theeconomic impact of the migration policies, and that this will bring the issueof race to the forefront. A group of 38 Chinese boat people who arrived in Australia as illegalimmigrants have rejected an offer by the government to settle out of court.They will press ahead with their claim that they were held for 418 days longerthan the 273-day limit for a decision to be made under the Migration Act.

Foreigners repatriated up to$13 billion in wages in 1995. Currently, non-Gulf Arabs are not permitted totrade in the Saudi stock market or buy property, but they can invest in mutualfunds through Saudi banks. There are more than six million foreigners amongthe 17.9 million Saudi population. Kuwait's Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs is considering limiting theterm of residency permits for expatriate workers to one year. Under currentlaw, residency permits for workers are issued for two to four years. The aimof the one-year permit would be to cut back on illegal visa trading and papercompanies set up only for labor recruitment purposes. The proposed residencylimit would not apply to foreign employees in the government sector or tomaids. Kuwait issued over 800,000 visas to foreign workers in 1995. About 1,000 foreign workers will be fired by the Kuwait Post Authority inthe next three months as it tries to increase profitability. Most of theforeign workers are Arabs and Asians employed as clerks. Since November 1994, Shia Muslims in Bahrain have protested the policies ofthe Sunni-led government. The official unemployment rate is 1.8 percent, butindependent analysts claim the figure is closed to 10 to 15 percent, with mostof the unemployed from the Shi'ite Muslim village communities. Bahrain is trying to increase the number of nationals with jobs by offeringtraining at special skills classes and offering preferential treatment forgovernment contracts to companies which have better rates of employment fornationals.

International Labor migration of AsianWomen: Distinctive Characteristics and Policy Concerns. Geneva: ILO. This report says that some 800,000 Asian women leave their country ofnationality for foreign jobs each year, and that they stay abroad an averagetwo years, so that about 1.5 million mostly Indonesian, Filipina, Sri Lankan,and Thai women are employed as maids and entertainers in Asia and the MiddleEast. In some labor-importing countries, half of the Asian women are workingillegally. The report places much of the blame for the migration of women, and theconditions in which they live and work, on labor contractors and brokers, whoare involved in the migration of 90 percent of all Asian women: "Were it notfor illegal recruitment agencies...Asian labor migration would not have reachsuch a massive scale." The majority of women migrating for jobs from Indonesiaand Sri Lanka do so illegally. However, sending countries can do little to police labor brokers--thereport says that governments in immigration countries must enforce THEIR laborlaws to protect female migrants.

ISSN 1081-9916 _______________________________ NORTHAMERICA _______________________________ CongressMoves to Curb IllegalImmigration Congress in March took up proposals by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)--S S269 andS1394, and Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX)--HR2202, the Immigration in theNational Interest Act--to deal with legal and illegal immigration. On March 21, the House approved the part of the Smith bill that seeks to reduceillegal immigration on March 21,1996 by a vote of 333-87. However, the Housevoted 238-183 to drop the reductions and changes in the legal immigrationsystem proposed in the bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee on March 28 voted 13-4 to send bills to the fullSenate for consideration April 15-17 that would deal with both legal andillegal immigration. The legal bill is the opposite of Simpson's originalproposal--it would INCREASE the number of visas available to unify families to500,000 per year, and not impose fees on US employers who want to admitimmigrants to fill US jobs. Opponents of the proposed reductions in legal immigration split thecomprehensive bill into legal and illegal components, under the theory thatthere are more votes in Congress to reduce illegal than legal immigration. In June 1995, the Clinton administration endorsed the Jordan Commissionrecommendation that legal immigration be reduced from about 800,000 in FY94 to550,000 per year, with the temporary addition of 150,000 visas per year toclear the backlog of spouses and children of legal immigrants waiting to joinfamily members in the US. Despite that endorsement, the Clinton administration supported the division ofthe immigration bill, probably ensuring that the legal immigration system willnot be changed in 1996. House. The House began consideration of its comprehensive reform oflegal and illegal immigration on March 18, 1996, and on March 21 approved thepart of the bill that aims to reduce illegal immigration by a vote of 333-87. One of the first amendments offered was to split the bill into separate legaland illegal components, as the Senate Judiciary Committee had done on March 14.The House vote to split the bill was 238-137--an "unusual coalition" ofPresident Clinton, liberals and ethnic advocates, high-tech businesses,libertarians, and the religious groups including the Christian Coalitionopposed reductions in legal immigration--many of these groups opposedimmigration reform in 1986. The bill approved by the House would beef-up-the-border bill and add new barsto access by illegal aliens to education and welfare. The bill as approvedwould double the Border Patrol from 5,000 to 10,000 agents by the year 2000,authorize the construction of a 14-mile triple fence on the US-Mexican bordersouth of San Diego, and set up a five-state pilot project that permitsemployers to verify the work eligibility of all new hires by checking acomputer data base. The House rejected the Smith bill's effort to make SocialSecurity cards more counterfeit-resistant by 1999. The House also approved, 257-163, with Speaker Gingrich's support, a so-called"Proposition 187" amendment that permits states to deny public education toillegal alien children, and to prohibit states from offering federally financedwelfare benefits to illegal aliens. Parents who are illegal aliens could notapply for welfare assistance for their US-born and thus US-citizen children.US-born children of illegal alien parents could still get AFDC and Food Stamps,but a third party would have to apply for such benefits on behalf of thechildren. Many experts believe that, if Congress approves the denial of free publiceducation to unauthorized children, the US Supreme Court will reverse the 5 to4 Plyler vs Doe decision in 1982 that found unconstitutional a 1975 Texas lawthat kept unauthorized children out of school. In the Plyler decision, theSupreme Court acknowledged that education was not a "fundamental right," butthe majority decision emphasized that Texas provided no evidence "suggestingthat illegal entrants impose any significant burden on the state's economy." California asserts that about five percent or 350,000 children in K-12 schoolsare unauthorized, and that their education costs $1.8 billion per year. To cut down on the use of false documents, the bill reduces from 29 to six thedocuments that workers can present to employers to prove their legal status,and treats document forgers as harshly as money counterfeiters. The approvedbill permits the imposition of fines of $50 to $250 on people caught inside theUS illegally, and permits state and local law enforcement officials to detainillegal aliens until the INS can take custody of them. The House on March 21 rejected by a 242-180 vote an effort by growers to launcha new guest worker program. On March 5, 1996 the House Agriculture Committeeapproved 25 to 14 an amendment by Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA) to the Houseimmigration bill that would grant temporary work visas to 250,000 foreign farmworkers, with the ceiling to be reduced by 25,000 each year. The existingtemporary farm worker program admitted about 17,000 H-2A workers in 1995. There are about two million workers employed at some time during a typical yearon the nation's crop farms, and a DOL survey estimates that 25 percent may beunauthorized. Under the Pombo proposal, growers, labor contractors, or associations wantingto employ foreign farm workers would have had to file at least 25 days beforethe job was to begin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with their stateEmployment Service office listing the number of foreigners requested and whenwork was to begin. Local ES offices would review these LCAs "only forcompleteness and obvious inaccuracies" within seven days after they are filed.Employers violating their attestations or program rules can be assessed civilmoney penalties, and be debarred from the program. Under the rejected plan, 25 percent of the foreign workers' wages would beplaced into a federal trust fund managed by the INS, which foreign workerscould reclaim with interest in their country of origin. Foreign workers wouldbe limited to a maximum two years in the US. Program costs would be financedby employer contributions equivalent to Social Security and unemploymentinsurance taxes that would not be paid by growers. The guest worker program would sunset after three years if Congress fails tore-authorize the pilot five-state telephone verification system that the Smithbill establishes to make it easier for employers to determine whether workersare presenting false documents. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) argued against the guest worker program: "once youadmit hundreds of thousands of people like this, why not just pull the BorderPatrol off the border and let people in?" The Clinton administration opposedthe program for fear that it would increase illegal immigration, reduce jobopportunities for US workers, and depress wage and work standards for USworkers. The Clinton administration also believes that the current H-2Aprogram is sufficient for businesses that are experiencing labor shortages. After the House Agriculture Committee vote, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich andUS Attorney General Janet Reno wrote to Senate Judiciary chairman Orin Hatch(R-Utah) that they would "strongly recommend" a veto of the entire immigrationlegislation if it included temporary foreign farm worker provisions foragriculture. On March 20, the House voted 221-191 to split the Smith bill and to deal onlywith illegal immigration. To reduce legal immigration, both the Senate and House bills would haveeliminated immigration slots for relatives such as adult sons and daughters andadult brothers and sisters of US citizens, but added slots for five years toexpedite the unification of nuclear families of legal US immigrants. Some850,000 of the 1.1 million foreigners waiting to enter the US to join legalimmigrant fathers or mothers are the families of persons legalized in 1987-88.Half of these spouses and children are believed to be already in the US withtheir families. The bill approved by the House requires Americans who wish to sponsor animmigrant to earn at least twice the poverty level income. This means that therequirement will double from the $14,800 for a family of four required in 1993.The bill also makes legally binding sponsors' agreements to assume financialresponsibility for the immigrants they bring to the US. One of the most contentious issues in Smith's legal immigration reform bill iswhether to eliminate immigration visas for the adult brothers and sisters andadult sons and daughters of US citizens. Among the arguments for doing awaywith these categories is that most such siblings are adults with families,whose immigration therefore sets off chain migration. A GAO study released in March 1996 concluded that chain migration occurs, butnot soon after immigrants naturalize. According to the GAO, an average 12years elapsed between the time an immigrant enters, and the date the immigrantpetitions for the entry of relatives. The Smith bill would require adult children wishing to bring their elderlyparents to the US to provide health insurance for them. Senate. When the Senate Judiciary Committee met to consider the Simpsonbill on February 29, 10 of 18 senators were prepared to vote to split the billinto legal and illegal components. Simpson delayed consideration of the billfor one week, and then dropped a proposal to reduce the number of immigrantsadmitted for economic/employment reasons each year from the current 140,000 to90,000--there were 93,000 admissions of workers and their dependents foreconomic/employment reasons in FY95. On March 14, the Senate Judiciary Committee nonetheless voted 12 to six tosplit Simpson's bill into legal and illegal components, and approved amendmentsthat would keep fines against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens atcurrent levels, rather than increase them as Simpson proposed-- first offensescurrently can result in civil money penalties (CMP's) of $2,000 per worker.The committee also voted to eliminate the requirement that employers caughtrepeatedly hiring illegal workers could have their property seized. Simpson also dropped a plan to require US employers wanting permanentimmigrants to pay the greater of $10,000 or 10 percent of the first year'ssalary into a fund that would be used to train US workers to fill similar jobvacancies in the future, as well as a plan to prohibit US employers fromdismissing US workers and hiring temporary foreign workers to replace them.The bill as approved would prohibit US employers from applying for a temporaryforeign worker if they have laid off a U.S. worker with the same skills in theprevious six months. US high technology companies and Jack Kemp, co-director of Empower America, ledthe fight against Simpson's proposed fees. A report entitled "Employment-BasedImmigration and High Technology" argued that immigrants admitted permanently tofill vacant US jobs provide "extraordinary benefits" to the US. The reportpredicted that new restrictions on employment-based visas would "drive morecompanies to locate research and development offshore, and will lead to lessinnovation, a less dynamic economy, and fewer jobs produced in the cutting edgeindustries of tomorrow." The CEOs of Silicon Valley companies weighed in with assertions that theircompanies have unfilled vacancies for engineers, and that the immigrants ontheir staffs are necessary to create good jobs for US workers. INS data indicate that most of the visas granted to immigrants on employmentgrounds go to technicians with two years of training, not to persons with"extraordinary ability" or to "outstanding professors and researchers." In 1994, about 123,000 permanent immigration visas were issued foreconomic/employment reasons. About half--60,000-- of these visas went to thespouses and dependents of the "needed workers"--only 40,000 visas went toworkers, including 4,000 to "unskilled workers." Another 22,000 visas went toChinese students who were studying in the US when the Tiananmen Square massacreoccurred in 1989. Foreigners are admitted for employment reasons under three preferences. Therewere 21,000 first preference admissions in FY94, but only 1,300 went to "aliensof extraordinary ability," and 1,800 went to "outstanding professors orresearchers." Some 5,000 went to "multinational executives or managers;" thiscategory required at least one year's employment with the company. Finally,13,000 visas went to the spouses and children of first preference workers. There were 6,800 visas issued to second-preference workers with "exceptionalabilities" and "professionals with advanced degrees," including artists whocaught the eye of a US opera or dance company while studying in the US. Manyof the artists seeking to become legal residents under the second employmentpreference complain that, because they are self-employed or freelanceperformers and do not have a US sponsoring employer, they find it hard tosecure legal immigrant status. The largest share, about 60 percent of the economic/employment visas in FY94,went to the third preference for "skilled workers, professionals and otherworkers" with at least two years training or experience. The number of third-preference visas has grown from 40 percent of allemployment visas issued in 1992 to 60 percent in 1994. According to corporateexecutives, it is difficult to find Americans for the jobs filled bythird-preference immigrants, especially administrative assistants. The "growth wing" of the Republican party, which generally backed Steve Forbesto be the Republican candidate for president, favors more immigration. Their"manifesto for immigration" in the Wall Street Journal February 28, 1996 calledimmigration a "brain gain" for the US, and quoted former President Reagansaying that his "shining city on the hill"--a metaphor for the US-- neededwalls, but with doors "open to anyone with the will and heart to get here." Simpson proposed changes to the legal immigration system that would eliminateimmigration visas for adult relatives of US citizens, but add visas to expeditethe unification of nuclear families of legal immigrants. Some called Simpson'splan to deny entry to up to 2.5 million relatives such as adult brothers andsisters of US citizens who are on waiting lists to immigrate, and to add visasfor the spouses and children of aliens legalized in 1987-88, a "reward" forlawbreakers, and a penalty on those who "played by the rules." To reduce illegal immigration, Simpson's bill proposes an expansion of theBorder Patrol by 700 agents, from the current 5,500, increased penalties onemployers who hire unauthorized workers, and the elimination the requirementthat the INS obtain search warrants before entering open fields to check forillegal alien workers. On March 21, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-4to require a triple fence to be built along the Mexico-US border south of SanDiego. On March 7, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to substitute a three-yearpilot program to verify the legal status of newly hired workers, and applicantsfor public assistance, rather than the national verification program withineight years originally proposed by Simpson. On March 28, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-4 to modify the process ofallocating visas for family unification. Under the approved revision, UScitizens can sponsor spouses, minor children, and parents each year--there isno quota, but 250,000 admissions annually are expected. In addition, theapproved amendment would permit another 175,000 immigrants to come to the USfor family unification reasons--at least 75,000 would be reserved for the adultchildren of US citizens, and the other 100,000 would be available, in order,for spouses and minor children of legal immigrants, adult children of UScitizens, adult children of legal immigrants, and adult brothers and sisters ofUS citizens. There is a backlog of 1.1 million spouses and minor children seeking to joinlegal immigrants in the US, and a backlog of 1.6 million adult children andbrothers and sisters of US citizens waiting to enter the US. The Senate billwould provide an extra 75,000 visas for 10 years to reduced these backlogs. Current law permits 480,000 family unification immigrants annually. The Senatebill, as amended March 28, would permit 500,000 family unification immigrantsper year for 10 years, a four percent increase. Simpson's proposal to allow the INS to hire 600 retired federal employees toprocess backlogged asylum applications and exempt them from a law that reducestheir salaries to account for their federal pensions was eliminated on March 5by the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight's Civil ServiceSubcommittee.

Candidates Dole and Buchanan argued over who supported Prop. 187 morevigorously in 1994; Forbes and Alexander opposed Prop 187. Dole and Buchananfavor reductions in legal immigration, and making English the official languageof the US; Forbes and Alexander would keep legal immigration at currentlevels. All the Republican candidates promised to do more to reduce illegalimmigration. Buchanan favors construction of a wall or fence along thesouthwestern border, and Dole supports Simpson's bill in Congress to add moreBorder Patrol officers and experiment with a registry so that employers couldmore easily determine who was legally authorized to work in the US. Alexandercalled for a new branch of the military to deal with border control. Clinton and Dole reportedly have similar immigration positions, with theexception that Dole favored Prop. 187 while Clinton opposed it. During thethird week in March, Buchanan pledged to build a 2,000-mile long fence, theClinton administration announced progress in slowing immigrant smuggling, andDole visited the border to announce that he supported the "Prop. 187" amendmentincluded in the House immigration reform proposal to deny free public educationto unauthorized children. Buchanan was the only Republican candidate to attack employers who hire illegalaliens: "There are many corporations which are repeatedly hiring illegalimmigrants and firing their American workers... You have to repeatedly fine andpunish companies that do that." Republicans are divided on immigration--54 percent favor a "five-year ban onall legal and illegal immigration into the US," according to a Wall StreetJournal/NBC poll. Some pundits argue that issues that seemed like sure winnersfor Republicans in 1994--Prop. 187 and opposition to affirmative action andracial preferences--in 1996 may get Republicans labeled as "fanatics." A March 1996 Newsweek poll found that 36 percent of respondents think recentimmigrants have burdened their communities, versus 31 percent who believe thatrecent immigrants contributed to their communities--33 percent said thatimmigrants had no significant effects. However, Governor Wilson is advising Dole to focus on immigration andaffirmative action to close the 20-point lead that Clinton currently has overDole in California. Because of difference in demography and business, immigration did not play asbig a role in the Texas primary as it did in the California contest. In Texas,about 15 percent of the 9.5 million registered voters are Hispanic. Voters inTexas can vote either Republic or Democratic in the primary. Texas politiciansare concerned that attacks on illegal immigration could tarnish the state'srelationship with a major trading partner, Mexico.

The San Francisco Chronicle published a long article onMarch 18, 1996 reporting that fewer than half of the 12,700 US employers thatINS inspectors recommended be fined between 1989 and 1994 for employing illegalaliens or not completing I-9 employee verification forms were in fact fined. The INS has 320 workplace inspectors to check on seven million US employers.The average INS fine levied on employers between 1989 and 1994 was $1,612.INS fines are often characterized by employers as a "the cost of doingbusiness." On March 21, 1996, the INS announced its largest ever fine--a $1.5 million fineon suburban New York janitorial firm Colin Cares for knowingly hiring over 150illegal aliens, and for 2,500 cases of paperwork violations. Over 2,500unauthorized workers were dismissed from the company's 4,000 person work force.Colin Cares cleaned buildings that housed, inter alia, IBM and ATT. The INS plans to hire 384 additional workplace inspectors in 1996, bringing thetotal to about 700 in the 19,000 employee INS. In addition, there are about 900 federal labor inspectors who contact the INSif they suspect that illegal aliens are employed when they check for minimumwage and other violations. The Chronicle emphasized that there are significant discrepancies inenforcement between cities. For example, the INS collected more CMP fines fromemployers in Laredo, Texas than in Los Angeles, and made more collections inGrand Island, Nebraska than in Fresno, California. The INS collected twice asmany fines in Cleveland as in San Francisco. The number of INS workplace inspectors dropped by half between 1989 and 1994.Consequently the number of workplace investigations dropped from 14,700 in 1989to 6,000 in 1994, as the INS diverted resources to deporting criminal aliensand going after immigrant smuggling rings. The INS estimates that 90 percent of US employers comply with laws that aim toprevent the employment of unauthorized aliens. DOL investigators, on the otherhand, estimate that only about 47 percent of employers are in compliance withimmigration laws. The INS usually gives three days notice before inspectingworkplaces, and obtains permission from workers before interviewing them--DOLdoes not. Apprehensions. Some 1,381,465 foreigners were apprehended by the USBorder Patrol in calendar year 1995, up 43 percent from 965,144 in 1994. Insome areas of Arizona, apprehensions increased 500 percent over 1994 levels,and are higher in 1996 than 1995. In the remote Arizona town of Douglas, the number of Border Patrol agentsjumped from two in the early 1980s to 127 in 1996, and migrants unable to crossthe border south of San Diego reportedly paid $800 to smugglers to get them toChicago through Douglas. Most aliens carry no money with them; their friendsand relatives pay the smuggler when the alien is delivered. No one knows whether the increased number of apprehensions reflects moreMexicans attempting illegal entry, or more success by the Border Patrol inapprehending foreigners, or some combination of the two. President Clinton on March 19 unveiled his FY97 budget, and it included a 16percent increase in the INS budget, to $3.1 billion, to cover the cost of anadditional 826 Border Patrol agents and 1,889 other INS employees. Clintonalso proposed $500 million to reimburse states for the cost of incarceratingunauthorized aliens. Academics at the University of Houston estimated that up to 330 unauthorizedaliens die each year trying to sneak into Texas, usually by drowning in the RioGrande. Many of the poor US counties along the border do not have medicalexaminers, so many of the bodies found do not have $500 autopsies performed todetermine the cause of death. Only about 40 percent of the estimated 3,200alien deaths between 1984 and 1994 were recorded by the state of Texas. Surveys of 2,500 Mexicans in four central Mexican villages found that thenumber of persons headed for the US was up 30 percent in 1995 versus 1994.However, some analysts argue that the cost of migration has increased with thestepped-up Border Patrol presence, and the increased number of apprehensionssimply reflects their success in apprehending a steady number of personsattempting entry. Other reports indicate that smugglers' fees are usually paid by US friends andrelatives when the alien is successfully delivered, so that the pesodevaluation would not affect these presumably US-earnings. In Brownsville, Texas, 54 Honduran children were found abandoned by smugglerswho "rented" them to make it easier to adults to be smuggled into the US. OfHonduras's population of 5.5 million, 2.7 million are minors under 18 years ofage, and 28 per cent of Honduran children aged 10 to 17 do some kind of work The INS has 316 miles of various types of fences along the 2,000 mileMexican-US border. Immigration. The number of legal immigrants admitted to the US in FY95fell to 720,461, down 10 percent from 804,416 in FY94, and down 20 percent from904,292 in FY93. There were only 85,336 employment-based immigrants and theirfamilies admitted [the quota is 140,000 per year], and there were declines inthe number of spouses and parents of US citizens, and a special program thatpermitted 55,000 dependents to join newly legalized immigrants expired in 1994.There were 106,827 refugees who were recognized as US immigrants in FY95. Of the 85,000 employment-based visas issued, only 37,000 or 43 percent wereprincipal workers--the others were their spouses and children. The major countries of origin were Mexico (12.5 percent), the Philippines (7.1percent), Vietnam (5.8), the Dominican Republic (5.3), China (4.9), and India(4.8). States of intended destination included California (166,482), New York(128,406), Florida (62,023), Texas (49,963), New Jersey (39,729), and Illinois(33,898)--immigration was down in each of these states except Florida. Immigrants arriving in FY95 indicated that they were moving to states thatpreviously not receiving large numbers of immigrants, such as Georgia andMichigan. California was the destination of 29 percent of all immigrants inFY93, but only 23 percent in FY95. One-third of California's 166,482 immigrants in FY95 were from Mexico (21percent) and the Philippines (14 percent). The Los Angeles-Long Beach areareceived 54,669 legal immigrants in FY95, half the 106,703 in FY93. It is not yet clear whether the recent drop in immigrant admissions signifies atrend toward less immigration. Some of the FY95 drop may be due to delays insetting up the so-called "245i" adjustment program, which permit personsalready in the US to adjust their status rather than return to their countriesof citizenship and present themselves to a consular officer. An analysis of1990 Census data found that about 30 percent of the persons counted asimmigrating in 1990 were living in the US in 1985. Backlog, apprehension, and other data suggest an increasing, not a decreasinginflux of immigrants. There are about 2.7 million foreigners on immigrantwaiting lists. The Current Population Survey estimates that the number of Mexican-bornresidents in the US jumped by 500,000 between March 1994 and March 1995. Sincethere were 111,000 Mexican immigrants in FY94, this suggests that fourunauthorized Mexicans may have arrived in the US for each legal immigrant. Naturalization. The INS also announced in March 1996 that itsCitizenship USA drive handled 500,000 citizenship applications in FY95. In1990, only 40 percent of the 19.8 million foreign-born persons in the US werenaturalized US citizens, the lowest level in many years. Beginning in 1994,the number of immigrants applying for naturalization surged. The INS hopes to reduce what is now a one-year wait in some cities between thetime that a settled immigrant applies for US citizenship on an N-400 form andis scheduled for an INS interview. About 75 percent of the one million applications filed in FY95, and the onemillion expected in FY96, are filed in five cities--Los Angeles, Miami, NewYork, Chicago, and San Francisco. According to election experts, newly naturalized US citizens mostly voteDemocratic. In New York City, West Indians, who have achieved more politicalpower than any other immigrant group in that city, vote Democratic. Dominicans,the city's largest immigrant group, vote primarily Democratic. Most Colombianand Ecuadorian immigrants are registered as Democrats, more than half of themvoted for the Republican mayoral candidate. The Asian American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angelesestimated in March that 80 percent of Asian immigrants eventually become U.S.citizens. Asians are less likely than whites to register to vote, but thosewho are registered are among the most likely voters to go to the poll onelection day. In 1994, 75 percent of the registered Asian Americans voted,compared to 73 percent of the whites, 64 percent of the Hispanics and 63percent of the African Americans. The Asian-American population is 7.2 million, and is projected to be 11 millionin the year 2000, and 20 million by 2020. According to one study, "AsianPacific Americans: Reframing the Immigration Debate," one-fourth of the hightech companies in California's Silicon Valley are run by Asian-Americans.Among Americans 25 to 38 years of age in 1990, Asian Pacific Americans weretwice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to have received a post-collegedegree. On March 5, 1996, California again sued the federal government asking that iteither take custody of the roughly 18,000 illegal aliens held in Californiastate prisons, or fully reimburse California for the cost of incarceratingthem. California has about 138,000 inmates in state prisons-- 38,000 were bornabroad, and 18,000 are believed to have been unauthorized aliens when theycommitted crimes that had them sentenced to one year or more. Californiaestimates that it spends about $22,000 per prisoner per year, or $400 millionto incarcerate illegal aliens--90 percent are Mexican nationals. One estimateis that 98 percent of all illegal immigrants who are deported for committingfelonies in California eventually return to California and, of those whoreturn, 40 percent will commit crimes again. Attorney General Janet Reno acknowledges the federal government'sresponsibility, but points the finger at Congress for not providing thenecessary funds to incarcerate the illegal alien criminals. In FY95, thefederal government had $63 million to pay for illegal immigrant prisoners; andit expects $500 million in 1996-97. In January 1996, the INS deported over 5,000 criminal aliens, keeping on itsannounced pace of deporting 62,000 criminal aliens in FY96. Two-thirds of thecriminal aliens deported so far in FY96 are Mexican nationals. Persons held less than one year, and until trials, are usually held in city andcounty jails. California's Orange County found in a September 1995 survey ofthe jail that 35 percent of the inmates were illegal immigrants. Under aproposed program, an INS agent stationed at the jail will identify illegalimmigrants prior to their first court appearance and arrange for deportation. The INS announced in March that the second Special Cuban Migration Programwould permit Cubans in Cuba between 18 and 55 who satisfy at least two of threeconditions--completed secondary school, have three or more years of workexperience, and have relatives in the US--to register for one of 20,000immigration slots designated each year for Cubans. The application period isfrom March 15 to April 30, 1996. As of March, more than 8,400 Cubans have beenapproved for legal migration to the US under this program. Some Cubans who have returned to their homeland say that they been victims ofreprisals, and claim that the US is not taking seriously their complaints ofretaliation. They complain that instead of treating them as victims ofpolitical persecution, the US tells them to apply for one of the 20,000 slotsfor Cuban immigrants. Some returned Cubans have reported difficulty in finding and keeping jobsbecause they are labeled politically "unreliable." The INS also announced in March that it would extend until March 27, 1997 theTemporary Protected Status of about 4,000 Liberians who have been in the USsince 1991. On March 20, 1996, green cards issued to permanent resident aliens before 1979expired, and all immigrants had to obtain new pink cards that are harder toforge, and that must be renewed every 10 years. Thousands of immigrants jammedINS offices on March 20 for the new cards, despite several extensions of thedeadline to renew their cards. There were believed to be about 1.5 millionlegal immigrants with the old green cards in November 1993, when thereplacement program began. Lawful immigrants are required to carry evidence of their legal immigrantstatus, and expired green cards no longer provide that evidence. The INS urgedthose who qualify to apply for naturalization rather than another green card. Profiles of Central American migrants who lived for five to 10 years in the USafter applying for and being rejected for asylum in the US emphasized that fewparents facing deportation want to take their children back to Nicaragua or ElSalvador with them, and that many parents simply disappear when they arefinally ordered to surrender to the INS. In a recent Sacramento case, aNicaraguan woman with five children who were born in the US fled instead ofsurrendering to the INS for return to Nicaragua.

The African American share ofthe population will climb slightly to 14 percent in 2050, up from 12 percent in1995. In 1995, there were about 193 million non-Hispanic whites, 31.5 million blacks,26.9 million Hispanics, 8.7 million Asians and Pacific Islanders and about twomillion Native Americans. For the first time in 200 years, a non-white group contributed more to annualpopulation increase than non-Hispanic whites. According to the Census report,"U.S. Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin: 1990-1995,"in 1993-94, the US Hispanic population increased by 902,000, and thenon-Hispanic white population increased by 883,000. The US population is expected to increase by 2.4 million per year, from 263million in 1995 to 394 million in 2050. Fueled by immigration--the Censusassumed a net influx of 820,000 legal and illegal immigrants annually-- andbirths to immigrants, the Hispanic and Asian populations in the US are expectedto grow by over three percent per year, faster than the growth of Mexico'spopulation in 1995, which was 2.2 percent per year. The white population isprojected to increase by about 0.4 percent per year. The new forecasts lower projected immigration from 880,000 to 820,000, butincrease projected fertility by NOT assuming that the currently higher thanaverage fertility of Hispanic and Asian women will converge to lower averagelevels for the US population. By 2030, non-Hispanic whites will be a minority of the US population, butalmost three-fourths of those 65 and older are projected to be non-Hispanicwhites. The New York Times billed these projections as a "profound demographic shift."Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee, who has written extensively on the politicalimplications of demographic change in California, noted that in this case,California today exemplifies the nation's future. In 1970, California's population composition was similar to that of the UStoday--about three-fourths non-Hispanic white. Today, non-Hispanic whites areabout 50 percent of the population, Hispanics are almost 30 percent, andAsian-Americans are approaching 10 percent. Walters emphasizes that the VOTING population changes much more slowly than thepopulation-- non-Hispanic whites may be only 50 percent of the population inCalifornia, but they cast 80 percent of the votes in the 1994 election.Non-Hispanic whites have a median age of almost 50, versus about 30 forLatinos. Some speculate that the combination of ethnic shifts and age twists may makevery contentious federal policies that redistribute tax funds from youngerminority workers to older white residents. In Fall, 1996, for example, thenumber of K-12 pupils is expected to reach 52 million, surpassing the 1971 babyboom peak, and to rise to 55 million by 2002, in part because of immigrationinto cities that sold of demolished school buildings in the 1980s. There are about 24 million foreign-born persons in the US--immigrants who movedto the US from other countries are about nine percent of all US residents.Most are in the US legally, the number of unauthorized aliens in the US isbelieved to be about four million. About 75 percent of the legal immigrants,and 85 percent of the unauthorized aliens, are believed to be in sixstates--California, New York, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Illinois. In 1970, there were about 10 million immigrants in the US, and 20 countries hadsent 100,000 or more of their citizens here. By 1990, there were 41 countriesfrom which 100,000 or more citizens migrated to the US. In 1970, the average foreign-born person earned more than a similar US-bornperson--similar in terms of years of education and age. In the mid-1990s,foreign-born persons earned less than similar US-born adults, leading to whatsome call the "de-skilling" of immigration, and allegedly increasing the effectof immigrants at the bottom of the labor market, and increasing immigrantwelfare costs. Some studies suggest that 20 to 40 percent of the increase inthe wage gap between the least and most skilled workers in the US is due toimmigration. The US Census Bureau reported in October that, among the nation's 271metropolitan areas, three of the four fastest-growing are along the US-Mexicanborder. Between 1990 and 1994, the population of Laredo, Texas grew by 22percent; the population of McAllen, Texas by 20 percent; and, the population ofYuma, Arizona by 19 percent. The US population was 263 million on July 1, 1995. About 83 percent of the USpopulation is white, 13 percent African American, 10 percent Hispanic, and fourpercent is Asian. California's population was 31.6 million on July 1, 1995, including 9.1 millionin Los Angeles county, 2.6 million each in San Diego and Orange counties, and1.6 million in San Bernadino county, and 1.3 million in Riverside county. InLos Angeles, immigration is transforming neighborhoods--Watts is now 70 percentHispanic, up from 60 percent in 1994. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan predicted that, "in 15 years, Los Angeleswill again be a town with a strong middle class, mainly Latinos and Asians.They will make relatively less money than the average middle-class citizentoday, but there will be more houses with two, three or four wage-earners." Between July 1994 and June 1995, some 383,000 California residents leftCalifornia, bringing to 1.5 million the number of residents who left the statesince 1990. However, California's population continued to increase because ofimmigration and a baby boom--there were 343,000 more births than deaths. The Census uses July-June years to report population changes and, it noted thatnet foreign immigration to California peaked at 296,000 in 1992-93, dropped to260,000 in 1993-94, and dropped again to 234,000 in 1994-95. These immigrationdata mirror national trends--net US immigration was 835,000, 754,000, and702,000 in these years, giving California 35, 34, and 33 percent of USimmigrants in the 1990s. During the 1980s, California's population rose by 25 percent, while the USpopulation rose by 10 percent. The US population was 262.8 million on July 1,1995, including 31.6 million in California, 18.7 million in Texas, and 18.1million in New York--one in four US residents lived in these three states.California's population is expected to be 36 to 38 million by 2005, dependingon the strength of the state's economic rebound. These population changes were driven largely by demography and economiccircumstances. The US economy added 1.7 million jobs in 1995, bringing payrollemployment to 117 million. California added 300,000 jobs in 1995, bringing itspayroll employment to 12.6 million. Unemployment in December 1995 was 5.6percent, and 7.7 percent in California. California has 7.7 million foreign-born residents, or 40 percent of thenation's immigrants. As California bounces back from recession, there is renewed interest in whetherthe state that would be the world's seventh largest economy presages trendselsewhere in the US economy. Some students of the California economy arguethat California's experience simply reflects national trends, so that sloweconomic growth and strained public finances, inequality, and rising healthcare costs reflect developments common to the US and many other industrialeconomies. The California economy produces goods and services worth about $900 billionannually. Almost one-fourth of all California households have incomes above$75,000 per year, versus about one-fifth of US households. California's 1980s boom, 1990s bust, and mid-1990s resurgence is centered inLos Angeles county, which accounts for almost one-third of California'spopulation and labor force. Los Angeles county lost almost half of itsdefense-related jobs between 1988 and 1995. Since 1990, Los Angeles countylost about 510,000 jobs, but gained back about 150,000 of them by 1996. Los Angeles county now has about 133,000 aerospace jobs, down from 300,000, and130,000 motion picture jobs, which some consider only 50 percent of the totalemployment in the industry because of the large number of independentcontractors and persons affiliated with the motion picture industry. The California-is-unique analyses, on the other hand, argue that California'seconomy has been affected primarily by defense cutbacks, immigration, and rulesand regulations that stifle business expansion. The percentage of Americans living in poverty fell from 15.1 percent or 39million in 1993 to 14.5 percent or 38.1 million in 1994. The poverty rate isdetermined by multiplying the cost of a minimum diet by three--persons whoseincome falls below this line are considered poor--the income needed to lift afamily of four above poverty in 1994 was $15,141. These census data measure pretax income. If the value of in-kind transferssuch as health insurance or public housing is included, the number of poorpeople falls; if the cost of food is one-fourth rather than one-third of a poorperson's expenditures, the number of poor people rises. The median income of American households was $32,264 in 1994, practicallyunchanged from 1993. Many of the welfare programs being debated in Congress aim to prevent childrenfrom growing up poor. According to a recent Government Accounting Officereview of census data, about 17 percent of the school-aged children (fivethrough 17) were living in households with below poverty-level incomes in1990--some 7.6 million children. However, 31 percent of the school-aged children in households headed byimmigrants lived in poverty-- 709,000-- including 43 percent of the children inhouseholds headed by an immigrant from Mexico--299,000--and 40 percent of thechildren in households headed by an immigrant from Vietnam--46,700. Population growth and change are linked closely to issues such as socialsecurity funding. In 1995, there was one person 65 and older for every fourpersons 20 to 64; by 2030, the ratio will be almost two older for every threeof working age. The US Census has announced that it will use sampling to enumerate theprojected 276 million residents on April 1, 2000. The 2000 Census is expectedto cost $3.9 billion. Under the new plan, the Census will use several attempts to get completedcensus questionnaires until 90 percent of the households in a county haveresponded (in 1990, 63 percent of households returned Census forms by mail).Then Census interviewers will visit a random sample of the 10 percent ofhouseholds that did not respond, and use this interview data to estimate thecharacteristics of non-respondents. It is still planned that one in sixhouseholds will get the "long form" that requests information on income,housing, and other items. On March 20, the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the 1990 Census doesnot need to be adjusted, despite an acknowledged undercount of especially urbanminorities. The city of New York and 23 other cities filed suit against theBush administration when it refused to adjust the 1990 Census to account forthe estimated 1.6 percent of the 250 million residents who were not counted inparticular cities and states.

According to a March 4 story inthe Wall Street Journal, some teachers who could earn $35 per week in Mexicoprefer $200 per week picking fruits and vegetables across the border insouthern California. Over the past 25 years, the number of Mexican collegegraduates--licenciados--increased in all fields. Over 1.3 million Mexicansgraduated from college in the 1980s, when there were only 300,000 jobs createdfor them, persuading some of them to emigrate for jobs. One Mexican dentistwho graduated in 1986 reported that 25 percent of his classmates were workingin the US--usually not as dentists. NAFTA permits governments of one member nation to accuse another for allowingviolations of its own labor laws. The US made four complaints since January1994--two involving GE plants in Mexico, one involving a Sony plant, and oneinvolving a Honeywell plant. For the first time, Mexico accused the US of not remedying a US labor lawviolation. On July 14, 1994 Sprint closed a facility that sold long-distanceservice to Latinos, just before a union election by the 200 largelySpanish-speaking employees. An NLRB administrative law judge sided withSprint's argument that the facility was closed for lawful economic rather thanunlawful anti-union reasons. The governor of Guerrero took a leave of absence while Mexico's Supreme Courtinvestigated his possible role in a June 1995 massacre of 17 peasants bypolice. An investigation by state officials led to the jailing of severalpolice officers, but exonerated the governor. Mexico's currentdecentralization of power is illustrating the practically unlimited power ofsome state governors, and corruption in the police and judiciary. Mexican local police, who reportedly earn $135 per month in Mexico City, andthe federal police, who earn about $250 per month, have in some instancesfought one another for the right to "protect" local drug dealers and supplementtheir incomes. Mexico in March 1996 rejected October 1995 suggestions by US Defense SecretaryPerry to conduct joint US-Mexican military exercises. However, three USmilitary incursions into Mexico over the past 150 years led Mexico to rejectthe presence of US troops on Mexican soil. The number of people living along the Mexico-US border was about 100,000 in1900, and about 10 million in 1995, making water an increasingly contentiousissue between the US and Mexico--El Paso residents use about 210 gallons perperson per day, versus about 70 gallons in Juarez. Nicaragua in 1996 began to issue new and more counterfeit-resistant passports.Under the Sandanistas, Nicarguan passports were sold or given to foreigners whosupported the regime, including five persons involved in the World Trade Centerbombing in 1993.

The 4th congressional district was created after a 1991lawsuit that led to Illinois' first Latino-majority district, represented byLuis Guitierrez since 1992. The decision is expected to be appealed to the USSupreme Court. The decision may affect how Chicago ward maps are drawn, although some Hispanicleaders claim wards are different because the boundaries are negotiated by theLatino leadership. However, current ward maps are being challenged by theMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which argues that theboundaries were drawn to protect Aldermen John Daley, brother of Mayor Daley,and Edward Burke. In a comparison of immigrant political influence in the nation's two largestcities, it was emphasized that immigrants in New York City are more likely togain political clout than immigrants in Los Angeles because many moreimmigrants in New York have legal status. Further, it is easier for immigrantsto have political influence in New York's 52-seat city council than in LosAngeles, which has only 15 seats in its city council and a five-member boardof supervisors. There is much speculation about the "sleeping giant" of Latino political powerin California. The number of Latinos in the California Senate and Assemblydoubled from seven in 1992 to 14 in 1996, despite a decline in the number ofDemocrats in California. There are 10 Latinos in the 80 member Assembly, andfour Latinos in the 40 member Senate. About nine percent of California voters were Latino in 1992, 11 percent in1994, and possibly 15 in 1996. In Santa Clara county, California, the number of Mexican-born voters increasedby 22 percent between February 1995 and February 1996, but they still were only8,500 of the county's 728,000 registered voters. There are 14.1 millionregistered voters in California. Some older immigrants in citizenship classes say they want to become UScitizens because they fear that the government will cut off Medicare and SocialSecurity benefits for legal immigrants.

About 40 percent of Europe's asylum applications were inGermany--128,000 in 1995. In the Netherlands, asylum applications fell to53,000 in 1995 from 29,000 in 1994, and in Sweden, from a peak 84,000 in 1992to 4800 in the first half of 1995. Some estimates are that EU countries removed 200,000 aliens in 1995. Britainsent 2,600 aliens to their countries of origin in 1995, Germany sent 60,000 byair out of the country, and France removed 10,000 aliens. The centers wherealiens are held before removal-- Amsterdam has Grenhospitium, Britain hasCampsfield, Transit Centre 127-Bis is in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium, and Cortemarkin Germany --the biggest such center in the EU--have become the targets ofimmigrant rights protests. EU officials from home affairs and interior ministries meet under the auspicesof the K4 Committee, Steering Group 1 (Asylum and Immigration), to coordinatetheir efforts to deal with asylum seekers. With their support, most EUcountries are drawing up a "white list" of countries from which an applicantfor asylum has the duty to prove that he is suffering political persecution,and no right of appeal if the applicant has come via another "safe" country. The unemployment rate in the 15-nation EU is 11 percent, and is higher forforeigners than EU nationals. There are some 10 million non-EU nationals inthe 15-member EU, and the EU is under pressure to permit, e.g., a Turkishimmigrant in Germany to move freely to France. In Rome, thousands of people representing political parties, trade unions andimmigrants rights activists marched in Rome on March 16 to demand betterconditions for the 520,000 illegal, and one million legal, foreigners in Italy. The number of Europeans aged 60 and over is projected to double to 114 millionby 2025, and the over-60 population will be one-third of all residents. Someestimate that, to keep social welfare states viable, up to seven millionimmigrants annually may be needed, versus the current 500,000. The top 10 countries attracted 300 million of the world's 567 million touristsin 1995, according to the World Tourism Organization in Madrid. Franceattracted 61 million tourists in 1995, followed by 45 million each in Spain andthe US, 29 million in Italy, and 23 million each in China and the UK, 22million in Hungary, 20 million in Mexico, 19 million in Poland, and 18 millionin Austria.

The German Social Democratic Party was accused offanning the flames of xenophobia when its leaders campaigned against allowing220,000 ethnic Germans to move from the ex-USSR to Germany each year, sayingthat they "migrate directly into the unemployment benefit and social securitysystem." Germany spends about $2.2 billion annually to support and integrateethnic Germans. Most ethnic Germans, who acquire German citizenship automatically, vote for thegoverning Christian Democratic Union. Ethnic Germans are persons descended from Germans invited to Russia's VolgaRiver valley in 1762, but then deported to Siberia and Central Asia duringWorld War II. Germany's 1949 Basic Law includes the provision that ethnicGermans who suffered because they were Germans have the right to enter Germanyas citizens. Germany has already reduced the benefits available to ethnic Germans, reducing,for example, the length of state-financed German-language education from 15months to six. According to the SPD, Germany cannot absorb ethnic Germans when unemployment is11.1 percent, meaning that four million persons were jobless. Over half of theunemployed in Germany are women. On March 24, voters in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig Holsteinand Baden-Wurttemberg elected state parliaments, and the SPD saw its share ofthe vote decline by between four to six percent in each state. The liberalFree Democratic Party had a surprisingly strong showing. Although theelections do not directly affect the federal government, Helumt Kohl claimedthat the votes supported his policies. Dieter Spori, the SPD candidate for state premier who had campaigned againstthe immigration of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union, said he wouldno longer play a leadership role in the SPD after he lost the election inBaden-Wurttemberg. Spori conducted a populist campaign that included attackson immigrants. On the other hand, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said he did not believe hisparty's losses in the three states was due to opposition to ethnic Germanimmigration. According to a March 1996 survey, 70 percent ofGermans--especially those in the former West Germany--agreed with Lafontaine'scall for a stoppage or severe restrictions the influx of ethnic Germans. The governing coalition and church groups denounced the SPD. Some 397,000ethnic Germans arrived in Germany in 1990. Beginning in 1993, a quota of220,000 per year was introduced. Germany has been admitting about 200,000ethnic Germans per year since 1988; about 80 percent were born after 1945. Thegovernment argues that the ethnic Germans take farm and factory jobs thatGermans shun. Interior Minister Manfred Peuchel of Saxony-Anhalt said that the migration ofyoung East Germans to West Germany, and the aging of the remaining population,means that the former East Germany needs young ethnic Germans. In Sohren, a town of 2,000 south of Coblenz, about 1,200 ethnic Germans areliving in former US military barracks, and their presence has created divisionsin local schools, where non-German speaking children sometimes outnumber thenative-born children. There are about 7.2 million foreigners in Germany, but only about 10,000non-ethnic Germans are naturalized each year. Kurds. Turkish Kurds living in Germany went on "rampages" March 9 and 16in northwestern Germany. Demonstrations were planned in anticipation of theKurdish new year March 21, and Kurdish demonstrators clashed with police whotried to remove banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) banners--PKK banners areillegal in Germany. There are believed to be active 3000 PKK members inGermany. The resulting violence led to "consensus" that foreigners who organize orparticipate in violent protests in Germany should face deportation. There arebetween 400,000 and 500,000 Kurds among the two million Turks in Germany, aboutthe same proportion as among Turkey's 60 million residents. Kurds have beenfighting to succeed from Turkey since 1984. On March 27, the Kohl coalition in Bonn agreed to expel foreigners involved inillegal demonstrations by redefining participation in a banneddemonstration--currently a misdemeanor--to be a severe violation of publicorder that leads to automatic expulsion. Police raided the asylum center in Halberstadt on March 22, and seized PKKmaterials. About 1,300 of the 1,900 asylum seekers in Halberstadt are Kurds. Seven people died and 73 were hurt in 146 fires in hostels for refugee asylum-seekers in Germany in 1994 and 1995--in 41 cases, arson was suspected. Construction. On March 22, some 12,000 workers demonstrated in Munichagainst the employment of foreigner workers at wages below those paid to Germanconstruction workers. Under current rules, subcontractors based in another EUcountry can legally undercut German pay rates by recruiting in their owncountries at local rates then sending the workers to a German building site. On March 23, another 6,000 workers demonstrated in Magdeburg. In collective bargaining to implement a German government proposal to resolvethe EU construction worker issue, IG Bau demanded a minimum hourly wage ofDM19.58 for non-German EU workers from the first day of their employment inGermany, up sharply from the current DM12. Employers offered DM15, and theissue was sent to an arbitrator for a decision by April 8. If there is no agreement, the union could call the first ever nationwide strikein construction. The European Council's social affairs committee on March 29 tackled the issueof paying all EU workers the same wage at the same work place. The UK, Irelandand Portugal have fought the proposed "equal pay" directive. A compromise has been proposed by the Italian president of the EU, which wouldstipulate that the "equal pay" directive would apply to EU workers immediatelywhen an EU national is employed in another EU country. The previous proposalwould have permitted lower wages for the first month of employment.

About 300 of the immigrants then moved to a gymnasium, where two days later thepolice again removed them to prevent any "risk of violence." Juppe wascriticized in the press for the March 24 pre-dawn raid. Many of the Africansinvolved have lived in France for more than 10 years without residency papers. Days after the evacuation, 67 of the immigrants were in a Paris court. OnMarch 27, a French appeals court overturned a lower court ruling that released38 of the immigrants arrested during the sit-in, and the police are expected tooverturn another court order that released some of the other immigrants. Mostof those released had disappeared by the time the first court ruling wasoverturned. On March 28, 50 of the asylum seekers were flown to Mali. The French government said that the church sit in was a staged protest. Thegovernment announced on March 26 that it will close some of the loopholes thatallowed the first court to release some of the immigrants apprehended, andstrengthen laws that remove immigrants from France. Draft interior ministrylegislation includes rules that would establish fingerprint banks, computerlists of people harboring aliens, and simplified procedures to deport illegalaliens-- only 20 percent of the aliens ordered deported from France areactually removed from the country. The number of foreigners naturalizing in France rose 30 percent in 1994compared to 1993. About 26 percent of the new French citizens were Moroccans,15 percent were Portuguese, 10 percent were Tunisian, and nine percentAlgerians. The number of French residents rose to 58.3 million in 1995, reflecting thedifference between 710,000 births, 529,000 deaths, and 45,000 net immigrants.About 36 percent of the births were to unmarried mothers. There are about four million foreign-born persons living legally in France, andup to one million unauthorized aliens.

The Saudi government hadthreatened to break British arms contracts if the Saudi dissident was allowedto remain in the US. The judge told the Home Office to reconsider Masaari's asylum applicationwithin one month. The Saudi dissident runs a North London-based organization called the Committeefor Defense of Legitimate Rights, which advocates replacing the Saudi monarchywith an Islamic government. The British government is considering plans to increase the number of peopledeported by elevating the Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Departmentto executive agency status, and rewarding managers for meeting deportationtargets. Britain deports less than 10 percent of failed asylum seekers--therest disappear or reapply for asylum. In 1994, there were 32,800 asylum applications-- 4,500 foreigners were allowedto stay in Britain, and 1,580 people were deported. The remaining 26,720people are unaccounted for. In 1995, all 2,000 Nigerians who applied for asylum in Britain had theirapplications rejected. A 70-page report issued by the Refugee Council on March25, also said that all Rwandans, and 91 percent of the Sri Lankans, wererejected for asylum despite civil unrest in both countries. The High Court ruled on March 27 that the withdrawal of welfare benefits frommost asylum seekers under new government regulations was lawful. Foreignerswho do not apply upon their arrival are not eligible for income support,housing benefit, or other welfare payments. The High Court noted that 32 per cent of the 2,900 asylum applications filed in1984 were approved, but that only four percent of the 32,800 filed in 1994resulted in a grant of asylum suggesting to the Court that the government actedproperly in reduce benefits to mostly false asylum seekers. On March 5, 1996, the British government promised local authoritiescompensation to meet legal obligations to asylum seekers. Local councils musthouse people, including asylum seekers, under homelessness legislation until atleast the summer of 1996, when the Asylum and Immigration Bill is expected tobecome law. Local councils will have to care for the children of asylumseekers beyond that date under the Children's Act. The British Home Office asked the Commission on Racial Equality to draw upguidelines to prevent employers from discriminating against minorities to avoidfines under the proposed employer sanctions law. Under the proposal, employerscould face criminal penalties and fines of up to L5000 ($7,700) if theyknowingly hired an illegal worker. The number of illegal aliens caught working in the UK increased from 4,000 in1988 to 10,000 in 1995. Prime Minister John Major announced on March 4 that up to two million Hong Kongresidents will continue to be able to visit Britain without visas after 1997.They will be able to visit Britain for up to six months, and will not have theright of abode or to work. Some Tory MPs feel that the UK faces an illegalimmigration "nightmare." Major also announced that Hong Kong's ethnic minorities, primarily Indians andPakistanis, would be guaranteed the right to live in Britain after the turnoverif they came "under pressure to leave Hong Kong." After the announcement, other European countries were expected to may adoptsimilar policies toward Hong Kong residents.

Poland receives 500 to 600 asylumapplications every year. Poland permits immigrants to enter for economic reasons as long as anindividual can prove strong ties to the Polish community and the ability tocontribute to Polish society. Those seeking employment in Poland receive workpermits on the basis of employer guarantees. In 1994, 14,000 work permits were issued to foreigners. However, under a newregulation that took effect in October, 1995, first-time work visas are issuedonly at Polish consular posts abroad. The Polish Border Guards Commandant said on March 26 that Poland must have amore effective control of border traffic to prevent border crime. In April,1996, 10 new watch-towers will be built and two to four helicopters will beginto patrol the border, including the Polish-Lithuania border where 20 airplanesreportedly illegally smuggle in people and goods. The Border Guards report that border enforcement has already reduced illegalimmigration. The Border Guards admit that the smugglers from the CIS and Asiancountries are better organized and equipped than they are. About 12,000illegal immigrants were stopped at the border in 1995.

Turkey, one of the world's major potential countries of emigration, was throwninto political uncertainty after the Islamist Refah party won 158 seats in the550-member Parliament in elections held December 24, 1995--the next two largestparties have 135 and 132 seats. The Refah or Welfare party's success was attributed to honest local governmentsin the 23 cities it controls, including Istanbul and Ankara, and grass-rootscampaigning at weddings etc, putting the party closer to many people than themainstream parties. Refah opposes the current Turkish ban on headscarves inpublic offices, arguing that culture is religion, and that women who want tocover their heads should be allowed to do so. Turkey is often described as a country on a knife edge, sometimes tiltingtoward Europe, and sometimes toward the Middle East. To try to win theDecember election, the government printed money, and in 1996 inflation, thebudget and trade deficits, and interest rates are up, and severalclosely-watched businesses such as car assembly announced plans to close atleast temporarily because of falling sales. Real incomes in Turkey fell about 20 percent in 1995, the social securitysystem is bankrupt, and privatization is much slower than planned. As inMexico, the government keeps going by offering Turks--who buy two-thirds of thecountry's debt--interest rates of over 100 percent for three and six month debtinstruments. Some speculate that the military could stage a coup, as in 1980, to restorestability. Sweden, which deported Kurds who lied about their identity--usually claiming tobe Iraqis--has agreed to reopen " thousands" of cases to determine if theforeigners really needed protection in Sweden despite lying about their trueidentity. Some 500,000 people were granted residence permits in Sweden, whichhas a population of 8.5 million, between 1979 and mid-1995.

Selected papers on labor recruitment and themigration transition will be published in a special issue of the Asian andPacific Migration Journal, edited by Philip Martin, Andy Mason, and ToshikzauNagayama. The conference was unusual in three respects. First, it focused on threeunderstudied issues--labor contractors and smuggling, trade in services and themigration of professionals, and the migration transition, or the movement of acountry from being a net labor exporter to being a net labor importer. Second, these issues were examined comparatively, with researchers'presentations being critiqued by policy makers. Third, conference participants discussed migration issues with Japaneseemployers, unauthorized workers, and local officials in areas where, in onecity, almost 10 percent of the population were foreigners. There are 1.32 million foreigners in Japan, making them 1.1 percent of thetotal population. These field trips provided several insights. First, immigration andintegration policies are being made locally in Japan, as local officials reactin an ad hoc manner to events that arise when foreigners and foreign workersare present. They prepare booklets in e.g., Portuguese and Japanese on how toseparate garbage for pickup, and establish bilingual classes to accommodateforeign students. Local officials seem to be aware that Japanese immigration policy is to avoidthe settlement of foreigners, but they nonetheless are implementing policiesthat make it easier for foreigners and their children to settle in Japan,including the provision of Japanese language classes and the support ofJapanese-foreigners associations for Nikkeijin, the mostly Brazilian andPeruvian workers of Japanese descent who get three-year work permits to enterJapan. Private organizations are also being established to help foreigners. The AllUnited Workers Union has opened a hall in Ueno, Tokyo where about 40 foreignersworking for small manufacturing companies can get help and advice in Urdu,Bengali and French--the workers are from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Senegal.About 900 non-Japanese workers are dues-paying members of the Tokyo-basedunion. Second, foreign workers are to some extent a structural feature of the Japaneseeconomy and labor market--the number of foreigners in at least some industriesand areas is increasing along with the unemployment rate, as especially youngJapanese workers avoid so-called 3-D jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult. Unemployment in Japan reached 3.2 percent in 1995, for an average 2.1 millionunemployed workers--youth unemployment reached 6.1 percent. There appears to be very little enforcement of employer sanctions--at leastsome of the employers who hire unauthorized workers do so fairly openly, andreport that they do not fear visits or fines from labor or immigrationinspectors. A June 1995 survey of 1,731 companies in the Tokyo Metropolitan area found that17 percent of respondents had foreign workers on their payrolls, up from sixpercent in 1991. Third, immigration policy is closely linked in the minds of local governmentofficials and employers to industrial policy. Foreign trainees are meant toserve as a bridge to foreign investment to e.g., China and Indonesia,especially for small firms that do not have a foreign presence. The aging Japanese industrial work force is training young foreigners in Japan,helping industries from garments to machinery preserve production in Japan inthe short run and, since most of the trainees return to their countries oforigin, to show local workers how to do things the Japanese way if the Japaneseestablish a local facility in the cities from which they come. Most foreigners holding unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in Japan appear to beeither Brazilians of Japanese descent who get three-year permits to live andwork in Japan, trainees from nearby Asian nations, or unauthorized foreignworkers. The ethnic Japanese from South America are treated as Japaneseworkers, participating in Social Security and other labor market programs, andpaid the same as Japanese workers doing similar work. The trainees, on the other hand, reportedly cost a Japanese employer the same150,000 yen ($1500) per month that a Japanese high school graduate would cost,but the composition of the employer's cost of labor is very different forforeign trainees. Trainees in one city receive a cash allowance about $400 permonth, and $200 per month for food. The other $900 represent costs theemployer incurs for transportation, housing, fees, and clothing. In somecases, trainees pay kickbacks to their sending organization from theirallowance, such as to a public organization in China. In early February, Japan intercepted 60 Chinese trying to sneak intosouthwestern Japan. The captain of the ship had charged the workers 180,000 to210,000 yuan ($21,000 to $24,500) to be smuggled into Japan. The number of foreign students enrolled in Japanese universities and technicalschools was 53,847 in May 1995, including 45,245 who were studying in Japan attheir own expense. Foreign students in Japan are permitted to work 28 hoursper week. Faezah Ismail, "Is homogeneous Japan an myth?" New Straits Times, March 20,1996.

Singapore's labor minister responded that the governmentneeded to control foreign workers in Singapore to balance their employmentagainst long-term national interests. The prolonged use of foreign workers, heasserted, could have adverse economic, social and political effects. During the debate, the labor minister argued that continued access to foreignworkers could discourage employers from training local workers and upgradingtheir operations. He encouraged employers to find innovative ways to overcomemanpower shortages, and rejected calls to eliminate the foreign worker levy andthe limits on the number of foreign workers allowed in various sectors. The government also rejected a proposal to establish a minimum wage for foreignworkers, saying it could result in unrealistic labor costs for employers andundermine the country's competitiveness. The number of foreign workers in Singapore jumped from 70,000 in 1975 to350,000 today. The share of foreigners in the work force rose from sevenpercent in 1975 to 20 percent of the 1.7 million workers in the country in1995. Despite tight controls, the number of foreigners overstaying their visas isalso climbing. In 1993, 6,000 remained past their expiration date, in 1994,the figure jumped to 7,000, and between January and October, 1995, over 5,000. An estimated 10,000 aliens annually are smuggled into Singapore, usually bysmugglers who provide them with false passports. According to Singapore'simmigration department, counterfeit social visit passes, which previously costabout S$100, are now so readily available that the price has dropped to S$10. Construction is a major employer of legal and illegal foreign workers. Inconstruction, employers may have up to five foreign workers for every oneSingaporean, provided they pay a monthly levy for each foreign worker-- S$200(US $141) for a skilled worker, and S$440 for an unskilled worker. The Employment of Foreign Workers Act took effect late in 1995, and itpenalizes labor contractors between S$15,000 (about $10,700) and S$30,000, orjail for a term of not more than one year, or both. There is also a fine ofbetween S$50,000 ($35,700) and S$100,000 for employers who have committedimmigration offenses that are punishable with mandatory jail or caning.Illegal workers are also fined: up to S$5,000 or imprisonment of up to oneyear, or both. Under the new law, foreigners who overstay their visas for more than 90 days,or who enter Singapore without a valid travel document, can be punished withthree strokes of the cane, as can employers found with five or more illegalworkers. In the past, many construction contractors claimed that they did not know thattheir subcontractors were using illegal workers. The new law helps identifythe main contractor who was previously protected by sub-contractors. On March 14, a subcontractor was sentenced to eight months' jail for illegallyhiring 105 foreign workers at two construction sites in 1995. This was thefirst case involving a single employer caught for employing a large number ofillegal workers. The number of employers prosecuted for employing illegal workers rose from 31per month in 1994 to 43 per month in 1995. About 750 illegal aliens areapprehended each month in Singapore. Singapore is one of the world's richest "developing" nations, with a per capitaGDP of $24,000, higher than that of the UK, and roughly equivalent toFrance--its three million people had a 1995 GDP of about $82 billion. However,only about three percent of the country's workers have a college degree ormore, although the government notes that almost one-fourth of the new entrantsto the work force have college degrees.

Some Tory MPs feel that the UK faces anillegal immigration "nightmare," since, they argue, the UK is really admittingmainland Chinese without visas. Singapore and South Africa are expected to follow the UK's lead and permitvisa-free entry with SAR documents. Many Hong Kong residents nonetheless waited long hours near the end of March toobtain British National Overseas passports, which they thought would makefuture international travel easier--80 countries allow visa-free entry to BNOpassport holders. March 31,1996 was the last day for Hong Kong residents toobtain British National Overseas passports. There is a limit of 3.3 millionBNO passports that can be issued to Hong Kong's 6.3 million residents. Major also announced that Hong Kong's ethnic minorities, primarily Indians andPakistanis, would be guaranteed the right to live in Britain after the turnoverif they came "under pressure to leave Hong Kong." A total of 90,000 Hong Kong residents applied for naturalization in theUK in March, compared with 34,500 in all of 1995 and 18,000 in 1994. Hong Kong residents are permitted under US law to defer immigrating to the USuntil 2002. In 1995, about 39 percent of those who received immigration visaselected to defer migrating. Australia estimates that there are 220,000 multiple entry visitor visa holdersfrom Hong Kong in Australia at any one time, eligible to stay up to one year,and that, in 1997, some may stay and request asylum. In 1994, the Fiji government invited up to 28,000 Hong Kong Chinese toimmigrate, a move opposed by 76 percent of both native Fijians and Indians.Most Fijians are Methodists, and the Methodist church is leading the oppositionto the plan to admit Hong Kong Chinese, arguing that the Chinese will bringdrugs and prostitution to the island. Under the plan, Hong Kong residents who wish to immigrate would have to pay$30,000 per family, and invest at least $100,000 in Fiji. Cynics think thecorrupt government ministers want to pocket the fees. Easy access to Shenzhen, China, a special economic zone set up 16 years ago tohelp industrialize the mainland, has led to a restructuring of the Hong Kongeconomy. Manufacturing firms such as Hitachi are relocating to China forcheaper land and labor. Only an hour from Hong Kong, more than 150,000 HongKong nationals earn their living in the Shenzhen region of China. Shenzhen residents have the highest average monthly salaries in China (about$450), about twice monthly earnings in Beijing. Richard C.

By the end of February, some 50,000 foreign trainees were in Korea.They receive basic training; most work in small manufacturing companies for oneyear. The government has developed several strategies to help small businesses dealwith labor shortages. Small businesses with less than 50 employees are allowedto have a work force composed of up to 20 percent foreigners, up from theprevious 10 percent foreigners ceiling. The government also assigns some youngKorean men to small businesses in lieu of military duty--some 15,000 Koreanswere assigned to small business in 1996. Foreigners will be recruited to work on fishing vessels in South Korea for thefirst half of 1996 in order to alleviate labor shortages. About 1,000foreigners workers will be placed aboard fishing vessels on a trial basis. Thenumber of offshore fishing workers is expected to fall 10,500 short of the51,500 needed. The labor shortage, which peaked in 1991, was caused by reduced birth rate,exhaustion of the rural labor surplus, and the declining labor forceparticipation of the young, more of whom are studying longer. There are approximately 84,000 illegal workers in Korea. There are three types of illegal foreign worker in South Korea. The mostcommon arrives with a short-term visa, such as a tourist visa, and remainsillegally in the country to work. The second type enters South Korea with afraudulent passport or is smuggled in. The third type enters legally as atrainee, and either overstays the trainee visa, or illegally changes jobs. The South Korean government is currently considering the passage of the ForeignEmployment Act, which will address some of the legal and social issues thatarise with foreign workers. But the government warned that it will takeseveral years of study before the legislation can be approved and implemented.

China's Jilin province includeslarge numbers of ethnic Koreans, and the Yalu river is shallow enough thatpeople can wade across. China's missile tests in the Taiwan strait led to numerous ads in Taipeinewspapers offering, e.g., " missile protection passports" for T$100,000"($3,600), or permanent residency in Costa Rica within 60 days. So-calledimmigration fairs drew 30,000 to 40,000 people in March. About 20,000Taiwanese emigrate each year to the United States, Canada, Australia, NewZealand and South Africa. However, more Taiwanese have reportedly "boughtprotection" by acquiring passports from Dominica, the Seychelles, Vanuatu,Belize, Namibia and Costa Rica. China's population rose by 12.7 million in 1995; China's goal is to keep itspopulation to 1.3 billion by 2000. There are 10 countries with more than 100million residents, and two--the US and Japan--are among the world's wealthiest.China has 30 provinces, 19 of which have more than 30 million residents. China's gross domestic product GDP in 1995 was 5,773.3 billion yuan. Incomegaps between provinces are widening. The coastal areas of Shanghai andGuangdong had per capita incomes of $800 in 1992, versus $225 in Guizhou.There are about 230 million residents in the rich southeast coastal area, and530 million in the poorer center. China classifies its urban households into five categories, from the poorest,who have annual incomes of less than 5,000 yuan ($600) and who comprise eightpercent of households, to the next group--who have annual incomes between 5,000and 15,000 yuan ($600-$1,800)--and who comprise 30 percent of urban households,to the 53 percent of all urban households that have annual incomes between15,000-30,000 yuan ($1,800-$3,600), to the high income households that haveannual incomes of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan ($3,600-$12,000)--who are six percentof all households, to the very high income households, who have more than100,000 yuan annually ($12,000)--and are three percent of all households. About one-fourth of China's 1.2 billion people are considered urban residents. There are believed to be about 35 million ethnic Chinese outside mainlandChina, or 55 million if Taiwan is included. These overseas ethnic Chinese arebelieved to account for some 70 percent of the more than $ 490 billion inforeign investments in mainland China. Overseas Chinese have been described as"Lords of the Rim: The Invisible Empire of the Overseas Chinese," and "TheMerchant Mandarins." China elaborated on plans announced earlier to "preserve jobs in China for theChinese." Urban unemployment is estimated to be at least 10 percent, farhigher than the three percent official rate. The US Human Rights Report on China, issued in March 1996, notes that there isa "floating population" of over 100 million economic migrants within China.China also responded to US charges that it is swamping Tibet with Chineseimmigrants by arguing that, in 1995, there were 79,000 Chinese Han people amongTibet's 2.4 million residents. In the US, the 98 Chinese Golden Venture passengers still in detention may beable to apply for political asylum in the U.S after the House approved aHouse-Senate conference report that would amend the Immigration and NationalityAct to allow people who fear "coercive population controls" in their homecountry to seek asylum in the U.S. Vietnam announced in March that there are 2.6 million ethnic Vietnamese in 80countries, including one million in the US, about 400,000 in France, 300,000 inChina, 160,000 in Australia, 150,000 in Canada, 120,000 in Thailand and 100,000each in Germany, Cambodia and Russia.

The proposal would also allow foreigners full ownership in businesses in thezone. Current rules allow foreigners to own no more than 40 percent of anenterprise. Most products produced in the special economic zone would be forexport. The Thai House committee on military affairs believes that the presence of overtwo million illegal foreign workers in the country poses a security threat.Most of the foreign workers are from Myanmar (formerly Burma); the committeespokesperson asserts they are sent to act as spies in Thailand. On March 20, the Thai House of Representatives considered a proposal to allowforeign workers to work on Thai fishing vessels. The bill is aimed atalleviating a shortage of crewmen on fishing boats. Many of the workers comefrom Myanmar (Burma) or Cambodia. After five Thai workers were executed for murder and robbery in Singapore inmid-March, the Thai justice ministry is considering posting legal advisorsabroad to protect Thai overseas workers. The reaction to the killings inThailand was muted, although the government was criticized for not protectingoverseas workers. Press reports initially expected a furor similar to thatwhen the Singapore government executed a Filipino maid last year.

Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation with a labor force growingby almost two million per year, is worried that too many "good jobs" are goingto foreigners. In 1995, the number of foreign workers increased 38 percent, to57,000. Most foreigners in Indonesia are professional expatriates who earn $4,000 permonth or more. The government reports that expatriate workers in 1995 earned atotal $2.4 billion, equivalent to one-third of the country's current accountdeficit of $7.9 billion. There are over 11,000 South Koreans working in Indonesia, 9,000 Japanese and5,000 Taiwanese. Currently, Indonesian companies can only hire foreign workersfor jobs requiring professional skills not possessed by locals. On March 23,the government announced plans to allow foreigners to work in positions whichhave previously been closed to them such as high and middle-level management.The government hopes that the new, shorter list will attract more foreigninvestment in Indonesia.

The report was released at a meeting of government officials, employers andtrade unions from more than 30 countries who met at the ILO's Genevaheadquarters the week of March 4 to discuss international labor standards forconstruction workers. During the meeting, the representatives discussed howthe government of labor-sending countries can protect their overseas workers.Labor importing countries were accused of failing to enforce their labor lawsregarding migrant workers. In the report, the ILO found that the wages and benefits of foreign workers aretypically below those paid to local workers. In Bahrain, for example, wagesfor construction workers fell by as much as one third between 1986 and 1989. The ILO report found that wages vary considerably. A survey of wages paid byKorean construction firms in the Middle East in 1992 revealed, for example,that Malaysians earned the most, US$536 per month, followed by Filipinos andThais. At the bottom of the scale were Sri Lankans, at US$38 per month. Wagesfor foreign construction workers are higher in Asia than the Middle East. The failure of many countries to recognize their dependence on foreign workershas led to many migrants working illegally, and thus they do not complain ofsafety violations. A survey of Asia in the Economist assumes that labor shortages throughout theregion will have some inflationary effect, and that continued labor shortageswill act as brake on economic growth. The article concludes that the companiesthat succeed in Asia on a large scale will be those that can build their owninfrastructure and distribution systems and recruit and retain the bestemployees.

Only Palestinians working in Jewish settlements in the territories will be ableto return to their jobs, and Palestinian patients will be allowed to seektreatment in Israeli hospitals. However, most Palestinians will continue to beindefinitely barred from their jobs in Israel. During the periodic bans on Palestinian workers over the past year, Thai,Romanian and Chinese workers were brought in to work in the fields andconstruction sites throughout Israel. More than 60,000 Palestinians areauthorized to work in Israel, and about 40,000 more work in Israel illegally. In mid-March, the Israeli government approved the admission of 16,500 newforeign workers to replace the banned Palestinian workers, bringing the totalto 90,000 legal workers and another 50,000 to 100,000 illegal foreignworkers. On March 19, the first of the new foreign workers were flown in from Thailand.The 238 farm laborers will pick oranges, vegetables and flowers. With nearly one in ten worker a non-Israeli, the country's labor ministerwarned that if the number of foreign workers continues to increase, Israel willexperience some of the same problems facing western Europe. An immigrationabsorption expert from Tel Aviv University predicted that, if foreign workerseventually bring their families, there may be a xenophobic reaction. Some foreign workers in Israel live in poor conditions, often without water oradequate sanitation. The city of Raanana, north of Tel Aviv, issued a ban inMarch on renting housing to foreign workers. Most foreign workers are recruited in their home countries by Israeliintermediaries and are paid less than the legal minimum wage--about $600 permonth compared with $1,500 per month. Most foreigners have one-year workcontracts. In 1995, foreign workers remitted about $470 million to their countries oforigin. The West Bank and Gaza depend on the Israeli economy for jobs and sales--Israelputs the daily dependence at $2 million per day, the Palestinians at $3 millionper day in wages and jobs, and another $6 million in indirect sales that resultfrom the expenditure of wages earned in Israel. Israel's economy is about 30 times that of the West Bank and Gaza, and untilrecently about one-fourth of the Palestinian labor force of 280,000 worked inIsrael, usually in construction for about $35 per day. Palestinian officials said on March 24 that they are trying to establishworldwide trade accords to lessen the area's dependence upon Israel. APalestinian delegation is planning to negotiate trade accords with other Arabstates. The US has agreed to provide $110 million worth of equipment to help Israelbuild and monitor a 124-mile fence to separate the West Bank from Israel. Thefence is designed to prevent terrorism and "illegal immigration" from theterritory controlled by the Palestinian authority. Israel has received about 700,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union since1989. Per capita income reached $15,500 in 1995 -- equal to that of Spain,Ireland and New Zealand.

First Party leader Winston Peters said that New Zealand wanted immigrants whowere committed to the country, and would make a contribution to New Zealand,but not wealthy people who would spend most of their time overseas. NewZealand first has only 3 seats in the 99 person Parliament, but 17 percentsupport in opinion polls. The Labour Party leader criticized Peters for his anti-immigrant views butblamed the government for creating the climate for such sentiment. Thegovernment, she said, has allowed in sharp increase in immigration withoutbeing prepared for the influx. Some Maoris fear that wealthy Asians settling in New Zealand will purchase muchof the country, jeopardizing tribal land settlement that dates back to Europeancolonization last century. A recent survey found that 51 percent of the voters believe New Zealand has toomany Asians, even though they make up less than 0.5 percent of its 3.5 millionpeople.
