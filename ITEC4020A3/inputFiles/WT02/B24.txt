Following are several of theprovisions LDA supports: Changes related to the IEP, including: A. Participation of parents in eligibility and placement decisions andregular and special education teachers, where appropriate, in the IEPteam. B. Inclusion of short term goals or other benchmarks to measureprogress. C. Requirement for objective measurements of the child's progresstowards attaining annual goals. D. Inclusion of required accommodations. E. Consideration of the emotional and behavioral aspects of a child'slearning disability as well as the communication needs of the child. F. The addition of the child's teacher to those who may reconvene theIEP team to consider additional strategies for working with a child withbehavioral problems. G. The requirement that the IEP team consider the appropriateness andimplementation of the child's IEP before a change in placement. H. Reevaluations focused on the child's continued need for specialeducation and related services, not on whether or not the child has adisability. The retention of the current disability categories and the expansion ofthe use of the term "developmental delay" for children aged 3 to 9.Participation of children with disabilities in standardized assessments,with accommodations if necessary. Dropping the age for the beginning of transition considerations to age14. The requirement that parents be offered pre-due process mediation andproviding that either party can withdraw after a good faith effort hasbeen made. The removal of the waiver provisions for model LEA programs and under Part H. At the same time, LDA has concerns about other provisions within thesebills including: Consolidation of discretionary programs without adequate assurancethat the mission of these important programs will continue and that theoverall authorization level will be maintained. Changes in incidental benefit requirements and establishment of acoordinated services system which allows IDEA funds to be used forstudents without disabilities. Any new law that might result in coercion of parents to "voluntarily" use their private insurance to pay for related services. Finally, LDA is not prepared to support legislation which includesprovisions that would: Alter state and local funding formulas to move away from the current childcount provision. Allow state education agencies to suspend highest professional standardsfor special education teachers and related services providers. Allow a local education agency to reduce the level of expenditures forspecial education when the reduction is attributable to the departure, byretirement or otherwise, of special education personnel. Change due process procedures. These procedures are essential to ensurethe rights of parents and individuals with disabilities. LDA is reluctantto support any changes in procedural safeguards unless such changescontinue to protect the rights and enhance the educational opportunitiesof children with learning disabilities. Allow cessation of educational services to any student with disabilities.LDA agrees that a student with disabilities who brings a weapon or drugsto school, when such behavior is found not to be a manifestation ofhis/her disability, may be removed from his/her current placement andplaced in an alternative placement. However, LDA strongly believes thatcessation of educational services is harmful not only to the student andhis/her family, but also to the community at large.

During the 1990-1991 school year 2,117,087 childrenin public schools were identified as having learning disabilities. Thisis more than fifty percent of the total number of students identified inall disability categories. "Full inclusion", "full integration", "unifiedsystem", "inclusive education" are terms used to describea popular policy/practice in which all students with disabilities, regardlessof the nature or severity and need for related services, receive theirtotal education within the regular classroom in their home school. The Learning Disabilities Association of America does not support "fullinclusion" or any policies that mandate the same placement, instruction,or treatment for all students with learning disabilities. Many studentswith learning disabilities benefit from being served in the regular classroom.However the regular education classrom is not the appropriate placementfor a number of students with learning disabilities who may need alternativeinstructional environments, teaching strategies, and/or materials thatcannot or will not be provided within the context of a regular classroomenvironment. LDA believes that decisions regarding educational placement of studentswith learning disabilities must be based on the needs of each individualstudent rather than administrative convenience or budgetary considerations,and must be the result of a cooperative effort involving educators, parents,and the student, when appropriate. LDA strongly supports the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act(IDEA) which mandates: a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environmentappropriate for the student's specific learning needs. a team-approved individualized education program (IEP) that includescurrent functioning levels, instructional goals and objectives, placementand services decisions, and procecures for the evaluation of program effectiveness. a placement decision must be made on an individual basis and consideredonly after the development of the IEP. a continuum of alternative placements to meet the need of studentswith disabilities for special education and related services a system for the continuing education of regular and special educationand related services personnel to enable these personnel to meet the needsof persons with disabilities. LDA believes that the placement of all children with disabilitiesin the regular classroom is as great a violation of IDEA as the placementof all children in separate classrooms on the basis of their type of disability. LDA urges the U.S. Department of Education and each state to movedeliberately and reflectively in school restructuring, using the Individualswith Disabilities Education Act as a foundation-- mindful of the best interestsof all children with disabilities.

Amplification--LDA Resolution (1) The developing brain of the child before birth and in early life isparticularly vulnerable to insult from any substances A toxic agent can affect the developing nervous system in many ways,including changes in cell structure, function, production, migration, anddifferentiation; and/or with the processes of axon and dendrite growth,neurochemical mechanisms, synapse formation, and myelination.[l-2] (2) Neurotoxic effects in the developing brain can be both quantitativelyand qualitatively different from effects in mature adult systems. In the case of neurotoxicity, children are not "little adults." A safeexposure cannot be estimated by extrapolating from adult toxic exposures,because the developing brain may respond quite differently to anexposure, than does a mature adult brain.[3] (3) Such toxicants can produce permanent alterations in brain developmentand function, with subsequent effects on learning abilities and behavior. The American Academy of Pediatrics has noted that early exposure to lowlevels of lead incurs a risk of sustained developmental delays andimpaired cognition even in clinically asymptomatic children Theyrecommend directing pediatric efforts to routine screening, preventionpractices and regulatory action.[4] The Director of the Center forResearch on Mother and Children at the National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development (NICHD) has pointed out that prenatal exposure tomany drugs, xenobiotic agents and toxic substances can cause measurableand permanent behavioral abnormalities in the absence of visiblestructural change or measurable physiological change.[5] (4) "At least 25% of hazardous industrial chemicals for whichoccupational exposure limits have been set, have demonstrated neurotoxiceffects" [6] The safe exposure limits of 167 of 588 chemicals set by the AmericanConference of Government Industrial Hygienists were set on the basis oftheir neurotoxicity.[7] The 1984 report by the Office of TechnologyAssessment estimates that about one fourth of the chemicals encounteredin industry have neurotoxic effects. [8] (5) To date, only a small number of chemicals have been evaluated fortheir potential to adversely affect brain development and function. Reports from the Office of Technology Assessment and from the GeneralAccounting Office to the U.S. Congress make this point.[9-10] There are a few chemicals and one pesticide for which EPA hasdeveloped Test Rules for developmental neurotoxicity, one of the first in1986.[11] However, no reference dose has been established fordevelopmental neurotoxicity as yet, and no action or regulation hasresulted from these data. Testing for structural malformations is now required, while testingfor injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) is not. Yet neurologicdamage is a much more frequent outcome of chemical exposure than physicalmalformations are. The result of our present regulatory policy is that weare testing agents for neurotoxicologic effects on human subjects withouttheir consent or knowledge.[12] FDA cannot require any toxicity testing for cosmetics[9] and does notrequire developmental neurotoxicity data in the evaluation of drugs orfood additives. (6) Many national and international organizations have called forneurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral testing for pesticides, foodadditives, drugs, and priority chemicals. The World Health Organization recommended in 1984 that efforts wereneeded to include neurobehavioral tests for routine use in developmentaltoxicity evaluation.[13] The Interagency Committee on LearningDisabilities, mandated under the Health Research Extension Act of 1985reported to Congress in 1987. The report recommended that data ondevelopmental neurotoxicity are needed to protect health anddevelopment.[14] Japan requires several tests for developmental toxicity,including behavior, in the evaluation of chemicals, especiallypharmaceutical drugs.[l5] The U.S. Congressional Committee on Agriculture Report pursuant to theFIFRA Act Amendment of 1988 requested that EPA intensify the degree ofneurotoxicity testing in its pesticide program, including testing relatedto prenatal and neonatal effects. (7) Collaborative behavioral teratology studies have provided evidence ofthe validity and reliability of neurobehavioral lest methods. A major study was conducted in this country to check the comparability ofa number of behavioral tests, across six different laboratories[16]; inEurope, five laboratories in four countries collaborated in theevaluation of the detection levels of different test methods[17]; bothshowed comparable sensitivities for the behavioral test batteries,automated test systems, and the neurochemical assays. (8) Two federal agency reports to Congress have identified a number ofpolicy issues and options for Congressional action. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) Report to the Congressdiscusses the risk posed by neurotoxic substances, and evaluates theFederal research and regulatory programs now in place to assess theserisks. The OTA Report found that neurotoxic chemicals constitute a majorpublic health threat, and that the social and economic consequences ofadverse effects are potentially very large.[9] The US General Accounting Office (GAO) Report to the Senate Committeeon Governmental Affairs identified 30 chemicals that are of high concernfor reproductive and developmental effects. The report found that therewas insufficient protection from current risk assessment decisions, andthat 2/3 of the decisions were not based on reproductive or developmental(including neurodevelopmental) data. The GAO report states, We believeit is unlikely that regulation based on other diseases will protectagainst reproductive and developmental outcomes in all cases.[10] References Sibergeld, E.K.(1986).

According to the U.S. Department of Education,1 in 5 American adults is functionally illiterate. Three-fourths of the unemployed lack sufficient skills to function successfully in thenation's work force. There are many reasons for illiteracy - one cause is neurologically-based learning disabilities which have not been recognized and/or dealt with appropriately. Many children, including children with learning disabilities, do notlearn to read in the first grade because they lack the basic readiness skills or the school's method is not appropriate for them. They may be allowedto fail for two or three years without effective intervention. Unless these children are identified early and appropriate instruction provided they may be passed along in school until basic reading instruction is no longer available. Quality reading programs must be available across the age range if we are to significantly reduce illiteracy. While accommodations may beappropriate, they must not be substituted for direct reading instruction. Common educational practice is for schools and adult literacy programs to adopt a single method for teaching reading, with the assumption that it will be effective for everyone. Research indicates that some students withlearning disabilities need a multisensory phonics approach, with instruction in phonological awareness; some students need a more meaning-based approach; while other students need interventions to address comprehension problems. For many students a combination of approaches is effective. LDA EMPHASIZES THAT NO SINGLE READING METHOD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES. LDA believes that illiteracy is a national crisis. It is LDA's position that to effect a significant increase in reading achievement for all people the following elements must be in place: a variety of methods for teaching reading in schools (in regular and special education) and in adult literacy programs, intensive teaching of reading, written language, and spelling in elementary and secondary schools, screening and diagnostic programs to identify students with reading disabilities, evaluation of program effectiveness that goes beyond mandated periodic testing, teacher certification requirements for elementary, secondary and special education teachers include substantive courses in reading methodologies, individualized reading programs for students with learning disabilities, and a strong commitment to research which will identify causes/prevention of reading failure and effective interventions. LDA recognizes that reading is crucial to success in school, to realizing one's potential, and to becoming a productive member of society. Therefore, every person must be given the opportunity to learn to read. Appropriate reading programs must be available to all ages... it is never too late to learn to read.

LDA agrees that students,including students with learning disabilities, whose violent behavior isa danger to themselves or others must be immediately removed from the currentschool setting. LDA also supports current law which ensures that studentswith learning disabilities so removed remain entitled to a free appropriatepublic education, as provided through the Individualized Education Programprocess. LDA is concerned about misperceptions that students with disabilitiesare disproportionately involved with violence in schools and that schoolscan do little or nothing to discipline those few students with disabilitieswho do exhibit violent behavior. Nothing in the limited data availableindicates that there is any disproportionate relationship between studentswith disabilities and violence in schools. Further, as stated above, currentlaw provides more than adequate procedures to appropriately disciplinestudents with learning disabilities. Schools must intervene early, using techniques such as behavior managementstrategies to prevent violence in schools. The U.S. Department of Educationreports that schools which have effectively implemented models for classroomand behavior management practices have greatly reduced or eliminated entirelythe need for subsequent interventions. LDA believes that such strategiesare essential so that students whose learning disabilities may make themvulnurable in a volatile school environment may benefit from their educationalprogram. LDA recognizes that a free appropriate public education in the leastrestrictive environment is only possible in violence-free schools. Therefore,LDA is committed to working toward that end with all parties interestedin ensuring safe schools for all children.

The umbrellaterm "assistive technology" as used in P.L. 100-407 (The AssistiveTechnology Act) can describe both devices and services. Appropriate assistivetechnology for students with learning disabilities can include but is notlimited to computers, taped books, spellers, tape recorders, readers, calculatorsand electronic date books. Devices (or equipment) may be high tech (usingsophisticated electronics, for example) or low tech (such as an abacusfor math computation or a grip for a pencil). Equipment or strategies developedfor individuals with other disabilities may be appropriate. The key isto determine the functional limitation of the disability and to find anappropriate accommodation. Definition As defined in P L. 101-476 (IDEA, the Individuals with DisabilitiesEducation Act), the term "assistive technology device" means"any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquiredcommercially off the shelf, modified, or customized that is used to increase,maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities."In the same legislation, the term "assistive technology service"is defined as "any service that directly assists and individualwith a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistivetechnology device." Individualized Education Plans Both devices and services can be written into an IEP (IndividualizedEducation Plan) if the IEP team determines that assistive technology isnecessary for the student to receive a free, appropriate education andthe team designates assistive technology as either special education ora related service. The need for assistive technology must be consideredlike other needs, on a case-by-case basis. Although there are few opportunitiesfor assistive technology assessments and few qualified assessors, assessmentscan be requested through the IEP. IEPs that include assistive technologyshould be written so that students have access to these accommodationsnot only for in-class work, but also for projects and for all types oftests. In addition, Dr. Judy Schrag, (Office of Special Education Programs),in a policy letter dated November 27, 1991, states that assistive technologyneed not be restricted solely to in-school use. Lack of availability orcost cannot be used as excuse for not providing what is deemed necessaryby the IEP team as long as the need is related to education. To supportthe need for assistive technology, parents and professionals should documentprecisely how the student benefits educationally. For instance, documentationcould include information such as: "Mary usually takes 1 hour to do8 math problems. With a calculator, she can do the same number of problemsin 20 minutes." Should the use of assistive technology be denied,parents have a right to appeal the decision through mediation or due process. Employment and Assistive Technology Individuals and employers can get help in identifying appropriateassistive technology and/or accommodations in the workplace by contactingthe Job Accommodations Network (JAN) at 1-800-526-7234. Consultants canprovide comprehensive, up-to-date information about accommodations, devicesand strategies. Calls to JAN are confidential. Assistive Technology Projects P.L. 100-407 (Technology-related Assistance for Individuals WithDisabilities Act of 1988) provides an avenue for all individuals with disabilities,including those with learning disabilities, to explore the use of assistivedevices and to access services. The Tech Act (P.L. 100-407) focuses onconsumer involvement and allocates funds for a maximum of 10 years to statesto help overcome barriers to appropriate selection, acquisition, and usageand to make assistive technology more accessible. Pursuant to the passageof the Act, projects in all 50 states have been funded. Generally the projectsare to provide access to computerized information on the use of assistivetechnology, develop demonstration centers where individuals with disabilities,may go to try out different pieces of equipment, provide consultants,to help individuals make informed decisions about equipment, provide referral services, and provide training to both individuals with disabilitiesand others. The funded projects in the various states are operated in either thestate vocational rehabilitation services office, the department of education,the University-Affiliated Program, or by a coalition of service providingagencies at the state level. The state department of education should beable to provide information to help individuals locate the project in eachstate.

January 1966 "Okay, class, before you open your science book to page 95 forthe next lesson, get out your homework from yesterday, and put it in theright hand corner of your desk for me to review; then we'll be ready tostart." Ron takes out his social studies book and stares into space.Why didn't Ron follow the teacher's directions? Not listening? Distracted?Not paying attention? Poor conduct? Hearing loss? Any of these explanationsis possible. Or maybe Ron hears the sound, but has a problem processingor understanding what is said to him particularly when the language usedis complex, spoken rapidly, or is lengthy, and when there's a lot to lookat and lots of noise around him. The inability to understand spoken languagein a meaningful way in the absence of what is commonly considered a hearingloss is called a central auditory processing problem. Other terms thathave been used interchangeably include: auditory comprehension deficit,central deafness, word deafness and auditory perceptual processing dysfunction. Frank Musiek, audiologist and researcher in this area, has describedcentral auditory processing as, "How well the ear talks to the brain,and how well the brain understands what the ear tells it." Evaluation by both an audiologist and a speech-language pathologistprovides important information about the person with central auditory processingproblems. An audiologist will evaluate a child's hearing and identify possibleprocessing problems. This professional will also make recommendations abouttreatment strategies concerning improving the listening environment andmonitoring any changes in hearing status. A speech-language pathologistcan evaluate a child's perception of speech and his/her receptive (understanding)and expressive (production) language use. These professionals and a child'steacher and parents can work together to determine the scope of the problemand the most effective treatment techniques. Two general treatment approaches have been used for central auditoryprocessing problems. One approach focuses on training certain auditoryand listening skills such as auditory discrimination (e.g., telling thedifference between peas and bees), localization of sound, sequencing sounds,or identifying a target sound in a noisy background. Training these skillsin isolation, however, may not help a child to understand complex language,such as a teacher's instructions, Therefore, another approach concentrateson teaching more functional language skills (e.g,, vocabulary, grammar,conversational skills) and uses strategies (e.g., visual aids and repeatingdirections) to facilitate the processing of language. Changes can also be encouraged at home and in the classroom to helpa child with central auditory processing problems: 1. Seating Select seating for the child away from auditory and visual distractionsto help focus and maintain attention. A seat close to the teacher and theblackboard and away from the window and the door may be helpful. 2. Setting Reduce external visual and auditory distractions. A large display ofposters or cluttered bulletin boards can be distracting. A study carrelin the room may help. Ear plugs may be useful for distracting noise froma heater or air conditioner, the pencil sharpener, or talking in the hallways.Check with an audiologist to find out if ear plugs are appropriate andwhich kind to use. Placing mats and cloth poster boards on classroom wallshas been shown to decrease the reverberation of noise. A structured classroomsetting may be more beneficial than an open classroom situation. To improve the listening environment, an audiologist may recommendthe use of a device that transmits the teacher's voice directly to thestudent's ear while blocking out background noise. The audiologist canprovide recommendations on the potential benefit of available options basedon the child's individual needs. 3. Speaking Gain the child's attention before giving directions. Speak slowly and clearly, but do not overexaggerate speech. Use simple, brief directions. Give directions in a logical, time-ordered sequence. Use words thatmake the sequence clear, such first, next, finally. Use visual aids and write instructions to supplement spoken information. Emphasize key words when speaking or writing especially when presentingnew information. Pre-instruction with emphasis on the main ideas to bepresented may also be effective. Use gestures that will clarify information. Vary loudness to increase attention. Check comprehension by asking the child questions or asking for a briefsummary after key ideas have been presented to be sure the child understands. Paraphrase instructions and information in shorter and simpler sentencesrather than by only repeating. Encourage the child to ask questions for further clarification. Make instructional transitions clear. Review previously learned material. Recognize periods of fatigue and give breaks as necessary. Avoid showing frustration when the child misunderstands a message. Avoid asking the child to listen and write at the same time. For children with severe central auditory processing problems, ask abuddy to take notes, or ask the teacher to provides notes. Tape recordingclasses is another effective strategy. Central auditory processing problems can affect learning particularlyin areas like spelling and reading. It is important to identify problemsearly and help the child acquire adaptive strategies to compensate. Ifyour child is a "poor" listener, frequently misunderstands speech,and has difficulty following directions, consult an audiologist or speech-language pathologist to determine if problems exist. * * * * * Compliments of American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. fact sheet index | home pageWT02-B24-45IA089-000954-B007-50http://www.ldanatl.org:80/factsheets/Dyslexia.html 206.86.190.251 19970109183743 text/html 5298HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 18:37:40 GMTServer: BESTWWWD/1.0MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5116Last-modified: Tue, 06 Aug 1996 04:49:47 GMT LDA Fact Sheet - Dyslexia Learning Disabilities Association FACT SHEET DYSLEXIA Educational Services Committee May 1996 What is dyslexia? Dyslexia is a learning disability in the area of reading. It isincluded in the category of "Learning Disabilities" in the Individualswith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). A person with dyslexia is someonewith average to above average intelligence whose problem in reading isnot the result of emotional problems, lack of motivation, poor teaching,mental retardation or vision or hearing deficits. The term dyslexia,however, is defined in different ways. While reading is the basic problem,people include different aspects of reading and related problems in theirdefinitions. For example: Problems learning to translate printed words into spoken words withease, beginning reading skills (decoding) Problems with word identification and/or reading comprehension Persons with dyslexia often reverse or mis-sequence letters within wordswhen reading or writing (b/d, brid/bird, on/no). They may also exhibitdifficulties with one or more of the following: Perceiving and/or pronouncing words Understanding spoken language Recalling known words Handwriting Spelling Written language Math computation What is reading? Reading is more than translating print into the spoken word (decoding).Reading is getting meaning from print. People who have not developedautomatic word recognition skills may have comprehension problems becausetheir energy is focused on identifying words rather than thinking aboutwhat they mean. Many of these children and adults read very slowly, oftenhaving to read things more than once to understand. Others have automaticword recognition skills, but cannot comprehend what they read. They mayalso have trouble understanding spoken language. What causes dyslexia? The basic cause of dyslexia is not known, however, much researchis being done to determine the problems underlying dyslexia. Research indicatesthat, in many cases, dyslexia is inherited and may occur in several membersof a family, Studies are being done to determine whether there are slightdifferences in the brains of people with dyslexia. Recent research indicatesthat many children having difficulty learning early reading skills (decoding)also have problems hearing individual sounds in words, analyzing wholewords into parts, and blending sounds into words (phonological processing). What should be done when dyslexia is suspected? Individuals suspected of having a reading disability should havea comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation including hearing, visionand intelligence testing. This evaluation should include all areas oflearning and learning processes, not just reading. The diagnostician(s)should then be able to determine whether there are additional learningdisabilities, make recommendations for teaching methods, and specify whetheradditional services are needed. In many schools children are not identified as having a reading disabilityuntil they have failed for an extended period because of a "formula"used to determine whether a student is "eligible" for specialservices. A child should not have to fail for two or three yearsto demonstrate evidence of a learning disability. What educational interventions are appropriate? If a child is diagnosed as having a reading disability (or dyslexia),it is important for parents to ask exactly what the problem is, what methodfor teaching reading is recommended, and why it was selected. There aremany approaches to teaching children with reading disabilities to read.Recent research on beginning reading skills indicated that many childrenhaving difficulty benefit from direct instruction in phonological processingand a multi-sensory phonics approach to reading. There is, however, nosingle method that will be effective with every child. A change in methodshould be considered if progress is not seen in a reasonable length oftime. Selecting the appropriate reading method for a child with a readingdisability is critical for success. Widely advertised reading programs that claim to be successful in teachingphonics/reading to anyone should be viewed with caution. It is highly recommendedthat before investing in these programs, research documenting their effectivenesswith individuals having diagnosed reading disabilities (dyslexia)be requested and reviewed.

Sometimes delayed developmentis first detected in the doctor's office. Warning signs are just that... Warnings. They don't necessarily meanthere are problems, but they should be discussed with your pediatricianor family physician at your next visit. If your toddler is developing normally,your doctor will be able to reassure you. Early intervention with a child who is behind in social, cognitive,fine motor, gross motor, and/or language development can make a world ofdifference. If you see some of these signs in your child, you may wantto contact your school district, primary physician or the local, stateor national LDA office for information. They can guide you on where tostart in determining whether your child has a developmental delay.

For students who have not graduated from high school, GED is ameans of obtaining a diploma that is equivalent to a high school diploma.Most secondary programs will accept the GED as equivalent to graduationfrom a regular high school program. The GED tests are designed to measurethe important knowledge and skills, usually learned during four years ofhigh school, that individuals may have obtained in a different manner. Who is eligible? Individuals who have not completed high school are eligible totake the GED with the following stipulations: The individual must be a resident of the state in which (s)he is takingthe test. The individual must not be enrolled in a public school. Applicants under the age of eighteen must apply to the State Departmentof Education, Adult Services, for permission to take the test. Individuals with Learning Disabilities must fill out an "Applicationfor Special Testing" and sign a release of information to have certainmedical and psychological records sent to GED for review. Which learning disability conditions may justify special accommodations? Learning Disability conditions which are eligible for special accommodationsinclude, but are not limited to, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyslogia,attention deficit disorder, receptive aphasia, distractibility, and hyperactivity.Documentation of the learning disability may be required. What modifications are available to individuals with learning disabilities? Possible modifications which can be obtained include: Audiocassette edition (with printed reference copy) Large print edition Use of a scribe Extended time Use of a calculator Frequent breaks Use of a private room for testing Is there a fee for taking the test? Generally, there is a modest fee for taking the test for the firsttime. An additional minimal fee is required for each retest. Are preparation classes and/or practice materials available? Free classes and materials are provided to prepare and individualto take the GED. Classes are usually held at local colleges or technicalschools and instruction is individualized to allow students to progressat their own rate. Individual practice materials are also available formPrentice Hall Regents Cambridge Adult Education Division of Prentice HallPublishers. What is the format of the GED tests? The GED tests consist of five tests in the areas of writing skills,social studies, science, literature and the arts, and mathematics. Thequestions in each of these tests require a general knowledge of the subjectsand the ability to think. There are few questions asking about facts, details,or definitions. What are the contents of the tests? Writing skills Part I (55 questions) Grading: 35% sentence structure, 35% usage, 30% for spelling, punctuation, capitalization Part II (essay) Social Studies (64 questions) Grading: 50% life science, 50% physical science Literature and the arts (45 questions) Grading based on interpretation of: 50% popular literature, 25% classicalliterature, 25% commentary on literature and the arts Mathematics (56 questions) Grading: 50% arithmetic, 30% algebra, 20% geometry What is passing? An individual must achieve a minimum total score of 225 pointson the five tests with no single score below 35. If a test is failed, thereis a waiting period before retesting. The waiting period depends on thetotal score that the individual has achieved. Retests are given afterthe five tests have been completed. Individuals may take as many testsat one session as desired. There is no time limit in completing the fivetests. The writing skills test requires the individual to complete an essayon an assigned topic. Who issues the diploma? The State Department of Education issues diplomas.

Parents are often attracted to home-schooling because of their disillusionmentwith the traditional school. New technology is also driving the increasein home-schooling. Sophisticated software is now available which evaluateshow much a child knows on a subject, designs lessons to fit the child'sneeds, and tests how well the lessons are learned. Although statistics are not readily available, most authorities believethat the number of children taught in home-schools is growing (estimatesrange from 500,000 to one million). In 1991 the National Home EducationResearch Institute conducted a national survey of parents who belongedto a home-school organization, and reported the following characteristicsof home-schooled children: average age, years 8.24 average grade 3.25 years taught at home 3.02 grade through which parents intend to home-educate child 10.88 attended public school before home-education 25.6% attended private school before home-education 24.4% attended public school after home-education 2.8% attended private school after home-education 3.0% Questions to ask when considering home-schooling Why teach children at home? Home-schooling allows individualizedplanning for each child-an opportunity to consider his/her needs and interestsand to tailor an educational program accordingly. It gives family membersan opportunity to spend more time together. Many families choose to becomeinvolved in home-schooling because of strong mora] or religious convictionsand their desire to convey these values to their children through theireducational experiences. Sometimes parents disagree with the educationalphilosophy of the public school system. How does home schooling affect socialization? Home-school advocatesmight argue that sending children to school does not guarantee the desiredsocial opportunities and outcomes and that the home can protect the childfrom negative influences. Parents serve as role models in the area of socialization.Other social opportunities for children being educated at home includeinteraction with peers after school and on week ends, dance/art classes,theater groups, music lessons, sports teams, church activities, etc. Manyhome-school parents belong to cooperatives which provide moral supportand information and often opportunities for children to study together,go on field trips, or take informal classes. What personal parental characteristics are needed for successfulhome-schooling? Parents who make this choice need to be flexible, patient,sensitive to the needs of the children and spouse, have organizationalability, a sense of humor, a desire to grow and learn, tenacity and determination,a desire to spend extended time with children, good family communications,financial resources and space, and be able to avail themselves of neededresources (materials, support groups, community opportunities, etc.) What is the financial impact of home schooling? When consideringhome-schooling, a side-by-side cost analysis of public, private and home-schoolingshould be made. Home-schooling requires the presence of one parent in thehome, eliminating a second income. Expenses may include curriculum, supportservices, resource materials, field trips, equipment, etc. Library servicescan be used to reduce resource material costs. What about legal requirements and record keeping? Laws regardinghome-schooling vary from state to state, thus it is essential to contactstate and local education agencies to determine legal requirements. Somestates require that files be kept including proof of immunization, worksamples, evaluation of progress, etc. How do home-educated children compare academically with other children?The National Home Education Research Institute reported in 1991, afterstudying 1500 home-educated students, that the average scores for thesechildren were at or above the 80th percentile in all categories (reading,listening, language, math, science, and social studies). Major standardizedtests used included the California Achievement Test, the Iowa Test of BasicSkills, and the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT). What about home-schooling students with learning disabilities?Children with learning disabilities represent challenges in finding educationalmethods that work, and thus present additional challenges to parents whoattempt to serve as their primary educator. The attraction of home-schoolingfor students with learning disabilities might be the ability to individualizefor his/her particular needs and to avoid the frustrations of trying tofind the right "fit" in the public school system. If home-schoolingis attempted for these children, parents must become informed about learningdisabilities and the resources which will address their unique needs.

November 1995 DEAR LEARNING DISABILITIES ASSOCIATION: Last week at my child's annual Individual Education Plan (IEP) meetingthe teacher said that students in special education programs will now receiveall special education services in inclusive general education classrooms.Last year my child received special education services for reading andwritten language in a resource room and made progress in both areas, Ido want my child in the regular classroom but I know he continues to needdirect and special help in reading and written language, If he does receiveall of his special education in the general education classroom and doesnot make progress what can I do? DEAR CONCERNED PARENT: The IEP meeting you attended was not legal. Before such a change indelivery of special education services, your school must do two things.First, a reasonable time prior to that meeting your school must have givenyou in writing notice of what they would be proposing; why they would proposeit; what alternatives they considered; why those alternatives were rejected;a description of each evaluation procedure, test, record or report theyused as a basis for their proposal; and any other relevant factors, [34CRF300.505]. Second, your child is also protected under Section 504 of theRehabilitation Act and The Americans with Disabilities Act. The schoolmust have conducted a re-evaluation of your child before proposing thischange, [34CRF 104.36]. You should demand both from your school districteven though it is after the fact. The purpose behind the philosophy of 'inclusion' is to make sure thatall children have the opportunity to be educated in the same environmentas their non disabled peers. For many students in special education, innovativeprograms in the regular classroom are fulfilling their needs. For otherstudents the opposite is true. Some children with learning disabilitiesand/or attention disorders learn better in a resource room. The decisionas to where your child receives special education must be basedon your child's individual needs, not by what program the school offers. According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),all special education students must be educated in The Least RestrictiveEnvironment (LRE), which is often mistakenly interpreted as meaning thatthe student must receive special education services in the regular or generalclassroom. The Least Restrictive Environment is decided after the individualneeds of the student are determined and written in the Individualized EducationPlan (IEP). If, with services in the regular classroom with the use ofsupplemental aids and services, your child is not meeting his/her goalson the IEP, then educating the child in a different environment like aresource room for some portion of the day is one factor that should betaken into consideration. The law is very clear in stating that in determiningthe LRE a full continuum of placements (regular classroom, resource room,self contained classroom placement etc.) must be available when makingplacement decision for students in special education programs. In the Individualswith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) under Continuum of alternative placements300.552(b)(2), the resource room is specifically mentioned as an environmentwhere special education services can be delivered. The ultimate goal in IDEA is to make sure that all students in specialeducation programs receive a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE).Since all special education FAPE decisions are supposed to be made accordingto your child's individual needs it is essential that you know and understandyour child's abilities and disabilities so that you will be able to givewell informed input as to what is appropriate or inappropriate in termsof goals, objectives, learning styles, environment and placement. One wayof doing this is to familiarize yourself with all of the evaluation reports.The evaluation report should include information on your child's abilitiesand disabilities and how they are impacting both academic areas and theentire school day. If you need a better understanding of the report, requestan appointment with your school psychologist, diagnostician or specialeducation teacher. To make sure that your child is benefiting from his current individualizededucation program (IEP) there are a number of things you can do: 1. Ask in writing for an IEP meeting. According to law every IEPmust state the students 'Current Level of Performance "in all areaswhere your child is identified as needing special education."This statement should accurately describe the effect of the child's disabilityon the child's performance in every area of education that is affected,including (i) academic areas (reading, math, communication, etc,), and(2) non academic areas (daily life activities, mobility, etc.)" [34CRF Sec. 300.345, Appendix e. Question 36]. Make sure that necessary academicperformance levels are addressed in a specific and meaningful way. If assessmentsin those are not current, request that they be done right away so thatthe IEP can properly address educational needs. Once the academic levelsare known, request that the special education teacher track the studentsprogress through frequent informal assessments. Have this frequent monitoringwritten as part of the IEP and also designate how often the assessmentsshould occur. The Supreme Court has stated [Board of Education v. Rowley(1982)] that "parents are to be involved in assessing the effectivenessof the program." So ask for things to be written into the assessmentthat You can observe and report on, such as homework, behavior, etc. 2. Keep samples of all of your child's homework, tests, quizzes andclasswork. This will help keep you aware of progress and might come inhandy later on for use as documentation. 3. Find out how the special education services are being delivered toyour child in the regular classroom. How much time on a daily basis does the special education teacher spendin the general education classroom? How much time does the special education teacher spend with your childgiving direct instruction? Does the teacher work one on one with your child or with small groupsof students? How many children are in the group? Is the special education teacher certified in the area of learningdisabilities? Is the instruction and curriculum designed with your child's educationalneeds in mind? Are learning strategies and organizational skills part of the dailyinstruction? How does this compare with the special education your child receivedlast year? 4. If your child's academic skills do not seem to be progressing aswell this year in a general education classroom setting as they were lastyear in a resource room setting, ask the school system for written justificationexplaining on what they based their change of environmental placement decision,Since the school system made the change in placement from a resource roomto the general education classroom based on a blanket policy of inclusionwithout taking into consideration the individual needs of your child, itis up to them to prove that this is the correct learning environment foryour child based on his individual needs. 5. If you continue to feel that your child needs a different specialeducational setting, request in writing for your child to receive servicesin a special education resource pull out program. State that you are requestingthat the school change the placement and provision of a free appropriateeducation for your child and that they answer your letter within thirtydays. The school must then notify you in writing if they refuse to changeyour child's placement. That notice must tell you: (1 ) What they are refusing,(2) Why they are refusing it, (3) What alternatives they considered, (4)Why they rejected those alternatives, (5) Every test, record, examinationor other report that forms the basis for their refusal, and (6) Any otherrelevant factors. If the school district will not issue such written notice,file a written complaint with your state education agency. 6. Ask in writing for an independent evaluation at public expense onthe issue whether reasonable educational outcomes can be achieved underthe current IEP and ask for the suggestions of names of independent evaluatorsthe school would recommend to perform the service privately. If you arenot familiar with names on the list contact your local Learning DisabilitiesAssociation chapter for information. 7. Work with your local LDA chapter or other parents to make a presentationto your school board on the lack of continuum of placements/different learningenvironments and what the law mandates. It is hoped that the IEP team will work with you in making sure thatyour child is progressing in his educational program and that if a differentsetting for his education becomes necessary that the team will make therecommendation to change the environment where special education servicesare carried out. Then steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 (as listed above) will not beneeded. It is important for everyone to remember that full inclusion isa philosophy, not a mandate supported by law. With that thought in mindall children in special education programs should be able to receive afree appropriate public education (FAPE), designed to meet their individualneeds. fact sheet index | LDA home pageWT02-B24-50IA089-000954-B007-189http://www.ldanatl.org:80/factsheets/Ed_Standards.html 206.86.190.251 19970109183857 text/html 9082HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 18:39:00 GMTServer: BESTWWWD/1.0MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 8900Last-modified: Tue, 06 Aug 1996 05:58:04 GMT LDA Fact Sheet - Educational Standards Learning Disabilities Association FACT SHEET Learning Disabilities and Educational Standards Educational Services Committee October, 1995 A major part of the educational reform is an emphasis on standards.Efforts to ensure higher levels of competence in students inevitably focuson higher and more rigorous standards. These increased standards are intendedto strengthen both student competence and teacher skills. Higher or more rigorous educational standards can effect students withlearning disabilities in significant ways. However, little data or researchyet indicates the effects on changes in standards. Often standards thatoffer the greatest promise for educational reform, raise the greatest concernfor individual students with learning disabilities. Thoughtful questionsneed to be asked about many areas in which there are proposed changes instandards. High school graduation standards. In many states and districts,more demanding courses (i.e. algebra, geometry, or foreign languages) arerequired for a diploma. Similarly, basic and vocational classes such asconsumer mathematics and slower paced regular classes that are awardedCarnegie units are being phased out because they are less challenging orthe teachers are needed to teach more advanced classes. Ask "If a student cannot pass one of these classes, can a coursesubstitution be written into the IEP and accepted toward thediploma?" High school competency testing. Some states use a passing scoreon a competency or exit exam as a graduation requirement. While some modificationsare permitted, others may not be allowed. Some newer examination formatsclaim to test reading by asking for a paragraph-length written response. Ask "Are appropriate modifications permitted? Are students withIEP's permitted to take an unmodified test if desired? Does the test formatallow the student with specific disabilities to show the ability beingtested?" Reporting standardized test results. Sometimes students withdisabilities are actively discouraged from participating in testing becauselower group scores may result. In other situations, students with disabilitiesare required to participate in testing which may be frustrating and self-defeatingeven when accommodations are provided. The National Center on Outcome Educationand Fair Test advocate the collection of data by disability category inorder to establish accountability. Ask "Are students discouraged from or pressured to participatein testing? How are test results reported? Are test scores a meaningfulmeasure of teaching skill? of learning?" Differentiated or tiered diplomas. Some states award attendancecertificates, standard diplomas, and advanced diplomas that each have differentcourse and competence requirements. Other states are eliminating all diplomasexcept the advanced diploma in order to ensure high standards. Ask "What impact will an IEP, competency testing, accommodations,course substitutions, or other factors have on the type of diploma received?How early must a student decide which diploma to seek? Will employment,vocational training, or college entrance be affected by the diploma(s)available? What value will be placed on the diploma that students withlearning disabilities receive?" Admission to apprenticeships and other postsecondary options.In order to ensure a perceived competence level, some unions, professions,and postsecondary programs establish criteria or entrance tests withoutprovision for accommodations or individualized consideration. Entranceinto a trade, for example, may require extensive written responses unlikethat needed for successful work in that trade. Ask "How can groups be Informed more accurately about the natureof learning disabilities and the individual differences that characterizethem? Can legal means be used to establish needed and appropriate flexibility?" Academic standards developed by professional groups. Organizationsof content specialists and educators have been asked to establish contentand teaching approaches for elementary curricula and high school courses. Ask "How can groups be informed more accurately about the natureof learning disabilities and the individual differences that characterizethem? How can parents and professionals knowledgeable about learning disabilitiesparticipate in the development of academic standards?" Formation of charter schools. The establishment of "charterschools" that use a specific alternative approach to education fora specified population with exemption from most state laws are being encouragedby some states. Ask "To what extent will students with disabilities be includedin or excluded from charter schools? If included, how will the rights ofstudents with disabilities be protected? If excluded, how will studentswith disabilities gain access to the education offered by charter schools?" Student test scores as a measure of educational success. Somestates, districts, and programs use achievement or competency scores tomeasure teacher success or compare success among school or school district. Ask "Is a test score useful as a single measure of teachingor learning success? How can test scores be most effectively used to improvelearning? Are the scores of students with learning disabilities included,excluded, or presented as a separate category?" Changes in teacher certification. Many states are changing theprocess and criteria for certifying or licensing teachers. Those with militaryor business backgrounds are provided alternative certification. Liberalarts and science content is emphasized over teaching methods and knowledgeof the specialized needs of students with disabilities. A private NationalBoard of Professional Standards is establishing voluntary certificationbased on portfolio and other evidence. Ask "Are general education teachers developing skills neededfor mainstreaming and inclusion? Are teachers for students with moderateand severe learning disabilities required to possess real competence inbasic skill instruction, clinical diagnostics, consultation, technology,collaboration, and transition? How are teachers who come from primarilyliberal arts, science, or alternative certification routes prepared towork with students who have learning disabilities? How do school systemconstraints or flexibilities and other factors effect the success of competentteachers?" Dropout rate. A pervasive concern is the effect that more rigorousstandards may have on self-esteem and thus, on the already high dropoutrate. Some students may be frustrated by academic criteria, competencytests, and other seemingly impossible expectations. The important motivationof a diploma as a key to postsecondary training and/or employment may alsoseem even less attainable. A probable result is increased drop out ratesamong students with learning disabilities. Ask "What procedures for collecting dropout data will be used?What special efforts will be made to encourage students with learning disabilitiesto stay in school? Will participation in sports, clubs, and other attractiveactivities be curtailed If specific academic criteria are not met?" * * * * * * * * LDA fully supports the efforts of educational reform to improve theskills, competence, and attitudes of America's students and workforce toincrease competitiveness within the world market. However, these effortsmust be balanced by the need to nurture the unique abilities and talentsof each individual with learning disabilities. The questions raised heremust be communicated to parents, professionals, taxpayers, legislators,and educational administrators before education reform is implemented.The future education of individuals with learning disabilities may be atstake.

In order toenter many academic and vocational programs, tests to assess abilities,aptitudes, and/or general knowledge are often required. Among the mostfrequently administered tests are the SAT and the ACT which are generallytaken in the eleventh and twelfth grades at specified places. Because coursesand grading standards vary widely from school to school, scores on standardizedtests help postsecondary programs compare the academic achievements ofstudents from different schools. These test scores, along with course grades,and other information about the student's academic background help collegeadmission officers evaluate how well prepared an individual is to do college-levelwork. Some high tech vocational schools also require this test. Both theSAT and ACT offer special accommodations for students with learning disabilities. SCHOLASTIC ASSESSMENT TESTS (SAT I) In 1994, the SAT changed both its name and its format. The new testis the SAT I: Reasoning Test. it is offered in March, May and June. Itis fundamentally similar to the earlier version, but features significantchanges that reflect recommendations from educators throughout the UnitedStates. The SAT I is a three hour test, primarily multiple-choice, thatmeasures verbal and mathematical abilities. The test consists of: two thirty minute sections and one 15 minute section that test vocabulary,verbal reasoning, and critical reading skills two thirty minute sections and one 15 minute section that test abilityto solve problems involving arithmetic, algebra, and geometry a thirty minute section of questions (either verbal or mathematics)that is used for a statistical process called equating and does not counttoward your score. (You will not know which is the equating section.) There is no longer a test of Standard Written English, Changes to theverbal sections include the following: More emphasis is placed on reading passages; the proportion of questionsrelated to these passages increased from less than 30% to more than 50%. Reading passages are longer - 400-850 words, as compared with the previousrange of 200-450 words. One or more of the tests' reading selections consists of a pair ofrelated reading passages, the second of which opposed, supports, or insome other way complements the point of view expressed in the first. Antonym questions have been eliminated. More total reading time is provided for the verbal sections of thetest, even though there are fewer verbal questions. Changes to the mathematical sections include the following: A new type of question requires students to produce their own responses,rather than choose from four or five answer choices. Students fill in theiranswers on special grids on the answer sheet. The use of calculators is allowed only on the mathematics sectionsof the SAT I: Reasoning Test and it is recommended that students take acalculator with them to the test. Four function, scientific, or graphingcalculators are acceptable. For information regarding special accommodations, contact a school counseloror write to: SAT Services for Students with Disabilities PO Box 6226 Princeton, NJ 08541-6226 The following accommodations may be requested: large type audio cassette with written form a reader a person to record answers magnifying glass extended time A student's counselor or other designated individual must certify thatthe student meets the eligibility requirements as set forth by the AdmissionsTesting Program (ATP). Documentation of the learning disability may berequested by ATP. Requests for special accommodations must be submittedat least six weeks earlier than a regular request. AMERICAN COLLEGE TESTING (ACT) The ACT is very similar to the SAT with both verbal and mathematicalsections. Requests for special accommodations must be made four to sixweeks prior to test date and a Request For ACT Assessment Special Testingmust be completed and sent with the request. To be eligible, a copy ofthe current IEP testing accommodations which states that the student cannottest under standard conditions must accompany the request form. There mustbe a re-diagnosis or reconfirmation of the disability within the last threeyears that the learning disability still exists and it must be done bya qualified professional whose credentials are appropriate to the disability.An IEP on file at the school within the last three years is generally acceptablereconfirmation. The LD diagnosis must be more specific than "learningdisabled" (e.g., attention deficit disorder, developmental readingdisorder, developmental arithmetic disorder, or other specific learningdisability). The following accommodations may be requested: extended time alternate test form which is consistent with test accommodations regularlyused by the student and required by the student's IEP audio cassette edition with regular-type copy four-function calculator a reader a person to record answers For additional information contact the school counselor or write: Special Testing - 61 ACT Universal Testing PO Box 4028 Iowa City, IA 52243-4028 Fact sheet Index | LDA Home Page WT02-B24-52IA089-000954-B007-235http://www.ldanatl.org:80/factsheets/RFBD.html 206.86.190.251 19970109183924 text/html 5322HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 18:39:27 GMTServer: BESTWWWD/1.0MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5140Last-modified: Wed, 18 Sep 1996 21:18:34 GMT LDA Fact Sheet - Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic Learning Disabilities Association FACT SHEET Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic September, 1996 Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic's services are available to anyonewith a documented print disability which includes learning disabilities.It serves students at all academic levels, as well as people who useeducational and professional materials to pursue careers or personalinterests.

My baby doesn't talkyet." "Everyone in our family was a late talker. My child will talk whenthe time is right." "Why worry now? Speech and language services will be availablewhen school starts." "Treatment? Looks like they are just playing games to us." You may have had similar thoughts or comments. Usually, there is concernabout a child's speech and language skills if there is no speech by theage of 1 year, if speech is not clear, or if speech or language is differentfrom that of other children of the same age. WHAT IS EARLY IDENTIFICATION? It is estimated that 2% of all children born each year will have adisabling condition, Many of these children will have speech and/or languagedelays and disorders that may have a significant effect on personal, social,academic, or vocational life. Although some children will develop normalspeech and language skills without treatment by the time they enter school,it is important to identify those who will not. Many people falsely believethat speech-language treatment cannot and should not begin until a childbegins to talk. Yet, research has shown that children know a great dealabout their language even before the first word is said. For example, childrencan distinguish between their native language and a foreign language, usedifferent nonverbal utterances to express different needs, and imitatedifferent patterns of speech through babbling. Early identification includes the evaluation and treatment providedto families and their children under three years old who have, or are atrisk for having, a disability or delay in speech, language, or hearing.A child can quickly fall behind if speech and language learning is delayed. Early identification increases the chances for improving communicationskills. WHO SHOULD BE EVALUATED? Children identified as at-risk or high-risk, such as those from neonatalintensive care units, should be tested early and at regular intervals.Other risk factors include diagnosed medical conditions, such as chronicear infections; biological factors, such as fetal alcohol syndrome; geneticdefects, such as Down Syndrome; neurological defects, such as cerebralpalsy; or developmental disorders, such as delayed language. Children withno obvious high risk factors should be evaluated if their speech and languageis not similar to that of other children of the same age. HOW IS THE EVALUATION DONE? Evaluation may be formal or informal and include any combination ofstandardized tests; direct observation of play and interaction with caregivers;reports by parents, teachers, or physicians; and collection and detailedanalysis of spontaneous speech samples. Several sessions as well as ongoingevaluation may be required to obtain enough information to make an accuratediagnosis. The early intervention team may consist of the speech-languagepathologist, audiologist, psychologist, neurologist, electrophysiologist,otolaryngologist, pediatrician, nurse, and social worker. Because speech-languagedelays and disorders may be due to a variety of causes, each professionalmakes valuable contributions to the evaluation. WHAT IS SPEECH LANGUAGE TREATMENT? From the results of the evaluation, certain services may be recommended.Prevention includes those children who have been identified as at-riskfor a communication delay or disorder because of low birthweight. Servicesmay be provided before a specific diagnosis has been made. Remediationincreases function in identified areas and may serve to prevent other relatedproblems. For example, remediation of a language disorder can help offsetlearning disabilities. Language is taught in a natural setting. It is presented at the child'sdevelopmental level. Responses are consistently stimulated. Output is rewarded.Play may be used to teach communication, language models or rules of conversation,such as taking turns. If you are concerned about a possible speech-language delay or disability,consult a speech-language pathologist. A list of certified speech-languagepathologists in your area may be obtained by calling the American Speech-Language-HearingAssociation's toll-free HELPLINE at 1-800-638-8255. * * * * * Compliments of American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

It develops as a result of exposure to spoken language. Problemswith language development may not be recognized for a long time unlessthe child simply fails to begin talking. Oral language is the basis forlearning reading and written language and for benefitting from instructionin other areas. It is important to identify children whose language isnot developing normally so that more specific stimulation and actual interventioncan begin as early as possible. Language problems, like other learning disabilities, are called by severaldifferent names including: delayed language, language disorder, languagedisability, specific language disability, etc. Some people distinguishbetween children who appear to be developing all aspects of language ata slower rate (delayed language) and those who do not appear to be developinglanguage in the expected way or have uneven language development (languagedisability). Regardless of the label, language problems should be assessed.A language evaluation must include a hearing test since hearing loss isone reason for delayed language acquisition. Speech-Language Pathologiststypically do the testing for spoken language disabilities. When childrenare of school age, the evaluation must include the language of instructionand reading and written language. Like other types of learning disabilities, language disabilities differin type and severity. In young children there are many known milestonesthat can be observed by parents and preschool teachers. Some of these arelisted on the table below along with some activities to encourage languagedevelopment. Even mild problems in spoken language can have an impact on learningin school. A child should enter first grade with the majority of the languageneeded for learning. Problems in understanding language will affect almostevery aspect of school: following directions, learning vocabulary, understandinginstruction, reading comprehension, etc. Problems in using language areoften seen in children who do not understand. Some children understandspoken language but have difficulty expressing themselves. A common problemseen in expressive language is difficulty recalling words they know (wordretrieval problems). These children understand the word, know it when theyhear it, but cannot always call it up when they need it. These childrenmay say, "You know that thing you sweep the floor with"; "Iknow it, but I can't think of the word"; "Umm, umm, I forget";etc. Retrieval problems can make children unwilling to participate in classbecause they interfere with a child's demonstration of what he/she haslearned. For example, children may have learned color or letter names,but are unable to give the names when asked. These children can point tothe color or letter when the name is said to them. Some children have difficulty with spoken grammar. They omit words orword endings or get words in the wrong order. Some have difficulty puttingtheir ideas into words in an organized way. Problems in pronunciation of words can be the result of mishearing sounds(Starvation Army/Salvation Army), getting sounds in the wrong order (aminal/animal),or difficulty producing specific sounds (fum/thumb). Problems with thesound system of language have been reported in many children who have difficultylearning to read. While some speech sounds are acquired later than others,children who have many sounds they cannot make and are difficult to understandmay have later problems with phonics. Language activities with young children are fun for them and can stimulatemore language. Reading to children and talking about the pictures and the"story" is an important activity. Making certain new vocabularyis used in many ways and in different situations helps children learn newwords. It is important to have children's language evaluated if there is anyconcern. Too often, parents are told "He'll outgrow it" or "Justwait, she'll talk when she's ready". This is not good advice whenthe child is not doing what is expected for his/her age. Speech-LanguagePathologists can determine what the problem is, if any, and make recommendationsfor working with the child. Oral language is important for social developmentand effective communication, as well as being the foundation for schoollearning. Problems should not be overlooked or disregarded.

"What are the children going to do thissummer" is a question that parents now ask long before summer arrives. The purpose of this Fact Sheet is to help parents find a program thatis suitable for their child. Traditional and nontraditional summer programsare listed to allow a child opportunities for exploration of interestsand maybe the development of a hobby during summer vacation. Some of the programs listed require collaboration between school districtsand other government agencies such as city or county parks and recreationdepartments. The collaboration may be detailed in a formal Inter-GovernmentalAgreement (IGA). A school district may provide a building or multi-purposeroom for a summer program, pay the utilities and provide custodial services.The other agency, either city or county, may provide the trained staffand special equipment. If your school district does not have a summer program, you might beable to start one for next summer by sending a formal request or a petitionto your district school board or committee. Extended School Year (ESY) provides a continuation of specialeducation and/or related services beyond a regular school year if the needis documented in a student's IEP (Individualized Educational Program).Key factors in determining eligibility for ESY are regression andrecoupment. Regression is a return to a lower level of functioningin those skills or behaviors on the student's IEP. Recoupment isthe amount of time a student needs to regain the knowledge lost over aperiod of time. Review your child's IEP for the last few years to determine if reasonableeducational progress has been made in the goals and objectives followinginterruptions in service due to illness, vacations, etc. If you think yourchild may be eligible for ESY, ask for a review of placement and requestESY services. Some school districts provide ESY services a few weeks following theend of the current school year. Others provide ESY services prior to thebeginning of the next school year. Summer school remedial or enrichment classes are offered by manyschool districts or community schools. Some of these classes may be appropriatefor students with learning disabilities. Tuition or registration fees areusually charged. School-parent groups or educational enrichment foundationsfrequently allocate money to assist families in paying summer school fees.Some SEAs (State Education Agencies) require students below a certain achievementlevel to attend summer school. Private schools or learning centers offering specialized instructionto students with learning disabilities, learning differences or languagedevelopment deficits are available in many cities. These facilities chargefees for services, sometimes on a sliding scale. Check listings in the yellow pages of your phone book under headingssuch as Schools-Academic-Secondary and Elementary or Schools-Academic-SpecialEducation. Your local or state LDA affiliate, The Directory of Facilitiesand Services for the Learning Disabled (Academic Therapy) or TheComplete Learning Disabilities Directory (Grey House) may be of helpin locating a school or center. Universities or colleges sometimes have specialized summer classesfor high school students with learning disabilities. The classes usuallyallow for the earning of college credits while becoming familiar with thecollege environment and participating in specially structured programs.Check with the disabled student resource center at your local college oruniversity. Summer PreCollege Programs for Students with Learning Disabilitiesmay be obtained from HEATH Resource Center, One Dupont Circle, Ste. 800,Washington, D.C. 20036-1193, (202) 939-9320 or (800) 544-3284. Various departments or colleges within a university system may offerspecialty camps in astronomy, chemistry, computers, math or science. Many colleges and universities offer residential and day sport camps(tennis, basketball, baseball, football and soccer) with college sportstars in attendance. One major university is offering a month-long Sports-0-Ramathrough their School of Health Related Professions, Department of Exerciseand Sport Sciences. Contact the sports information office at your localcollege or university for more information on offerings in your area. Libraries have traditionally offered summer reading programs.If your child has a reading or comprehension disability, ask if he/shecan participate in the program through taped children's books or if youcan read the books to the child. The need for expanded services and community outreach has increasedthe scope of programs offered at many libraries: orientation classes forusing the library; story hours for children and for families; programsin music, art, history and travel; and specialty classes. One major library system is offering a junior high/middle school survivalcourse for students and their parents, in separate sessions. The classesdeal with organizational skills, coping with class schedules, peer pressuresand development/maturity issues. Recreational programs offered by school districts in conjunctionwith city or county parks and recreation departments are available in manyparts of the country. Games, team and individual sports, table games, artsand crafts, dancing, environmental studies and special events make up theusual programs. Specialized day-camps offered by therapeutic recreation unitsof parks and recreation departments provide recreation programs for studentswith disabilities. Day camps for children and pre-teens, teen social groups,weekend outings, dances, special events, hiking and swimming classes areroutinely offered. The day camps are sometimes co-sponsored by school districts throughan IGA. Frequently the day-camps are offered at no cost to the parentssince municipal or county tax dollars fund the programs. Many day-care centers offer day-camp experiences for children up toabout age 10. Athletic and fitness clubs also offer recreation programsfor students, many times with reduced rates for multiple children in afamily. Museums and zoos may have summer programs within their specialtyareas. Some art museums offer classes in cartooning, ceramics, drawing,painting, photography and sculpture. Some historical museums help childrendevelop an understanding of the history of their immediate area or statethrough hands-on lessons. A Directory of Summer Camps for Children with Learning Disabilitiescan be obtained from the Learning Disabilities Association of America for$5.25. Your local or state LDA affiliate may also be able to provide informationon residential summer camps. If you consider a residential camp, it's wise to include the child inthe decision. You may want to ask the camp for a local reference so thatyour child can talk with another camper and you can discuss your concernswith the parent. Factors you may want to consider are: the training ofthe staff in working with children with learning disabilities, the structureof the program, the opportunity for a child to maintain skills in reading,the dispensing of medication, accessibility of medical treatment, how disciplineis handled and staff to camper ratio. Cooperative "intern" arrangements with friends or understandingneighbors are especially good in more remote areas. Each parent agreesto take the other's child for a particular period of time to teach a skill:cooking, pet grooming, child-care, computers, wood working, horsemanship,etc. A child might be able to develop several different skills during thesummer and have fun too! Miscellaneous opportunities for recreation and training are availablethrough organized sports programs (Little League); Boys and Girls Clubs;Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts; Campfire; the Salvation Army; YMCAs and YWCAs;hospital volunteer activities (Candy Stripers); computer camps; specializedskills camps such as boating, swimming, archery, tennis, and horsebackriding; trail building and maintenance with the U.S. Forest Service; theexploration of interests and hobbies; and, volunteer activities workingwith younger children or seniors.

The reauthorization of Public Law 94-142, now referred to as the Individualswith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, PL 101-476), in 1990, left no questionsas to the necessity for including transition services in the educationalprogram for all students with disabilities. In Section 602(a)(20) of IDEA,the need for stating specific strategies to effect successful transitionis mandated (paragraph D). Transition planning must be included in theIndividualized Education Program (IEP) beginning at age sixteen and continuinguntil the student leaves school, possibly as late as age twenty-one. Thetransition goals are to be specified in an Individualized Transition Plan(ITP) as part of the IEP process. The ITP itself may be outlined in a separatedocument that is considered to be part of the IEP, or the ITP goals canbe specified in the main IEP document. In high schools, transition services have traditionally been availableonly to the most promising students. High school guidance counselors spendapproximately thirty per cent of their time working with the students whoare college-bound. Legislation now demands that students with disabilities(including students with learning disabilities) who may or may not be college-boundhave the same level of services available to them. Providing transitionservices within the school may require that not only the guidance counselorand the special educator be part of the IEP team. Regular education personnel,vocational educators, speech and language professionals and other specialistsmay need to provide information or participate in writing the IEP to makethe planning process as comprehensive as possible. Beyond simply meeting the mandates of the law, transition planning requiresa change in how school personnel view students with disabilities and howthey prepare those students for adulthood. Simply moving students forwardwithin the school system does not provide the type of guidance and preparationnecessary for transition to adult roles in the community. Clear and specificgoals must be identified early. The law stipulates that should there bea need, transition planning can begin as early as age fourteen. Many transitionspecialists, however, maintain that even age fourteen is very late andthat planning should begin as soon as the disability is identified. The student and the parents must be involved in the ITP process. A widerange of options should be considered based on the student's interests,skills, and abilities, not just the student's disabilities. Also, the needfor services beyond what the school provides must be considered and appropriaterepresentatives from the community should be part of the ITP process. Appropriatemembers of the community may include persons from Vocational Rehabilitation,potential employers, service agency representatives, and personnel frominstitutions of higher education. Even though outside agencies may participate in the process, it is stillthe local education agency (i.e. the school system) that has ultimate responsibilityfor implementing the plan. Should outside agencies not provide the supportrequired, the school system then is required to reconvene the IEP teamto identify alternative strategies to meet the objectives outlined in theIEP (34 C.F.R. Section 300.347). Transition planning, used effectively, can increase the number and typeof options open to students with learning disabilities. By accurately assessingstudents' interests, skills, and abilities early, students, parents, educatorsand other professionals can work together to make sure that all schoolexperiences help move students toward successful adulthood.

Despite the many good provisions in the bill and theuncertainty about what the 105th Congress might do with theReauthorization of IDEA, on Sept. 25, LDA, along with other disabilityorganizations (ASHA, CED, NASP, NESS, NPND, The Arc, and UPCA) and regulareducation groups (the American Association of School Administrators andthe Council of Great City Schools) had asked Senator Frist to postponepassage of IDEA until the next Congress. They were concerned because ofthe lack of time to study the effect of a last minute Manager's Package ofAmendments to IDEA on students with disabilities. The CCD (Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, acoalition of over 65 disability organizations which work together onlegislation of common interest) Education Task Force sent a letter to theHill listing specific concerns: cessation of educational services for certain students withdisabilities weakening of other civil rights issues, such as the requirement thatparents identify the remedy as well as the reason for the request for adue process hearing, the stay put provisions under discipline, and theprovisions for changing the placement of children with "disruptivebehavior" failure to assure the presence of related services personnel, asappropriate, at IEP meetings, and elimination of assistive techonologyconsiderations under special factors under the IEP uncertainty about discretionary programs What Does This Mean? Failure to pass a Reauthorization bill does not affect Part B, whichcontains all the assurances, protections, and safeguards for the educationof children with disabilities. Part B remains the same and none of theproposed changes - good and bad - are required. Authorization for thediscretionary programs (teacher and parent training, research anddevelopment, early intervention, clearinghouses) has expired, but theseprograms are all funded in the 1997 Appropriations bill. What Happens Now? Now is the time to prepare for the Reauthorization of IDEA in the 105thCongress. Constituents should write or call their Congressmen (andCongressional candidates) to express support for the promise of IDEA andto offer to help explain any areas of uncertainty. Hopefully, the newCongress will pass an IDEA which incorporates all of the good features andeliminates the bad features of the proposals in the 104th Congress. Thank you all who responded to the many requests to provide input toCongress in the last two years.

Cessation of educationalservices will not be mentioned, but proposals to allow cessation will nodoubt be introduced. Hearings - one on discipline and one on funding -will be held on February 4 and 6, and the full Economic and EducationalOpportunities Committee is expected to mark up the final bill in the secondweek in March. Senate Labor and Human Services Committee Chairman Jim Jeffordsalso expects to act swiftly on the reauthorization. The Subcommittee onDisability Policy has been eliminated, so, as in the House, there willbe no opportunity for input before the full committees act on the bill. Time is short and the need to help Congressmen understand the importanceof IDEA for students with learning disabilities is great. Almost a thirdof the 45 members of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committeeare new, as are many of the members of the Senate Labor and Human ServicesCommittee. However, because of the short time frame, it is vital that ALLmembers of Congress hear from their constituents. IDEA is only the firstof the bills affecting individuals with LD which will be reauthorized bythe 105th Congress. Input will be needed as well when bills reauthorizingthe Rehabilitation Act, the Higher Education Act, the Juvenile JusticeAct, and the Vocational Education Act are introduced. A list of the addresses, phone and fax numbers of members of relevantcommittees is attached. Please keep this list for future reference. Remember,personal contacts are the most effective way of reaching Congressmen. Otherways of making an impact, in descending order, are personal letters orpostcards, form letters, or phone calls. Letters or faxes have more impactthan e-mail. However, anything is better than nothing. Please add your personal input to the following sample letter. LDA'sposition on last year's IDEA bills was sent to all state and localpresidents and to the network. It is posted on the LDA Home Page on theInternet and was reprinted in the Washington Update section of the Nov./Dec.1996 Issue of Newsbriefs. Please add your own experiences, - particularlyabout the difficulty of determining eligibility for students with learningdisabilities who are performing at grade level only because of their effortsand the support of their families Stories about the success of studentswho benefited from IDEA are also needed. SAMPLE LETTER FOR THE REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA TO A SENATOR The Honorable (Full name) U.S. Senate Washington, DC 20510 TO A REPRESENTATIVE The Honorable (Full name) U.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Senator (last name) Dear Congressman (woman)(last name) I am (an individual with LD, a parent of a child with LD, a professionalworking in the field of LD). I am asking you to support the continued federalcommitment to the education of ALL children with disabilities as promisedby IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Despite its flaws,children with disabilities have greatly benefited from that law. Societyhas also benefited as more IDEA graduates have gone on to higher educationand competitive employment. (EXAMPLES HERE) One of the first acts of the 105th Congress is expected to be the reauthorizationof IDEA. I hope that this reauthorization will make very few changes toPart B of IDEA Many of the positive changes proposed in the Reauthorizationbills which died at the end of the 105th Congress could be brought aboutby regulatory changes. I am afraid that other changes, particularly thosewhich would deny educational services to certain students with disabilitiesor would curtail their rights, would severely limit their opportunity toobtain an appropriate education. (Attached is LDA's position on the IDEAbills introduced in the 104th Congress.). I will let you know of specific concerns when the bills are introduced.In the meantime, I would be happy to discuss IDEA with you at any time.My telephone number is Thank you Name AND address SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE, 105TH CONGRESS 428 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.

Home schooling is beginning to beviewed as a "viable educational option" (1 to 2 percent of the K-12population). Home schooling is legal in all 50 states and the District ofColumbia. Thirty-four states regulate home-schooling. Forty states do notrequire any parent qualifications for teaching. Few states ask whyparents are home-schooling their children, but reasons given range from"school violence to poor academic quality to overzealous peer pressure."Observers have seen "growing numbers of habitual truants, giftedchildren, children with disabilities, and in general, older children andteens being educated at home." Student Standards for Speaking, Listening Education Week (June 12, 1996) The Speech Communication Association released national voluntarystandards for speaking, listening, and media literacy that are meant toapply across the curriculum. These standards are different from theInternational Reading Association and National Council of Teachers ofEnglish English-Language Arts standards because they focus on spokenlanguage. Free copies of these standards are available from SpeechCommunication Associates, 5105 Blacklick Road, Building E, Annandale, VA22003. Teacher Licensing Project Begun by NCATE Education Week (April 17, 1996) The National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education and 7selected states (Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, NorthCarolina, Washington) are working to reform teacher preparation andlicensing. Their goal is to establish state standards for teacherpreparation and licensing that is focused on teacher performance ratherthan specified coursework. These standards would be "aligned with NCATE'sstandards for teacher education school." Educators Skeptical About New Tests Education Week (April 17, 1996) Teachers in Maryland and Kentucky (states that re-vamped the way theymeasure student performance) question whether the new measures really"gauge what students have learned." These states replaced standardizedachievement test with performance-based testing programs. The new testsconsist of "problem solving, participation in group activities, answeringopen-ended questions, and writing." While many teachers said the newassessments improved instruction, most teachers in both states also saidthey thought some schools had found ways to "improve scores withoutimproving the quality of teaching." Most said the scores improved"because the teachers and students were more familiar with the test,students did practice tests, and the test-taking skills had improved." Ifthe teachers concerns are right, the gains reported "probably don'trepresent generalizable gains in student learning." In both states 70percent or more of the teachers said they had put more emphasis onsubjects and topics that were tested, reducing emphasis on those thatwere not. Contrary to the "commitment to the belief that all children canlearn at high levels, the survey clearly suggests that many teachersstill believe some students can learn more than others." In Maryland,"only 18 percent of teachers said they had increased expectations forspecial-education students." Thirty-six percent said they "expected moreof their high-achieving students. The real test was said to be "whetherthere will continue to be gains." Teacher Attrition a Concern Education Week (June 19, 1996) A survey of new teachers in North Carolina "brought bad news and worsenews. The bad news was the large number of rookie teachers who leave theprofession within five years. Even worse, the ones who are quitting arethe brightest of the new teachers." A review of the records of 81,000 teachers hired in 1979-80 found thatby the end of the fifth year after being hired, one-third had left teaching."And the survey showed that after five years of teaching, 44 percent ofteachers who came from colleges considered to be in the top one-fourth inthe state had left, compared with only 26 percent of teachers coming fromthe bottom one-fourth of colleges." This high attrition rate for teachersis not only in North Carolina. According to the National Commission on Teaching, 30 to 50 percent of beginning teachers leave the professionin their first five years. Other studies have shown that new teachers"tend to feel overwhelmed by classroom responsibilities and often do notreceive proper support." Private Management of Public Schools Has Yet to Show Improved Scores Education Week (May 29, 1996) The U.S. General Accounting Office recently released a reportindicating that "private management of public schools has often led tocleaner buildings, greater access to computers, and more individualizedinstruction. But it has yet to show academic improvement anywhere..." Theprivate management groups examined were: Public Strategies Group Inc. inMinneapolis and Education Alternatives Inc. in Baltimore; Dade County,Fla.; and Hartford, Conn. (Scores in Hartford were not evaluated.) EAI'scontracts were either not renewed or ended ahead of schedule. PSI inMinneapolis received only 66 percent of the total it could have receivedbecause, among other reasons, student test scores did not improve.

FAPE comprises an appropriate education program designed for eachindividual student according to both Part B and education standards ofthe state of residence. Each state, under 34 CFR ï¿½300.600, must supervise and ensure programs in the state providing education services to studentswith disabilities meet both federal and state standards. When a student moves from one state to another, the receiving schooldistrict must first determine whether it will adopt the student's mostrecent evaluation and individual education plan (IEP). Since theevaluation and IEP from the sending state were based partially on theeducation standards and eligibility criteria of the sending state, the student's evaluation and IEP may not be consistent with the educationstandards of the receiving state. If the receiving district determinesthat the previous evaluation complies with both state law and Part B ofIDEA, it may adopt the evaluation and provide parental notice inaccordance with 34 CFR ï¿½300.504(a). The receiving district must also examine the student's IEP todetermine compliance with state law and Part B of IDEA. If the receivingdistrict determines that the IEP is appropriate and can be implemented,no IEP meeting need be held if the parent is satisfied with the currentIEP (Appendix C to 34 CFR Part 300 (question 6)). If, however, either the parent of school district is dissatisfied with the existing IEP, andIEP meeting must be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days afterthe receiving school districts accepts the eligibility determination andevaluation of the previous school district. If the receiving school district does not accept the previousevaluation, the district must evaluate the student without duedelay and provide proper parental notice under 34 CFR ï¿½300.128,ï¿½300.220 and ï¿½300.504(a). The new evaluation must be treated as apreplacement evaluation under 34 CFR ï¿½300.531. The receiving districtmust obtain parental consent (34 CFR ï¿½300.504(b)(1)(i)). Specialeducation services may be provided to the student during the evaluationprocess if parents and the district can agree on an interim IEP. If thereis disagreement, however, the student will be placed in regular education. Once the receiving district completes its assessment, an IEPmeeting must be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days after thedate of eligibility determination (34 CFR ï¿½300.343(c)). At the meeting anappropriate IEP should be developed and adopted to address the uniqueeducation needs of the student. If the parents disagree with the new evaluation or proposed IEP, theymay initiate an impartial due process hearing under 34 CFR ï¿½300.506.Pending the hearing the student may be placed in the program proposed bythe receiving district, with the parents' consent, or in anotherplacement on with both the parents and district agree. If agreement on an interim placement is not reached, the receiving district is not requiredto implement the interim IEP or to approximate services provided underthe previous IEP. In such a situation the receiving district will placethe student in the regular education program in accordance with 34 CFRï¿½300.513(b).

FAPE includes "special education and related services" that are provided at public expense and at no charge in conformity with the student's individualized education plan (IEP) 20 USC ï¿½1401(a)(18). The U.S. Supreme Court in Irving ISD v. Tatro clarified that related services include everything needed by the student with disabilities to "reach, enter, exit or remain in school during the day." The need for related services should be addressed during the meeting at which the IEP is developed for a student with disabilities. The IEP must contain every related service the school district is to provide. It should also include the frequency and duration of the service as well as the title of the individual providing the service. Related services, provided under 20 USC ï¿½1401(17) include, but are not limited to: transportation speech pathology and audiology psychological services physical and occupational therapy recreation, including therapeutic recreation early identification and assessment of disabilities in children counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes school health services social work services parent counseling and training Related services may include developmental, corrective or supportive services which are necessary to assist a child with a disability benefit from special education (34 CFR ï¿½300.16 (Comment)). Assistive technology devices/services may also qualify as related services (Letter to Goodman, 16 IDELR 1317 (OSEP 1990)). Related services delineated under 34 CFR ï¿½300.16: Transportation includes travel to, from and between schools, travel in and around school buildings, and specialized equipment if required to provide special transportation for a child with a disability.

The court ruled the 7-year old student whose voice was often strained and fluctuated in pitch was eligible for special education services because the condition affected his ability and desire to communicate with others although he was performing academically at the level of his peers. The parents challenged the school district's refusal to declare the student eligible. Although the district admitted the child did not have a normal voice, it disputed that his condition adversely impacted his education because the child was making passing grades. The court cited two reasons for its decision: (a) an advisory note to the federal regulations which states that in evaluating communicative speech disorders, the examiner must "focus on an objective level of speech ability and the observation of speech behavior" and (b) OSEP policy letters which have stated that eligibility for a speech/language impairment could not be "conditioned" on the existence of deficient academic performance. The court noted that federal regulations do not allow the use of a single procedure as an eligibility criterion but required an investigation of data from a number of sources. The court stated that educational performance is not determined solely on the basis of academic criteria but indulged the development of communication, social skills and personality.

Failure to implement student's IEP resulted in denial of FAPE The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) ruled that in the case of Ocean View (CA) Elementary School District, 23 IDELR 903 (OCR 1995), the failure of the district to implement the individualized education program (IEP) of a student with disabilities denied the student a free appropriate public education (FAPE). OCR determined the district violated the student's rights under both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when it failed to implement the IEP consistently. In their investigation OCR found confusion among the student's teacher, the instructional aide and other school district personnel regarding the implementation of certain provisions of the IEP. Inconsistency in implementation of an IEP is difficult to prove, but it was apparent in this instance that the school personnel who were to implement the IEP did not have the same understanding of how the student should be served.

District did not discriminate against student with disability by giving failing grade in physical education The parent of a student with dyslexia complained to OCR that her daughter was discriminated against because she received a failing grade in physical education. OCR found that it was the student's refusal to participate in physical education which resulted in her failing grade. Although the student had received an "F" on a written test in physical education, the examination grade had not been averaged into her physical education grade because of her dyslexia. The teacher had provided assistance to the student in opening the combination lock to her locker, but the student repeatedly failed to dress for class despite notice that doing so would result in failure.

The parent of the 14-year old student hadchallenged an administrative law judge's denial of SSI. Diagnosed in first grade as having a learning disability, the student had attendedregular and special education classes. The court stated evidencepresented failed to substantiate "medically determinable physical ormental impairment of comparable severity" and indicated the student had'moderate' cognitive and communicative impairments. The court further found testimony regarding vocational abilities was not required in such cases. SOURCE: Mack ex rel. Mack v. Secretary of Health and HumanServices, 24 IDELR 266 (S.D.N.Y 1996). Inclusion Inappropriate for Student with Learning Disabilities A Missouri district court judge ruled that regular class placement wasunsuitable for a student with a learning disability because the student's"self-esteem and behavior were aggravated by his associations withstudents from whom he felt 'different' and that consequently, hisacademic progress was hindered." The judge found that because the district failed to offer the student an appropriate education during histhird and fourth grade years, his parents were entitled to reimbursementfor tuition paid a private school where the child benefited academicallyand emotionally. The student had repeated first grade. When he completedhis third-grade year, his reading was below grade level, and he was unable to write a complete sentence. His grades were declining. The court noted the school district had failed to change its teachingmethods and merely increased the amount of time the child spent inresource. The district had previously decreased the amount of time thestudent attended resource in an attempt to improve his self-esteem. Thecourt further found the district failed to develop the student's fourthgrade IEP until October when it proposed he attend resource and self-contained class rather than a segregated environment. By that time the parents hadalready signed a contract for that year with the private school. SOURCE: Fort Zumwalt Sch. Dist. v. Missouri State Bd. of Educ.,24 IDELR 222 (E.D. Mo. 1996) Additional Services Ordered for Student with Dyslexia The Rhinebeck Central School District of New York proposed placing astudent with dyslexia in regular classes except for one 40-minuteresource class. The district justified its proposal by stating that thechild has above-average intelligence and belongs in regular educationclasses. They offered a 40-minute resource class for reading and writingand 20 minutes daily consultation between the student's special and regular education teachers. The parents of the student appealed the ruling of a hearing officerwho upheld the district's proposed program. The parents charged that theproposed IEP conveyed no educational benefits to their child. Specialiststestified that tutoring proposed by the district failed to address thechild's special education needs, that the child would benefit emotionallyfrom knowing other children with dyslexia and that he would struggle in the regular classroom. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York orderedthe district to develop and Individual Education Program (IEP) thanensures the child will attend class with students having similar learningdisabilities. The Judge noted in his ruling that the district had failedto: convene an impartial hearing within 45 days of the mother's request, have an appropriate IEP ready for the beginning of the school year, include a statement in the IEP of the child's present level offunctioning and strategies to evaluate progress, consult his classroom teacher, observe the child in the classroom, and prepare a written report stating the basis for determination of eligibility as learning disabled.

Physician's Diagnosis of ADD/ADHD Insufficient to EstablishEligibility for IDEA In response to a letter of inquiry from LaNelle Gallagher on behalf ofthe Learning Disabilities Association of Texas, Thomas Hehir, Director,Office of Special Education Programs, wrote that "a physician's statementthat a child has ADD/ADHD would be insufficient by itself to establisheligibility under Part B" (of IDEA). Dr. Hehir reiterated that in orderto be eligible for services under IDEA, Part B, a child must be evaluatedas having one or more specified physical or mental impairments (34 CFR ï¿½ï¿½300.530-300.534) and found to require special education and relatedservices as a result (34 CFR ï¿½300.7(1)(1)). The determination that thechild has a physical or mental impairment alone does not qualify thestudent for eligibility under Part B without the conclusion that as aresult of having the impairment, the child needs special education and related services. The decision of eligibility is the responsibilityof the multidisciplinary team (ï¿½300.532(a)) which evaluates the child inaccordance with ï¿½ï¿½300.530-300.534. "Although public agencies have thediscretion to require a medical diagnosis of ADD/ADHD as part of thechild's evaluation under the OHI (other health impaired) category, themultidisciplinary team must determine whether the child needs specialeducation and related services due to the existence of any such impairment."

Because so few days are left for legislative action, leaders in both the House and the Senate are reluctant to move any controversial or time-consuming bills to the floor. Among the bills in this category are IDEA, the Job Training (Careers) Bill, the Kennedy Kassenbaum Health Care Bill, and Welfare Reform. Any bills not passed by the end of the session must be reintroduced in the 105th Congress to be sworn in on January 20, 1997. Will there be a new IDEA? Would it be good or bad? No one knows The House version of IDEA was passed by voice vote of the full House on June 10. The Senate Labor and Human Services Committee passed their version of IDEA in March and asked that it be sent to the floor under unanimous consent rule. (Unanimous consent means no debate and no amendments.) However, Senator Gorton (R WA) (who has announced his intention of offering amendments 1) to severely limit attorneys fees and 2) to deny punitive damages under IDEA; and Senator Ashcroft (R MO) (who has announced his intention of offering amendments 1) to require administrators to document violent acts on a student's IEP which would be passed on to any new school attended by that student and 2) to allow schoolsto deny educational services to violent students) have placed holds on the bill, which means that it cannot move. Both disability and regular education groups have been trying to get the bill passed in the Senate, so a conference committee can be named to come up with a final bill. A number of disability groups fear that, flawed as the current bills are, the 105th Congress could pass a worse one. Moreover, failure to pass a bill would not guarantee that Senators Gorton and Ashcroft would not put their amendments on any new bill in the Congress. A number of regular education groups seem to feel that the current bills are better for them than the current law. However, others are hoping that the 105th Congress could pass an even weaker IDEA. The recent federal appeals court ruling that public schools must continue to serve students with disabilities who are suspended or expelled may change the equation. Virginia, which brought the suit, has not yet decide whether to appeal the decision. In the meantime, school systems in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina must serve all students with disabilities. The decision may not sit well with the National School Boards Association and the American Federation of Teachers, both of which support the current proposals which allow denial of educational services to students with disabilities who bring a weapon or drugs to school and whose behavior is found not to be a manifestation of their disability. KEEP TUNED ON IDEA. Appropriations The House Labor Health and Human Services and Education AppropriationsSubcommittee passed a bill which would level funds to all programs under IDEA.The Senate has yet to act. Even if IDEA is not reauthorized, the discretionaryprograms will not be affected in the 1997 appropriations. However, there will be real problems with the 1998 appropriations if the discretionary programs are not reauthorized. The Jobs Training Bill Different versions of federal job training programs consolidation were passed in the House and the Senate. Although conferees have been working since last October, major issues between Republicans and Democrats have not been resolved.If, as threatened, the Republication majority pass a conference bill, it will face a floor filibuster and a presidential veto. The Kennedy Kassenbaum Health Care Bill This bill would prohibit the denial of insurance coverage because of apre-existing condition. However, further action has been delayed because of concerns about proposals to allow medical savings accounts. Welfare Reform Congress hopes to get some version of welfare reform passed before adjournment.Disability advocates are concerned about proposals to eventually eliminate over 350,000 children with disabilities because of changing eligibility. Bills which could have an impact on individuals with disabilities The following bills, which are being monitored by various coalitions, could have an impact on individuals with learning disabilities. The Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act (S88, HR 2086), which allows states or localities to submit "flexibility or coordination plans" for any federal program under which financial assistance is available. This plan can include requests to waive virtually any local, state, or federal law or regulation. Although civil rights under the ADA, Section 504 and IDEA cannot be waived, a state or community could decide to use IDEA funds for general education rather than for special education services for children with disabilities. For further information, contactharrys@rtk.net. The Parents Rights and Responsibilities Act (HR 1946, SR 92) would prohibit any government official from interfering with a parent's desires in the areas of medical care, discipline, home schooling, and religious education.Sixty organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are opposing this bill. Remember the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR)? The original report of the ACIR, which was established by the Unfunded Mandates Act, recommended changes in both the ADA and IDEA, despite the fact that both laws were exempted from the mandate. The draft of ACIR's final report does not mention the ADA. However, it repeats the recommendation that IDEA be funded to pay for 40% of excess costs and amended to relieve state and local governments from prescriptive, administrative, and recordkeeping requirements and to foster increased use of mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. However, the original recommendation to prohibit a private right of action, i.e., due process, by parents has been dropped.

As required by Part B regulation (34 CFR ï¿½ï¿½300.540-300.543),the multidisciplinary evaluation team is responsible for determining if asevere discrepancy exists between a student's ability and performance.UnderPart B of IDEA and Part B regulations there are no "exclusions based onintelligence level in determining eligibility." In other words, astudent cannot be excluded from consideration of eligibility for specialeducation services solely on the basis of a high IQ; no child's IQ can betoo high for that child to be considered for eligibility for special educationservices -- even an intellectually gifted student may be considered foreligibility for special education. In order to qualify as having a specific learning disability, the student,according to Part B of IDEA and Part B regulations, must have a severediscrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability "in one of moreof the following areas: oral expression, listening comprehension, writtenexpression, basic reading skill, reading comprehension, mathematics calculation, or mathematics reasoning." Intellectual ability isdetermined by administration of intelligence or IQ test(s). Achievement is determined by administration of tests designed to measure basic reading skilland comprehension, math computational and reasoning skills, and the ability ofthe child to express his/her ideas in writing. Oral expression and listening comprehension are generally determined by giving speech and languagetests. Scores earned on achievement and IQ tests are then compared. In order to be eligible for special education services, the multidisciplinary team must determine if the student has an "impairment" or disability which "adversely affects educational performance" 34 CFR ï¿½300.7 (b) (1) - (b)(13). In a letter to William M. Lybarger, Ed.D., dated September 14, 1990, the Department of Education described "educational performance" asdifferent for each child, "determined on an individual basis," and"includ(ing) non-academic and academic skills." In other words, astudent with suspected learning disabilities must need special education and related services in order to qualify for those services. A multidisciplinary team may find a child has a specific learning disability if "the child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in paragraph (a) (2) of this section, when provided with learning experiences appropriate for thechild's age and ability levels ..." 34 CFR ï¿½300.541 (a) (1). TheDepartment of Education, in its letter to LDA of North Carolina, wrote thatit is "generally" appropriate for the multidisciplinary team to include inits written report (to determine eligibility) information regarding"outside or extra" instructional help or support which "may indicatethe child's current educational achievements reflects the service augmentation, not what the child's achievement would be without suchhelp." Such information should be considered by the team in deciding ifthe child has "a severe discrepancy between achievement and ability thatis not correctable without special education and related services." If,for example, a student with an IQ of 125 and significantly lower achievementscores maintains passing or even exemplary grades, the team should considerwhether or not the student achieves only because of special assistance orsupport. If the student receives no special help, the multidisciplinary teammight conclude that student would not need special education. If, on the otherhand, the student has tutoring several times a week, works for three to five hours each night on homework with parental assistance, and must have extra time to complete tests in order to pass or maintain a certain grade level, that student might be considered to have a "specific learning disability." His/her grades may reflect all the assistance the student is getting rather than the student's actual achievement level.

Zirkel asked OCR to respond in light of court decisions such as Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 441 US 383, 410 (1979), Alexander v. Choate, US 287, 300 (1985), Barnett v. Fairfax County School Bd., 927 F.2d 146, 155 (4th Cir. 1991), and others, as well as "reasonable accommodation limitation under Title II" of ADA. OCR responded that Section 504 regulations establish different standards of compliance for different settings. A reasonable accommodation limitation is contained in Subpart B covering employment and Subpart E covering postsecondary and vocational education. There is no such limitation, however, in Subpart D covering elementary and secondary education. OCR interprets the absence of any "cost-conscious limitation" in Subpart D, either in the original regulations or in subsequent actions by Congress or the courts, to mean that the writers of the regulations intended to create a different compliance standard in the elementary and secondary educational settings and the FAPE requirement of 34 CFR ï¿½104.33. In the Supreme Court cases cited by Zirkel, OCR stated that the Court addressed modifications unrelated to either elementary or secondary education and ruled in both instances that 'substantial accommodations' were invalid only if they went beyond accommodations necessary to eliminate discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals. OCR explained that in all lower court casescited there was no need to alter the FAPE requirement of 34 CFR ï¿½104.33 If particular educational services requested by the plaintiffs were denied by the courts, it was because the courts found no discrimination was occurring. OCR stated the rulings were consistent with their interpretation that the FAPE regulation requires school districts to meet the individual needs of all students, disabled and nondisabled, to the same extent, "though not necessarily providing the same programs and services." Because OCR adopted a specific FAPE requirement for Section 504 compliance in the elementary and secondary school setting, the general discrimination provisions, including any "reasonable accommodations limitation" of Title II, may not be applied to weaken the existing Section 504 standards.

The majority of children entering the juvenile delinquency system in D.C. have learning disabilities, emotional disturbances or mental retardation. Unfortunately, the professionals who deal with these children, namely, judges, probation offices, juvenile prosecutors and defense attorneys, typically lack the training to recognize these problems, and are unfamiliar with special education law. Joseph Tulman, Associate Professor of Law and Director of the Juvenile Law Clinic at the District of Columbia School of Law, contends that lawyers who can discern learning disabilities in their clients can enhance the effectiveness of their representation in many ways, in his article, The Best Defense is a Good Offense: Incorporating Special Education Law into Delinquency Representation in the Juvenile Law Clinic. "Children withlearning disabilities, emotional disturbances and mental retardation donot always understand their legal rights completely; lawyers can trydifferent methods of communicating with their clients, or have a guardian ad litem look out for the child s best interests. An understanding of specialeducation law can help an attorney hone her approach to the case." A child with a learning disability may qualify for a dismissal of a delinquency matter and referral to the mental retardation system, if the childis found to be moderately mentally retarded. Recognizing a juvenile clientï¿½smental or emotional disabilities can enable an attorney to argue for dismissalbased on "social reasons" under District of Columbia Superior Court JuvenileRule 48(b). Because prosecutors must not only prove that the child hascommitted the alleged offense, but also that the child is "in need ofcare and rehabilitation", defense attorneys can pre-empt prosecution byshowing that the child has received treatment outside of the court, and therefore is not in need of additional care and rehabilitation. In deciding whether to pursue special education rights, an attorney must, consistent with professional ethics, follow the clientï¿½s wishes. Often, aclient has dropped out of school and perhaps because of past academic failureand frustration, is reluctant to return. While an attorney should listen empathetically, and counsel the client in light of his own perceptions of self-interest, an attorney should also follow the clientï¿½s wishes if he does not wish to have a psycho-educational evaluation. Parents should also be consulted during this stage, since many education rights inure to the parent. While there is no inherent conflict in representing both the child and parent, an attorney should advise the parent of potential conflicts and what limits exist should a conflict arise. If the child agrees to pursue a psycho-educational evaluation, special education law requires the governmentto place a juvenile in an appropriate educational setting within fifty days of a request for educational e valuation. Since delinquency matters in D.C. take at least sixty days from arrest/initial hearing to first scheduled trial date, under ideal conditions, a dismissal for social reasons could be made before the first trial date. Special education law can also be used to improve the placement of the child. Federal and local laws require the government to provide each child with a "free appropriate public education" (FAPE), which does not mean an optimal learning environment. However, family court utilizes the "bestinterest of the child" standard for dispositional orders. Thus an attorneywho receives an unsatisfactory result through the special education system can resort to family court Since special education law also requires the"least restrictive environment", while family court has an obligation toprotect the community, an attorney may also be able to argue for placement in the least restrictive environment. The legal communityï¿½s understanding of learning disabilities and special education law can be enhanced through juvenile law clinics within law schools. Law clinics can serve a dual function of educating the students at hand, and reaching out to the larger legal community. Using special education law in a juvenile clinic requires law students to actively develop alternative placements and strategies in the special education system, rather than rely exclusively on defense strategies. Juvenile law clinics can reach out to the larger legal community by offering training sessions in the law of special education for lawyers representing juveniles. These training sessions can include the distribution of useful materials, such as sample pleadings. Law clinics can also help establish a network of private special education experts who will accept referrals of cases from attorneys. These services will help raise the standard of practice within the community.

In the past,the term minimal brain dysfunction was also used. Children with ADD It is estimated that children with ADD constitute 3% to 5% of thecurrent school-age population, which would represent 1.35 to 2.25million children. Most experts agree that ADD is a neurobiologicaldisorder that can have multiple causes. Research indicates that childrenwith ADD are likely to have a biological relative with ADD. In addition,evidence also suggests that neurologic, neurochemical or, in somecases, toxic factors may be involved. Other factors such as medicalconditions, medication side effects, familial functioning, orenvironmental conditions may exacerbate an existing disorder orcontribute to the development of ADD-like problem in some children(Parker, 1992). Diagnosis As with all other disabling conditions, evaluation of children suspectedof having ADD should be a multistep, multidisciplinary procedure. Firstthe assessment should determine whether a child meets criteria fordiagnosis of ADD; then, further assessment should determine thedegree to which the child's educational performance is adverselyaffected. This information will help determine what types of educationalservices are necessary to assist the student. The first step requires gathering information about the child from anumber of sources and in a variety of ways. Medical information; parentor guardian descriptions of the child's physical, mental, social, andemotional development; school information; descriptions of socialbehavior and classroom adjustment; and assessment of the child'scognitive functioning are essential to making an accurate diagnosis.Because the behavior of children thought to have ADD can vary widelyin different situations and environments, experts recommend obtaininginformation from many sources, and observing the child in differentsettings and at different times. Evaluations of children suspected ofhaving ADD often include rating scales completed by parents andteachers. School Responsibilities Schools must provide appropriate educational services to students whohave been identified as having ADD. In September 1991, theDepartment of Education issued a policy clarification on the topic ofchildren with attention deficit disorder (Davila, Williams, & MacDonalt,1991). The memorandum was intended to clarify state and localresponsibility under federal law for meeting the needs of children withADD in the educational system as a whole. The responsibility for meeting the educational needs of children withADD rests with the entire educational! system, not just with particularsectors. Thus, if the needs of these children are to be fully met in theschools (whether through general or special education programs), increased coordination, collaboration, and consultation will have tooccur among regular educators, special educators, administrators. andrelated services personnel. The report recognizes that: Regular classroom teachers are important in identifying appropriateeducational adaptations and interventions for many children withADD. State and local districts should take the necessary steps to promotecoordination between special education and regular educationprograms. Regular education teachers and other personnel need training todevelop a greater awareness of children with ADD and of adaptationsthat can be implemented in regular education programs to address theinstructional needs of these children. Children who are experiencing educational difficulties, whether fromADD or some other cause, often fail to receive any assistance until afterdifficulties, such as distractibility, disorganization, or inability to completeassignments on time, have caused them yo fall significantly behind theirclassmates. By the time children have experienced such failure, theygenerally have already lost a great deal of academic ground In addition,school failure may contribute to, or worsen, a student's feelings of lowself-esteem, depression, or anxiety. Federal Laws Affecting Children with ADD Both the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provide coverage for children withADD. When the disability adversely affects educational performance,eligibility for special education should be approached through theprocesses of IDEA When the disability does not affect educationalperformance but does substantially limit one or more major lifeactivities, eligibility should be approached through Section 504. Thefollowing are highlights of each law as it affects the education ofchildren with ADD. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part B: Requires that state and local districts make a free appropriate public education (FAPE) available to all eligible children Requires that the rights and protections of Part B of IDEA are extended to children with ADD and their parents. Requires that an evaluation be done, without undue delay, to determine if the child has one or more of 13 specified disabling conditions and requires special education and related services. Requires that children with ADD be classified as eligible for services under the "other health impaired" category in instances where ADD is a chronic or acute health problem that results in limited alertness that adversely affects a child's educational performance. Children with ADD can also be served under the categories of "learning disabilities" or seriously emotionally disturbed," if the evaluation finds these conditions are also present. Does not allow local districts to refuse to evaluate the possible need for special education and related services of a child with a prior medical diagnosis of ADD solely by reason of that medical diagnosis. On the other hand, a medical diagnosis of ADD does not automatically make a child eligible for services under Part B (IDEA). Requires that a full and individual evaluation of the child's educational needs must be conducted in accordance with requirements in Part B (IDEA). These requirements include: A multidiscipiinary team must perform the evaluation. At least one teacher or other specialist with knowledge in the area of ADD must be on the team. Requires that a due process hearing take place, at the request of the parents, if there is disagreement between the local district and the parent over the request for evaluation, the evaluation, or the determinations for services. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973: Prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of federal funds. Provides appropriate education for children who do not fall within the disability categories specified in Part B (IDEA). Examples of potential conditions not typically covered under Part B (IDEA) are: communicable diseases (HIV, tuberculosis) medical conditions (asthma, allergies, diabetes, heart disease) temporary medical conditions due to illness or accident drug/alcohol addiction Requires that a free appropriate public education be provided to each qualified child who is disabled but does not require special education and related services under Part B (IDEA). A free appropriate education (FAPE) under Section 504 includes: Regular or special education and related aids and services that are designed to meet the individual student's needs and are based on adherence to the regulatory requirements on education setting, evaluation, placement, and procedural safeguards. Guarantees parents the right to contest the outcome of an evaluation if a local district determines that a child is not disabled under Section 504. Requires the local district to make an individualized determination of the child's educational needs for regular or special education or related aids and services if the child is found eligible under Section 504. Requires the implementation of an individualized education program (IEP). One means of meeting the free appropriate public education requirements of Section 504 is to follow the IEP guidelines as set forth in the regulations for Part B (IDEA). Requires that the child's education must be provided in the regular education classroom unless it is demonstrated that education in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. Requires that necessary adjustments be made in the regular classroom for children who qualify under Section 504. References Davila, R. R., Williams, M. L, & MacDonalt. J. T.

Because theyare energetic, loving; at times impossible and excitable, many parentingtechniques simply do not work. Effective parenting involves patience, time,effort, and inter-parental cooperation. The following represent some concreteideas and suggestions: Be Positive - It is easy to notice the negative behavior ofa child with AD/HD because there is so much of it. Noticing and reinforcingpositive behavior is critical. There is a tendency to leave the child alonewhen she or he is being "good." To the contrary, this is thetime to say or do something that will make the positive behavior more probable. Use Praise - Learning a variety of ways to say "good job" and "thanks" can do wonders for the child with AD/HD.This is a major means that you can use to reinforce positive behavior. Be Specific, Concrete and Immediate - Children with AD/HDdo not do well with generalities or with feedback that is delayed. Their rapid pace, hyperactivity, and distractibility make swift parental response critical. Break things into manageable elements. For example, when givingtasks, be specific and to the point. Telling a child with this disorderto clean his or her room is fruitless. On the other hand telling them topick up dirty clothes and put them in the hamper or pick up all of theGI Joes and put them in a box will bring good results. Do not use complex, long-winded verbal communication. Childrenwith AD/HD do not tolerate complexity and may hear a portion of what isbeing said. They may only hear the first command of a series. Often, theymay need to have things repeated or be asked to say what they have heardin order to accomplish a task. Reinforce or punish now, not later. Because of memory problemsand a tendency to operate in the here and now and not in the future, parentalresponses need to be immediate. Discipline Must be Positive, If Possible, and Not Negative -Children with AD/HD often do much better by hearing positive rather thangetting into a vicious negative feedback cycle, negative behavior escalatingparental negatives. Some concrete techniques to facilitate this are: Give choices and options. Children with AD/HD often create powerstruggles and do not do well in confrontations, "options" aremore useful than "musts." For example, "Do you want to doyour homework now or in 30 minutes?" Use charts. Things written down in specifics will be usefulbecause they are visual and concrete. They can be helpful to remind childrenwhat they have to do and when. Use reward systems. Children with AD/HD are more ruled by immediategratification than by mature deliberation or by long term consequences.Using rewards for behavior with concrete payoff can be incredibly useful. Structure is Important As Is Attention to Time and Sequence- Children with AD/HD do not do well with unpredictability, change anda lack of consistency. Specific times for homework for completing tasks,chores, and other requirements are useful. If charts are used, they candictate components of tasks in a sequential fashion. Parents on the Same Wavelength and in Agreement - To have aparent coalition that is imbalanced and not working well together (blamingand condemning) will wreak havoc. Part of therapy is to heal parental splitsand to come to agreement. Parents Must Take Time to Nurture Each Other and Take Time Out- Due to the stress of raising a child who is hyperactive and distractible,parents must take time away and not be locked into their child's world.Going out and/or taking long weekends together can be very fruitful. ______________ Ruth Turner, 1992 This article is from Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder- Policies/Information Regarding Diagnosis/Interventions and Services(LDA, 1996).

The mainprinciple behind the behavioral management system is to decrease theundesirable behaviors and to increase the desirable behaviors through asystem of rewarding desirable behavior and ignoring undesirable behavior. Theenvironment needs to be predictable and the management of the behaviormust be consistent. The use of behavioral charts with systems of a tokeneconomy or response cost and the use of time-out work effectively with thesechildren. Some aspects of the use of behavioral management need to be designedspecifically for these students, including the following factors: Children with AD/HD are efficient learners when their behavior is reinforced 100% of the time, but are less efficient on a partial reinforcement schedule. In the classroom, where the teacher is able to give the student direct feedback infrequently, the student with AD/HD who is not always paying attention is placed at a disadvantage. The timing of the reinforcement is also critical with the child with AD/HD. If the feedback is immediate, it is effective. If there is a delay in the timing, the student learns less efficiently than his peers. It is critical that the reinforcement contingency is clear to the student with AD/HD or it will be less effective. They work best with a system of positive reinforcement rather than punishment. It is important to respond to the behavior of these students without anger. The use of Cognitive Behavior Modification has successfully assisted these students in becoming aware of their own thinking processes and their approach to tasks. The approach gives them responsibility for their own reinforcement and assists them in learning to organize themselves and to control their own behavior. The provision of direct instruction in self-control and social skills can be helpful. Relaxation techniques may be useful and teaching the student to "stop, look, and think" and may assist the student in self-monitoring. Behavior management should be coordinated across all settings and communication between the home and the school is essential. If the student has a private therapist or counselor, they should be involved in the planning of the management system. If the child is on medication, a system to objectively monitor behavioral changes should be established and coordinated with the student's physician.

Behaviors associated with AD/HD are frequently perceived as lack ofcompliance or motivation. It is essential that all counselors and teachers havetraining in the current research in the area of AD/HD and the other conditionsthat may co-exist with AD/HD or result in similar symptoms. 2. All school personnel should understand the legal requirements of theIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of theRehabilitation Act with regard to students diagnosed as having AD/HD. 3. When medications have been prescribed by a physician, it is critical thatthe school staff members cooperate with any measures requested by the physicianto monitor the impact of the medication. No school personnel shouldrecommend medication or suggest changes in the dosage of the medication tothe parent All issues of medication should be coordinated with the prescribingphysician. It is the responsibility of the school personnel to work out a systemfor the administration of the medication if it must be given during school hoursthat is sensitive to the feelings of the student and is effective enough toensure the timely administration of the medication, as prescribed. 4. Parent and home collaboration is necessary in the management ofhomework and the implementation of behavior management plans. Homeworkassignments should always be written down and their complexity should beadjusted to accommodate the ability of the student to work independently. 5. Sound behavior management systems should be implemented. 6. Instruction should be broken down into manageable steps and the studentsshould be taught at their instructional level not their frustration level. Give the student additional time to complete tasks and alternate the types of assignment to increase interest. It is also helpful to engage as many senses, as possible, in instruction. 7. Instructions should be given to the student one at a time and there shouldbe some feedback requested from the student to ensure that the instructions areunderstood. 8. Learning aids such as listening centers, computers, tape recorders andcalculators will frequently increase the student's ability to pay attention.Other strategies of stimulus reduction may also assist the student in focusingon the school work. 9. Assessment must include multiple sources of information which may includeformal and informal observations, interviews of the parents, teachers and thestudent, traditional psychoeducational measures, behavior checklists andmedical input from the student's physician. 10. Some students with AD/HD benefit from group or individual counselingwhich focuses on problemsolving, social skills and cognitive behavioralself-monitoring strategies. 11. Give the student regular feedback about his academic work and focus onthe positive gains he has made. 12. Provide as much structure as possible with a predictable schedule andstrategies designed to help the student move from one activity to another. 13. Alternate activities that require the student to remain seated with activitiesthat allow movement. Alternate independent work with supervised work.Mve< References: Ronald Reeve, AD/HD, Facts and Fallacies in Intervention in School andClinic, November, 1990 Texas Education Agency, Assessing and Serving Children With AD/HD,January, 1992 Friedman and Doyal, Attention Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity, 1987 __________________________ Ruth Turner, Roscoe Lewis, 1992 This article is from LDA's new publicationAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder - Policies/Information RegardingDiagnosis/Interventions and Services (1996).

Professionals in child health and education often have a limited understanding of the nature of learning disabilities. Parents may have to search for the appropriate expertise to diagnose and manage theirchild. This deficiency in professional training is especially serious since "understanding" is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways of treating LD. Since learning disabilities are so common, they must be easy to diagnose. Learning disabilities are very often "hidden disabilities" -- although they commonly occur they are often difficult to spot. While some children exhibit striking signs of LD and clear patterns on simple screening tests, others will need careful and extensive assessment by an interdisciplinary team to identify an underlying learning disability or disabilities. IEPs mean that students will go to special education classes. Interventions for most children with learning disabilities can occur in the regular classroom; the IEP simply formulates how such interventions will be implemented. It is the regular teacher's job to teach all children, regardless of so-called disabilities. Learning disabilities represent a complex challenge to the regular classroom setting and one that needs to be addressed with a wide variety of intervention strategies -- a variety that demands the involvement of a number of different professionals. Close working relationships with other professionals should prevent the teacher from feeling alone, overburdened or abandoned. Some special medication, diet or other treatment can "cure" learning disabilities. There is no magic pill, quick fix or one-stop cure for learning disabilities. When a diagnosis of LD is made, parents should be told that they are in for the "long haul." Love, support, attention and understanding remain the mainstays of long-term treatment of LD. Children outgrow learning disabilities. Learning disabilities are life long. However, many adults with LD who receive special attention as children will build strategies to successfully adapt to life's challenges. Most children who experience difficulties with learning are just "slow." Learning disabilities occur in children at all levels of intellectual ability. Some children with LD are bright enough to be academically gifted, some are average, and a few are below average. The specific neurological deficit that cause learning disabilities are distinct and separate from general cognitive ability. Learning disabilities are caused by poor parenting. Childrearing patterns and home discipline may have an impact on classroom behavior, and parental involvement in education certainly has an effect on a child's enthusiasm for and success in school, but parenting skills have no association with the presence or absence of learning disabilities. Learning disabilities affect everything at school. Learning disabilities are relative phenomena. The underlying patterns of strengths and weaknesses that cause LD may not seriously affect a child's performance in one classroom setting or at one grade level but may account for significant difficulties in another class or at a different grade level. Learning disabled students have school problems because they don't try hard enough. Learning disabilities are not motivational. Ironically, even if an LD student claims not to want to try at school he or she may simply be covering up for their fear of failure. A child will sooner resort to saying, "I won't" than admit the more frightening, "I can't." It is up to adults to help children with LD learn to compensate successfully. _____________________________ From The Invisible Disability, published by NHEC and LDA, 1996 Resources | LDA Home pageWT02-B24-79IA089-000954-B008-343http://www.ldanatl.org:80/articles/id/causes.html 206.86.190.251 19970109184437 text/html 6711HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 18:44:38 GMTServer: BESTWWWD/1.0MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 6529Last-modified: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 18:25:28 GMT Select Causes of School Failure Select Causes of School Failure Pasquale Accardo, M.D. Attentional Deficits The term "attentional disorders" is used to characterize children with a varying constellation of short attention span, impulsivity, distractibility, and sometimes hyperactivity (unusually high level of activity) or hypoactivity (underactivity). Children with attentional disorders frequently exhibit difficulties with both their attention and behavior that can interfere with their classroom performance. The terminology for attentional disorders is constantly changing, to the confusion and consternation of both parents and professionals. Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD), ADD-combined type, ADD-predominantly inattentive type, ADD-predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, Executive Function Disorder, and Primary Disorder of Vigilance are just some of the terms that clinicians and researchers use. The major areas of intervention used with children exhibiting attention deficit disorders include: classroom accommodations, behavior management counseling for the family, and possibly medication. Between fifty and seventy-five percent of children with attentional deficits also have learning disabilities; it is important to keep in mind that each will benefit from being specifically and separately addressed. Often, children with attention deficit disorders exhibit notable hyperactivity. Diagnosis of such hyperactivity is separate and not necessarily a part of all attention deficit disorders. According to current data, males seem more likely to exhibit hyperactivity early on in their school career; females are more likely to have attentional problems without hyperactivity early on and then show behavioral and emotional problems in middle to late adolescence. Girls with both mild attentional and learning disabilities are more likely to withdraw, try harder to compensate, and successfully keep their problem concealed, perhaps later developing psychological problems as the cost of this compensation. Although LD and attention deficit disorders are commonly related, early identification of attentional disorders may or may not help the identification of associated learning disabilities depending on whether or not one disorder masks the other. It may be of interest to physicians, teachers, and administrators to note that children referred to a health professional because the child is having "staring spells" in class are much more likely to have attentional problems than petit mal seizures (commonly assumed to be the primary cause of "staring spells"). Physical Disabilities Physical disabilities can lead directly to educational problems as well. Children with visual impairment require ophthalmological assessments and eyeglasses; children with hearing impairment need audiological assessment, otolaryngological evaluations) and possibly hearing aids or other assistive listening devices. Both of these groups of children will also benefit from single classroom accommodations (such as preferential seating) that take into account their sensory disabilities. Language Disabilities A language disorder may involve the form of language (phonology, morphology, syntax , the content of language (semantics) and/or the function of language (semantics) and affect spoken, written and/or other symbol systems Children may experience educational difficulty as a result of language disorders (developmental disorders related to language, i.e., expressive language and/or receptive language problems) as well. For such children, the discipline of speech-language pathology has developed a number of intervention techniques that can effectively be used to assess and treat their specific disability. For more information, contact the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Brain Tumors Even more severe among physiological disorders, brain tumors may occasionally cause children who develop them to display learning problems at school In this case, educational difficulty may be symptomatic of a critical illness. In fact, in the case of a tumor, a careful documentation of academic deterioration may provide the earliest clue to what may very well be a life-threatening situation. Although rare, brain tumors highlight the need to take a serious approach to diagnosing the underlying causes of educational failure. If the child's learning difficulties are passed off as motivational, the resulting failure to assess the child might delay a serious medical diagnosis in a case where time is critical to long-term survival. Similarly, children with degenerative diseases of the central nervous system may first evidence academic problems. As with brain tumors, a careful medical assessment will be needed to make an accurate diagnosis and determine whether academic difficulties are the result of a serious and worsening system disorder. Emotional Disorders Like physical impairments, emotional and psychosocial problems can have a serious effect on a child's ability to learn. Similarly, too, these causes of educational failure have their own fields of diagnosis and treatment; and, -- as mentioned earlier -- although these difficulties are not necessarily associated with LD, they commonly co-occur in learning disabled children. For children exhibiting any of a variety of different emotional diagnoses, there exists a range of professional psychological counseling and medical psychotherapy. In addition, emotional problems may be treated with medications (psychopharmacologicals). Unlike some other disorders that cause educational problems, major psychiatric conditions are not treatable through minor classroom accommodations and are probably beyond the typical experience of school counselors. _____________________________ From The Invisible Disability, published by NHEC and LDA, 1996 Resources | Table of Contents | LDA Home PageWT02-B24-80IA089-000954-B008-360http://www.ldanatl.org:80/articles/speak/ 206.86.190.251 19970109184445 text/html 3461HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 18:44:50 GMTServer: BESTWWWD/1.0MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3279Last-modified: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 18:39:22 GMT They Speak for Themselves They Speak for Themselves A Survey of Adults with Learning Disabilities LDA, 1996 (Shoestring Press) For years organizations, professionals, parents and others have spokenfor adults with learning disabilities. Of the few programs and supportservices provided for adults with learning disabilities, only a small percentagedemonstrate a true understanding of the needs of this population. In orderto provide a format for adults with learning disablities to communicate,LDA published a survey questionnaire in the spring 1994 Newsbriefs. The results of this survey have now beenpublished in "They Speak For Themselves." Some of these resultsare presented in the graphs below. The complete booklet may be obtainedthrough the national office. The survey was designed to obtain a complete description of the impactof learning disabilities on the lives of these adults. It asked about age,education, vocational history, mental and physical health, income, livingarrangements, and interactions with the justice system. It also includedquestions concerning the incidence of learning disabilities or other disabilitiesin other members of the family. Participants had the option of remaininganonymous and of providing additional comments. These comments, which providedinsight into the concerns of adults with learning disabilities and theirparents, added an unexpected dimension to the survey. It must be noted that the survey was not a random sample of the populationof adults with learning disabilities. The survey was distributed throughour national publication Newsbriefs. The respondents wereknowledgeable about learning disabilities and were motivated enough tobelong to a national organization concerned with learning disabilities.It is not possible to know to what extent these responses reflect the totalpopulation of adults with learning disabilities.

How Many "A's" Are Enough? Barbara Cordoni, Ed.D. A local Learning Disabilities Association meeting had as its speakers a group of successful college students with learning disabilities who were answering questions asked by the middle and high school students in the audience. This meeting represented the first time the adolescent students with learning disabilities had ever had the opportunity to really interact with others who had gone through what they were going through. Both the older college students and the younger students had their stories. Some of the stories they related were enough to break every heart in the room. Some students reported good attempts by teachers to help them but one reported "being placed in a waste basket because that was all she was worth." They nodded their heads. These young people understood each other. As a listener at this meeting, I learned from the students, as is often the case. A lovely thirteen year old looked directly at my daughter, Tara, a member of the panel, and asked, "How many 'A's' are enough?" While I was still pondering the question, my daughter answered, "I don't know. I don't know how many A's you have to get before you feel worthwhile, before you feelas competent as others; before you stop worrying that they will find you out."As Tara spoke, I remembered that it was not until she had her master's degree in her hand that she had allowed herself to believe it was truly hers. Even though parents may learn a great deal from meetings such as these, it is difficult for us to hear of the painful experiences of our children. It can also be difficult to hear students reveal to their understanding peers thingsthey felt they couldn't discuss with their parents. When we, horrified, find out years later some of the things that happened to them, they tell us they couldn't talk about them, it simply hurt too much. LIVING WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES The way families handle interactions such as these or those with school personnel depends on several factors: the mental health of the family; how badly and how often the child is wounded; the quality of help and support they receive from family, friends and the school district; and their own personalities. Obviously, families are different. Some are intact, but feel that educating children is the school's job and if the school did a better job many problems would be avoided. Some parents are fearful of confronting a teacher, fearing the teacher may retaliate and their child may receive fewer services. Some families are headed by single parents, who have to work long hours just to feed the children, leaving little time for parent involvement with the school. The structure of the family is far less important than the family's support of the person with learning disabilities. Acceptance of the person as a valued human being is the key to good mental health. In order to understand the family dynamics more comprehensively than one person's experience allows, the author spoke at length with a number of the Achieve Program's students. The Achieve Program is an academic support system for students with learning disabilities at Southern Illinois University. For seventeen years, these students have come from all over the United States and from thirteen foreign countries in order to go to college with the support of thisprogram. The author felt that a broad spectrum of experiences fromstudents from across the land would allow a better understanding of theadolescent years as experienced by our children. As expected, theirexperiences were varied. Some who came from very supportive homes, or whowere sports stars, or who went to private schools where their learningdisabilities were understood, came through those teenage years reasonablyintact psychologically. None was left without wounds. Students who came from homes where the learning disability was a source of embarrassment for the parents or where the parents didn't understand, had serious questions about their own self worth. Students who came from schools where the school district routinely restricted their classes and the makeup of those classes, showed a greater degree of stress than those from more supportive schools. All agreed that multicategorical placements produced the poorest results. Students who had been in classes with severely acting out students or who were mentally retarded rarely received appropriate services. The resource room in such schools represented the place where the "dummies go." This was a painful experience and memories continue to be painful. None understood the nature of his/her disabilities. Many said they were told that they were smart but had trouble learning. Others were given a label, such as dyslexia, which really had little meaning to them. The students perceived themselves as "not trying very hard"; not too bright; and outsiders in that critical group of successful high schoolstudents. They felt lonely and were embarrassed over their inadequacies and because of having to spend time in the resource room. Teenage years are difficult at best; however, having a learning disability only makes this period more difficult. Adolescents want desperately to be liked by their peers, but may feel isolated because of their disability. Parents may continue to offer support by telling the child how smart they are but the child may not believe it. The feeling is: "They're my parents, they have to say it." SCHOOL EXPERIENCES The Achieve students handled the trauma of high school in different ways. One took a full time job and went to school only occasionally. His single mother worked nights and could not be around for him. During one period he missed 45 days of school. Apparently, the school either was unaware or unconcerned. Another enrolled in as few academic classes as possible, taking several PE classes a semester and perhaps one history class. He arranged his study halls for the end of the day which meant he could leave school at noon.His last math class was in 8th grade. The friends he made at his Catholic grade school were the ones he kept. He says he went back to his ten year highschool reunion and didn't know anyone. As these stories are relayed, one wonders, "Where were the guidance counselors, the special education teachers, the truant officers?" BEHAVIORS Others say they hid behind a mask of toughness - black leather jackets; a knife in your backpack; promiscuity; alcohol and drugs - defying anyone to getclose. Some shoplifted, hot-wired cars, ran away and dated unsuitable people. Many, of course, dropped out of school. When parents see these kinds of behaviors emerging, they may not know what to do. Most try to talk to the youngster, (which often evolves into a screaming match) but unless a strong family bond has been set up long ago, talking probably will not be very effective. Even if there was a strong bond established, it is very difficult for the young person to open up to a parent about issues he is convinced the parent will not understand. With a limited peer group, the young person is unlikely to ask their advice, certainly not as it pertains to a disability. Often, the only group that willingly accepts these students is the dropout prone, substance abusing group. Since everybody has a basic need to be accepted by someone, this group is often where the LD youngsters can be found and the worse they behave, the more accepted they are. Such behaviors are terrifying to parents who are frightened about where the behaviors may lead. This beloved child is rebelling against everything his parents have tried to teach him, willfully, it may seem. Constant worry and stress (will s/he come home tonight?) affects every family member. Siblings may resent the attention focused on the acting out child, in effect saying, "I behave and where is the attention I deserve?" Some strive even harder to "make up" for the dysfunctional child. At school they may be ashamed of, or embarrassed by the sibling. Parents may not agree on the steps to help this child, causing friction between them. Repeated trips to yet another specialist may result in financial stress. Therapeutic intervention with a psychologist or social worker seems the next step to take, but often the adolescent cannot be made to go. If the parent succeeds in getting the child into the building to meet the therapist, the adolescent may be so resistant to treatment that there is no point in pursuing it. Many Achieve students have been through therapy, or their parents have attempted therapy. They felt that the best approach is to find an LD adult to work with the student in a non-threatening environment. Very few therapists have been trained to work with and understand the needs of the person with a learning disability and such knowledge is critical to successful intervention. Another response of the LD adolescent is to become the "people pleaser" in an attempt to have some control over what is happening to him/her. This child appears less rebellious and is less frightening to parents. This child has learned to be a charmer, often a skillful manipulator, who can talk others into just about anything; who never takes no for an answer; who will later come back with another reason why s/he should be allowed to do it his/her way.They tend to do better in school because teachers hesitate to fail these pleasant people who always have a smile. They can be maddening to live with. The pleasantness at school often disappears at home where it is less useful, but the manipulative behavior remains. Here, again, family dynamics come into play as they learn how to lead without destroying what, to the child, has become a survival skill. Parents need to remember that adolescents may be frightened and are doing the best they can to cope. They have little faith in their own abilities; theyfeel that they are less adequate than their peers; and they are constantly afraid their inadequacies will be discovered. Sometimes a youngster just quits. A mother and father came to see me, dragging along their fifteen year old son. He sat down hard on the couch and glared at me as his parents told me his story. He had been seen by some fine specialists but his parents said that the school had never followed through on the specialists' suggestions. He was impulsive and distractible. He had a language disorder which did not allow him to formulate a sentence; rather he would talk all around a topic until people refused to listen. Having tried everything they knew to help their child, now they were very frightened. The school was threatening to send him away to a school for the emotionally disturbed; the last time the school psychologist had tried to test him he had refused to answer any questions. I turned to the child and laughed, much to the parents amazement. "Decided you weren't going to play his silly games anymore, didn't you?" He looked at me, startled, and said: "Yes!" I then said to the boy, "You felt it hadn't done you any good in the past so why gothrough it again, right?" to which he replied, "Right!" His parents were stunned to find the reason for his refusal to submit to more testing. Often a child will so entrench himself in a position that only a person outside the family can be more objective and get at the heart of the matter. Why should he try to explain to his parents? After all, they had allowed this to happen to him again; they were no help in his eyes. They went on to tell me of his many talents while he rebuffed each talent they mentioned. Finally I turned to him and said: "You think that if you can do it, it must be awfully easy and everybody else can do it too, don't you?" He looked surprised when I told him that not everyone would be able to do the same things he could do, but that he would have to learn that himself. It was agreed that he would be placed in an alternative school that a very good special education director had opened. This placement was basically a self-contained LD class, which proved to be a lifesaver for this child. The nurses in the newborn nursery as well as mothers can tell early on the type of personality a baby is likely to develop. Some babies seem ready to take on the world while others lie quietly, hardly making a sound. These inborn personality variables, especially in the child with learning disabilities, are obviously affected by the way a child is raised. As the quiet baby grows he or she is easy to get along with but tends to be a more fearful child, less ready to be the first in line or to raise a fuss. This is the child who allows the parent - indeed almost forces the parent - to do a great deal for him/her. From homework to the ironing, these children appear helpless and if this behavior is allowed to continue, they will be. In adolescence, many become depressed. DEPRESSION Adolescent depression can be very frightening. It is difficult for a parent to judge how severe the depression is and to know when to call for professional help. Some signs of clinical depression are: a lack of interest in things s/he was interested in before; a change in eating habits, either bingeing or rejection of food which can lead to bulimia or anorexia; lack of interest in personal appearances and/or personal hygiene; excessive sleeping; a lack of involvement in family matters; promiscuity; drug use; and truancy. While each of these behaviors can have other causes, it is very important for the parent to watch for them and to take action if necessary. Action may include those mentioned before such as talking to a social worker, psychologist, or another adult with learning disabilities. Medication, if indicated, must be monitored by a physician. If the adolescent refuses to consult a professional, then the parent must do so. Depression is too dangerous to just hope it will disappear. One of my students told me he was in third grade the first time he tried to commit suicide. All children can become depressed under certain circumstances, but it is not sustained. It goes away after a few days or a week and should not be of great concern. If the depression is constant or becomes more severe, seek professional help. Once again, a major secret to good mental health is to feel good about yourself. INDEPENDENCE We parents help in the early school years because we must. The child with learning disabilities is under such stress to get the homework done that we are unwilling to place additional burdens, so the unkempt room is allowed for one more day or the chores left undone. It is also easier to do the chores ourselves than to get the child to do what s/he is supposed to do. Like water, taking the path of least resistance, the child learns to be helpless, and the parent feels needed. This isn't so bad while the child is young, but upon reaching adolescence most people want some control over at least a portion of their lives. Parents. unaccustomed to this behavior, may not willingly relinquish control. By this time, parents have been fighting for this child for a long time and may distrust other's promises. Even in the Achieve Program we have parents who call often, making sure that their child is getting the needed help. The students resent it. A young man lost his backpack the other day and since it contained some expensive equipment, he called his folks to tell them. His dad immediately called to ask for help for his son. Because we keep copies of their notes from classes and could help in replacing some of the lost material, I called the young man, who exploded, saying, "Can't they ever let me take care of anything myself!" A student, twenty years of age, requested a counseling session for her parents. She did not want to have to call her mother every day. She wanted to be allowed to make some decisions on her own. It was explained to her that if she wanted that freedom, she had to accept responsibility as well. She had to do her own work and not ask for her parents' help in writing every paper, ironing her clothes, and solving her problems. She understood that and was really trying to become her own person. This was discussed with her parents, concluding that we didn't think they really wanted her in the nursing home with them. They laughed and said that wouldn't be so bad, but one wonders if there wasn't an element of truth in that statement. Intellectually, they want her to have a life of her own; emotionally, it is much harder to let go. Many people with learning disabilities have grown up having had most things done for them, thus they come to expect it. Parents who wrote their papers; mothers who cleaned their rooms and who never taught, indeed insisted,that they learn how to do a wash or fix a salad, should not be surprised when the young adults have difficulty surviving on their own. Parents are teaching dependency when they do not teach their children to use a credit card or write a check. Many parents say that all of those years they were just struggling to get their children through high school but there is another three fourths of their lives after high school when other skills are needed. Socially, our youngsters tend to develop later than their peers. Because of language disorders they may be unable to express themselves well and may become the victims of other's jokes. They may have trouble understanding humor or sarcasm. Teasing may not be understood since children with LD tend to see things as black or white. Teachers need to understand these language disorders so they can offer the support needed to develop social skills. Many children with LD mature slower physically, developing balancingskills long after their peer group has been bicycling or roller skatingfor years. Jumping rope or playing ball are things one needs to be ableto do on the playground. To be chosen last for the team consistently isjust another way to have one's self esteem shattered. Some children cannot follow an issue to its logical conclusion. For instance, some time ago, we were told to expect an earthquake on a certain day. A student who had a note taker for his classes because of his difficulty with writing, asked: "If a major earthquake hits, where should I go to pick up my notes?" An untrained teacher might laugh, assuming the comment was a joke. Such a reaction could further diminish self-esteem. EDUCATIONAL SERVICES When I was a resource room teacher, it was fun to teach. I had in my classes five or six children per period. The only children I had were the real LD children. They could be grouped by skill levels and taught accordingly. My older daughter became a learning disabilities masterteacher, but in her classroom, she had a mixture of brain injured,emotionally disturbed, retarded, and LD children. Out of thirty-onechildren she saw in the course of the day, seven were really LD. Althoughshe had an aide, her role was more like that of a traffic cop. A studentassigned to her room for twenty minutes to work on spelling could not beexpected to accomplish much among the turmoil of so many children and somany disabilities. In my own district, the range of IQ scores of childrenstaffed into the "LD" classrooms range from 59 to 122 - a range fromretarded to superior. With multicategorical placements where all thechildren with disabilities are in the same resource rooms, it is littlewonder that being placed in special education classes today is such a stigma. High school teachers are trained, not in general education, but in contentareas. A history or math teacher generally teaches math or history. Theyare not trained in special education or how to modify the curriculum to allow the student with learning disabilities to demonstrate what they have learned. Many prefer not to have special education students in their classes, believing that they slow down the other students and limit their teaching efforts. Their fears may be valid in cases where classes consist of students with varied disabilities. High school resource rooms are often used for tutoring students through their classes so very little effort is made to increase their reading, math, writing or social skills. There is no single person supervising the educational needs of an individual child and special education teachers say they have a hard time getting any modifications for their students. It is incomprehensible that one can take a Graduate Record Exam, an LSAT or an MCAT to get into graduate school, law school or medical school, untimed, with a reader or a scribe, but a ninth grade student is not allowed to take his math test untimed. Many teachers believe giving such accommodations is unfair to other students, ignoring or ignorant of research to the contrary. In some better schools, a student may be allowed to take his/her test with the resource room teacher, but developing basic skills is not accomplished. Additionally, many schools begin to track students into courses of a certain level based on their skills as early as the ninth grade, so many LD students are tracked into high school vocational classes. While that may be fine for some, it severely limits the student who may have other, more advanced career goals. When a student is reading poorly, it is indeed rare for a guidance counselor to suggest that s/he take this course if s/he wants to be a surgeon, or that course if s/he wants to be an archaeologist, yet college programs turn out surgeons and archaeologists all the time. What is so troubling is that we give our students so few options; we neglect to tell them that they have choices of careers and that we can help them discover how to access them. Parents may fall into the same trap. The idea of "mainstreaming" was to give special education students a chance to be with their peers in classes where it was thought thev would do well in order to improve their social interactions. Many of our students are gifted in art, music, math or other areas. However, if we place a student in such a class and s/he has to read or write and that is an area of disability, the student will fail without certain modifications. We cannot have it both ways;we cannot proclaim the value of a social learning situation and then not give the student a means to achieve success. A major reason gifted learning disabled children cannot get into gifted classes at the elementary school level is because there is simply too much writing, so their giftedness is ignored because they can't write or spell well or fast enough. Such treatment of our nation's children is reprehensible and it goes on every day. As the result of this nearly constant emotional trauma, many of our kids just give up. "What is the point of going to a place where I am constantly told that I am lazy, disorganized and dumb?" they say. They may not do a homework assignment finding it easier to say they simply didn't do it rather than admit they couldn't do it. Not doing it is better than failing it. One student brought in a paper covered with red marks: "Another bloody one," she said. How many "bloody ones" can a person stand before they give up? PARENT INVOLVEMENT In the 1940's mothers marched on Albany to get services for their retarded children. So it has always been. Parents must lead the way for their children with learning disabilities. Parents must make sure the schools use appropriate modifications for our children; special education teachers cannot do it alone. Parents must say to the schools that if they are going to fail a student on a history exam because s/he misspelled some of the words, then don't call it a history test, call it a spelling test. Parents must insist the student be given an oral exam to let the student show what the student has learned in the class. After all, that is what the teacher should want to know, and it is the information on which the grade should be based. At the college level we have no problem with this and professors are quite willing to modify exams, test orally, and so forth. Why must our students suffer for so many years before they finally get the services they deserve? As parents of children with learning disabilities, we have had to do many things we never dreamed we would have to do. We have had to watch our beloved children suffer. We have had to read the law when we would rather be reading a novel. We have had to intervene with schools that were supposedly there to support our children, but too often hurt more than they helped. It is hard to forgive that. All we can do is the best we can in preparing our children for the world in which they must live. There is still time, no matter what the age of your child. STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS If your child has dysgraphia (difficulty with handwriting) do not delay in making a computer available. Get the use of a computer written into his/herIEP; that way the computer follows the child when s/he enters middle school. If your child has trouble spelling, provide a spelling ace. This device looks like a calculator and is worth its weight in gold to our students. It also allows them to use the vocabulary words they know, such as "enormous," instead of the one they can spell, "big." Most LD adolescents don't have many friends and don't know how to make friends. One student gets migraines on those rare occasions when he is asked to a party. His fear is very real. Join a club with your teenager so you are the protector until s/he can go it alone. It doesn't matter what kind of club,anything you think you both might enjoy. Don't expect your child to jump at the chance at first. Help your child to be comfortable in social settings by taking him/her to restaurants. plays and other social gatherings. Teach him/her how to calculate a tip in a restaurant; how to greet others; the importance of a firm handshake; and having eye contact with another. We sometimes become so accustomed to our children's behavior that we fail to help them understand that standing too close to another may make them uncomfortable; we never ask about things like a person's age, weight, or how much money hemakes; we never brag about how much we have. If matching clothing is a problem, use magic markers to mark on the tag oron a seam; if your child cuts out the tags - they irritate them you know - make a colored dot. Then take all the shirts that go with that blouse or pair of pants and put the same colored dot on them. Pick another magic marker and do the same with the rest of his/her clothes. That way you don't get plaids with stripes. Get maps of your town, state, the country and the world. Let him/her pick the route to grandma's. When the news comes on, find those places on the map.Show him/her where Haiti and Bosnia are. That can open a family discussion on whether or not we should have gone. Discuss the pros and cons of the elections. Lead and discuss in a safe environment and treat their opinions as politely as you would a stranger's. Help them to realize that they have options. If reading remains aproblem, order books on tape from your local library. If they can't addwell, develop their skills with a calculator. Teach them how to balance acheckbook, to figure out the best buy on a stereo. Help them developconversational skills by talking to them and by providing gentlefeedback. In other words, help them to develop a life style as close tothat of others as possible. Teach them how to clean the bathroom, peel a potato, what to do incase of an accident. As a family, teach time management. Put up calendars,color coding for specific activities. On a weekly calendar, color codehomework periods, TV watching, when a paper is due and so on. If you dothis as a family, writing down the dance recital, a business meeting, anout of town trip, it will become a natural part of their lives. Involve your child in decision making, starting with things liketopping for a pizza. In this way you establish that you respect his/her opinion while still being able to lead and direct him/her, and you give him/her experience in making decisions. When s/he has to make big decisions for him/herself, it won't be so frightening. Help your child understand his/her disability and put it in perspective. After all, 90% of them works just fine; it's that one little part that is so difficult to deal with. The more you accept the learning disability thatgets in the way of an otherwise great person, the more they will be ableto accept themselves. When they fully understand their own strengths andweaknesses, they should be taught how to advocate for themselvesintelligently. Continue to work with the schools. Become a vocal advocate for children. We must change our educational system for these children so that it helps rather than hinders. Perhaps Tara, in a paper for a class in her doctoral program, best described what those with learning disabilities want in education. "If I were to develop a school today the motto would read: 'Above All Else, Do No Harm.' It would be a school where students would feel good about their abilities and would not be ridiculed for their weaknesses; a place where children would wantto be. Kinesthetic and tactile learning would be used as well as the traditional visual and auditory format to reach a greater number of children'spotentials. Hands on, experiential tasks would be used as well as group discussions in order to teach and motivate students. All children would be valued, regardless of social status, ethnicity, gender or disability. Peer tutoring would be used to show that all students have their individual strengths and weaknesses. In this school, there would be no more than twenty students per teacher. This is what I wish I had had. This is what my son will have. This is what I want for all children." There is a wonderful Chinese proverb which reads: "Parents should give their children two things, roots and wings." Make sure your children can fly. _____________ From Secondary Education & Beyond: Providing opportunities forstudents with learning disabilities, Chapter 17.

Levine, M.D. Carl W. Swartz, Ph.D. Introduction Recognition of Adolescents' Patterns of Neurodevelopmental Variation The Phenomena Associated with Reduced Attentional Strength The Phenomena Associated with Limited Memory Capacity The Phenomena Associated with Superficial Understanding The Phenomena Associated with Reduced or Inefficient Output Summary References Introduction The secondary school years represent a significant period oftransition for adolescents (Levine, 1988). Students move frompupil-oriented elementary or lower schools to more content-drivensecondary school settings. Students with disorders of learning and/orattention can find graduating with a high school diploma increasinglyproblematic. Often, students with learning disorders lack the requisiteskills for success and therefore are not ready to meet academic expectations. Moreover, traditional classroom teaching techniques may not besuited to their particular learning strengths and content affinities orinterests. It is becoming readily apparent that within the adolescent age group,traditional criteria and definitions of learning disability fall far short ofcapturing the actual phenomena that lead to academic failure. Many of thelearning and attentional problems of secondary school students simply do notconform to the subtests of an IQ test or the parameters tapped by traditionalgroup achievement assessments. Consequently, many struggling adolescents "fallbetween the cracks" of diagnostic insight. The reasons for theirdifficulty are misconstrued, and commonly they are deprived of neededservices and accommodations. In this chapter we are advocating a substantial broadening of the concept oflearning disorder. Our paradigm shift entails the recognition and properinterpretation of clinical phenomena that are readily observable in theclassroom. Some of these phenomena may reveal themselves on standardized testswhile others are simply observable within academic contexts. If a student'spatterns of learning and working reveal the presence of one or more suchphenomena, that adolescent should be thought to harbor a disorder that is impeding learning and/or academic productivity. The well establishedphenomenon in and of itself is a legitimate cause for concern and a clearindication for intervention. Research results suggest many students with learning disorders lack thenecessary skills to succeed in general education settings (Deshler, Schumaker,Alley, Warner, & Clark, 1982) perform below the 10th percentile onstandardized measures of academic achievement (Warner, Schumaker, Alley, &Deshler, 1980); and lack many of the higher-order thinking skills required ofself-directed learners (Schumaker, Deshler, & Ellis, 1986). Furthermore,increased requisites for students to receive a standard high school diplomamay include mastering a second language, completing a mandatory mathematicscourse such as Algebra 1, and taking four years of language arts and sciences.Such educational reforms undertaken to produce literate and thoughtfulcitizens (e.g., GOALS 2000, Healthy People 2000) may potentially "push-out"students who realize early in their high school career that they cannot attainsuch standards tied to a "normal" diploma; and other types of diplomas(attendance) are not worth staying in school. The educational and professionaloptions having a positive life-long impact on these developing adults may befew for students with disorders of learning and attention. Results of the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) suggested oneoption being used by students with high prevalence/low severity learningdisorders is dropping out (Wagner, 1991). Students with learning disabilitieshad the second highest drop-out rate (32%) among exceptional children,included in a representative national survey. The figures reported in the NLTSare conservative estimates of the percentage of students with learningdisorders who drop-out because students with learning problems who do not meetfederal and state guidelines for learning disabilities are not included. TheCarnegie Council on Adolescent Development painted the following bleakeconomic future for our country and for students who drop-out compared withstudents who graduate with a high school diploma (cf Hamburg, 1992): (a) the rate of unemployment is double for students who drop-out; (b) over their lifetime the United States loses almost $260 billion in lost earnings and taxes; and (c) a male high school drop-out earns $260,000 less and contributes $78,000 less in taxes than males who graduate with a diploma; a female drop-out earns $200,000 less and contributes $60,000 less in taxes than females who graduate. Clearly, the percentage of students who drop out ofschool will have enormous implications for the overall well-being of oureconomy and of our society as a whole. Parents, adolescents, and educators are left grappling with significanteducational issues given the multitude of academic, social, and behavioralproblems that can be associated with learning and attentional disorders. Whatare the roles of parents, special and general educators, and the studentsthemselves for managing the educational process in the secondary schools inview of the wide range of factors contributing to academic success or failure?What knowledge and skills should teachers have regarding these students so asto manage more effectively their education, thereby increasing the probabilitythat students will experience success and remain in school? The magnitude ofthese issues is increased given the mismatch between the rate at which schooldistricts are adopting and implementing inclusionary models when contrastedwith the speed (and quality?) in which pre- and inservice teachers are beingdeveloped to successfully include all students in their classrooms. The purpose of this chapter is to present a phenomenological perspective oflearning disorders. A phenomenological perspective emphasizes improvingclassroom teachers' ability to recognize and describe behavior associated withcognitive, behavioral, and social development of students with highprevalence/low severity learning disorders. The purpose of such descriptionsis to enhance classroom teachers' ability to manage the education of studentswith neurodevelopmental variations in the classroom (i.e., selection ofaccommodations, implementation of direct interventions, modification ofclassroom materials). Top Recognition Of Adolescents' Patterns Of Neurodevelopmental Variation As yet, no definition of learning disabilities has produced a consensusregarding what constitutes a learning disability (Levine, Hooper, Reed,Sandler, Swartz, & Watson, 1993). All definitions of learning disabilitiesremain relatively vague characteristics emphasizing what a learning disabilityis not rather than what a learning disability is (Levine, et al, 1993).Discrepancy formulas, for example, are often intended to exclude students withmental retardation or "slow learning" but fail to shed light on the specificforms of learning disability. This has lead to an over reliance onstandardized tests of intelligence and achievement to determine eligibilityfor services without illuminating the wider array of learning disorders thatthwart the academic progress of adolescents. From our perspective,well-educated classroom teachers can derive information about students'learning disorders by analyzing their error patterns and observing theirbehavior. Evidence gathered by classroom teachers, students, and parents cansupplement information gleaned from tests of intelligence and achievement,thus, providing crucial information aiding in the process of recognizingstudents' learning strengths and points of cognitive breakdowns. Importantly ,we believe that the information provided by a well-educated teacher(s) cansignificantly enhance the development and successful implementation ofeducational management plans that lead to success for adolescents who are notmeeting classroom expectations and whose external defenses and face savingtactics mask serious underlying deficits in academic skills, in cognitivefunctions, and in the strategies needed to facilitate productivity in school. In this chapter, we will describe the following four common phenomena ofdysfunction that teachers and parents of adolescents need to be able torecognize and manage in adolescents: (a) reduced attentional strength; (b) insufficient memory capacity; (c) superficial comprehension; and (d) output problems. The purpose of this section is not to make readers expert"diagnosticians" but instead to provide examples of phenomena that oftenobstruct the quest for success as students traverse the bridge from earlyadolescence to early adulthood. Top The Phenomena Associated With Reduced Attentional Strength The heightened demands of secondary school curricula can place a strain onadolescents' capacity to attend to the varied sources of input from teachers,instructional materials, and peers. Secondary schools require students tosustain cognitive effort and to concentrate selectively for extended periods.Many adolescents may lack the attentional capacity to differentiate multiplelevels Of saliency in information and fend off the ever present threat ofmental fatigue. An adolescent's problem attending may be confined to certaincontexts (such as highly verbal settings) or the difficulty can be pervasiveand manifest itself globally as a deficit in one or more of the followingdomains: (a) academic recognition; (b) behavioral control; and/or (c) socialcognition (their ability to establish and maintain relationships with peersand adults [Levine, 1993]). Students with reduced attentional capacity in theacademic/cognitive domain may feel tired, bored, or restless unless they arefocusing on highly stimulating, romantically alluring subject matter oractivities. These students are likely to show signs of insatiability or suchan intense desire for highly pleasurable activities that they are unable todelay gratification and focus on less exciting stimuli (such as a lecture insocial studies). Frequently, these students are prone to extremes ofdistractibility and an inability to be highly selective in their attention.They focus on irrelevant detail or distractions and seldom make gooddeterminations of what is important or salient in a task, or a text. Forexample, in reading, they may have a poor sense of what is essential toremember and what is relatively unimportant. Adolescents may also revealprominent cognitive impulsivity, a tendency to "undertake tasks hastily andwithout sufficient planning. Consequently, many of them are observed to "dothings the hard way." Attentional problems in the academic-cognitive domain may or may not coexistwith attentional problems in the behavioral domain. Adolescents withattentional behavior problems seem to be unable to allocate attentionalresources to previewing the consequences of their behavior, monitoring theiractions or gaining from positive or negative feedback. The dilemma for parentsand teachers is to decide if the behavioral problems are the primary issues tobe dealt with or if these behavioral problems are related to the student'sfrustrations over failure in the classroom. Finally, attention problems thatmanifest themselves in the domain of social cognition can reveal themselves asa student's inability to determine and to deploy appropriately the socialskills needed to establish and maintain positive relationships with peers andadults. Adolescents may voice inappropriate comments, impinge on otherpeople's "space," and appear to not have a sense of their negative impact on other people. The attention deficits of adolescents may elude detection because theirmanifestations are highly inconsistent. Their difficulties tend to wax andwane. Consequently, during some hours, on some days, or even for weeks, anaffected student may have no trouble concentrating, only to deteriorate at anytime and for any interval for no apparent reason. Sometimes the test scoresover a semester portray such performance inconsistency all too vividly.Some adolescents with attention deficits show no evidence of other forms oflearning disorders; however, the existence of attention deficits in isolationis actually unusual. Most of these students have trouble with other aspects offunction, possibly including memory, higher order thinking skills, language,motor function or social development Additionally, these students aresusceptible to a range of emotional problems, including depression and otherforms of affective disorder. It is important to recognize that adolescents with attention deficit are aptto harbor notable strengths. In particular, many of them are highly creativeand entrepreneurial. Often they are experiential learners. That is, they arelikely to learn most from active participation and direct experience ("on thejob training") rather than through the usual formal modes of academiclearning. Top The Phenomena Associated With Limited Memory Capacity The memory demands of secondary school exceed the capabilities of manystudents with learning disorders. Secondary school curricula place a premiumon students' cumulative recall of information (e.g., using information in Maythat was learned in October), ability to summarize information for oral andwritten presentations, differentiation of memory skills by content area and byteacher expectations, and expectation for metamemory sophistication, or whatindividual students know about memory and memory processes (Levine & Reed,1992). Given the complexity of memory systems, there exist a range of memorydysfunctions that predispose to academic difficulty. We will describe what webelieve to be four common adolescent disorders of memory. Inadequate Entry Into Short-Term Memory There are students who endure discrete weaknesses of short-term memory. Somehave difficulty "recoding" input by paraphrasing or abbreviating informationin lectures and textbooks to allow complex messages to "fit" within the verylimited capacity of short-term storage. Others have highly specific deficitswith the registration of specific modalities of data into short-term memory.Thus, an adolescent may have problems entering visual-spatial information(e.g., from a map), sequential data (e.g., the steps in a math process) orverbal information (e.g., oral directions from the teacher). Still others failto employ effective rehearsal strategies (visual-imaging, sub-vocalization,and self testing) to facilitate and strengthen entry of information intoshort-term memory. These students may have trouble studying for tests andacquiring new information or skills during class sessions. Active Working Memory Dysfunction Active working memory enables a student to "hold on to" different componentsor procedures within a task while working on that task. Students withdysfunctions of active working memory are likely to forget what they are doingwhile they are doing it. Active working memory is vital during extendedperiods of writing, while performing mathematics computations, and whilereading. An affected adolescent may lose the essence of the beginning of achapter while reading the subsequent sections. He or she may lose track of aprocess amid a mathematics problem. The student may forget an idea whiletrying to recall a specific spelling word or punctuation rule. Students withactive working memory dysfunctions become understandably discouraged andanxious in school. They often have serious problems with test-taking and seemmore competent than their performance would indicate. Slow And/Or Imprecise Retrieval Memory Much of the secondary school curriculum demands rapid and exact recall offacts and processes. When a student is called on in class, he or she generallyhas three seconds to retrieve a response approximating the answer the teacherrequires. During tests, be it an essay test or a multiple choice/true false test, there is a steady need for the rapid recall of previously learnedmaterial. While writing, when time does not allow for substantive revision(e.g., timed exam), students must engage in simultaneous retrieval of contentknowledge and rules governing written expressions (i.e., they must quicklyrecall spelling, punctuation, capitalization, vocabulary, facts, ideas andletter formations). Some students simply cannot meet this chaUenge and exhibita chronic abhorrence of writing (Levine, Oberklaid, & Meltzer, 1981). Othersare delayed in mathematics because of slow or imprecise recall of the facts oralgorithms (i.e., procedures, such as how to reduce a fraction); especiallywhen they must recall facts and maintain the flow of the algorithms nearlysimultaneously (Levine, Lindsay, & Reed, 1992). The ultimate attainment for retrieval memory is automatization, the capacityto recall facts or procedure: instantaneously with virtually no expenditure ofmental effort. Some secondary school students are simply poorly automated;nothing at all is automatically accessible from memory. If reading decoding isnot automatic for a secondary school student his comprehension suffers badly.When math facts or computational rules are not automatic, it is hard tosucceed in algebra. Poor Pattern Recognition There are some students who have trouble recognizing the patters that keeprecurring within a subject area. They have trouble identifying themes orprocesses that keep re-appearing over an academic year, or within a particularsubject domain. To them, information and class work appears fragmented andlacking in cohesion. For example, in mathematics it may be hard for them toread a word problem and recognize a pattern within the language of the problemthat should cue a particular process. In reading, these students fail torecognize a theme, image, or character trait that emerges repeatedly invarious guises or contexts. Such weaknesses of pattern recognition memoryultimately take their toll on academic performance at the same time that theydiminish significantly the likelihood that a student will find the content ofschool particularly interesting. Embedded within the dysfunctions of memory is the ever present role ofattention. At any age, but possibly more so in adolescence, attention andmemory can interact to potentiate more insidious forms of learning disorders.Are the learning problems manifested in class attributable only to attentiondeficits? To only memory deficits? Or are the attention deficits undermining astudent's memory capacity or vice versa? Top The Phenomena Associated With Superficial Understanding Adolescents with learning disorders may proceed through secondary education ina state of mild to moderate, and sometimes even severe, confusion. These arestudents who have trouble grasping and building cognitive bridges between thefacts, ideas, concepts, an procedures learned within and across content areas.Those who appear to gain only a surface level Understanding of information maypossess hidden language deficits, poor higher-order cognitive skills,including weak formation of concepts and an over reliance on top-downprocessing, or they may be passive in their approach to learning. Adolescents With Poor Language Processing The academic demands for verbal comprehension, verbal reasoning, and verbalexpression explode in volume, density, complexity, and abstractness duringstudents' transition from early adolescence to adolescence (Montgomery, 1992).Teenagers with language deficits can manifest gaps in a number of processesand abilities assumed to be in place by secondary school. Adolescents with poor language processing may have difficulty followingcomplex instructions and interpreting extended verbal explanations (i.e.,lectures). They commonly harbor basic weaknesses in semantics, sentenceprocessing, and/or the capacity to deal with large chunks of languagediscourse. These students may reveal delays in their reading comprehension,major difficulties in foreign language acquisition, problems as well in theverbal aspects of mathematics, including the deciphering of word problems andthe mastery of technical vocabulary (Levine et al., 1992). They are prone toserious problems in courses that rely heavily on reading for content (such ashistory). There are some adolescents who can process language adequately but at a slowpace; they have trouble "keeping up" with the rapid constant onslaught ofverbal communication in the classroom. Additionally, many of these studentshave a weak metalinguistic sense, an incomplete understanding of how languageworks. They are apt to be confused over parts of speech, grammaticalconstruction, and other formal features of language. In secondary schoolsthere is a heightened need for students to be able to process abstractfigurative language, to comprehend textbooks containing densely packedverbally encoded ideas, m use verbal reasoning skills, and to learn a foreignlanguage (Levine & Reed 1992). The critical role of language progressionduring adolescence is poorly appreciated. There exists a dearth of appropriatediagnostic tools and a lack of well trained professionals with a background inadolescent language development (both normal and dysfunctional). Moreover,research into the language disabilities of secondary school students has beensparse. Adolescents With Incomplete Conceptualization Concepts are broad ideas that categorize the phenomena that keep recurring inany subject area. Examples include: "balanced equation" in mathematics;"photosynthesis" in science; "right wing" in a social studies class;"conjugation" in a foreign language; and "sonata form" in a music class. Somestudents struggle in vain with the concepts in one or more secondary schoolsubject areas. In particular, they are likely to have trouble with theever-growing array of abstract concepts, those concepts that do not containany direct sensory references. Such students are often described by theirteachers as overly "concrete." Their conceptual understanding is incomplete ortenuous - They may over-rely on prototypes, believing (or hoping) that if theycan cite an example, they must understand the concept. A student might knowthat the United States is a democracy without really grasping the componentsof government that constitute the concept of "democracy." In mathematics, astudent may over-rely on rote memory, deploying a so-called "algorithmicapproach" to problem solving. She or he may be able to solve equations withoutreally knowing what equations are. Such tenuous grasping inevitably leads toacademic deterioration. Adolescents With Extreme Top-Down Processing Students who are extreme in their top-down processing are often very creativeand imaginative. However, they have difficulty focusing on relevant details.They keep imposing or superimposing their own ideas, rich associations, andvalues over what they are hearing, observing, reading, or discussing.Adolescents who over rely on top-down processing are likely to have difficultyin highly convergent subject domains, those courses where there tends to beonly one correct answer to a question or only a single acceptableinterpretation of a situation. These adolescents often do poorly on multiplechoice tests and can be very distressed when they receive their SAT scores. Adolescents With Passive Learning Approaches Some adolescents are conspicuously inactive in their approach to learning.Within the classroom their minds seem to be inert. They fail to associate newinformation with what they already know. They tend to be non-elaborative intheir thinking and speaking in school. Very little intellectual content is ofany interest to them. Their understanding is constricted, and they tend toequate learning with memorization. Some of these students with passivelearning approaches may show attentional dysfunction as well; that is, theyseem to have too little mental energy to partake actively in the learningprocess. Top The Phenomena Associated With Reduced Or Inefficient Output The expectations of secondary school curriculum demand ever increasingquantities of self-directed academic productivity. Adolescents must not onlylearn to learn, they must also work and learn to work! The demands of outputinclude increasing amounts of a wide-range of writing genres, such asargumentative/persuasive essays, compare and contrast formats, original worksof fiction and non-fiction, each emphasizing students' ability to analyze,synthesize, and evaluate differing perspectives about history, literature, andculture. These important higher-order cognitive functions can stress the stilldeveloping or yet-to-be developed systems, that comprise students' attentionalstrength, memory capacity, comprehension level, problem-solving facility,organizational function abilities, etc. This section will describe thesecommon developmental output demands placed on adolescents. Written Output Failure There may be no more complex school-related activity than writing (Levine,1987). The myriad of interdependent and recursive cognitive processes andsub-processes required to represent knowledge on paper (see Flower & Hayes,1981; Hayes & Flower, 1986; Levine et al., 1993; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986)may make it the most cognitively expensive performance-based task; yet it isthe single most commonly used activity to evaluate competence in secondaryschools, if not at all grade levels. Presently, schools are adoptingperformance based assessment tests comprised of open-ended items that studentsrespond to by "thinking on paper," where generating a product (correct answer)is not weighed as heavily as the process (procedures, thought processes) usedto arrive at the product. Such forms of evaluation will no doubt discriminateagainst students with "output problems"' by underestimating their competency.These adolescents often can partake of activities requiring high-orderthinking skills, but they may need to express these skills throughnon-traditional means, such as producing a piece of art work that captures theessence of a poem instead of a written essay that reflects an interpretationof the poem. Developmental written output failure can be associated with various underlyingdysfunctions. Students whose writing is labored, slow, and poorly legible mayhave graphomotor dysfunction which manifests itself in various forms of finemotor incoordination during writing that make it difficult for their fingersto keep pace with the flow of their ideas (Levine, et al, 1981). The effort oftranscribing thoughts to paper can functionally undermine thinking and the useof sophisticated language during the writing process (Levine et al., 1993).Written output failures are also exhibited by students with memorydysfunctions (see above), language difficulties (see below), andorganizational problems (see below). In addition, the higher-order deficits,such as in problem-solving ability, social cognition, planning and revisingstrategies, can make it difficult for students to select topics and producecoherent and cohesive text (Hayes & Flower, 1986). Disorders of written outputcan have a profound psychological effect on an adolescent who is prone tobecome discouraged and anxious about performance in school - perhaps soanxious about school performance as to cease being productive at all. Expressive Language Dysfunction There are many students who have difficulty meeting the high expectations forexpressive language fluency (of which written output is one form). Manylanguage processing activities require the apportionment of capacity fromdifferent cognitive processes (Montgomery, 1992). Classroom teachers canrecognize adolescents who may have expressive language dysfunction byobserving students who have difficulty communicating their ideas during classdiscussions, on paper, or both. These adolescents are at-risk for academic andsocial problems (Montgomery, 1992). Montgomery (1992) stated that researchresults are mixed as to delineating causal mechanisms underlying languageimpairments in adolescents. Deficits in expressive language have beenassociated with difficulties in social conversational abilities, wordretrieval during conversation and written expression, and the cohesiveness andcoherence of narrative text. Affected students may live in constantapprehension over the prospect of being called upon in class! Organizational Problems Secondary schools require adolescents to be extremely efficient and effectiveorganizers of time and materials; textbooks, homework, pencils, papers, pensmust all arrive at 6-7 different classrooms at the appointed times to be usedin classes led by teachers with different expectations for performance andbehavior. Adolescents can have temporal-sequential deficits, or an inabilityto estimate, allocate, stage, and monitor progress towards completion ofactivities, that undermine efficient management of time. Many adolescents withtemporal sequential deficits have trouble making use of stepwise approaches totask completion; they try to think of what to do as they are in the process ofcompleting a task. Instead, students need to plan or preview what the finalproduct may look like, generate multiple alternative strategies that could beused to complete the task, select one strategy, start the task, monitorprogress and quality of the product, and modify the strategy or select anotherwhen it is no longer facilitating goal attainment. Adolescents can oftenbenefit from an adult or a peer who will provide "expert scaffolding," or theprovision of help, for the purpose of structuring the timing and sequencing ofactivities (see Palinscar & Brown, 1984). The goal should be to model thesecovert cognitive processes as approached for the student to utilizehim/herself during problem-solving tasks. Other students will experience problems organizing materials for school.Notebooks, desks at home, lockers, assignment journals, and other "props" aresimply difficult to manage. These students "lose" many possessions, havedifficulty knowing and/or organizing materials to take home or bring back toschool, and surround themselves with hopelessly disorganized work areas andlockers. Top Summary Some phenomena that impair learning and attention in adolescents have beenpresented in a compartmentalized, linear fashion. In reality these phenomenaassociated with negative school-related outcomes never operate in isolation.Importantly from a developmental perspective, all cognitive processes arehighly interdependent and can influence each other's development andrefinement. For example, an early adolescent may possess attentional strengthsbut weak memory capacity during middle school that over time functionallyundermines existent attentional strength. This student's inability to continueto use developed attentional processes during middle school may result in weakattentional strength and reduced memory capacity in high school. In fact, bythe time students reach secondary school-age it may be very difficult, if notfutile, to identify single dimensions of cognition that cause learningproblems. That is, is a student's negative performance related only todeficits in attention, memory, language, or a combination of two, or acombination of these? Furthermore, a unitary explanation for learning andattention deficits implies a single treatment strategy. Management What are teachers, parents, and adolescents left to do regarding themanagement of the phenomena underlying underachievement given the complexityof these learning and attentional disorders and the limitations ofstandardized tests for illuminating subtle and sometimes hidden learningproblems? First, the phenomenological approach to learning disorders requiresteachers to be well-educated in adolescent cognitive and social development.Teachers need to be keen developmentalists especially about the phenomenarelating to areas such as attention, memory, language, higher-order cognition,and output. Second, well-educated teachers should apply this knowledge usingobservational tools to record prospectively relevant dimensions ofperformance. Additionally, teachers should engage their knowledge in skillfulanalyses of students' error patterns. Teachers can gather their evidence,including reports from the parent(s) and the student, and draw inferencesregarding the functional status of a struggling adolescent. Third, teacher(s),parents and students need to collaborate in a process of formulating,monitoring, and evaluating the effectiveness of educational managementtechniques that lead to academic achievement, social skill development, andenhanced self-concept. Optimal management must include "demystification" ofthe phenomena associated with negative school-related outcomes and may includeuse of accommodations that "by-pass" the problematic areas and/or directcognitive interventions that instruct students about the covert processesunderlying school-related outcomes. Demystification Of The Phenomena Educating students about their learning strengths, weaknesses, and affinitiesis based on the premise that students must begin to understand the mysteriousprocesses underlying learning and the nature of their differences as aprecondition of intervention. Students' inclusion in the process of managementgrows in importance as they grow older; it is futile to attempt to intervenein this age range if adolescents do not have a firm grasp on the nature oftheir cognitive assets and shortcomings (Levine, 1993).The purpose of demystification is to educate students about their own uniquepatterns of ability using non-threatening, non-moralistic, and jargon-freevocabulary and examples. It is hoped that such teaching can relieve studentsof negative attributions for their success and failure in the classroom andfantasies ("I'm dumb!") about themselves commonly associated with low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness, and loss of motivation in children andadolescents with learning and attentional disorders (Borkowski, Weyhing, &Carr, 1988; Sabatino, 1982; Swartz, Purdy, & Fullingim, 1983). Accommodating To The Phenomena One component of the educational management plan may be the formulation of "by-pass" techniques. The purpose of using by-pass techniques is to change the nature of tasks to minimize the negative impact of inadequately developed cognitive processes underlying school-related outcomes (i.e., long division, writing). Such techniques demand flexibility and compassion on the part ofteachers. Generally, accommodations take the following forms: (a) rate adjustment, or modifying the speed in which information is taken in and the speed in which output is expected to be produced; (b) volume adjustment. or modifying the ideational density of information taken in or amount expected to be produced; (c) complexity adjustment, or modifying the number of steps to be remembered within a procedure, reducing the linguistic demands of instruction; and (d) devices, or the use of props (i.e., calculators, word processors). Instructional decisions regarding the use of accommodations, individually orin combination with others, is a function of the student's profile ofneurodevelopmental strengths and weaknesses and the teacher's understanding oftheir interactions with components of specific tasks. An adolescent who produces very little written output on paper, but who isvery eloquent and sophisticated in her verbal output during discussions, maybenefit from "writing her paper" on a tape recorder and then transcribing itto paper. If this by-pass technique is not possible, the teacher can reducethe complexity of the writing task by encouraging the student to write theinitial draft of her paper without regard to spelling, punctuation, andgrammatical structure of the sentences and paragraphs. The teacher will thenevaluate only the quality of the ideas contained in the initial draft; theteacher will evaluate other mechanical aspects of the essay in later drafts.This process may require the teacher to make adjustments in her expectationsfor when the student will turn in the final paper. But, the teacher will beevaluating an essay that more closely approximates this student's competence. Interventions To Strengthen Weaknesses Intervention research with children and adolescents with learning andattentional disorders has had a mixed history. Kavale (1990, 1993) laments thepast shortcomings of intervention research because "... little agreement hasemerged about the value of an intervention much less insight in how and why itworks" (p.6 [Kavale, 1990]). Teachers do not know which students will benefitfrom participation in intensive intervention programs. This problem isprimarily due to researchers who provide inadequate descriptions of thesamples of students they are studying and the lack of well-controlledexperimental settings. The former limits generalizability of findings toindividual students while the latter limits transferability of teachingstrategies to classrooms. Regardless of such a less than optimistic perspective on the effectiveness ofdirect interventions and intervention research, a growing empirical knowledgebase suggests that students with learning and attentional disorders canbenefit from direct instruction in the covert cognitive processes (such asstrategy use) underlying many school-related outcomes (i.e. , readingcomprehension, narrative story writing). The purpose of direct interventionsis to improve students' self-regulation of information processing, behavior,and personal relationships. For example, a student with developmental writtenoutput failure may possess relatively intact attention, memory, languageskills, and higher-order cognition based on his teacher's classroomobservations, analyses of error patterns, and student self-reports. Thestudent's weakness may lie in his tenuous understanding of the writing process(planning, translating, reviewing) and/or how his unique neurodevelopmentalprofile of strengths and weaknesses interacts with writing tasks (e. g. ,interaction between active working memory and transcribing ideas at the sametime he is trying to use rules of syntax). The adolescent student may benefit from direct instruction in the writingprocess through a cognitive behavioral writing intervention. The purpose ofthe intervention is to improve the student's knowledge and skillful use ofplanning strategies (idea generation and organization), decisions about thetime line for translating ideas into sentences and paragraphs (initiallyattending to meaning then attending to other text features such aspunctuation, spelling and grammar), and reviewing strategies (evaluating thecohesiveness and coherence of the text, comprehensibility of the text, andrevision strategies that improve the quality of the essay). First, the teacher needs to demystify the student about his profile ofstrengths and weaknesses and then introduce the writing strategy. Second, theteacher should make covert thought processes underlying the writing processovert by verbalizing his thoughts and decisions during his modeling of how towrite an essay. Initially, the student is likely to overtly verbalize histhoughts and decisions and over time subvocalize his writing strategies.Finally, the student should self-regulate the writing process with no overtbehavior. Depending on the status of the student, this process may take weeks,months, or the whole school year. Conservation Of Adolescents A byproduct of a phenomenological perspective for recognizing and managingadolescent underachievement has at the core of its philosophy the conservationof individual variation among students. It assumes that all adolescents wantto succeed in high school and that they want to be successful adults. It isimportant to recognize that the abilities needed for success as an adultdiffer markedly from those functions that are requisites for accomplishedperformance in secondary school. Moreover, the adult world values and needsdiverse kinds of minds. We must overcome the irrational drive to homogenizeyoung people. Teachers, parents, clinicians and policy makers must strive topreserve developmental differences rather than to punish or discriminateagainst them by imposing needlessly rigid expectations during a criticalperiod when maturing nervous systems are working overtime to define theirindividuality.

The reason I do support groups for peoplewith learning disabilities is that I am very learning disabled myself.My disability is in written language. My reading is at the 30th percentileand my written expression is virtually zero. Because of these conditions,I have lots of school failure experience. The kids that I work with canidentify with that very nicely. I have been doing this work for about 7or 8 years and I have done all kinds of different groups. I've done substanceabuse, correctional institutions, and school groups. I have also done adolescentand adult groups for people with learning disabilities. These ideas aresome of the things that have worked for me and I hope they will be helpfulto others. This paper is an edited transcript of a tape I made. The tapeis also available. The purpose of this discussion is not how to run a support group. Thereis lots of literature available with basic information on support groups.I see this as information on how support groups can work for people withlearning disabilities, their specific needs, and things to talk about.Everybody has the same problems with learning disabilities and the learningdisability is the same whether you're an adult, an adolescent, or a child.The focus of this discussion is adolescents, although many of the needsand suggestions are right for children and adults with learning disabilitiesas well. Adolescents are having problems getting their education and theyare having social problems. Getting Started One of the things that we all need to do is to discover that we arenot alone in having learning disabilities. I think one thing that happensis all of us with learning disabilities haven't met other people with learningdisabilities so we feel quite alone. It's a wonderful experience when we'rein a room full of people and everybody is learning disabled and they'retalking about the same things you've had trouble with and experiences you'vehad. It's quite different to learn about other people with learning disabilitiesfrom this kind of experience than it is to have somebody tell you that10% of the population is learning disabled. There's lots of people outthere and it's hard for us to relate to the fact that, yes indeed, thereare people with learning disabilities, and a lot of them. We can't beginto really understand that until we start talking with other people whohave learning disabilities. When I meet with a group of adolescents the first thing I like to dois have the group members tell what their names are, where they're from,and what grade they're in. It's nice for them to do something that, isvery non-threatening and it starts them talking and participating in thegroup. It is important to establish confidentiality at the beginning. By thatI mean that we can talk about a lot of things in the group, we can learnfrom them, but we just can't take people's names away from the group. Theintent is that everybody learns that we do not put names to any of theinformation we hear. With adolescents, one of the things we want to dois to make sure that the parents are involved. My suggestion is that thefirst meeting be conducted for both the adolescents and the parents. Itis a good way for the parents to know who the facilitators are and whatthe adolescents are expected to do. This will make the parents less nervousabout who their children are working with and what they will be doing. Suggested Topics and Comments These ideas of things to talk about in a support group are good, butthe very best ideas are things that the group itself might like to talkabout, so the facilitator should always be exploring, "Is there anythingthat you'd like to talk about or any particular subject that you mightbe interested in?" Comment: I find it interesting that when you have a group of learningdisabled people together, there is all kinds of knowledge about learningdisabilities in that group. I think it is the facilitator's job to getthat information from the group and get everybody participating in discussingit. On a particular subject you may find a little bit of information fromone person and something else from somebody else and as everybody talksabout it, you'll find that there's an awful lot of information right inthe group. As a matter of fact, I feel that it's a group of people thatare learning disabled who are really the experts on the subject. With alittle bit of help it is amazing the kind of information that will comeout of a group. I think I have learned more about learning disabilitiesfrom groups than I have from other sources. Special Education Services Most of the adolescents are receiving some type of special educationand they need to talk about this. You can have them say if they're gettingspecial ed services and talk about whether they think the services arehelping. Comment: With these kinds of things you can get everybody to participate.The kids will also talk about what it's like to receive special educationservices. They will tell you that there are all kinds of things involvedwith the resource room; whether they like to go to the resource room, whatthe other kids think about it, whether they're called dummies because theygo to a different kind of class, if they're thought of as being retarded,how it feels to get these kinds of services, and if it helps. It's kindof surprising sometimes the kinds of things that they'll tell you. Someof them will be very satisfied and think they are getting somewhere andothers will have some real doubts and some very serious feelings aboutthe special ed services. Diagnostic Evaluations Another thing to talk about is whether they've been evaluated. Comment: Many of them will have been evaluated and they won't realizeit. Most of them, even if they have been evaluated, don't understand whatthe evaluation shows and what it might mean. This is an area that I thinkthey need to have some help with. This can be arranged by having them getsomeone to go over their evaluation with them like the school counseloror maybe a parent or somebody from LDA who is knowledgeable about evaluations.By the time they're in junior high school and high school these kids needto know what their specific learning disabilities are, how they affecttheir education, and what might be some good coping strategies to helpwith the difficulties they have. It's kind of nice for them to talk aboutthis together because they begin to see that all of the kids have similartypes of problems and they don't feel quite so alone. By talking with eachother, they're going to help each other cope with some of these things. Types of Learning Disabilities - Academic Problems Small Motor Problems or Dysgraphia. The kids don't usually understandabout small motor problems or dysgraphia. This is really something thatthey need to talk about, and quite extensively, because it does bothera high percentage of them. They often think that the reason that they can'twrite well is because they're messy, they don't pay attention, and theydon't try. It's kind of a different concept to them that they have smallmotor problems and they can't get their hands to do the writing the waythey want them to or writing gets to be a very cognitive process for them,very time consuming and hard. Comment: Just this one subject is something that could go for a wholemeeting because it's very involved and they will have enough experiencewith it that they can share. Have each one of them say if they have thesekinds of problems, what they're like, and what the ways are that they havefound to cope with these kinds difficulties. I find that not only the kidsdon't understand about dysgraphia, but most adults don't either. Teachersdon't understand and this comes as a surprise to the kids. It's kind ofa relief to them to know what these kinds of difficulties are, that theyare not because they aren't trying, that there is a reason for them, andit has a name. It is also a relief to know that there are lots of peoplewho have the same kinds of troubles. Executive Function Problems. These kids have what we call executivefunction difficulties. That means keeping their lives organized, gettingtheir work done, and making school come out right. One of the first thingsthat I do when I start to talk about this is I'll ask all of the kids ifthey have a locker. Of course all their hands go up because everyone doeshave a locker. The next question is, "Do any of you have a mess inyour locker right now?" They'll all start to laugh and everybody'shands go back up again because most of us who have learning disabilitieshave red trouble keeping things organized and getting things done. I'lldescribe how the locker looks; most of them will have 6 to 8 inches ofpaper crammed in the bottom with a bunch of books and stuff thrown in ontop, everything will be accumulating and nothing will be taken care of.There'll be homework papers that are lost in the heap, assignments thatnever got home to be done, and papers that never got passed in becausethey got lost. All these same thing also usually apply to bookbags. Another part of the same kind of thing is that kids have real problemswith time schedules at school - getting to the right class at the righttime. They will sometimes get it all figured out so they can get aroundright , but they still will have troubles having the right books and homeworkwith them. One of the things they will often do is carry every single oneof their books in their bookbags at all times and never go near a lockerbecause they can't really handle shifting things around and making surethings work out right. With time problems, what happens is that they'llfinally get a schedule worked out so that they know where they're supposedto be and get it working all right and then all of a sudden school mightrun on a different schedule because of an assembly or something. This throwsthem all off and they get lost and don't know where they're supposed tobe and they can't figure it out. Comment: The kids will start to talk about these kinds of things andthen you can get them to start talking about ways that they can help eliminatesome of these problems. It's important that they think up the ways to doit themselves. We can't give them a recipe for organizing their schoolwork. They need to work out a way that's going to work for them individuallyand they will start thinking about ways that they can keep their assignmentsorganized, make sure they get home and that they get their work done andget it back to school the next day, and that they get it to the right classand passed in. They will think about ways to get the right books to theright class at the right time. All of these things are real problems forthem and they are often surprised to find that other kids are having thesame trouble. It's very good for them to start talking to each other aboutthese kinds of things. It makes a good topic because most everybody isinvolved and they all realize that they need to do something about it,and they are quite willing to talk about it. Language Problems, Academic. There are many things that needto be talked about associated with language. Questions to be asked include:What kinds of trouble did you have learning to read? What is your readinglevel? Are you making any gains? How is your spelling? I find that thespelling seems to be a common denominator. Everybody that has languageproblems, I think, has problems with spelling. Another thing that needs to be talked about is the math part of it.I've been noticing that those who have trouble with language are apt tohave problems with early math or arithmetic. They seem to go hand in handso it looks to me like you have to have the same skills to learn languageas you do to learn early math. For instance, learning multiplication tablesand addition facts is a kind of short term memory work. To add, subtract,multiply and divide, you need sequencing skills and these are somehow relatedto language difficulties. I see that a big change happens in math when you get to Algebra I. Manypeople who have had real difficulties in arithmetic and can't seem to doaccurate work, and can't seem to learn, when they get to algebra they willbe very successful. It might turn out to be an area that they're very strongin. Sometimes those who can do algebra can do geometry and trigonometryand do very well in math. So people have to be looking for these kindsof things. I also notice that sometimes those who have been very successfulin arithmetic, get into high school and all of a sudden they are failingalgebra I and they don't have the faintest idea what's happened to them.Everybody around them is saying, "Well, you are a real, good, smartperson, if you paid attention you could do the algebra. You can do everythingelse." It's the same story that we were told about language - if wetried and paid attention we'd be able to do it. People sometimes don'thave as much understanding about the fact that we can have as much difficultyin advanced math as we do language. I have seen a lot of people who have had a lot of difficulty with theireducation when they got in high school because they couldn't do the math.This has sometimes interrupted their high school education and preventeda lot of people from going on to college, simply because they don't understandwhat happened to them. They have a weakness in math and don't get goodinstruction to help them learn. They don't understand that it's not theirfault. Comment: I try to tell the kids that it isn't their fault and that theyhaven't gotten the kind of instruction needed to help them learn. It' ssometimes a different concept for them that the difficulties that theyhave had in school really aren't their fault. They are having these difficultiesbecause of the way they are "set up". It might be that they haven'thad appropriate instruction and maybe the failure isn't theirs, maybe it'ssomeone else's. Sometimes these kids haven't thought about that before. These are some issues that relate to academics and some ideas aboutgetting started talking about them. Types of Learning Disabilities - Social Problems The other kinds of things that I work with the adolescents on aresocial issues. I think that sometimes the social issues may be as importantas the academic, or even more important. The kinds of things that we starttalking about are things like: "How do you make out having friends?Do you have a lot of friends and do you have a lot of things that you dosocially?" Do you think that you could do better in this area?" Language and Social Problems. Those of us having language difficultyare apt to have difficulty making friends or maintaining friendships. Ithink that one of the things that we need to talk about is the abilityto express ourselves and use language. For those of us that have difficulties,I see them falling into several areas. One is that we are slow in processinglanguage so it is difficult for us to keep up with other people's language.This makes it hard for us to keep a good conversation going. Some of ushave difficulty thinking of words and what we want to say, also makingit hard for us to keep a conversation going. Others have no problem gettinglanguage out. It seems to run out of them forever and it's very fast andit goes and goes and goes and sometimes it doesn't very much. Comment: These problems have to be dealt with. I think it is importantfor a facilitator to recognize these problems and not be at all bashfulabout addressing them in the group situation. For instance, if somebodyis running on and on and on and it's something they do all the time, theymay not be aware that they are doing it. The facilitator can be of a bighelp to people to stop the whole thing and point out exactly what is happeningso they will know. The facilitator can also help those who have problemsin speaking. They have to be given plenty of time and people have to bepatient and listen. Everybody has to have a chance to speak. No matterwhat their difficulty is everybody has to be patient so everybody has agood chance. As a group we can look at our expressive language difficulties and startto understand them better. Some of the things we can look at are: how wemake out one on one; can we talk in a small group where everybody is talkinga little bit slower; do we have difficulty in a larger group where thereare a lot of people talking. The group itself is a good place for peopleto practice. This is what we need to do. We need to talk, learn to talk,and talk about talking. The group is a good safe place to do this. Everybodyin the group can talk about their particular difficulties and maybe evenhave suggestions about things that help. I find that almost everybody who has expressive language difficultiesgets a lot worse if they are stressed. Of course as we try these kindsof things and we're in situations where we're talking about things thatwe have a lots of feelings about, stress is running very high. As we beginto understand that this is happening to us, we can get those stress levelsdown. This helps us a lot. Eye Contact. Many of us have difficulty with eye contact. Itkind of drives people crazy when we don't look at them when we're talkingto them, What is happening to some of us is that we're struggling so hardwith the language that we don't have enough capacity to look at someone'sface or it's so distracting to look at their face that we can't do bothat the same time. It's very difficult sometimes to get our language upand out and look at somebody while we're doing it, but we can do a lotabout these things when we start to understand them and work on them. Executive Function and Social Problems. Problems with executivefunction skills are another thing that bothers us in social situations.These are the same executive function skills that are necessary for usto succeed in school. One of the problems is that we have a poor conceptof time. Because of this we don't do a good job of meeting people whenwe say we're going to and we don't do a good job of getting things donethat we say we'll do. This causes us all kinds of problems. Another partof the executive function problems is that our rooms tend to be a messand our things are not taken care of, All of these kinds of things tendto drive other people crazy. I recently asked a young man if he had a steadygirl friend and the answer was "no" because he couldn't handlethe hassle of doing all of the things like calling her. He would forgetto call her and wouldn't meet her when he was supposed to. He hadn't figuredout how to do all of these things yet. I think one good thing about itwas that he did recognize that he had these problems. Now he needs to findways to compensate for them. Other Social Issues. Another thing that we have trouble withis that we don't know what is proper to wear. We have trouble picking anoutfit that looks right together and we also have problems knowing whatto wear to a particular function. A lot of the kids tell me that they can'tfigure out what the latest styles are at school and if they try somethingdifferent they get made fun of or laughed at. They can't figure that wholesystem out. One of the things they say is that they just wear jeans anda sweatshirt because that's always acceptable. That's not what they'd liketo do but they can't figure out what is happening with the styles. Comment: Always keep in mind that the group will have some ideas orsome things they would like to talk about. It also might be very appropriatefor the group to do some social things together such as having a pizzaparty, going on an outing, or something else, that lets them socializetogether and not just work all the time. Looking at Positives Comment: Up to this point I've talked about things that don't workright or that we have difficulty with. We also need to spend time lookingat things that do work and things that we do succeed at. I like to spendabout as much time looking at positive things as things that we have difficultywith. One of the things that's nice to do every meeting is to have peopleidentify some things that have gone real well for them. Maybe they havedone something that they have never been able to do for themselves before,they have been able to take a stand, or they have been able to explainsomething to somebody that they hadn't been able to do. Just look for thepositive things that are happening. Outside of that I also like to spend a lot of time looking at what thegifts or the abilities are. By definition, people with learning disabilitieshave to be of average intelligence or higher. If this is so, and we havedeficits in language, for example, it's a given that we have areas thatwe're better than average in. A lot of time the kids have not even thoughtabout these areas. People haven't helped them think about these things.People are very apt to point out the things we have difficulty with andsometimes we don't get much positive reinforcement for the things thatwe can do. I use Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences to discuss gifts andabilities, but there are other systems to use. The important thing is thatwe start looking at areas that we can succeed in and develop some knowledgein these areas. Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences. The firstintelligence that we talk about is "linguistic" or language.This includes the ability to read, write, spell, speak and all of the languagekinds of things that most of us who have learning disabilities have a greatdeal of trouble with. As I mentioned, I have found that the kids who aregood in language also do very well in early math, arithmetic. Many timesthose of us who have language troubles also have trouble in arithmetic. The second intelligence is "mathematical, logical".I find that the mathematics we are talking about here is are advanced andI'm not sure just where it starts, but when people get to Algebra I theyare there. Sometimes when students with this ability get to Algebra I,they have their first success in school. This was true for me. The firsttime I had any success in school at all was when I got to algebra. Another area is "spatial abilities". This is the abilityto picture things in your mind as they really are. Kids with this abilityran do very well with blueprints and they can visualize things and putthem together and make things work. They do very well with lego sets. Theylike construction toys. They can draw. They just generally just like tomake things. Another area is "musical ability". Some of the kidsthat I work with will have a terrible time in language, but they can heara song on the radio just once and pick it out on their guitar or play iton a piano. They retain all of that and it works very well for them. Another ability is "body kinesthetics". That is theability to do things physically. All of our athletes have good body kinesthetics,as do dancers and anybody who does things physically. Sometimes those whoare having difficulty with language will excel in some sport. These thingscan be talked about and people can begin to see what they can really excelat. The next ability is "interpersonal abilities". Thismeans that a person likes to work in groups and do things with other people.They can talk with people and have a good feel for what other people needand feel. They work well with others. Sometimes that is a real strengthfor our kids. The last one is what Gardner calls "intrapersonal intelligence".This is the ability to understand yourself, take care of yourself, anddo the things you need to do to prosper and have good health. I think itis very interesting that an awful lot of the kids that I work with whohave severe language problems or math problems have very poor ability totake care of themselves and in understanding themselves. This is a verygood thing to talk about to start the kids thinking about it. Comment: This is an awful lot of information to give a group at onetime and they probably can't retain it all. What I do is go around thegroup and have each person try to identify a couple of areas that theydo very well in, things that they like to do, or things that really clickfor them. The facilitator will have to help sometimes to get this startedbecause people aren't sure what groups they fall into. You can questiona bit about the things that they like to do. Can they play a musical instrument?Are they good in sports? What kinds of things did they like to do whenthey were young? What kind of toys did they play with? You can usuallyfind out a couple of areas that each one is doing some things in and doingthem successfully. Then I try to have each one identify a couple of areasthat they have difficulty with, such as language maybe. Did they have troublelearning to read and write in school? Do they still have these kinds oftroubles? How is their math? After a little discussion each person willhave some ideas about things that really work for them. One of the interestingthings is that oftentimes they have more trouble finding the things thatdo work for them the things that are good, because people aren't too aptto point out the things that we're successful at. They really prefer totell us the things that we have trouble with. So, usually they have a prettygood idea of things they don't do well. After you've done two or threepeople in the room, the whole group begins to understand more how it'sgoing to work and they participate very well. When you get done, everybodycan see that they do have some things that they can do and that they maybe very talented in. This helps people understand that they may have realdifficulties in language, but that's not the only thing in the world thatwe can be smart in. There are all kinds of things that we can succeed in. This whole procedure takes a lot of time because you have to spend quitea bit of time with each person. If the group is small, this works a lotbetter because after a little while people start getting uneasy and itdrags on for a long time. What I do if I've got a big group I'm workingwith, I'll ask these questions and have a show of hands. For instance,if I am inquiring about music, I'll ask all of those who play a musicalinstrument, like to sing, or enjoy music to raise their hands. Right afterwards,I'll ask all of those who don't care for music, or they like to listento it, but have never had a desire to play an instrument to show theirhands. That begins to show the group that indeed there are some who arevery good in that area and there are some who have difficulties in thatarea. A lot of people feel that there isn't any area that they have abilitiesin and I think it is important to spend some time with those folks. Theyreally do have something, but they haven't had much success and it takesa little while to discover where they might be successful. We spend an awful lot of time, energy, and money on discovering exactlywhat it is that we can't do. Sometimes I think we should spend a littlemore time discovering what it is that we can excel at. Sometimes thesethings seem to get lost. So, I think we really do need to spend time withthese kids looking in that area. Other Things to Consider I suggest that after a while, whenever the adolescents are ready, tohave another parent open house. At this meeting I would have the adolescentsexplain what their learning disability is and how it has affected them.They could also share what their abilities are and how they can use thoseto help them in school. Another topic to discuss is compensatory things we can do to help ourselves.For instance, we can take notes with a tape recorder, use talking books,sometimes get extra time on tests, and use word processing. Facilitatorscan develop a list of compensatory things. On the other hand, there areremedial things that can be done. For instance, with appropriate readingprograms, many of us can learn to read, spell and write a lot better. Thesethings need to be talked about. There are many other topics that can be discussed. For instance, a lotof times we talk about specific types of learning disability and go into the real details of each one. People can learn and share that way. Itis always important to remember that the people in the group will havetopics to discuss. Another point is that a facilitator can't help people solve their problems.The job of a facilitator is to teach people what their disability is, whattheir specific learning disabilities are, and what their strengths are.These folks will then be able to figure out what it is they need to doand help themselves. We can't really help them directly, buy we can surehelp them help themselves. Another thing that I have found is that two facilitators can be veryeffective, preferably, a man and a woman. While one is talking, the otherhas a good chance to observe and come up with some other ideas. If necessary,the two can work together for modeling and that kind of thing. These are some of the things that I have found that worked for me. Ihope you will be able to use them in some of your work. Harrison Sylvester is chair of the adult issues committee.

This simple concept is one that is often missed by many of those involved in the learning disability field, including those with learning disabilities themselves This lack of connection to the concept of disability as part of the learning disability condition leads to the failure of many to access those key elements that allow persons with learning disabilities to succeed - civil rights protection and the right to reasonable accommodations. However. even if persons are knowledgeable about their disabilities and are knowledgeable about their rights, the issues of when and how - and even whether or not to use the civil rights protections offered by the law are an ongoing debate. It often comes down to the question of to tell or not to tell, and if you do tell, when is the right time. Every major civil rights law concerning persons with disabilities, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), recognizes individuals with learning disabilities as persons entitled to those unique civil rights protections given to persons with all other disabilities. IDEA insures a free, appropriate, public education (FAPE) in grades K-12. There are certification and qualification obstacles to gaining access to civil rights as persons with disabilities. Because disability laws are civil rights laws, they do not require substantial changes in standards for either educational or employment settings. The laws state that a qualified individual with a disability is someone who, with or without a reasonable accommodation, can do the work or perform the essential function of the employment position. To be covered by civil rights protection, an individual with learning disabilities must be able to perform the work required for the particular job or position. If a person cannot perform the essential functions of the job, even with reasonable accommodations, there is no discrimination in either failing to hire or in firing a person.Disability laws forbid employers or educational institutions from asking, as part of their interview process, if a person has a disability. It is therefore up to the person to self-identify in order to be guaranteed protection under the law. No program, educational setting, or employer is required to provide accommodations unless the persons with disabilities state that they have a disability and provide documentation to verify that declaration. Persons with disabilities should also be able to identify the accommodations necessary for them to perform the tasks required for that job or educational program. Because individuals with learning disabilities and/or their parents are responsible for self-identification in order to be protected under civil rights laws, they must: know that they have learning disabilities and have written documentation of their disability be knowledgeable of the laws know that they qualify for protection under the laws know what accommodations they will need take the risk to self-identify, and face a wide range of uncertainties. For many individuals with learning disabilities, the identification issue becomes a life-long concern and debate. The debate focuses on whether it is worthwhile to identity oneself as a person with a learning disability or to try to do the best one can without accommodations. Central to the debate, to tell or not to tell, is the lack of knowledge and understanding of learning disabilities by the general public. The terms learning disabilities and mental retardation are too often interchanged. The continuing disagreement within the learning disability community itself concerning the causes, identification, impact, effects, etc. of learning disabilities further impedes understanding by the general public. Perhaps the more important question an individual with learning disabilities must ask is not whether to tell or not to tell, but rather the consequences of not telling. Can the person with learning disabilities do the job or derive benefit from a postsecondary educational program without accommodations? If the answer is no, the individual with learning disabilities (the parent, advocate, etc.) needs to consider the following: How severe is the learning disability? How much does the nature or manifestation of the disability conflict with the needs of the job or educational program? How open is the employer or educational program to recognizing and accommodating individuals with learning disabilities? If there is a union in the workplace, what is its position toward and willingness to support members with learning disabilities? Persons with learning disabilities need to be informed consumers and effective self-advocates. The skills of consumerism and advocacy need to be incorporated into the high school curriculum. Organizations such as LDA can serve as resources for students and adults with learning disabilities, their parents, and advocates and for schools and employers as well. IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and ADA can open doors to persons with learning disabilities. Civil rights laws make discrimination illegal; however, individuals must ask for protection under the laws through self-identification. With self-disclosure, one seeks implementation of the laws. Without implementation, civil rights laws are meaningless.

Fidgets with hands or feet Squirms in seat Difficulty remaining seated Easily distracted Difficulty awaiting turn in games or group situations Gives answers to questions before they are completed Difficulty following instructions from others Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities Shifts from one uncompleted task to another Difficulty playing quietly Talks excessively Interrupts others Does not seem to listen Loses things Engages in physically dangerous activities without considering the possible consequences If so, he/she might have ADHD. What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? ADHD is a disorder characterized by three behaviors: Hyperactivity Distractibility Impulsivity You may see one or more of these behaviors. It is not necessary to have all three to have ADHD: e.g., one does not have to be hyperactive. ADHD is related, to but different than, learning disabilities (LD). Some people only have learning disabilities. Some have ADHD only. Some have both. A number of professionals believe that as many as 50-80% of those with ADHD will have LD. There is an overlap. It is important to remember each disorder requires different treatment. What are these three behaviors? Hyperactivity: The child exhibits an unusual degree of activity. Most are fidgety; something is always in motion -- fingers, pencil, feet. They squirm in their seat, or cannot remain seated, etc. Distractibility: The child has difficulty blocking out unnecessary input from the environment. Auditorily Distractible means paying attention to all sounds, not just appropriate ones, e.g., voices in halls, ringing of telephone. Visually Distractible means paying attention to all things seen rather than the appropriate items, e.g., clouds, rug, pictures. Impulsivity: The child does not think before acting or talking and does not consider the impact of his/her actions on others. Thus, they do not learn from experience. This child may be accident prone because of impulsive behavior combined with poor judgment. Who makes the diagnosis? Parents, teachers, and professionals may find evidence suggesting ADHD. However a physician usually confirms the diagnosis. How is the diagnosis made? ADHD is the least common reason for hyperactivity, distractibility or impulsivity. The most common causes for these behaviors are anxiety or depression. The history of the problem is the best indication. If the behaviors have been chronic, that is, present almost since birth, and pervasive, present all day, every day, it is probably ADHD. Check lists and rating scales can be of assistance. However, the history of the behavior combined with clinical observations remain the best procedure for establishing the diagnosis of ADHD. What causes ADHD? The final answer is not known. Current research strongly suggests that ADHD is due to a deficiency in a specific neurotransmitter in the lower area of the brain. Research should lead to a greater understanding of this disorder in coming years. How long does it last? Current information suggests about 50% of children with ADHD will no longer have ADHD by puberty. The remainder will continue into adolescence and possibly into adulthood. How is ADHD treated? Behavioral approaches can be attempted to help the child concentrate on sitting still, staying on task or thinking before acting. Most of these are effective for short periods of time. Several nutritional approaches have been proposed. The Feingold Diet appears to work at best for 1-2% of children with ADHD. Too much refined sugar can increase hyperactivity in some children. The generally accepted treatment in this country is the use of medications. Treatment with medication Each medication has its own characteristics, effects and possible side effects. Thus, the physician should review these issues with the parents before beginning any medication. The goal is to decrease or stop the behavior without side effects. Medications have been used since 1937 and are considered to be safe and effective. These medications do not "drug" or "alter the mind" of the child. Rather, research suggests that each medication increases the amount of the chemical that is deficient in the brain, allowing the brain to function normally; therefore, the behaviors are diminished. Thus, the child becomes less active, less distractible and more able to think before acting. The current approach is to use one of three groups of medications. The physician will generally begin with Group One progressing to the others if no improvement is seen or side effects occur. Since ADHD can interfere with classroom work, peer interactions and family life, it is recommended that the child be on medication throughout each day, not just during school hours. Group One medications (stimulants) are: Ritalin (methylpenidate) Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) Cylert (pemoline) Group Two medications (antidepressants) are: Tofranil (imipramine) Norpramine (desipramine) Group Three medications are: Mellaril (thioridazine), an antipsychotic Tegretol (carbamazepine), an anticonvulsant also effective for manic-depressive (bipolar) disease Catapres (clonidine) may be used with Group One or Two medications to increase their effectiveness. Remember the total child: Many children with ADHD also have learning disabilities. Treating the ADHD will not treat the learning disabilities. Each must be treated if the child is to make sufficient progress. If children have ADHD and learning disabilities they may develop emotional, social and family problems. Each must be recognized and helped. Unless the total child, in his or her total environment is considered, neither the child nor the family will make as much improvement as necessary. * * * * * LDA acknowledges Larry B.

The response to thisrequest by LDA members was overwhelming. At the 1995 LDAConference a session on Asperger Syndrome was so well attendedthat this year a full day symposium was held. Dr. Ami Klin of theYale Child Study Center was the featured speaker. He made thefollowing points: The current definition of Asperger Syndrome is consideredprovisional and will probably become obsolete, but the disabilitywill, of course, remain. The upsurge in interest in the concept ofAsperger Syndrome over the past decade, without consensus onthe definition led to inclusion in the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) under Autism. The Yale Child Study Center's interest in Asperger Syndrome andthe overwhelmingly positive response from LDA members led to afederally funded project on social learning disabilities. The projectfocuses on an array of tests and procedures developed to advancethe understanding of social mechanisms from a neurobehavioralperspective. Since the nature of and needs associated with the social disabilityencountered in Asperger Syndrome appears to differ from those found in autism, the Yale Child Study Center made a priorityof investigating new diagnostic instruments with a view tostandardize the assessment and diagnosis of newly recognizedtypes of social learning disabilities. The objectives of the project include: documenting a range of social behaviors which can provide forquantification of relevant social phenomena quantifying conversational skills utilizing relevant diagnostic interviews that can providequantification of past and present symptoms creating experimental tools that investigate informationprocessing, both neurobehaviorally (through computer andvideo-administered tasks) and neurophysiolocally (documentingdifferences in brain activation to social stimuli). Ongoing research at Yale is seeking to determine whether thenonverbal learning disabilities profile can be seen as aneurobiological model of Asperger Syndrome, but not of autism,thus differentiating the two syndromes at the neurobehavioral level.Neuroimaging studies carry this hypothesis to the neuroatomic(structural MRI) and the neurophysiological (functional MRI) levels. Recent genetic studies have shown the recurrence of autism infamilies to be about 200 times the risk in the general population.From the preliminary data collected, it appears that the recurrencerisk factor of a social learning disability in a family of a person withAsperger Syndrome to be even higher. As part of the presentation, Dr. Klin reviewed the contents of thenew LDA brochure Asperger Syndrome:Guidelines for treatment and Intervention, a sequel to theearlier LDA publication Asperger Syndrome: Guidelines for Parents. Both of these brochures can be obtained fromLDA, 4156 Library Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15234. Dr Klin stated, "For people working within the context of an academicclinical environment, it is often frustrating that we do not have theresources to mobilize the people, agencies, and institutions thatcould help us make a significant dent into the service provisioninfrastructure that affects our clients. The news that LDA hasestablished a Task Force on Asperger Syndrome was enormouslygratifying. I would like to state the willingness of the members of the Yale Child Study Center to be of help every way we can.Yale Child Study Center has a Web site http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism and is planning to issuea quarterly newsletter relating to information about the project toparticipating families. One of our dreams is to create a list ofresources, nationwide, to families of individuals with social learningdisabilities. The goals and Yale and LDA converge a great dealand I hope that the partnership between LDA and Yale is only beginning."

Gallet, Judge in Family Court, State of New York My mother was a trained teacher but even she did not understand learningdisabilities. The term was almost unknown when I was a child. She was convinced Iwas bright, and she knew I was working hard at learning, but she could not understandwhy my achievement was so low. She shared my frustrations. Everyone at school said that I was lazy or stupid or both. After a while I began tobelieve them. Sometimes, I just gave up. I couldn't write, spell, or read, or answerquestions quickly. I didn't even know which hand to put over my heart when werecited the Pledge of Allegiance. Once my parents were called to school and told that I had scored first in my classon an I.Q. test. That score they were told was evidence that I had cheated on the test.My father, a lawyer, argued that I must have been bright, indeed, for I had copiedonly the correct answers. My parents never gave up on me although it must have beena great disappointment to those two scholarly people that their first born could barelygraduate from high school. They encouraged me to go to college and I did, graduating last in my class. Iwanted to go to law school against the best advice of my school counselors. Againthey encouraged and supported me, this time along with one of my professors, Dr.Hugo Mailey. Law School - No Longer Last in Class Brooklyn Law School took a chance on me. I responded with the best academicperformance of my career ï¿½ I graduated in the middle of my class. By law school Ihad begun to learn how to compensate for my problems. I also had the good fortuneof meeting Steve Lusthaus, another student, who was willing to spend many hoursdiscussing legal concepts with me. Law school was easier than college because therewas more emphasis on concepts and less on rote learning, my greatest weakness. Steve, now a successful lawyer, and I still joke about the time he tutored me for atorts examination on which I scored an "A" and he only a "B". I also remember thenight I decided to drop out of law school because of the seemingly endless pressureand Steve argued with me all night, refusing to let me go to sleep until I agreed tostay in school. Life Finally Comes Together I was a lucky one. Loving parents, a college professor and a law school roommatesupported me, encouraged me and refused to let me fall victim to my frustrations andgive up. They knew that I was neither stupid nor lazy, even though there were times Iwas not so sure myself. By the time I was, by chance, diagnosed as learning disabledat the age of thirty-five, I had already learned to deal with my learning disabilities.By the age of thirty-seven, I was a judge. I take special pride in one accomplishment. Having failed English courses in both high school and college, I finally learned how to write. But, today, with five books and over thirty articles to my credit, I still suffer from terrible writer's block and an irrational fear that I am about to make afool of myself every time I sit down to write. The fear and the frustration have left such a lasting mark on me that I can never forget how it was. I can never fully believe it will not be that way again. Some Thoughts about the Juvenile Justice System I agreed to write this article, after first refusing, because I think mystory may help parents deal with their LD children. Almost every week I see a learning disabled child who, undiagnosed or untreated, is venting his orher frustrations in anti-social ways. I could have stood in that same spot. Ifnot for loving, caring, involved parents, my frustrations at not being able tokeep up in class, and to some extent in the play yard, could have burst forth in the same self-destructive way. The schools and the courts have not met their responsibilities to LD children.When I was young, they simply did not recognize the problem. Now, they candiagnose and deal with LD but have not allocated the resources to do what must bedone. I expect the FCLD benchbook to make a major impact on the juvenile courts.Juvenile court judges will for the first time have an authoritative work to help themdeal with the LD youth-at-risk. Hopefully, it will lead to treatment programs to haltthe escalating conflict between the frustrated, angry, impatient LD youngster and hisor her overburdened, impotent-feeling parents who are unable to socialize theirchildren and integrate them into their peer groups. Too often in the past, the solutionhas been to place the child in foster care, an unsatisfactory, non cost-effective solutionwhich may very well do more damage than good. It is the schools which hold the key to avoiding the type of conflict we see in thefamily courts. An early diagnosis of the problem and an integrated treatment plan,including not only help for the child, but, also, counseling for the parents, would savemany children now going astray. Unfortunately, too many schools have not focusedtheir attention and resources on the problem and research proposals to find methodsfor early diagnoses of LD are going unfunded. There is improvement. As education programs such as the FCLD grants forhandbooks for lawyers and judges make more and more people aware of the problemand the terrible waste it creates, more LD children are being identified and helped.Unfortunately, the process is painfully slow. ______________ Their World, 1986 Reprinted with the permission of the National Center for Learning Disabilities, 381Park Avenue South, NY, NY 10016.

The depressed state can be primary (familial-genetic disorder) or secondary (symptomatic depression) to medical conditions or learning disability. Depression is feeling sad, lonely, unloved, dumb, and worthless, alongwith guilt feelings and beliefs of being mistreated. Depression is havingtrouble falling asleep (initial insomnia), restless sleep with recurrent awakenings (interval insomnia), or waking early in the morningunable to fall back to sleep (terminal insomnia). Depression often isalso awakening in the morning anxious, tired, sad, or mad. Depression is a loss of interest in friends, hobbies, and school or work.Depression causes a loss of concentration, poor memory, forgetfulness,and inattention. Depression is having headaches, stomachaches, and other physical symptoms. Depression is feeling angry,picked on, grouchy, and irritable. Sometimes depression is feelinghopeless and helpless, and wishing to die. Depression is the leading cause of suicide. A clinical depression is a combination of thesesymptoms which persist for longer than three weeks and cause failure inthe person's environments of home, work (school), or play. Depression has been demonstrated in many studies to be associated withand the possible cause of school failure, conduct disorder anddelinquency, anorexia and bulimia, school phobia, and panic attacks. The scientific description of depression and manic-depressive diseasewas first prepared by Emil Kraepelin in the early 1900s. For the firsthalf of the twentieth century, most clinicians did not accept the concept that primary depression (or manic-depressive disease: affectiveillness) occurred in children and adolescents. However, by the early1970s, criteria for the recognition of depression in children andadolescents had been established (Table 1, "The Weinberg Criteria"). These criteria were basedupon those used to diagnose depression and mania in adults as formulatedin the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for adult psychiatric disordersby the Department of Psychiatry of the Washington University School ofMedicine in St. Louis, Missouri. The Weinberg Criteria for depression inchildren and adolescents was published in 1973 and the criteria for maniain 1976 by Weinberg and Brumback (Table 2). In1980, the American Psychiatric Association published the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Third Edition (DSM-III) [revisedin 1988 as DSM-IIIR and in 1994 as DSM-IV] which contained guidelines forthe diagnosis of depression and mania in individuals of all ages. In theDSM-III, diagnostic criteria were added for the various temporal patternsof affective illness. These patterns are characterized by chronic,long-standing ebbs and flows, "good" and "bad" periods per day, mixedwith "good" and "bad" days, but without prolonged well (stable) states.Patterns of affective illness with prominent manic symptomatology(chronic hypomania, cyclo-thymia, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorderand dysthymia with the manic feature of hostile anger) are mostprevalent in pre-school years and continue through young adult age. Depression and other forms of affective illness are probably geneticdisorders based upon studies of familial clusterings, evaluation ofoffspring of both depressed and manic-depressive adults, and studies of siblings and twins reared apart. Research is now underway to determinewhether the various patterns of affective illness represent a unitarygenetic disorder modified by other traits or are the result of multiple and varied genetic and psychosocial causes. It is possible that evengenetically-based affective illness could remain dormant throughout anindividual's life if inappropriate environmental stressors are not present. Criteria For Depression In Young People The "Weinberg Criteria" for depression (Table1) include 10 major symptom categories: dysphoric mood,self-deprecatory ideation, agitation, sleep disturbance, change in schoolperformance, diminished socialization, change in attitude towards school,somatic complaints, loss of usual energy, and unusual change in appetiteor weight. The individual must manifest: 1) dysphoric moods andaffect and 2) self-deprecatory ideation. We use the termmood to describe the young person's emotional feelings, while theterm affect indicates the individual's appearance in relation to feelings. Symptoms of dysphoric mood and affect are sadness, loneliness,unhappiness, hopelessness, pessimism, mood swings, moodiness,irritability, easily annoyed, hypersensitivity, tearfulness and crying, negativity, and difficulty being pleased. Generally, a child manifestingdysphoric moods will have a multitude of these symptoms. Sadness andhopelessness can be so severe that the young person will withdraw to aroom to sit and cry (melancholy). Self-deprecation is the feeling ofbeing worthless, useless, dumb, stupid, and guilty, or beliefs ofpersecution. Death wishes occur in 35% of pre-pubertal children manifesting depression, suicidal ideation (thoughts and plans) in 15%,and suicidal attempts in 5%. In addition to dysphoric moods and self-deprecation, the child musthave four or more of the following eight symptoms: agitation sleep disturbance change in school performance diminished socialization change in attitude toward school (work) somatic complaints loss of usual energy unusual change in appetite or weight Most young people fulfilling this criteria will have seven or eight ofthe ten major symptoms. The agitation of depression is irritability, grouchy feelingsand actions, inappropriate sudden anger or fighting, quarrelsomeness,lack of respect for authority, and difficulty getting along with others. The most common sleep disturbance is trouble falling asleep(initial insomnia). The young child will often manifest restless sleepwith frequent awakenings (interval insomnia) and enter the parents bed for comfort. Awakening too early in the morning (terminal insomnia)strongly correlates with thoughts of suicide. Common to the depressedadolescent is difficulty awakening in the morning with excessive morning sleep. Change in school performance is characterized byfrequent complaints from the teachers of: daydreaming, poor concentrationand memory, and inattentiveness; loss of usual work effort in school subjects with a drop in grades; loss of usual interest inextra-scholastic activities; incomplete classroom assignments; muchincomplete homework; avoidance of homework activity; and disruptive behavior. The depressed young person will often lose interest in friendsand social activities. Occasionally the young person loses the ability toanticipate or experience pleasure (anhedonia). Commonly, theindividual must be forced or coerced to participate in what previouslywere usual, fun activities, but the enjoyment is lessened and theparticipation does not restore interest (dyshedonia). Schoolavoidance, school resistance, discomfort in school, andschool phobia are symptomatic of depression. Somaticcomplaints (physical complaints) of headaches, stomachaches, jointand muscle aches and pains, and visual disturbances without any physicalcause is depression until proven otherwise. The depressed young personcomplains of poor energy and tiredness. A change inappetite (either a loss in appetite or excessive desire to eat) associated with change in weight is less common in children than adults,but is still symptomatic of depression. It is important to understandthat depression, as a disease or illness, is a group of symptomsassociated with maladaptation or worsening in usual performance in eitherthe home, school, or play environments. Most depressed young people willbe failing in school, will be difficult to live with at home, and willdrop out of usual extra-scholastic pursuits. The depressed individual'sjudgment deteriorates, interests wane, and failure occurs. Minor depressions are identical to major depressive episodes induration but involve fewer symptoms and less impairment. The WeinbergCriteria for depression defines severity of a depressive episode in relation to death wishes and suicidal ideation: mild (no death wishes),moderate (positive for death wishes or suicidal thoughts), and severe(positive for suicidal plans or suicidal attempts). Diagnosis of Depression Using the Weinberg Criteria, the diagnosis of depression isestablished through interview of the individual and the primarycaretaker. The criteria symptoms for depression must represent a changefrom the individual's usual self or a worsening of the usual self, bepresent for more than three weeks, and be associated with poorperformance and a worsening of adaptation (or failure) in one, two, orthree environments - home, school (work), or play. A symptom is acceptedas positive when at least one of the characteristic behaviors listed forthat symptom category is present (Table 1). Dysphoric moods and self deprecation (deteriorated self-esteem) must be reported by the youngperson for these symptoms to be considered positive. The other eightsymptom categories can be reported by either the individual or the primary caretaker. Petti (1978; 1985) developed the Bellevue Index of Depression (BID)from the Weinberg Criteria. The BID offers a systematic interviewapproach to both the young patient and the caretaker and can be used for diagnosis of depression and assessment of the severity of thedepressed state. The Diagnostic Inventory for Children and Adolescents(DICA) developed by Herjanic and Reich (1982) is a structured interview based upon DSM-III criteria for depression and otherpsychiatric disorders. It is administered to both the patient and the caretaker. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-P) developed by Puig Antich and Chambers (1978) is a structured interview modified for children based upon theResearch Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for depression and other psychiatricdisorders in adults. The Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised(CDRS-R) was developed by Poznanski and colleagues, in 1985, and modeledafter the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression for adults. It correlates with global ratings for depression. Depression By Self-Report It is possible to recognize young people at risk for depression throughself-report instruments. The Weinberg Screening Affective Scale (WSAS) isa 56 item self-administered form requiring fourth grade reading ability (Appendix A) that takes less than five minutes tocomplete. The WSAS correlates with depressive illness in both outpatientand hospitalized depressed children and adolescents. Two large populations of high school students have been studied fordepression by self-report using the WSAS. The first study group consistedof 3,292 students in a large metropolitan urban school district, and thesecond population had 1,298 students from a rural middle-size college community school district. These twopopulation studies (in which 96% of the students participated)demonstrated that about 14% of high school students manifest depressionby self-report. Gender and ethnic group differences were evident.Hispanic females had the highest percentage of depression by self-report(22%), while white males (8%) had the lowest. Black students, whitefemales, and Hispanic males were intermediate in the prevalence ofdepression. Three percent (3%) of the students related suicidal thoughts("I think a lot about killing myself") These studies concluded thatdepressive sympto-matology is prominent in adolescents, large numbers ofyoung people are actively depressed, and a significant number are at riskfor suicide. The WSAS can be used for the screening of depression inyoung people and is a strong confirmation instrument in the clinicalsetting. Two other widely used self-report forms for depression are theBeck Depression Inventory (BDI) which has been used in adolescents andyoung adults and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) developed byKovacs in 1987 for ages 7-17 years. Dysthymia: Chronic or Long-standing DepressiveSymptomatology Dysthymia is characterized by chronic long-standing depressivesymptomatology with ebbs and flows in severity, periods each day ofdepressive moods (mixed days), occasional fully-depressed days, and an occasional depression-free day; but no prolonged well states. Periods ofmajor depression are common in individuals with dysthymic disorder.Dysthymia limits functioning, performance, and enjoyment, but is not associated with the same degree of impairment that characterizesminor or major depressive episodes. The onset of the dysthymic pattern is usually during the pre-schoolyears (ages 2-5 years), with major or minor depressive episodes occurringlater in elementary and secondary school years. School phobia with the start of school can be the presenting symptoms of a majordepressive episode in the anxious dysthymic young child. The learningdisabled dysthymic child will often develop a major depressive episode during the third or fourth grade school years associated with theincreased stress of school tasks. Criteria for Mania in Young People The hallmarks of mania (Table 2) areeuphoria and hostile anger. Euphoria has two presentations: a) an elatedmood with inappropriate feelings of well being, cheerfulness, giddiness,and silliness. However, it can also be b) the inappropriate denial of problems or symptoms despite behavior that isobvious to observers as inappropriate, disruptive, and destructive. Themanic young person can be hyperactive, intrusive, destructive, oragitated, or display hostile anger, while at the same time reporting, "Ihave no problems or concerns." The irritability of mania is hostile anger, with ranting rages, driven impulsive destructiveness, or uncon-trollable antisocial behavior. Thehostile anger of mania can lead to homicidal wishes, thoughts, threats,or attempts. Utilizing the criteria established by Weinberg and Brumback (1976) forthe recognition of mania in children and adolescents, the individual mustmanifest either euphoria or hostile anger with three or more of thefollowing six symptoms: hyperactivity (mental, motor, or sexual), motor drivenness,intrusiveness; push of speech; flight of ideas, racing thoughts, the inability to maintain thinkingon one idea; grandiosity with heightened self-worth, self-power, andself-influence which can be delusional; sleep disturbance with decreased need for sleep and nighttimehyperwakefulness (night-owl insomnia); shortened attention span, inability to concentrate, anddistractibility. Each symptom must be a discrete change from the individual's usual self,either a new behavior or a worsening of an old behavior. Although theoriginal criteria stated that this symptom complex must be present formore than one month, further studies indicate that a duration of only oneweek is necessary. Diagnosis of mania is established by interview and observation of theyoung person and interview with the primary caretaker utilizing asemi-structured, closed-end interview technique. A symptom is accepted aspositive when at least one of the characteristic behaviors listed for thecategory is present. Euphoria (most commonly denial of any problems) must be reportedby the individual, but the other symptoms are observational and can bereported by the individual, the caretaker, or knowledgeable others. The course of childhood onset classic manic-depressive diseaseis exemplified by the child with no previous disturbance of mood andaffect who begins to manifest the symptom complex of depression. On arare occasion, a manic episode will precede the first period ofdepression. Subsequently there are discrete periods of depression usuallylasting six to eighteen months and mania persisting for one to six weeks, with interspersed prolonged well states. Althoughclassic manic-depressive disease is uncommon in pre-pubertal child-ren,the patterns of dysthymia, hypomania, cyclothymia, and juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder often begin during pre-school years, andare mislabeled as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),conduct or oppositional defiant disorder, and over-anxious disorder. As the child ages, classic manic-depressive disease becomes evident. Hypomania, Cyclothymia, And Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder(See Glossary) One of the confusing problems in the recognition and appropriatemanagement of mania in children and adolescents is the observation thathypomania is chronic with a very early onset. Hypomania can present in utero as a hyperactive fetus; as overly alert, irritable, colickyinfant with poor sleep habits; or as a "supermarket toddler" requiringrestriction in the gro-cery store cart. The hypomanic child progresses through preschool years with significant hyperactivity, excessivecheerfulness, frequent sexual naughtiness, inappropriate silliness,giddiness, and elation, and nightowl insomnia. As the child ages, periodic rants, rages, hostile anger (mania), and even homicidal threatslimit the hypomanic child's ability to function. Hypomania is a commoncause of attention deficit disorder with persistent hyperactivity (ADHD): "hypomanic/hyperactivity." Increasing manic moods and classicmanic-depressive disease become apparent as the child ages. Cyclothymia (See Glossary) Cyclothymia is long-standing (chronic) hypomania with moments per day ofboth depressive moods and "mini" moments of significant anger. Most ofthe days are "mixed days" with an occasional all "bad" day, but rarely an"all good day." The cyclothymic disorder begins in the toddler or earlypre-school years and progresses during late childhood and youngadolescent years to discrete periods of major depression or manic episodes. Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder (JRCBD) (SeeGlossary) The term juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder (JRCBD) is applied to agroup of manic-depressive young people who are free of continuoushypomanic/hyperactivity but manifest moment-to-moment, day-to-day ("all mixed days") of depressive moods, actions, and feelingsinterspersed with hostile anger, ranting, or rages. Juvenile rapidcycling bipolar disorder most often is evident during preschool years andworsens with aging to major depressive or manic episodes during theadolescent years. Family History The pattern of affective illness in the young person predicts familyhistory. If the pattern in the young person is discrete cycles ofdepression with or without a manic episode and with prolonged wellstates, the family history will only be positive for typical depressionor classic manic-depressive disease. Dysthymia or cyclothymia in theyoung person predicts a family history of depression or manic-depressivedisease along with alcoholism. Depressed children, who are oppositional and defiant or have a conductdisorder, have a positive family history of sociopathy, or alcoholism,along with depression or manic-depressive disease. Hallucinations during depression indicate a family member withschizophrenia. Depressed children with prominent somatic complaintsfrequently have a female family member with Briquet's syndrome (a disorder characterized by severe hypochondriasis and often multipleoperations without recognizable underlying medical disease). Inheritedtraits of these other disorders become apparent as additional symptoms during the depressive episodes in young people. When that youngperson is free of depression or manic-depressive episodes, those traitsbecome inapparent. Thus, it is important to try to identify an underlying depression or manic-depressive state in any childrenpresenting with an apparent conduct disorder, somatic complaints, orother behavior complexes. It is also noteworthy that 30-40% of affectively ill children willhave a biologic parent who is also affectively ill (most commonlydepression) at the time the young person presents for initial evaluation. The Neurology and Biology of Affective Illness inYoung People The neurologic examination is very important in both establishing andunderstanding the localization of depression in the brain and theinfluence of this metabolic (chemical) disorder of the brain on other brain functions. During a depressive episode the young person will oftenmanifest neurologic abnormalities of tone, posture, or reflexes in theleft arm and leg indicating dysfunction of the right side of the brain(right cerebral hemisphere). The manic young person will have similarneurologic abnormalities that involve the right arm and leg indicatingdysfunction of the left side of the brain (left cerebral hemisphere).Depressed young people have a variety of problems that indicatedisturbances in right parietal lobe functions: they have impairedcoordination and are clumsy (dyspraxias); handwriting deteriorates(dysgraphia); they have language skills ("math"), wit, and humor suffer.In mania, the individual demonstrates errors indicative of left cerebralhemisphere dysfunction: specific word finding (naming) difficulties,problems with clarity of speech, and abnormal verbalizations. During wellstates, these motor findings and disturbances of higher braincommunicative-cognitive functions improve to the individual's more usualabilities. An important concept is that affective illness can cause alearning disability or worsen an underlying learning disability. The right posterior parietotemporal cortex appears to be involved inthe production of the dysphoric and vegetative symptoms of depression.The left mesial temporal and entorhinal cortex appears to be responsible for the key symptoms of mania: euphoria (denial) and hostileanger. It is likely that obsessions, compulsions, and oppositionaldefiant behavior are minor manifestations of the hostile anger of mania. It is prudent to mention that some research concerning adultstroke patients has implicated left frontal lobe lesions in depressionand right frontotemporal lesions in mania. However, studies by Freeman and colleagues (1985) and the preponderance of studies reviewed byBrumback (1985: 1993), indicate that the right parietotemporal area playsa major role in the genesis of depression. Our ongoing observations ofchildren and adolescents confirm this brain localization for depression. Biological correlates for depression in young people are similar tothose reported in adults (Table 3). The mostreproducible have been abnormalities of sleep and disturbances inhypothalamic-pituitary hormonal activity (abnormal dexamethasonesuppression test and blunted growth hormone and thyrotropin releasinghormone). The strongest biological correlate is the proven successfultreatment of depression with certain specific medications. Originally,the monoamine (MAO) inhibitors, and for the past twenty five years, thetricyclic antidepressant medications (TCAs) have provided beneficial therapy. Both these agents augment the activities of the neurotransmittersnorepinephrine and serotonin. Serotonin is produced by neurons in theraphe nuclei of the brain stem and travels up the axons of these neuronsto the cerebral hemispheres, more right than left, where it is releasedinto the synaptic clefts. Norepinephrine is produced by another group ofnerve cells, the locus ceruleus, of the brain stem and also travels upaxons to the cerebral hemispheres. In depressed states, there is arelative deficiency of these two neurotransmitters. The tricyclicantidepressants, amitriptyline (Elavil) and doxepin (Sinequan), block theinactivation of serotonin thus allowing this neurotransmitter to beavailable for needed use by cerebral cortical nerve cells (Table 4). Desipramine (Norpramin) andprotriptyline (Vivactil) block the inactivation of norepinephrine, whilenortriptyline (Pamelor) and imipramine (Tofranil) prevent inactivation ofboth serotonin and norepinephrine. The second generation antidepressanttrazodone (Desyrel) prevents inactivation of serotonin and maprotiline(Ludiomil) prevents inactivation of norepinephrine. The new thirdgeneration antidepressants sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), andparoxetine (Paxil) are very specific in preventing inactivation ofserotonin. The underlying mechanisms leading to this relative deficiencyof serotonin and norepinephrine in the cerebral cortex is unknown, but webelieve that a dysfunction of modulating control from the right posterioremporoparietal cortex initiates a cascade of events causing alteredactivity of the key brain stem neurons and consequent deficiency ofnorepinephrine and serotonin release by their axons in the cerebral cortex. The biology of mania (Table 3) is less wellunderstood and cannot be explained by any available bioamine(neurotransmitter) theory. The major tranquilizers widely used to treatmania in adults block the effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine.However, the disorder of absent dopamine, e.g., Parkinson's disease, isnot characterized by mania. due to the severe progressive motor problemsassociated with the major tranquilizers, we actively avoid their use inyoung people). The two most successful drugs in the treatment andprevention of manic episodes, lithium carbonate and carba-mazepine(Tegretol), have many different biological actions, none of which areunique to mania. Although, right limb motor abnormalities, suggestingleft brain dysfunction, is a reproducible observation, various brainimaging studies have been inconclusive, possibly due to heterogeneousstudy populations. Concurrent Diagnoses Concurrent diagnoses (a combination of two or more diagnosesoccurring in the same individual at the same point in time) are common inyoung people with affective illness. There is a high prevalence of specific learning disabilities, overanxious disorder, school phobia, andanorexia in depressed young people. Conduct disorder and oppositionaldefiant disorder are common in children with hypomania, cyclothymia, orjuvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder. It has been reported (and we concur) that 35-45% of delinquentadolescents have affective illness prior to their incarceration fordelinquent activity. In this same context, drug-abusing,learning-disabled adolescents frequently have had major depressiveepisodes, chronic minor depression (dysthymia), or long-standingcyclothymia prior to initiating drug abusing behavior in adolescence. Ithas also been reported (and we concur) that at least 50% of the olderadolescent and young adults committing suicide, with a prior history ofdrug abuse, had evidence of depression predating the abuse of drugs andsuicide. Nearly twenty years ago (1977), we reported that hyperactivitybeginning after age two years was most often symptomatic of an underlyingdepression. Fifty-five percent (55%) of hyperactive pre-pubertal childrenwere only hyperactive when in a state of depression (Table 5). The so-called "rebound" side effects andvegetative symptoms (loss of appetite, insomnia) attributed to stimulantmedications used to treat hyperactive children are actually the result ofan underlying depression. The terms "hyperkinetic impulse disorder" (1950s), "minimal braindysfunction" (MBD;1960s), "hyper-active child syndrome" (1970s),"attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity" (ADD with or without H; 1980s) and now "attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder" (ADHD;1990s) have successively been applied to a heterogeneous(mixed) group of children, adolescents, and young adults whose clinical problem can be more correctly explained by one or more of thefollowing disorders: affective illness, learning disabilities, andprimary disorder of vigilance (Table 6). ADHDis just a group of symptoms that demands more accurate evaluation andcorrect diagnosis (Figure 1). The recently described primary disorder of vigilance (PDV) (Table 7) is the proper diagnosis of a large groupof young people fulfilling criteria for ADHD without hyperactivity orwith only minimal hyper-activity. These young people are busy,inattentive, and daydream while trying to stay awake due to difficultiesremaining alert (hypovigilance). The individual with primary disorder ofvigilance, when depressed, becomes excessively sleepy and can "sleep thedepres-sion off." Such individuals can go to bed for weeks, months, oruntil the depression lifts. Interestingly, during a manic episode, theindividual with primary disorder of vigilance continues to have vigilanceproblems ("sleepy") when trying to concentrate. Learning Disabilities, Depression, and SchoolFailure Children, adolescents, and young adults with specific learningdisorders have a high prevalence of depression. Sixty to eighty percent(60-80%) of learning disabled children failing in school will fulfill criteria for depression at the time of initial clinical evaluation.Evaluation of individuals failing in school necessitates carefulassessment of emotions and cognition and communication skills (higherbrain functions; (Table 8), along with standardneurologic and physical examinations. This total evaluation, includinghistory of the present problem, developmental, health and familyhistories should take less than 90-120 minutes to complete. Too often anevaluator takes the short-cut of only evaluating part of the young personrather than the whole person: the evaluation for learning disability willbe omitted; affective illness will be excluded; none of the youngperson's brain functions will be examined (with only a motor examinationperformed); or without any examination, the determination will be madethat the environment (home or school) is the sole cause of thedifficulties; or the label ADHD suggested and a prescription of stimulantmedication offered. It is important to undertake a complete systematicevaluation to establish correct diagnosis and develop a successfulclinical management program. For children, adolescents, and young adults with learningdisabilities, school can be an unpleasant, noxious, and highlyfrustrating environment. Young people with various specific learningdisabilities often manifest poor attention, restlessness, daydreaming,and limited diligence when asked to do tasks that they are unable to do.It is postulated that continuous stimulation of a geneticallymaldeveloped area of the cerebral hemisphere makes that area, surroundingcerebral cortex, and homologous cerebral cortex in the oppositehemisphere all work less well. For example, language-impaired anddyslexic children (left hemisphere learning disability) often becomemoody, irritable, and angry when asked to speak, read, or recall words. Poor spellers (left hemisphere learning disability),practicing spelling for the spelling test, become increasingly dysphoric,anxious, irritable, and dysattentive as the school year progresses. Somewill cry, show poor self-esteem and express death wishes. The repeatedattempts to perform language functions by these children stimulatespoorly functioning left cerebral hemisphere which leads to dysfunction ofthe opposite right hemisphere areas with resultant depressivesymptomatology. These examples represent the interaction betweenenvironmental stress and cerebral dysfunction. Right hemisphere learning-communication disorders (RHD) are characterizedby difficulties with social communication including social discomfort,social dysemotionality, dysprosody (difficulties understanding thegestures or speech tones of others, difficulties expressing appropriategesture or speech tones, or both), ordering problems (difficulties withsequencing, timing, and context), motor and social dyspraxias(clumsiness), disturbed attention (both hypovigilance and neglect),difficulties with calculation (dyscalculia for the sequencing ofnumbers), and poor graphic skills (Table 8). Young people with righthemisphere learning communication disorders, during adolescence andadulthood, are at high risk for major depressive disorder oftenexacerbated by the inappropriate stress promoted by education directed at their communication difficulties. This population can be divided into an under-expressive group (hypoprosodic; developmental expressive hypodysprosodia) and an over-expressive group (Asperger's Syndrome; developmentalexpressive hyperdysprosodia). In contrast, it is uncommon to see on a referred basis a pure lefthemisphere learning disability (Table 8). Most,if not all, children, adolescents, and young adults referred because ofschool failure have evidence of bihemispheral (right and left cerebralhemisphere) learning disorder. With sixty percent (60%) or greater ofthese bihemispheral learning disabled children manifesting affectiveillness, it is often the exacerbation of the affective illness that tipsthe balance from marginal passing to failure. Within this context, thereare several major questions: "Why is this young person now depressed? Candepression be induced or promoted by asking the right cerebral hemisphereto do repetitively what it is unable to do? Is it likely that pure lefthemisphere disorders (pure 'classic' dyslexia; pure 'classic' dysphasia)(Table 8), with no genetic basis for depression, will struggle in theschool setting but be free of depression? (Population studies ofnon-referred young people suggest this interpretation). Does asking thelearning disabled individual to work repetitively at tasks he or she isunable to do cause depression? Is there a biological basis for a'reactive' depression?" The multiple threshold theorem best explains induction of affectiveillness. For those individuals with a high genetic load for depressionlittle or no environmental stressors are needed. These individuals will have spontaneous episodes of affective illness throughout their lives. Incontrast, for those individuals with a low genetic load, external factorsare important in the induction of a depressive or manic episode. Suchepisodes can be induced by head trauma, viral encephalitis, medicalillnesses (including hyper-thyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, andinfectious mononucleosis), and various drugs and medications (including minor and major tranquilizers, anti-hypertensives, andanti-convulsants). Inappropriate educational stress (as indicated above)can also induce depression. Young people with specific learning disabilities who are failing in school and functioning poorly outside ofschool must be considered to have depression until proven otherwise. Thetreatment of specific learning disabilities should avoid induction of depression or worsening of other patterns of affective illness byproviding an appropriate educational environment. If manic or depressiveepisodes occur, specific medical management should be undertaken (Table 9). Treatment of Depression, other Patterns of Affective Illness, and Specific Learning Disabilities Depression and other patterns of manic-depressive disease are chemicaldisorders of the brain that can occur spontaneously or be promoted orinduced by other medical illnesses, drugs and medications, andenvironmental events. Often the school environment is a major stressorfor the learning disabled individual. Treatment strategies for learningdisabled young people should address appropriate educational input/outputsystems assuring success in school, including college preparatory andcollege classes. The goal of formal education must be the acquisition andutilization of meaningful information and the pursuit of the individual'sassets, talents, and creativity. The educator provides a structured anddisciplined environment to accomplish these goals. Reading, spelling,numeric language, graphic skills, vocabulary, and word usage improve withaging and maturation of the nervous system, something that cannot beaccelerated by remediation or other programs. Young people with specificlearning disabilities are willing, able, capable, and competent learnersif appropriate input/output systems are used. Table 10 summarizes the bypass/ compensatorystrategies and assistive technologies that must be implemented for thelearning disabled person to prevent the induction of affective illnessepisodes. The management of children, adolescents, and young adults withaffective illness is multimodal (Table 9). Theymust be informed about the nature, course, and treatment of this disease.The environments must be supportive and r eassuring. There must be anemphasis on positive interaction, and the individual must be assistedwith appropriate decision making. The depressed young person should not be allowed to "drop out" of usual pursuits. Cognitive coaching on a "mini" daily basis should be offered byparents and significant others (teachers, coaches, employers, orfriends). Cognitive coaching involves recognizing that actions should dictate feelings and intelligence should overrule emotions: "It is nothow one feels but it is how one acts"; "act positive-feel better"; "feelsad and act sad, then you will be sad"; "feel sad and act happy, then youwill feel better"; "feel mad and act with anger, trouble!"; "feel mad and act civil, then good things canhappen". Clinical cognitive psychological counseling may be indicated forboth the individual and the primary caretakers (Wilkes and colleagues,1994). The emphasis is for all concerned parties to act using intelligence and not emotions, with such interactionbeing positive, rewarding, reassuring, and supportive, whileintelligently ignoring the disturbing mood or emotion. The hallmark of successful treatment is for the brain to be free ofthe "chemical imbalance" of affective illness. For this to occur, thetreatment should include appropriate medication management. Prior toinstituting antidepressant medication, it has become standard to obtainan electrocardiogram (EKG). Complete blood count with differential, bloodchemistry profile, and thyroid profile are also often indicated(particularly before use of antimanic drugs). An electroencephalogram(EEG) is obtained if the person has had a seizure in the past, if thereis a positive family history for epilepsy, or prior to the use of antimanic drugs. Sometimes an EEG, CT scan, or MRI is indicated as aresult of abnormal neurologic findings. The drug management of depression, dysthymia, and cyclothymia withprominent dysphoria continues to be with the first generationantidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants) in children and young adolescents. The choice of drug is dependent upon the body type of theindividual and prior treatment response in family members. Amitriptyline(Elavil) is the first choice in young people who are not overweight. Ifnot effective, this is followed by doxepin (Sinequan). These twomedications increase appetite and can increase weight. Imipramine(Tofranil) followed by desipramine (Norpramin), the metabolite ofimipramine, are the first drugs in overweight young people. Nortriptyline(Pamelor), the metabolite of amitriptyline (Elavil), is sometimes thethird choice but can also cause excessive weight gain. If the depressedchild or young adolescent does not respond to the above medications, thethird generation antidepressants are then offered. For most, weuse fluoxetine (Prozac) first, followed by sertraline (Zoloft). In mature adolescents and young adults with depression, dysthymia,and cyclothymia with prominent dysphoria, the third generationantidepressants are becoming the first choice rather than the tricyclic antidepressants. For those free of prominent hypomania or manic moods, weprefer fluoxetine (Prozac), followed by sertaline (Zoloft) and theneither imipramine (Tofranil) (a first generation antidepressant), or paroxetine (Paxil). Adolescents manifesting dysthymia with bipolarfeatures, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder, or cyclothymia areinitially offered imipramine (Tofranil) followed by sertaline (Zoloft), prior to antimanic medication. For successful management of depression and dysthymia in adolescentsand young adults, a combination of a third generation antidepressant anda tricyclic is often needed. The third generation antidepressant is takenin the morning and the tricyclic at bedtime. Table 11 lists the antidepressant medications,the dosage range, serum levels, indications, contraindications, andpotential adverse effects. These medications are not approved by the FDAfor use in children less than 12 years of age, except for the use ofimipramine for bedwetting. However, they are successful in the treatmentof depression in all ages and their use has become a standard of practice. There is a group of depressed learning disabled young people who alsohave inherited the primary disorder of vigilance (Table 7). If this group fails with the aboveapproach to drug management, protriptyline (Vivactil) is sometimes successful. Occasionally a combination of protriptyline duringdaytime hours with another tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime provesbeneficial. The treatment of mania in classic manic-depressive disease, juvenilerapid cycling bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia will often requireantimanic drugs (Table 12). However, wecontinue to offer individuals with these patterns of affective illness an initial trial ofantidepressant medication. If manic symptomatology is promoted thenantimanic medication must be started. The antimanic drugs primarily used are carbamazepine (Tegretol) and lithium carbonate. If the manicstate is characterized primarily by hypomania and elated moods, thenlithium is the first choice. If the mania is manifested as hostile anger without elation, the first antirnanic drug is carbamazepine. Mostindividuals whose mania is successfully controlled with lithium (orcarbamazepine) will require the addition of an antidepressant medicationto be free of depression. All the antidepressants can promote or induce mania Likewise, theantimanic drugs can promote depression. For most depressed individuals,an antidepressant medication will be successful. For some the addition of lithium or carbamazepine with the antidepressant will beneeded to achieve stable moods and good functioning. Serum medication levels are obtained during the course of treatment.Repeat EKG, blood chemistries profile, and thyroid profile are performedat appropriate intervals depending upon the medication being used and age of the patient. Frequently the young patient (and parents)will ask: "Do I have to take medicine forever?" Our answer is "No." Once a well state is established for a period of 6-9 months,medication can be tapered on a trial basis. Although affective illness isa cyclic disorder, recurrent cycles can be expected but not anticipatedor predicted. Sometimes recurrence will be seasonal and on otheroccasions associated with stressful events. If, with aging throughadolescence, the dysthymia, hypomania, cyclothymia, or rapid cycling bipolar disorder patterns do not stabilize, then appropriate medicationwill be needed for a long period of time: "But nothing is forever."However, individuals requiring and benefiting from lithium can anticipatelong term use of the medication. A complex issue is the treatment of attentional symptoms with the twostimulant medications: methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) and pemoline (Cylert).These two agents heighten vigilance and can be successfully used in themanagement of the primary disorder of vigilance. They also lower thehyperactivity of hypomania (Table 12). However,these drugs can promotedepression. The mood disturbance ("rebound"), insomnia, and loss ofappetite associated with these two medications are symptomatic of anunderlying depression. Rarely are these two agents helpful in themanagement of affectively-ill, learning-disabled young people. With agingand freedom from depression, those with the primary disorder of vigilancewill stay busy to be alert, to learn, and to perform. If depressionoccurs, appropriate antidepressant medication should lift the depressionthus restoring normal vigilance which was worsened by the depression. Summary A common cause of school failure in learning disabled young people isaffective illness. Depression is generated by the right cerebralhemisphere and manic symptoms by the left hemisphere. Affective illnessis a genetic disorder that can present in several patterns: depression,dysthymia, mania, hypomania, cyclothymia, juvenile rapid cycling bipolardisorder, and classic manic-depressive disease. The treatment ismultimodal involving the use of appropriate medication in addition toappropriate environmental (home and school) communication systems,cognitive coaching, and counseling. Affective illness is recognizable, treatable, and should have a good prognosis. Glossary Selected Reading Warren A. Weinberg, M.D.; Caryn R. Harper, M.S.; Graham J.

You Should Know: What an IEP is How to prepare for an IEP meeting What an IEP must include How to write your own IEP input statement How to participate effectively in an IEP meeting How to use positive communication skills to build a cooperativehome/school relationship How to obtain appropriate special education and related services foryour child through the IEP What is an IEP? An IEP is a written document which is developed at an IEP meeting.Federal Law requires that a written individual education plan (IEP) bedeveloped and reviewed annually. (121a. 344 PL 94-142) Preparation for the IEP Meeting Obtain your child's school records. The Family Rights andPrivacy Act (FERPA) insures your right to examine school records, receivean explanation of the contents, challenge the contents, and obtaincopies of all records. Before any IEP meeting, all recordsmaintained by the school must be made available to you. [Access Rights(121a.502, 121a. 562)] Prepare a file of your child's evaluations. Review theschool's diagnostic/eligibility written report. This report must containthe nature of your child's disability, eligibility status,classification, written observation reports, signatures of the schoolteam. (Review evaluation purpose 121a.500; 121a.530-532; SLD Regulationsof 12/29/77, 121a. 540-543) List skills you believe your child is ready to learn or shouldhave learned. This is especially important if you believe your childhas greater abilities than those stated by the school team. Make an outline of what you believe your child's IEP shouldcontain based upon your child's evaluations and consultation withappropriate professionals. Remember to bring this file to the meeting. Talk to other parents of children with specific learningdisabilities. Learn as much as you can from them about their IEPexperiences. Contact your local LDA Unit. The school must send you written notice of the IEP meeting.The time and place must be mutually convenient. The school mustindicate who will be in attendance. (121a.504-505; 121a.344-345) A copyof your legal rights should be included in the written notice. Bring a friend, another parent, a relative or advocate forsupport. Some parents feel overwhelmed at an IEP meeting. It may behelpful to obtain a copy of the Federal Regulations to the Education ofthe Handicapped Act, PL 94-142, and your State Rules and guidelines forSpecial Education. Also very helpful is a copy of Interpretation ofthe Individualized Education Program, published by the U.S.Department of Education in the Federal Register. January 19, 1981. TheFederal sources are available through your Congressional representatives.Your State Department of Education can provide you with stateinformation. You may also want to contact your local LDA unit. The IEP Meeting Participate in the IEP meeting confidently. It is your right andobligation. The IEP meeting must include: A representative of the school, other than the child's teacher, whois qualified to provide, or supervise the provision of specialeducation. The representative must have the capacity to commit the agencyresources so that whatever services are set out in the IEP will not bevetoed at a higher administrative level within the agency. (FederalRegister 1/19/81, #13) The child's (student's) teacher One or both of the student's parent(s) or guardian The student, where appropriate, as determined by the parent(s)(Federal Register 1/19/81 #13) For a handicapped student who has been evaluated for the first time,the school must include someone who is knowledgeable about the evaluationprocedure used with the child and is familiar with the results of theevaluation. [121a.344 (b)(2)] Other individuals at the discretion of the parent or agency. Parents have a right to clear explanations in everyday language. Donot hesitate to ask for clarifications if needed. Parents may tape IEP meetings (Federal Register 1/19/81 #12) An IEP must be agreed upon (and short term instructional objectiveswritten) before special education and related services are provided to ahandicapped child. The extent and duration of both regular and specialeducation and related services must be written at the initial meeting. An IEP must be in effect within 30 days of determination ofeligibility and thereafter at the beginning of each school year. Special education also includes access to vocational education withappropriate modifications, accommodations and remedial services. (121a.143; Federal Register 1/19/81 #50) Ask for a copy of the IEP. An IEP can be revised if you feel it is not working. IEP meetings can be called at the request of the parent or theschool. Federal regulations do not require parental signature on the IEP. Your Child's IEP Should Consist of: A statement of your child's present educational performance level A statement of annual goals, including short term instructionalobjectives Specific special education and related services to be provided and astatement of the extent to which your child will participate in regulareducation programs The dates for initiation of services and the anticipated duration ofservices Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures andschedules for determining at least annually, whether instructionalobjectives are being achieved All accommodations and modifications necessary for participation inregular education programs (Federal Register 1/19/81 #48) A statement of the least restrictive environment (LRE) An annual goal is a general statement of desired changes andprogress through the year. Example: "To increase ______'s word analysis skills from 2.1 to 3.4 as measured bythe ______test(s)" A short term instructional objective is a measurable,intermediate step between a child's present level of performance and theannual goal established. The objectives are based upon the logicalbreakdown of the major components of the annual goals and serve asmilestones for measuring progress towards meeting the goals. Theydescribe what the child is to accomplish in a particular area within atime specified period (Federal Register 1/19/81 #39) These objectives direct the sequential efforts for closing the gapbetween the child's indicated ability and his functioning. Examples: "________ will be able to discriminate between the short 'i' and short'e' sounds. By mid-October, orally given 20 new words containing theshort 'e' and short 'i' sounds, _____will respond with 85% accuracy." "________ will be able to analyze the syllables in multisyllabic words.By November 15, ________ will be able to identify the number of syllablesin a list of 25 new mullisyllabic words presented visually with 90%accuracy." "________ will continue work on basic subtraction concepts, fractions(understanding equivalent), and addition facts through 20. By January, ________ will be able to define and explain the terms numerator and denominator and will add fractions with like denominators with 90% accuracy." "By mid November, ________ will show increased ability to attend ingroup work settings as determined by both ________'s self monitoringrecords and teachers independent probes as demonstrated by a 40% increasein attending behavior." Your Child's IEP can be implemented through: A regular class in a public school, with appropriate supportiverelated services A special class in a public school, with appropriate supportiverelated services, as necessary A special public high school A special education program in private day or residential schoolwhich meets state standards A home or hospital program A special education program in a residential facility Appropriately related/supportive services must be provided to meetyour child's needs as indicated in the IEP. These include, but are not limited to: (121a.13) Speech and language services Psychological services, social work services, counseling services Special readers, braillists, typists, and interpreters Physical and occupational therapy, adaptive physical education, andother necessary therapeutic services Consultative services Supportive institutional services Medical services for evaluation and diagnostic purposes, and school health nurses Parent counseling and training Resource Centers Transportation services Vocational Education The need for related services is determined by an appropriateevaluation of the child's needs. If you feel your child is in need of aspecific related service, and it is not included, you should request anevaluation in that specific area. The IEP should state each needed related service, the date ofthe initiation or the service, prescribed time(s) per week (days(s)).person(s) to render service, and the anticipated duration. The IEP shouldstate whether the service will be provided on a one-to-one basis, in agroup, or only by consultation with the classroom teacher. Example: Speech and language remediation for 15 minutes daily on a one-to-onebasis and 25 minutes three times per week in a group of no more thanthree children with similar language needs with the Speech and LanguagePathologist. When requesting related services, you should base your request on thepremise that your child needs a given service in order to benefit fromhis/her special educational program. Your child should receive appropriate non-academic and extracurricularservices (Federal Register 1/19/81 #48, 49, 50) Adaptive physical education (OT/PT) Music, art, home economics, shop Other non-academic subjects that other children in your school arereceiving Recreational opportunities that other children in your school arereceiving Parents and Professionals May Disagree The law insures a process for resolving differences. It you cannotcome to an agreement you may request another meeting. Do not feelpressured to make a decision immediately. You might wish to initialthose areas with which you agree and request a 30 day interim IEP.(Federal Register 1/19/81 #35) Independent Evaluations Parents may obtain an independent evaluation and request another meetingbased on the new evaluation. Consult PL 94-142 section 121a.503 and page52511 for additional information. Independent evaluations that seek adiagnosis of the disability can frequently be financed through thirdparty (insurance) carriers if the evaluations are obtained throughprofessionals such as clinics, psychologists, pediatricians, neurologistsetc. Specific Learning Disabilities are recognized medical conditions. Complaints If needed services are not provided in the IEP or recommendations from anindependent evaluation are not considered you may file a complaint withyour State Department of Education (seeking mediation) (121a.602 andEDGAR) or file for a Due Process Hearing. (121a.506-513)* *Sources cited: Education of All Handicapped Children's Act PL 94-142Federal Register on IEP's 1/19/81 Under Federal requirement the IEP has been defined as: A communication vehicle between all participating parties toensure that they know what the child's problems are what will be providedand what the anticipated outcome may be An opportunity to resolve differences A written commitment of resources to enable a handicappedchild to receive needed special education and related services.

Bateman, Ph.D., J.D. Due to the length, this paper is presented in three parts: Part I (this part) Part II Part III The post-school success rates of students who have learning disabilities, as a group, have not been what we would all hope even though many individuals have been highly successful. A recent focus on greater school responsibility for the post-school life of students who have disabilities has resulted in new transition requirements. The purpose of this discussion is to present a different approach to writing IEPs, with special attention to the transition component This approach results in IEPs which, unlike most IEPs, are both educationally useful and legally correct. THE PROMISE After nearly seventeen years of life the Individual Education Program (IEP)-- the heart and soul of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) -- is still in it's infancy, it's great potential unrealized and unappreciated. The IEP process and product frequently have been distorted beyond recognition. The purpose of this discussion is to show how the IEP process can work to produce IEPs that are both educationally useful and legally correct. The essence of legal correctness is that the IEP is tailored precisely to all theunique needs of the individual student. The core of educational utility is that the IEP spells out precisely how the school district will address each and every unique need and how it will determine whether and when a change in strategy or service is required. The IEP process must determine: (a) which needs or characteristics of the student require special education, i.e., individualization of services; (b) Precisely how the district will address each need, i.e., "what special education, related services or modifications it will provide; and (c) how and when the efficacy of those services will be evaluated. The IEP process must include the parent (or parent/student) as a full and equal partner, and a student whose IEP addresses "transition" must be invited to participate in the IEP process and must have her or his preferences and interests considered. These transition concerns and processes are a special focus of this discussion. THE PRACTICE Most IEPs are useless or slightly worse, and too many teachers experience theIEP process as always time consuming, sometimes threatening, and, too often, apointless bureaucratic requirement. The result is a quasi-legal document to befiled away with the expectation it won't be seen again except, heaven forbid,by a monitor or compliance officer. The point of the IEP exercise seems to beto complete the given form in a way that commit the district to as little aspossible, and which precludes, as much as possible, any meaningful discussionor evaluation of the student's real progress. Parents too often experience, the IEP process as an overgrown parent-teacherconference in which the school personnel present some previously preparedpapers and request a signature. They may be told a few things about some"rights." Parents who attempt to participate as equals are often intimidatedinto acquiescence. They are frequently given false and outrageous distortionssuch as, "We (the district) don't provide individual tutoring"; or "Speechtherapy is always done by the regular classroom teacher and the speechtherapist provides consultation services to her"; or "We are a full inclusionschool and have no special classes or resource rooms because we don't believein pull-out programs." When such limiting and blatantly illegal practices arepresented as if they are simple fact few parents are adequately prepared tochallenge the district. A BETTER WAY The IEP process and product can be both educationally useful and legallycorrect. The first step toward that end is for the district to provide anappropriate time and place for the IEP meeting, The place should be physicallycomfortable and the meeting time and length appropriate. The law requires themeeting be at a mutually agreed on time and place. Too often parents are notaware they have any say in either. Districts must also be careful to avoidunrealistically short meetings, especially for initial, complex or disputedIEPs. The only legitimate focus of an IEP meeting is on the special needs of thestudent and how those are to be addressed. There may be a temptation fordistrict personnel to sidestep into policy explanations or justifications orinto what the parents have done or not done. If the student is not present atthe IEP meeting a strategically placed photo of the youngster can serve tohelp all participants stay focused on the needs of that student. Many IEPmeetings lose this essential focus and wander, becoming inefficient andfrustrating for all. The single most important principle of the IEP process is that the school mustappropriately address all the student's unique needs without regard to theavailability of needed services. Prior to the passage of IDEA (then P.L.94-142) in 1975, schools were legally free to offer only the programs orservices, if any, they had available. Parents were supposed to be grateful foranything at all that was provided. The primary purpose of the law was to turnthat squarely around and entitle the student who has a disability toa free appropriate education individually designed to meet her or his uniqueneeds. Educators who have entered the field in the last twenty years lack thishistorical perspective and too easily revert to the pre-IDEA mentality oftrying to stretch existing programs and services to fit the students. Insteadthey must start with the student and design services to fit the student'sneeds, however unique they may be. THE PARTICIPANTS Sometimes parents report that only a teacher was at the IEP meeting; othertimes a seeming army of district personnel confront them. The law specifiesthat in addition to the parent and student (if the parent so wishes) a teacherof the student and a district representative must be present. The IDEAregulations allow the district substantial discretion in determining whichteacher will be at the IEP meeting. Since, in theory, the IEP team isaddressing the student's needs above all, it would seem reasonable to select ateacher who knows the student well. In addition, at least one team membermust be qualified (by state standards) in the area of the student'sdisability. If this is not the teacher, it must be the district representative(Mcintire, 16 EHLR 163, (OSEP, 1990)). Students at middle school orhigh school most often have several teachers. The law does not require thatthey all attend, but good special education practice suggests their inputshould be sought and they most certainly should be informed of the IEP'sprovisions. The district representative must provide or be qualified to supervise specialeducation, have the authority to allocate district resources, and be able toguarantee no administrative veto) of the IEP team's decisions (34 CFR Part 300Appendix C, 13). These qualifications are the law's way of insuring that theIEP team, and it alone, has the power to determine what services the studentneeds and, therefore, will receive. The evaluation team, often called themulti-disciplinary team, determines eligibility, but only recommends services. All members of the IEP team should remember the enormous power andresponsibility that is theirs. When the IEP specifies a service is needed, thedistrict must provide it. Too often parents are given a very differentimpression, i.e., that only what is already available can be provided andoften in smaller than needed amounts. This critical difference between the lawand practice is typified by the common situation, e.g., where the parentbelieves the student who has a learning disability needs intensive,individual, daily language therapy and is told by the speech therapist thatsince the therapist is only in that building on Mondays and Wednesdays thestudent will be included in an ongoing 20 minute speech therapy group on thosetwo days. In addition to the parent (and perhaps student), teacher, and the districtrepresentative, the first IEP meeting for a given student must be attended bya member of the evaluation team or someone familiar with the evaluation. Inaddition, either the district or the parent may invite anyone else. Thedistrict must, however, inform the parent ahead of time of all districtinvited persons who will be at the IEP meeting. There is no similarrequirement for parents to inform the district of anyone they may invite. The fact the law does not require related services personnel to be present maybe highly significant. The IDEA regulations (34 CFR Part 300 Appendix C,Question 23) advise that related service personnel provide writtenrecommendations to the IEP team about the nature, frequency and amount ofservice to be provided. Arguably, there is no requirement that goals andobjectives are necessary for related services. If related service goals andobjectives are required they may be of the sort a teacher and parent couldwrite. Since related services include only those necessary to enable thestudent to benefit from special education it stands to reason that the goalsand objectives to be accomplished by the related services would appear asgoals for the special education services. The focus on the related servicescomponents of the IEP is on specifying the amount of service and the outcomeis reflected in the goals and objectives for special education. The relatedservices are not ends in themselves, but rather enablers. CONTENTS OF THE IEP The federal requirements for the contents of the IEP are straightforward. Theindividualized education program for each child must include: (a) A statement of the student's present levels of education performance; (b) A statement of annual goals, including short term instructionalobjectives; (c) A statement of the specific special education and related services tobe provided to the student, and the extent to which the student will be ableto participate in regular educational programs; (d) A statement of the needed transition services for students beginningno later than age 16 and annually thereafter (and if determined appropriatefor an individual student, beginning at age 14, or younger), including, ifappropriate, a statement of each public agency's and each participatingagency's responsibilities or linkages, or both, before the student leaves theschool setting; (e) The projected dates for initiation of services and the anticipatedduration of the services; and (f) Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and schedulesfor determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the short terminstructional objectives are being achieved. (34-CFR 300.346). LEGAL RULINGS ON IEPS These five general principles, among others, emerge clearly from a review ofthe hundreds of past IEP rulings from agencies and courts: (1) All of a student's unique needs must be addressed, not just heror his academic needs, e.g., Russell v. Jefferson Sch. Dist., 609 F.Supp. 605,(N.D. CA 1985); Abrahamson v. Hershman, 701 F.2nd 223, (1st Cir.1983). Arguably, no "non-unique" needs have to be addressed. (2) The availability of services may not be considered in writing the IEP. Ifa service is needed it must be written on the IEP and if the district does nothave it available, it must be provided by another agency. One of the earliestof all the agency rulings mandated that availability of services bedisregarded in writing the IEP (Leconte, EHLR 211:146, OSEP, 1979).This principle has been reiterated repeatedly by the Office of SpecialEducation and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) and the Office of SpecialEducation Programs (OSEP) and virtually ignored by the field. (3) The IEP is a firm, legally binding "commitment of resources." The districtmust provide the services listed or the IEP must be amended (Beck,EHLR 211:145 (OSEP 1979)). (4) IEPs must be individualized. The same goals, same content areas, samediscipline or the same amounts of therapy on many IEPs (e.g., every studentwho receives speech therapy in a particular building receives 30 minutesdaily) reveals a violation of this individualization requirement (Tucson,AZ Unified Sch. Dist. #1, EHLR 352.547 (OCR 1987)). (5) All of the components of the IEP required by law(e.g., goals and objectives, specific special education and related services)must be present.

Do not dwell on the problem. Helpthem develop the same behaviors that you expect from other children. Help your child understand his or her disability and put it in perspective.The more you accept that L.D. is just part of the individual, the morethe person can accept him or herself. Never let the disability become an excuse for not trying. Allow yourchild to try, and even fail sometimes, since that's what life is also like. Involve your children in decision making. This can be anything fromdeciding which watermelon to pick to choosing a vacation route. Allow themto make the small decisions so they will be ready for the big ones. Social/Emotional Teach your child the rules of polite behavior, such as a goodhandshake, the importance of eye contact, to wait until another hasstopped before speaking. Share your own feelings with your children. Telling them, "I amangry." "I am worried", "I am happy", helps him/her understand how faces and bodies look when someone is feeling a certainway. Help your children participate in clubs or activities so they candevelop skills in areas along with others. Avoid too many extra-curricularactivities that create undue competition. Choose activities that willhelp build self esteem and that may someday help with career choices. Self-Help Teach good grooming. Pick a hair style that is easy to comb; choosecolor coordinated clothes, and then teach how to take care of clothes andpersonal items. Help your child learn organizational skills. Start early with sortingobjects such as silverware. Plan for the next day the night before. Makedaily lists and plans. As skill increases, teach how a calendar is usedfor planning ahead. Teach time management so he/she can learn to determine how long it willtake to get ready for class or a date. Help with developing a weekly schedule.Color code different times, i.e. Green - study time, Blue - T.V., Red -classes etc. Teach or find someone to teach such skills as telling time, how to preparefood, basic car maintenance, to answer the phone, take messages, balancea checkbook. Think of things you have to be able to do. Pick one skilland teach it. Then pick another. In other words, teach your child the skillsneeded to live independently. Subscribe to appropriate magazines and publications that will keep himor her updated on current clothing, movies, music, etc. Academic Keep copies of all school and psychological reports. You may need themlater to get services for your child. Don't become overly involved in the child's homework. Guidance and supportis needed but it is difficult to be both parent and teacher. If your child wants a college education start to investigate collegeprograms in his/her freshman year. It will take time and good programsfill early. Help him/her ask good questions about the programs provided. Encourage students to volunteer at a nursing home, your church or synagogue, or with an environmental group. Such places are non-threateningand help develop social skills. If he or she has chosen a vocation instead, consider having a careercounselor help with the decisions. There are also programs to help thestudent in on the job training. Never limit your children. Don't tell them they can't enter an occupationbecause of the disability. There are more and more opportunities developingfor people with learning disabilities. Involve yourself. Find out about local, state and national conferences.They are good sources of information and literature. So is the library.Find support groups such as LDA.

A severe difficulty in understanding or using one ormore areas of language, including listening, speaking, reading,writing, and spelling. DYSNOMIA. A marked difficulty in remembering names or recallingwords needed for oral or written language. DYSPRAXIA. A severe difficulty in performing drawing, writing,buttoning, and other tasks requiring fine motor skill, or insequencing the necessary movements. LEARNED HELPLESSNESS. A tendency to be a passive learner whodepends on others for decisions and guidance. In individuals withLD, continued struggle and failure can heighten this lack ofself-confidence. LEARNING MODALITIES. Approaches to assessment or instructionstressing the auditory, visual, or tactile avenues for learningthat are dependent upon the individual. LEARNING STRATEGY APPROACHES. Instructional approaches that focuson efficient ways to learn, rather than on curriculum. Includesspecific techniques for organizing, actively interacting withmaterial, memorizing, and monitoring any content or subject. LEARNING STYLES. Approaches to assessment or instructionemphasizing the variations in temperament, attitude, andpreferred manner of tackling a task. Typically considered arestyles along the active/passive, reflective/impulsive, orverbal/spatial dimensions. LOCUS OF CONTROL. The tendency to attribute success anddifficulties either to internal factors such as effort or toexternal factors such as chance. Individuals with learningdisabilities tend to blame failure on themselves and achievementon luck, leading to frustration and passivity. METACOGNITIVE LEARNING. Instructional approaches emphasizingawareness of the cognitive processes that facilitate one's ownlearning and its application to academic and work assignments.Typical metacognitive techniques include systematic rehearsal ofsteps or conscious selection among strategies for completing atask. MINIMAL BRAIN DYSFUNCTION (MBD). A medical and psychological termoriginally used to refer to the learning difficulties that seemedto result from identified or presumed damage to the brain.Reflects a medical, rather than educational or vocationalorientation. MULTISENSORY LEARNING. An instructional approach that combinesauditory, visual, and tactile elements into a learning task.Tracing sandpaper numbers while saying a number fact aloud wouldbe a multisensory learning activity. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION. A series of tasks that allowobservation of performance that is presumed to be related to theintactness of brain function. PERCEPTUAL HANDICAP. Difficulty in accurately processing,organizing, and discriminating among visual, auditory, or tactileinformation. A person with a perceptual handicap may say that"cap/cup" sound the same or that "b" and "d" look the same.However, glasses or hearing aids do not necessarily indicate aperceptual handicap. PREREFERRAL PROCESS. A procedure in which special and regularteachers develop trial strategies to help a student showingdifficulty in learning remain in the regular classroom. RESOURCE PROGRAM.

SPECIFIC LANGUAGE DISABILITY (SLD). A severe difficulty in someaspect of listening, speaking, reading, writing, or spelling,while skills in the other areas are age-appropriate. Also calledSpecific Language Learning Disability (SLLD). SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY (SLD). The official term used infederal legislation to refer to difficulty in certain areas oflearning, rather than in all areas of learning. Synonymous withlearning disabilities. SUBTYPE RESEARCH. A recently developed research method that seeksto identify characteristics that are common to specific groupswithin the larger population of individuals identified as havinglearning disabilities. TRANSITION. Commonly used to refer to the change from secondaryschool to postsecondary programs, work, and independent livingtypical of young adults.

Check List of Characteristics Educating Persons with Learning Disabilities Through A Child's Eyes Parent's Creed Compensatory Techniques and Curriculum Adaptations Sources of Additional Information When Learning is a Problem Does your child have a problem? Perhaps we can help Who has learning disabilities? Your chances of knowing him are very good: people like him may make upat least 10% of the population, cutting across every segment of thepopulation. Can we afford the loss of the talents and contributions ofthis proportion of the population? Of even one person? This is the bright little boy who started first grade expecting tolearn to read, but he didn't. He couldn't. He has one kind of learningdisability. His very serious problem is dyslexia - impairment of theability to read - which can damage his performance in every otheracademic area. Fortunately, there is hope. He can be taught tocompensate. He can reach his potential, if only someone will understandand do something. Through no fault of his own, a child like this is handicapped. Heneeds special help, but because his handicap cannot be seen, he oftendoes not receive assistance. The pressure on him to perform like othernormal children is tremendous. He wants to understand and tries to, buthe fails. He cannot solve his perplexing problem: that takes a trainedprofessional. It is urgent to get that professional and this childtogether, before the child gives up. Once the problem has been identified, remediation has begun andcompensation is implemented in the classroom, the person can begin tohelp himself to rebuild his fading self esteem. How to identify a person with learning disabilities: Any unexplained, persistent problem in learning a basic skillnecessary for survival as an independent adult may be a clue to learningdisabilities in a person of normal to superior intelligence. Learning disabilities should be considered as a possible cause if achild has trouble with one or more of the following: thinking clearly writing legibly spelling accurately learning to read learning to compute copying forms remembering facts following directions putting things in sequence or, if he is often confused, clumsy, impulsive, hyperactive, ordisoriented, becoming frustrated and rebellious, depressed, withdrawn, oraggressive. A learning disability (LD) is a lifelong disorder whichaffects the manner in which individuals with normal or above averageintelligence select, retain, and express information. Incoming oroutgoing information may become scrambled as it travelsbetween the senses and the brain. In adults, learning disabilities are commonly recognized as deficitsin one or more of the following academic areas: comprehension spelling written expression problem solving math computation Less frequent, but no less troublesome, are problems in organizationalskill, time management, and social skills. Many adults with learningdisabilities may also have language based and/or perceptual processing problems. top Check List of Characteristics Children who have learning disabilities frequently show somecombination of a variety of characteristics and/or weaknesses.Significant symptoms might include: READING/VISION _____ holds book too close _____ word caller _____ points to words _____ word reversals _____ word substitutions _____ skips complete words _____ sees double _____ re-reads lines _____ does not read fluently _____ vocalizes during silent reading _____ poor comprehension in oral reading _____ skips lines as he reads _____ lacks word attack skills _____ eye regressions _____ omits ending consonants in oral reading _____ moves head when reading _____ loses place when reading _____ poor tracking and eye scan _____ frowns when reading _____ excessive eye blinking _____ closes or covers one eye _____ squinting _____ burning or itching of eyes _____ tends to rub eyes _____ visual closure problems _____ inability to focus properly _____ sights with one eye WRITING _____ handedness not clearly established _____ lacks automatic response to alphabet _____ lacks spacing between words _____ letter reversals _____ has poor posture _____ improper position of paper _____ variation of letter heights _____ inability to write on the lines _____ grips pencil tightly or awkwardly _____ moves paper or body when writing _____ pressure points in writing _____ finger writing _____ poor closure of letters _____ poor organization of thoughts _____ poor grasp of writing mechanics AUDITORY/VERBAL _____ listless _____ frequent colds, allergy, asthma _____ depends on others visually _____ faulty pronunciation _____ breathes through mouth _____ complains of ear problems _____ dizziness in head _____ unnatural pitch of voice _____ blank expression of face when spoken to _____ watches teacher closely _____ uses loud voice _____ looks at others for help _____ excessive volume needed for listening to TV, radio, or record player _____ unable to follow more than one direction at a time MATHEMATICS _____ reverses the numbers _____ inability to transfer in computation _____ difficulty with story problems _____ poor digit memory _____ forward _____ backward _____ difficulty learning to tell time _____ poor number concept understanding _____ inability to respond automatically to basic math facts at appropriate level SOCIAL/EMOTIONAL _____ Overactive _____ Over reactive _____ poor self esteem _____ limited attention span _____ poor peer relations SPELLING _____ omission of beginning or ending letters _____ can spell better orally than written _____ auditory perception problems _____ letter reversals _____ wrong number of letters in words _____ unable to distinguish difference _____ long vowel sounds _____ short vowel sounds _____ spells phonetically _____ confusion between consonant sounds of ____ d - b ____ d - t ____ m - n ____ p - b ____ f - v ____ s - z Checklist adapted from From ObservableSymptoms to Remediations, Sister Sibyllina Mueller, O.D. top Educating Persons with Learning Disabilities How much does it cost to educate a person with learningdisabilities? It costs very little compared to the cost of noteducating him. In every community offering appropriate services, examplesof successful remediation can be found, some in college and some in theadult world. The Schools Public schools are required by law to provide persons with learningdisabilities with a free, appropriate education. Good school systems areworking in compliance with the law. Good professionals are dedicated tocareful diagnosis and quality remediation. Programs and services forpersons with learning disabilities are mandated through high school age and beyond, and should be available. Finding the Right Educational Program Become involved in your child's school program. Meet with theclassroom teacher and request a student study team meeting. Write aletter to the school principal stating that your child may have aspecific learning disability, and requesting a comprehensive evaluation,to be followed by an Individualized Educational Program (IEP) meeting.Keep copies of all correspondence with the school and a record of thedates and contents of all telephone conversations. You legally haveaccess to your child's file at the school and may request copies of hisrecords. Contact a local LDA chapter, state office, or the national office forspecific learning disabilities and procedural information. Pinpoint the problem. Arrange for a thorough physical evaluation,including vision and hearing. Consider the need for assessment ofreceptive and/or expressive language problems, and visual perceptiondifficulties. Parent Advocates Local LDA chapters usually have experienced volunteers who know thespecial education laws, professional language, appropriate tests forspecific learning disabilities, the types of special education programs,and the schools and school systems. Individuals like these are ready toserve as resource persons and can provide information to parents aboutadvocacy resources. The high school, college, and vocational student with learningdisabilities The student with learning disabilities may require a variety ofservices which can include: tutorial services, special academicadvisement, basic skill remediation, assistance in organization anddevelopment of adequate study skills, and additional programaccommodation, or modification. Some students with learning disabilitiesmay not require extensive use of personnel, extra funds, or assistancefrom professors, but may need appropriate program modifications and useof auxiliary aids. These include readers, scribes, note takers, extendedtime policies for assigned papers, projects, or tests, and taped books orlectures. However, it must be noted that these services are designed toequalize opportunities, not to lower the academic standards forthese students or to alter the essential nature of the degreerequirements. There are, however, instances where a student is unable tomaster a particular course because of his disability. In those cases,course substitutions may be in order if the course in question is notessential to the degree program or related to a licensing requirement. top Through A Childï¿½s Eyes A candid look at A Family of Children with LearningDisabilities Twelve year old Bobby would be glad to write or tell this truestory if he could, but the words wouldn't come out right for him even ifhe tried. Let's look at this frankly through his eyes, though: I'm in the sixth grade now and am doing O.K., I think. I'm the luckyone of the family for two of my three older brothers had a pretty roughtime in school. I'd like to talk about me first. I can remember when Iwas little I used to say to my folks, "I hear you but I don't understandyou." Even now, I have to listen "hard" in school and at home I just plaindon't "dig" the T.V. stories sometimes. It's kind of funny though as myoldest brother who is twenty eight often has to ask his wife what happened on the T.V. show even yet. When I hear him still ask questions I don'tfeel so dumb because I know he isn't dumb. My mother tells me I am really doing great now in what I think of"Me". I used to always say "I'm stupid." Seems like I just couldn't get along with the kids either. They used to call me dumb lots of times. Icould get along with grown-ups a lot easier, now I'm doing better withthe kids since I'm older. I do O.K. with my teachers. They know I really try. I can still remember way back in the first grade when I used to "scrub"my pencil across the paper. Sometimes I did it all day; I just couldn't do anything the other kids did and that really made me mad. I couldn't read either. In the second grade I started getting lots of extra help. I began to find I really could learn but it just took a lot longer for me. I had a very special kind of help in reading. I have trouble even yet, but I'm coming along slowly. My twenty-one year old brother still has lots of problems with reading and spelling, yet he is really sharp in lots of ways. He understands everything very quickly that he hears; he's just a lot better "listener" than I am. My writing is something else. I asked my teacher one day whether she wanted me to write fast and sloppy or slow and neat. She is great though as she told me to just do the best I can. I took private typing lessons all last year and that has really helped me out in my school work. I do try hard and when I have a nice teacher like I have now, somehow I seem to plug right along. I still need lots of help at home though. I can read better now but I just can't keep up with the books in my grade. All my books except math and grammar are on tapes. My mother is a special teacher, herself, and has helped me all these years. If we ever get so we can't work together we agreed we'd find someone else to help me. We are an unusual family. Even though three of us four boys have problems in learning, all my older brothers are making it OK in college. Some of them started kind of late, but they are still at it. They do one of the things I'm doing already, like listening to bookson tapes. Of course I'm one ahead of them since I can type already. Oneof my brothers has some pretty girl in his college class taking notes forhim on what is said in class for he spells so bad he can't read his ownnotes. Then in the subjects that he has a lot of reading to do, my mother types out notes for him to study. All my brothers use the tape recorder in their classes sometimes, but they say it takes so long to listen to thetapes again that they sometimes run out of time. I'll probably do thatwhen I get older,but right now I don't want to as I'm afraid the kidswill tease me. I don't like to be too different than the other kids. Little by little I'm beginning to think "I'm OK" and I already know mybrothers are "OK". We just laugh like when one of my brothers puts the newhouse numbers on in the wrong order. Another brother turns the valves onour swimming pool the wrong direction. Then my oldest brother gets lost alot when he is driving someplace. He acts just like my mother does behindthe wheel. We kid a lot about the funny things we do sometimes. It helpsme to laugh at my own goofs. We are all sort of like fish in the water,but you should see us on dry land. Football, basketball, tennis -- youname it -- they just aren't our bag. Our family sort of pulls together; Iguess that is the main thing. Learning Disabilities Council ofIndianapolis top Parentï¿½s Creed THE PARENTS They told them she would "grow out of it" so they waitedanother year. Baffled by their problems, parents seek advice but often in the wrongplaces. Even if they have raised other children who were academicallysuccessful and even if they are convinced that parents areexperts in knowing their own children, their self confidence vanishes. They feel helpless as they suffer with,for, or because of these youngsters. Another year of failure goes by, leaving its scars on a sensitivemind. Identification... from infancy to adulthood. From infancy, parents should be checking the child's progress against thenorms for his age group, using any good reference on child development. If there are continuing deviations, they should discuss them with a trusted professional. Most schooldistricts have pre primary diagnostic clinics and special education programs, if needed. Early remediation is best, but later is better than none -- even much later. LDA can provide informationfor adults with learning disabilities. Not one person of normal intelligence should be sent into today'sjob market without basic academic survival skills. Yesterday's person with a learning disability entered a simpler adultsociety, often at a younger age. Some who were unusually gifted andtalented became famous: Hans Christian Anderson William Butler Yeats Winston Churchill Woodrow Wilson Leonardo da Vinci August Rodin George Patton Bruce Jenner Tom Cruise Cher Walt Disney We do not hear about the rest, whose talents and intelligence may havebeen lost to the world, but who could nevertheless make a living withtheir hands. Today's person with learning disabilities enters a highly lingual,educated society. Credentials that he may not be able to obtain stop himat the threshold of the career of his choice, and his second choice, andon down the line. How many are we losing, and what will happen to them inan increasingly technological job market? A PARENT'S CREED (written by anLDA mother) I BELIEVE that being the parent of a child with a hiddenhandicap is the most important and challenging job I will ever have. Inthe few years I have to help him mature, I will always attempt to instillin him a deep knowledge of his innate worth as an individual and nevermeasure his behavior or scholastic achievement by any other child. I WILL strive to always remember that this child is operatingunder great pressure and much frustration; therefore, I will not rejecthis outbursts as being abnormal or unrestrained misbehavior. I willrecall the many times he has been loving and kind and try to overlook the incidences when there is overt hostility. And then I will try to help structure his world so that frustrations might be lessened and he will feel more secure. I WILL have endless patience when directions are not followedat the first command, and when some rule or concept is forgotten ormisunderstood. I will not expect perfection. I will be aware of andgrateful for every small improvement he makes. THROUGH the trials which I may face each day, I will alwaysremember that this child did not choose to be different and that he would, if possible, gladly be ï¿½normalï¿½. However, since he is different, he deserves special understanding, patience,acceptance, and love. He's my child, and it is my right and my duty toguide him in finding fulfillment in life. Learning Disabilities Council ofIndianapolis top Compensatory Techniques and CurriculumAdaptations While the majority of the student's program should be as closelyaligned with the school and classroom core curriculum, some modificationsand accommodations might be necessary. Listed below are some suggestedcompensatory techniques, curriculum adaptations, and educational aids forstudents with specific learning disabilities (SLD): For students with difficulty reading, or the very slow reader, the"read along technique" with taped textbooks and workbooks might be used inthe classroom, at home, and in the resource room. For students with memory problems, or unable to take notes inclassroom, a fellow student might share notes by using carbon paper, orthe teacher could provide a copy of the class lesson or allow the studentto tape record lessons. Educational film strips and videos are available on most subjects andmost grade levels for general information not acquired from the printedpage. Talking books may be acquired from the library. For students with short term memory problems -- i.e., do not remembermathematical facts, but understand the computation process -- a table ofmath facts and other visual aids, and a printing calculator couldbe provided. For the student who has difficulty writing, a battery cassetterecorder could be provided for the student to dictate answers to tests orwritten lessons. For the student who cannot write legibly, reverses letters, numbersor symbols (e.g., + for x), typing could be taught asearly as possible. Each typing lesson is also a lesson in punctuation,spelling and vocabulary. Handouts should be typed, not handwritten. Some students may benefitfrom large print, or colored plastic overlays thought by some to enhancesymbols and to give depth to printed page. To train memory and listening skills, the use of poetry, rhymes,songs, and spelling tapes, beginning with the early grades, is thought tobe helpful. Teaching spelling should be started with a multisensory approach --say the word, spell the word orally, then write the word. Reading: Test the student for ability to learn and usephonics. Students who can't profit from phonics might be taught byalternate methods. A need for individual evaluation is indicated. Theteacher should explore different methods until a technique is found thatbenefits the student. Assessment should be made for instructional levelas well as comprehension level. In some cases the use of high interestmaterials, a couple of grades below the student's grade level, may bebeneficial. Concrete words such as nouns, verbs and certain adjectivesand adverbs might be taught with flash cards -- both the word andillustration of the word. Abstract words that cannot be illustrated(e.g., of, is, if, to, etc.) could be taught as part of a phraseor sentence on flash cards. These abstract words should behighlighted in the textbook. Vocabulary enrichment of content material: The student can prepare files of vocabulary words used in a story or textbook, add definitions, write new sentences using the words, and keep them in alphabetical order. Large print-picture dictionaries are available for different reading levels. "Concept Picto-Cards" are an excellent tool for vocabulary, spelling and reading comprehension. Supplemental educational materials include Large type copies of Readers Digest magazine and Condensed Books (many are already on tape -- e.g., "Talking Tapes"). Picture magazines: Life, People, etc. Maps in dark outline, color coded, large lettering. Writing: For problems in copying, worksheets which leave spaceunder each word, phrase or sentence for copying provide support foradditional practice. Put list of words on right margin for left handedstudents, or those with mixed dominance (switch hitters). Have hand outsat desk for those who can't copy from blackboard or take dictation. Forstudents who use large written symbols, enlarge space allowed for"fill in the blank" tests or work sheets. For students who have difficulty with processing auditory input,(fully understanding questions asked, recalling or forming an appropriateanswer), be patient -- wait for the answer or present the question inwritten form. Oral language should be taught simultaneously with written language.Illustrations in the reading book should be used to generate conversationthat duplicates what is to be read in the printed text. Televisionviewing at home could serve the same purpose. Use video tapes to supplement instruction in subject matter (e.g.,reading, social studies, science, mathematics). Computers, captioned TVprograms, video tapes and workbooks used in preparing for GED testdirsare the newest and most effective ways to supplement instruction forstudents with specific learning disabilities (SLD). A multidisciplinary team is essential for proper evaluation of SLD. Amultisensory approach is needed to make classroom instruction meaningfuland available. When Learning is aProblem Teaching Mathematics to Students with Learning Disabilities Learning disabilities in mathematics have received relatively littleattention, yet the learning of mathematics is viewed as a crucial part of one's education -- mathematical abilities are listed as a separate category in the generic term "learning disabilities" by the National Joint Committee for Learning Disabilities and by Public Law 94-142 (listening, speaking, reading, writing, mathematical abilities,reasoning). Theories on mathematics disabilities view spatial visualization and verbal skills as critical. These two categories have a great deal to dowith anyone learning mathematics and are merely magnified for students with learning disabilities. These two areas should receive much attention in one's mathematics education and should be heavily emphasized in the teaching and remediation of mathematical concepts and skills. Concepts should be introduced with "hands on" concrete materials. Calculations should be done with calculators if memory is a problem (skill in using a calculator is necessary). Estimation strategies should be taught as mental computational skills are developed. Students should draw illustrations and representations whenever possible. Students should consistently discuss, read, and write mathematics. Knowing one digit facts is important, but work with paper and pencil algorithms should not be emphasized. An individual educational program in mathematics should concentrate on developing concepts and skills within these strands: numeration, geometry, measurement, collecting and interpreting data, estimation/mental computation, patterns and relations, word problems/applications. For some students with learning disabilities,the focus of the requirements should be on "hands on" and practical and daily living experiences, writing and discussing applications of mathematics. top Additional Information The following books provide additional information on learningdisabilities.

Lynne Cannon of the LDA Research Committee outlined the history of the Centers which began in the early 1980s. Through the ongoing efforts of the Research Committee, Congress mandated an Interagency Committee on Learning Disabilities in 1982 which included 11 federal agencies. Following a comprehensive review of the existing research and information on learning disabilities, the Interagency Committee concluded that ... Collaborative, integrated and coordinated multi-disciplinary approaches to research questions... a classification system... delineation of homogeneous subgroups.... and of more precise and reliable strategies for treatment, remediation, and prevention... were critical to the field. Dr. Reid Lyon, Director of the Learning Disabilities Research programs at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) outlined the research projects that began under the first appropriations of $7,250,000 in 1989. These were located at the University of Colorado, Yale; and at Johns Hopkins (Dr. Martha Denckla). These projects have expanded to five, adding Bowman Gray School of Medicine and Harvard/Beth Israel. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke funds the Johns Hopkins program. The total expenditure this year will be $21,000.000. He noted that this has provided the field with 2,200 journal articles and 26 books on learning disabilities over these past years. Dr. Lyon explained that the decision to focus on dyslexia or reading disability was taken because this is the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children. All the Centers use common diagnostic criteria, and all now have an intervention research component, and noted that this is the most difficult type of research to do well, requiring a high degree of intensity and hard work. Dr. Shaywitz (Yale Research Center) reported that dyslexia, a disorder of the language system (phonological awareness) cannot be separated from reading disability and is the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children, about one child in five. Following large groups of children prospectively, about three-fourths have a persistent deficit, though all improve, there is still a gap. In random samples, nearly as many girls as boys are affected. A central issue in reading disability is phonological awareness-that words are composed of sounds. This must be taught to 20-30% of the population and is the most important predictor of reading success in children and young adults. Other research at Yale, using imaging techniques (functional MRI), is investigating the underlying neurobiology of learning disabilities, correlating brain areas with various processes in reading. Dr. John DeFries (Colorado) said that the Institute of Behavioral Genetics at Boulder began in 1973 with a family study-followed by a twin study, still in progress. Many investigators are responsible for various studies under this program, which include projects on ADHD and executive function. The Colorado Reading Project found evidence of a genetic linkage to chromosome 15 in 1983 and more recently to chromosome 6 with five DNA markers. There is evidence for both shared and independent etiologies for different components of reading, e.g., visual/orthographic analysis and phonological awareness. There is evidence for a genetic etiology for reading disabilities from two large independent samples, and it is interesting that the affected region on chromosome 6 also influences the human immune system. Dr. Michele Mazzacco (Johns Hopkins) described four research projects at the Learning Disabilities Research Center at over the past seven years, designed to study specific social and academic learning disabilities in children with known syndromes wherein various types of learning disabilities are a part: neurofibromatosis, Turner's, and Fragile X. A comparative core battery of tests are conducted on all children in the program and on some family members. Brain imaging studies, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allow the identification of anatomical correlates of these cognitive and social deficits. Comparing the non-verbal learning disabilities of girls with Fragile X and Turner's syndrome allowed ways to study social learning disabilities in depth. The goal of these studies is to show how specific genes can impact specific aspects of the bran development and how these brain differences lead to different behavioral and cognitive phenotypes and symptoms that we need to understand in evaluating learning disabilities and their subtypes. Dr. Frank Wood (Bowman Gray) described their program, which for over seven years has been studying many processes that show how a dyslexic child learns to read and some important genetic findings from their study. The genetic and neuroimaging aspects of this project have important contributions for teaching approaches also. David Pauls reported on new genetic linkage studies in four samples of dyslexics and their families, based on four phenotypes: phonological segmentation, non-word reading, rapid naming, and single word reading. Phonological segmentation showed linkage to the HLA region of chromosome 6, very close to the Colorado findings. The region on chromosome 15, located in 1983 by the Colorado group, was found to correspond to word identification. The component processes of reading may involve different genes. Dr. Wood said they can image these phenotypes and pinpoint which areas of the brain arc working at a specific task. Excessive activity in some areas is related to lowered task performance. The left thalamus, related to decoding and phonological segmentation, is underactivated in the dyslexics studied. All of this has meaning for intervention. They have shown that code instruction (stainless steel phonics approach) delivered in the first and second grades improves reading performance in the third and eighth grades and produces stronger outcomes in math, an active frontal-type process. Dr. Albert Galaburda (Beth Israel/ Harvard) presented a segment of their nine-year project studying the neurobiology of dyslexia, which is looking at mechanisms behind developmental disorders of language. He said that debate has occurred on whether this involves the processing of sounds (low level processing), or is at the cognitive level (high level processing). His lab is exploring whether both low and high level processing are affected by the structure of the brain and whether small malformations are substrates for developmental language disorders. The transfer of low to high level processing, or the reverse, is important to decoding. An early lesion in one area of the brain will propagate to other levels of processing at the functional and anatomical levels, e.g., a lesion in the thalamus will affect the frontal lobe. Abnormal neuronal migration to the cortex, found in nine autopsied dyslexic brains would have occurred during prenatal life and might reflect a genetic defect in the cellular programming of neuronal migration. Such malformations and subsequent changes in the sizes of neurons in the thalamus can be reproduced in animal models with subsequent effects on their ability to discriminate fast sounds. Other, but not all, pathways may also be affected by these changes. Dr. Lyon introduced the programs on treatment interventions as a research target. He said that IQ/discrepancy criteria for services are not very valid for many children with learning disabilities. This may not be such a refractory disorder if identified early and attention given to the nature of the treatment itself. Dr. Barbara Foorman of the University of Houston and Dr. Joseph Torgesen of Florida State University described NICHD-funded studies on the effectiveness of various interventions for reading disabilities. The Houston intervention research program is about halfway through a five year grant. All the studies involve teacher training, teacher inservice and feedback. The children are from a mix of the four main ethnic groups. This prevention program is designed to help kindergarten children with pre-reading activities using listening games, rhymes, and phonemic segmentation and transition activities for 20 minutes a day. Analysis showed mid-year benefits from this program when compared to a matched control group in another school. The second program involves 114 children in the first and second grades who are poor readers and compares different types of instructional interventions used in a resource room program for one and a half to two hours a day. The third study involved designing a program and developing materials for a large school district that was moving from a whole language approach to reading to a phonics-based approach. Dr. Torgesen described two interdisciplinary projects of prevention and intervention. Four assumptions were used to guide this program: phonologically based reading disabilities are common; approaches must be affective in word-reading ability; the importance of letter-sound correspondences in deciphering the code; a method of stimulating phonological awareness must be included. One longitudinal study compared 1500 children, screened in kindergarten for poor phonological awareness and assigned to three different treatment groups, with a control group. All experimental groups showed good gains by mid-second grade and one group was above average in some reading skills. Other research from this program at Florida State University is investigating whether intensive interventions make a difference for the poorest ten year old readers. At the end of the day, members of the LDA research committee remarked that these research programs are providing valuable information for parents, teachers, and policy makers and scientific evidence for the possible etiologies and mechanisms of this real and most prevalent syndrome. The work on treatment, interventions, and in studying known genetic syndromes that involve social and cognitive learning disabilities will add to progress in this large and complicated field.

Introduction The purpose of this booklet is to provide literacy instructors and tutors with pertinent and concise information on adults with learning disabilities and their needs within literacy programs. Thousands of literacy programs across the country, including Adult Basic Education/GED programs, workplace literacy programs, and the many other public or private efforts, are giving an estimated 17 to 65 million illiterate persons in this country new opportunities not only to learn but also to increase their earningpotential and achieve their goals. The relationship between reading difficulties and the high incidence of learning disabilities among participants in literacy programs has been recognized frequently in recent practice and research. Persons withlearning disabilities appear in literacy programs at all levels of proficiency. Some are functionally literate, reading at the 8th grade level. Others have attained only basic skills, reading and writing at the 5th grade level. Still others can read and comprehend very little or not at all. Many individuals are identified as having learning disabilities as youngsters, some are identified as adults, but a significant percentage of individuals who have difficulty in learning never suspect their learning problems to be the result of a specific condition that can be identified and addressed. Theymay not understand that this condition is widely recognized and is shared by a variety of successful and notable people such as Greg Louganis, NelsonRockefeller, Thomas Edison, Bruce Jenner, Cher, Tom Cruise, and Whoopie Goldberg. Since 1976, Public Law 94-142 has supported the provision of appropriate individualized education programs in public schools at the elementary and secondary levels. Students who went through the educational system before 1976,however, may not have had the benefit of support programs in the schools. The lack of such programs have significantly impacted on the way those students view themselves and on their skill levels. Remediation, instruction on how to learn, training in learning strategy techniques, and the implementation of classroom modifications, along with support and encouragement from parents and teachers, have helped many students become more efficient and effective in the classroom and in other aspects of life. Although a significant number of adults with learning disabilities go quietly about their lives, all will not necessarily be well. For students who either were not identified or for some reason did not receive appropriate intervention struggles with academics, drugs, alcohol, the law, and staying in school all reflect poor self-esteem and can be precursors of a lifelong pattern of difficulties. We now know that children with learning disabilities become adults with learning disabilities. Because some of these individuals re-enter the educational system as adults, instructors, particularly in literacy programs, must recognize that these students' educational needs may require a variety of responsive techniques For those individuals who did not learn adequate coping strategies and did not learn the necessary academic skills in their school years, literacy programs offer a viable opportunity to acquire what they missed. Remedial instruction, combined withmodifications according to learning strengths and weaknesses, can enable persons with learning disabilities to see positive effects from their effortsin the workplace and at home. Top of article What Are Learning Disabilities? Although individuals with learning disabilities usually have average to above average intelligence and the potential for achieving in a wide variety of areasof adult life, they may be characterized as lazy, irresponsible and unmotivated. Generally the term "learning disabilities" refers to a broad spectrum of processing disorders that arise from inaccurate information received through the senses, an inability to remember or integrate information, or difficulty with oral, written, and nonverbal expression. The description used by the Learning Disabilities Association of America (1986) is as follows: "Specific learning disabilities is a chronic condition of presumed neurological origin which selectively interferes with the development, integration, and/or demonstration of verbal and/or nonverbal abilities. Specific learning disabilities exists as a distinct handicapping condition which varies in its manifestations and in degree of severity. Throughout life the condition can affect self-esteem, education, vocation socialization, and/or daily living activities." This description points out that learning disabilities are naturally part ofthe individual and not a set of behaviors that have been acquired. It also points out that no specific area will be affected in every individual; in other words, each individual with learning disabilities has a unique set of learning difficulties and those difficulties will always be present. Individuals, however, can learn to cope with those difficulties. As indicated,learning disabilities affect all aspects of life and can cause problems with self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and independent living skills. As mentioned earlier, a learning disability is indicated by problems in taking in,storing, retrieving or expressing information. As research and experience have shown, learning disabilities are not related to mental retardation in any way. Rather, learning disabilities reflect a discrepancy between an individual's ability and performance levels and the assumption is usually that the individual has at least average intelligence. The measurement of ability and performance, either in formal testing or in the instructional setting, can be particularly frustrating in that results will most likely be inconsistent. That is, in one area, the student will demonstrate high to very highaptitude and achievement, while, in another area, results will indicate below average to very low performance. Top of article Characteristics (Indicators) of Adults with Learning Disabilities Not all individuals who encounter problems learning to read have specificlearning disabilities; however, various researchers (Travis, 1979)document that anywhere from 30% to 80% of those involved in literacy programs display characteristics typical of individuals with learning disabilities. For tutors, the issue is how to determine whether the problems demonstrated by the student come from a lack of instruction or from identifiable learning disabilities. In addition, tutors must consider how best to proceed to encourage development in literacy. Since most instruction in literacy programs is one-on-one or in small group,literacy teachers have a good opportunity to observe behavior and to assess theeffectiveness of the student's learning efforts. The first indicator that the problem may be more complex than a simple lack of instruction is the level of frustration felt by both the instructor and the student. When the instructor has used all of the resources readily available and has been creative in developing new approaches, yet the student still does not make good progress, it is fair to assume that the problem may involve the student's learning processes. Some behaviors initially apparent to instructors of adults identifiedas learning disabled, and usually sustained over time, appear as listed below. It must be noted that not all incidents of these behaviors necessarily indicate a learning disability; neither will all the listed behaviors be apparent in any one individual. Hyperactivity moves constantly/restless talks a lot, frequently with incomplete thoughts appears to be unable to relax displays poor motor coordination appears to be moody Hypoactivity reacts slowly works slowly, sometimes sits and does nothing does not look people in the eye seems unemotional perseverates (stays with a task, even when finished) seems accepting of all situations Attention Problems daydreams seems confused has difficulty concentrating seems bored/uninterested fails to finish lessons/projects makes careless mistakes uses poor work habits/is disorganized is easily distracted by others, by noises, by any activity Impulsivity acts without thinking and is unconcerned about consequences speaks at inappropriate times says one thing and means another does not work well independently does not stay with a task General does not interpret correctly what others say is clumsy misunderstands social cues and nonverbal communication (stands too close to people during conversation, does not know when or how to end a conversation, etc.) exhibits memory problems displays poor decision-making skills displays poor fine motor skills (handwriting, needlework, for example) uses poor social skills (has difficulty relating to others) may confuse left/right, up/down, East/West, etc. Note: Some of the above was adapted from "Was I Misdiagnosed? Thoughts for Mental Health Professionals" by Nonnie Star,CSW. This booklet is can be obtained from LDA's book store. Also in the behavioral area are issues related to time management. Many individuals with learning disabilities have difficulty with being late for work or appointments, procrastinating, and generally just not being awareof the passage of time. These problems can cause a variety of complications on the job as well as in educational settings. Top of article Assessment For the student to gain maximum benefit from literacy efforts and to give tutors more comprehensive information on how to work with each student, assessment for possible learning disabilities may be appropriate. Such assessment can provide full information about the student's school experience, learning and cognitive styles (how a person processes information), and academic strengths and needs. Types of Assessment: Assessment can take many forms. In working with adult literacy students,different types of assessment should be considered. Tutors and literacy directors will need to decide whether formal or informal assessments areappropriate. The student's academic and personal goals should be given careful consideration and purposes for assessment should be clarified before the process is undertaken. Some literacy students want to learn to read for personal satisfaction while others need the skills for career or educational advancement. Formal Assessments Formal assessments, administered by professionals, such as theWoodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery-Revised and the Wechsler AdultIntelligence Scale-Revised, (WAIS-R) can provide information about cognitivestyles and academic strengths and needs. Information gathered from these tests give the instructor a comprehensive viewof how the student learns, which academic skills are strong, and which are weak. For example, information about slow visual-perceptual speed can indicatethat the student will need extra time to perform reading tasks. School Records School records may be available to provide information and insight to facilitate current efforts. To obtain school records, a request must be in writing from the student. Special education folders may contain past psychological and educational evaluation in addition to Individualized Education Plans, while regular cumulative folders usually have information supplied by former teachers and results from routine standardized testing. These materials should be beneficial to the literacy program staff personsin developing appropriate instructional approaches. Informal Assessments For some students a simple instrument such as the AcademicAssessment Instrument for Literacy Students (see Appendix 1) may be helpful in providing anecdotal information (personal accounts) directly from the student. Observations also are part of an informal assessment. The literacy instructor's impressions of how a student works are valuable in designing appropriate instruction and in choosing materials to meet the student's needs. Learning Strengths and Needs In addition to school records, anecdotal information, observations, andformal psychoeducational evaluations, information about learningmodalities can provide direction in choosing instructional techniques and materials. Teachers need to be cautious in selecting instructionalmethods to assure that those chosen reflect the student's strengths andneeds and not the teacher's own preferences and strengths. Theinformation gathered about how the student learns must be taken in itsentirety to develop appropriate techniques. In addition to facilitating the current educational process, this may be helpful to the client inunderstanding past successes or failures in school. Teaching methodswhich fail to capitalize on students' strengths may also fail to beeffective. For example, the use of a phonetic approach for readinginstruction with a student who has difficulty with auditory learning and who does not comprehend sounds appropriately or in thecorrect sequence will prove frustrating to both the tutor and thestudent. Greater success might be achieved by using more multi-sensorymethods such as language experience. General Assessment Information The objective of assessment is to find out how a person learns and howinstruction can be tailored to meet individual needs. An assessment can alsoformally identify someone as having a learning disability. Information aboutFormal assessment can be obtained from resources listed in the Resources section. Those include state Learning Disabilities Association offices, public school systems, state and local Vocational Rehabilitation offices, local colleges and universities, mental health centers, and private psychologists trained in learning disabilities. Some students will need formal assessments as part of their preparation process for General Education Development (GED) testing for a high school equivalency diploma. Documentation of an existing disability willallow the student to obtain testing accommodations such as extended time.Other students may ultimately be interested in attending a postsecondaryinstitution and will need documentation to access services. Having learning disabilities documentation will entitle the student to support services andacademic accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and toemployment accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of1990. Regardless of the final diagnosis, however, helpful information can begarnered from the assessment process. Top of article Learning Styles or Preferences Individual preferences in various ways of learning have been recognized by educators in all types of educational settings. Just as in formal school situations students reflect diverse academic strengths, literacy students also reflect those same variations. Learning styles can be assessed by looking at cognitive factors (how things are perceived and dealt with), environmental factors (what the instructional area is like in terms of light, temperature, furnishings, etc.), affective factors (who is involved in the learning process and how the student feels about those involved), or by looking at a combination of all three. Assessment can be implemented withformal instruments available through test publishers or with informal, tutor-designed instruments and methods. A less formal assessment may simply consist of asking a student how they would go about memorizing a long list of number or words. Those who prefer and work better with auditory learning will repeat the list to themselves orask to have the list read to them, sometimes repeatedly. Those who find visual cues more helpful may study the list simply by looking at it and memorizing either the items or the pattern of the numbers or words. Others may want to copy the list, rearranging the items in some particular way that makes more sense to them. Information gathered about learning styles actually has broader implications for tutors than for students since tutors can manage the learning environment to provide the best learning situation possible. Learning styles concepts and instruments such as the 4MAT System* (McCarthy, 1980) or the C.l.T.E.** (Wisconsin Vocational Studies Center) combine information from the cognitive, environmental, and/or affective areas to provide the specifics that the tutor can use in designing instruction that will meet the needs of the individual student. Student involvement in selecting relevant goals is strongly recommended. Students involved in setting their educational goals and knowledgeable about how theylearn tend to stay in literacy programs long enough to achieve significant progress and tend to maintain more positive outlooks. *Information about 4MAT is available from EXCEL, Inc., 200 W. StationStreet, Barrington, IL 60010. **Information about the C.I.T.E. is available in the Wisconsin VocationalStudies Center publication listed in the references. Top of article Tips for Literacy Providers - InstructionalAccommodations Using all available information, literacy tutors can experiment with a variety of techniques, modifications, and accommodations for each student that capitalize on identified strengths and compensate for weaknesses. Although the following ideas have proven helpful for some students, they may not succeed with a particular student. Realistic, short term goals can keep the student involved and motivated. As the student reaches each goal, positive reinforcement is particularly important. Tutors are urged to be creative and to explore their own ideas in developing instruction for their students. GENERAL TECHNIQUES present information in small manageable steps structure activities provide frequent feedback prepare handouts in typewritten form teach new materials in concrete ways (give examples) teach organizational skills such as color coding and filing relate new material to student's everyday life discuss and study new vocabulary words before they appear in the instructional material experiment with the use of large print use graph paper to help with letter spacing in writing provide outlines for lessons on new material prepare students for changes in routines teach students to proofread for each other rephrase questions both during discussions and on exams make frequent eye contact set up instructional space away from distractions (away from the door, windows, or heating/air conditioning units) encourage student questions restate information on test questions in a variety of ways use a sheet of colored transparency material to change the contrast between ink and paper on duplicated materials teach and encourage the use of mnemonics (devices for memorizing information) be well prepared for each session use untimed tests use multiple choice tests TO CAPITALIZE ON VISUAL STRENGTHS use graphics to reinforce learning in math, encourage the use of a number line use color coding write directions for assignments use a "highlighter" to call attention to key words or phrases, especially during testing teach the use of alternative notetaking systems such as outlining, graphing, flow charting, and diagramming form a mental picture of words or facts to be memorized TO CAPITALIZE ON AUDITORY STRENGTHS: use Books on Tape from Recordings for the Blind and/or Talking Books from state libraries for the blind (see resource list) encourage students to read along with taped texts use interactive activities during class time use oral testing use oral as well as written directions let students read together aloud ask students to repeat directions orally have students read aloud or subvocalize (form the words without saying them out loud) speak in even, measured tones use music and rhythms to reinforce learning encourage students to read first drafts of written work aloud encourage students to tape "write" first drafts and/or tape test answers TO CAPITALIZE ON KINESTHETIC (relating to movement) AND TACTILE(relating to touch) STRENGTHS: use hands-on activities use simulation and board games pair students to work together on assignments allow for frequent breaks from studying change activities frequently touch students on the arm or shoulder to re-focus attention trace letters and words to learn spelling use the computer (i.e. word processing spell checker) memorize or drill for rote learning while walking or exercising provide opportunities for touching and handling instructional materials manipulatives) use a calculator or abacus in math use index cards rather than notebooks for notetaking Note: These listings are adapted in part from Scheiber,B., & Talpers, J.

For some reason, school did not provide the needed skills, yet they now are willing to re-enter an academic setting to learn to read and write. Literacy program staff persons and volunteers are in a unique position to provide support and to facilitate the learning process. Perseverance on the part of the student, positive reinforcement from the tutor, and patience on the parts of both are major factors in making the literacy effort successful. The critical factor, however, is the literacy tutor. The expertise, enthusiasm, dedication, and patience demonstrated by literacy tutors are invaluable. Whether the expertise be from formal training or from innate skills and a desire to work with others, literacy tutors are making the difference for an increasing number of adults all over the country. Increasing literacy levels for Americans is a reasonable goal and literacytutors are well on the way to achieving that goal.

Top of article Appendix 2 List of Common Approaches to Teaching Reading in Literacy Programs This list of instructional approaches for teaching reading shouldserve only as a guide in choosing a teaching process for adults withlearning disabilities in literacy programs. It is strongly recommendedthat literacy program personnel consult with reading professionals tochoose instructional approaches that will meet the needs of the students. Diagnostic/Prescriptive Approach - involves doing diagnostic testing to determine specific areas of need and then teaching directly to address those needs. Eclectic Approach - describes choices made among a variety of programs andapproaches combined to provide a rich, varied instructional design. Individualized Reading Approach - allows the reader to select reading materials and to proceed at an individual pace. Language Experience - utilizes the language that the student is alreadyusing to develop reading, writing and speaking skills Laubach Method - relies heavily on phonetic language. Whole Language Methods - focuses on learning language through all thesenses. from "A Learning Disabilities Digest for Literacy Providers" Learning Disabilities Association of America, 1991 Top of article | Pamphlets | Table of Contents | LDA Home PageWT02-B24-97IA089-000954-B010-124http://www.ldanatl.org:80/articles/eric/ParentsRights.html 206.86.190.251 19970109184852 text/html 11279HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Thu, 09 Jan 1997 18:48:55 GMTServer: BESTWWWD/1.0MIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 11096Last-modified: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 17:44:44 GMT Rights and Responsibilities of Parents Rights and Responsibilities of Parents of Children withDisabilities What are your rights, as a parent, in the special educationprocess? Public Law 101-476 (IDEA) clearly defines the rights of childrenwith disabilities and their parents. A fundamental provision of thelaw is the right of parents to participate in the educationaldecision-making process. This includes the right to: Free appropriate public education for your child. Free means at no cost to you as parents. Appropriate means meeting the unique educational needs of your child. Be notified whenever the school wishes to evaluate your child, wants to change your child's educational placement, or refuses your request for an evaluation or a change in placement. Initiate an evaluation if you think your child needs special education or related services. Informed consent. Informed consent means you understand and agree in writing to the evaluation and educational program decisions for your child. Your consent is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time. Obtain an independent evaluation if you disagree with the outcome of the school's evaluation. Request a reevaluation if you suspect your child's present educational placement is no longer appropriate. The school must reevaluate your child at least every 3 years, but your child's educational program must be reviewed at least once during each calendar year. Have your child tested in the language he or she knows best. For example, if your child's primary language is Spanish, this is the language in which he or she must be tested. Also, students who are deaf have the right to an interpreter during the testing. Review all of your child's records. You may obtain copies of these records, but the school may charge you a reasonable fee for making copies. Only you, as parents, and those persons directly involved in the education of your child will be permitted access to personal records. If you feel that any of the information in your child's records is inaccurate or misleading or violates the privacy or other rights of your child, you may request that the information be changed. If the school refuses your request, you then have the right to request a hearing in order to challenge the questionable information in your child's records. Be fully informed by the school of all rights that are provided to you under the law. Participate in the development of your child's individualized education program (IEP), or, in the case of a child under school age, the development of an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). The school must make every possible effort to notify you of the IEP or IFSP meeting and then arrange it at a time and a place that is convenient for you. Remember, your child's IEP or IFSP cannot be implemented without your written consent. Have your child educated in the least restrictive school setting possible. Every effort should be made to develop an educational program that will provide the greatest amount of contact with children who are not disabled. Request a due process hearing to resolve differences with the school that could not be resolved informally. What are your responsibilities, as a parent, in the specialEducation process? Parental responsibilities to ensure that a child's rights are beingprotected are less clearly defined than are parental rights. Theseresponsibilities vary considerably depending on the nature of thechild's disabling condition and other factors. In accepting theseresponsibilities, some of the following suggestions may be helpful: Develop a partnership with the school or agency. You are now an important member of the team. Share relevant information about your child's education and development. Your observations and suggestions can be a valuable resource to aid your child's progress. Ask for clarification of any aspect of the program that is unclear to you. Educational and medical terms can be confusing, so do not hesitate to ask. Make sure you understand the program specified on the IEP or IFSP before agreeing to it or signing it. Ask yourself if what is planned corresponds with your knowledge of your child's needs. Make sure your child is included in the regular school activities program. Do not forget nonacademic areas such as lunch and recess and other areas such as art, music, and physical education. Learn as much as you can about your rights and the rights of your child. Ask the school to explain these rights as well as the policies and regulations in effect in your district and state before you agree to a special education program for your child. Monitor your child's progress. If your child is not progressing, discuss it with the teacher and determine whether the program should be modified. As a parent, you can initiate changes in your child's educational program. Discuss with the school or agency any problems that may occur with your child's assessment, placement, or educational program. It is best to try to resolve these problems directly with the agency, school, or district. In some situations, you may be uncertain as to which direction you should take to resolve a problem. Most states have protection and advocacy agencies that can provide you with the guidance you need to pursue your case. Keep records. There may be many questions and comments about your child that you will want to discuss, as well as meetings and phone conversations you will want to remember. It is easy to forget information useful to your child's development and education if it is not written down. Join a parent organization. In addition to the opportunity to share knowledge, experiences, and support, a parent group can be an effective force on behalf of your child. Many times parents find that as a group they have the power to bring about needed changes to strengthen and broaden special services. As the parent of a child with a disability, what can you offer theIEP or IFSP process? In the final analysis, parents of children with disabilities shouldbe involved in the process as much as they want to be and as muchas they can be. Varying degrees of involvement are possible. Thefollowing are suggestions for ways that parents can becomeinvolved: Before attending an IEP or IFSP meeting, make a list of things you want your child to learn. Discuss any differences between your list and the school's or agency's list. Take notes about aspects of your child's behavior that could interfere with the learning process. Describe the methods you have found to be successful in dealing with these behaviors. Bring any information the school or agency may not already have to the IEP or IFSP meeting. Examples include copies of medical records, past school records, or test or medical evaluation results. Remember, reports do not say all there is to say about a child. You can add real-life examples to demonstrate your child's ability in certain areas. Find out what related services are being provided. Besides your child's teacher, many other specialists and professionals may have contact with your child through provision of related services. Ask each professional to describe the kind of service he or she will be providing and what growth you might expect to see as a result of these services. Ask what you can do at home to support the program. Many skills the child learns at school can also be used at home. Ask to meet with the teacher when your child is learning a new skill that could be practiced at home. Make sure the goals and objectives on the IEP or IFSP are specific. This will ensure that everyone teaching your child is working toward the same goals. Ask questions to make sure that you understand and agree with each of the goals and objectives before signing the IEP or IFSP. Periodically, ask for a report on your child's progress. After the meeting is over, your job as a parent is not finished. You should follow your child's progress throughout the year. Regard your child's education as a cooperative effort. If at any point you and the school cannot reach an agreement over your child's educational and developmental needs, ask to have another meeting. This would allow time for you and the school or agency to gather more information and data. If after a second meeting there is still a conflict over your child's program, you should ask for a state mediator or a due process hearing. What resources are available to help you? Local and state education agencies have information to help guideyou through the special education process. Since the specificcriteria and procedures used by school districts vary, it isimportant to familiarize yourself with the information theyprovide. You will find your local director of special education andhis or her staff helpful in accessing such information and guidingyou through the process. Additional resources are available from national organizations.Some of them will also be able to direct you to local and statechapters that can provide more locally based support. Almost all ofthe states now have federally supported parent information andtraining centers.

They must develop an appreciation of the pleasures of written language and of the many ways language is useful. Develop Awareness of Printed Language Children need to develop a basic sense of what print looks like and how it works. They must learn how to handle a book, which way to turn the pages, and that the printed words -- not the pictures -- tells the story when you read. Children should be taught that words are all around them-in newspapers, mail, billboards, signs, and labels -- and have many different and valuable purposes. Learn the Alphabet Comfortable and early familiarity with letters is critical for learning to read. Children should learn the names of letters and to recognize and form their corresponding shapes. Understand the Relation of Letters and Words Children need to learn that printed words are made up of ordered strings of letters, left to right. They should be helped to understand that when the combination or order of letters is changed, the word that is spelled also changes. Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, andPhonemes The ability to think about words as a sequence of phonemes is essential to learning to read an alphabetic language. Children should become aware of the building blocks of spoken language. They need to understand that sentences are made up of strings of separate words. They should become comfortable in hearingand creating rhymes. They should be led to play with the sounds of language until they can pull words apart into syllables, and pull syllables into individual phonemes.* Learn Letter Sounds Given a comfortable familiarity with letters and an awareness of the sounds of phonemes, children are ready to learn about letter-sound correspondence. The most important goal at this first stage is to help children understand that the logic of the alphabetic writing system is built on these correspondences. Sound Out New Words As children learn specific letter-sound correspondences, they should be challenged to use this knowledge to sound out new words in reading and writing.Making a habit of sounding out unfamiliar words contributes strongly to readinggrowth, not just for beginners, but for all readers. Children need to understand that sounding out new words can actually be a strategy for helping them unlock pronunciations of words they have never seen before, and can make what they are reading understandable. Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily The ability to read with fluency and comprehension depends on recognizing most words almost instantly and effortlessly. Once the framework for a new word or spelling has been laid, through sounding and blending, the key to recognizing it quickly and easily is practice. The most useful practice is reading and rereading of meaningful text made up of words the child has been taught to sound out. For beginners, such reading helps most if it is relatively easy. As a rule of thumb, no more than one in 20 words should cause trouble. Know Spelling Patterns As children become reasonably capable of sounding out words in reading and spelling, it is important that they notice the similarities in their spellings.Awareness of spelling patterns that recur across words hastens progress in reading and writing, and weak knowledge of spelling is an impediment to mature readers. Learn to Read Reflectively Although the ability to sound out words is essential for learning to read, it is not enough. Written language is not just speech written down. Instead, text brings new vocabulary, new language patterns, new thoughts, and new modes of thinking. To enjoy and profit from reading, children must also learn to take the time to reflect on these aspects of text. _______________________ *A phoneme is the smallest functional unit of speech. (The word "cat"contains three phonemes: the /k/, /a/, and /t/ sounds. Letters oftenrepresent more than one phoneme -- the a in "cat" is a differentsound than the a in "cake" -- and sometimes a single letter willcontain more than one phoneme. For example, the word "ox" has two lettersbut three phonemes, /o/, /k/ and /s/). Fluent readers learn to recognize these discrete sounds of spoken words quickly, accurately, and automatically. Phonemic awareness is the foundation on which all other reading skills are built.

Research has shown that enjoying books with a child for even a few minutesa day can make a measurable difference in the acquisition of basic reading skills, and that everyday activities--such as a trip to the grocery store--can be turned into enjoyable learning experiences. Following is a list of ways in which parents can encourage the development of the skills needed by children in order for them to become good readers. Create Appreciation of the Written Word Find time to read aloud with your child every day. Typically,parents play an important role in developing this skill by reading to children and showing how important reading is to their daily life. Lap time withpicture books and stories can strongly motivate your child to enjoy reading. Try to make these books available for your children to explore and enjoyon their own as well. Develop Awareness of Printed Language Teach about books. When reading aloud to your child, let yourchild open the book and turn the pages. Point to the words as you read.Draw attention to repeated phrases, inviting your child to join in each time they occur. Point out letters and words that you run across in daily life. Make an obvious effort to read aloud traffic signs, billboards, notices,labels on packages, maps, and phone numbers. Make outings a way to encourage reading by showing your child how printed words relate to daily living. Learn the Alphabet Play alphabet games. Sing the alphabet song to help your childlearn letters as you play with alphabet books, blocks, and magnetic letters. Recite letters as you go up and down stairs or give pushes on a swing.A-B-C, dot-to-dot and letter-play workbooks, games, and puzzles are available at most toy stores. Many engaging computer games are designed for teachingchildren letters. Make sure these toys are available even when you are unable toplay along. Watch "Sesame Street" with your child. Show the child how tosing along, answer the riddles, and engage actively in its fun. Make writing materials available to your child and encourage theiruse. Help your child learn to write his/her name and other important words or phrases. Gradually, help the child learn to write more and moreletters. At first, most children find it easier to write uppercase letters. Understand the Relation of Letters and Words Teach your child to spell a few special words, such as his/her name,"stop", or "exit."Challenge the child to read these words every place they are seen. Draw attention to these and other frequently occurring words as you read bookswith your child. Challenge the child to read these words as they arise orto search them out on a page. Play word-building games with letter tilesor magnetic letters. Have the child build strings of letters for you toread. Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables and Phonemes Sing songs and read rhyming books. Sing the alphabet with yourchild, and teach your child songs that emphasize rhyme and alliteration, such as "Willaby Wallaby Woo" and "Down By the Sea." Emphasize the sounds asyou sing. Play rhyming games and clap out names. Jumble thewording or word order of familiar poems and challenge your child to detect the error. Talk like a robot, syllable by syllable. Play word games. Challenge your child to play with words. Forexample, ask your child to think of words that rhyme with "bat" or begin with/m/. What would be left if you took the /k/ sound out of ''cat"? What wouldyou have if you put these sounds together: /p/ and ickle; /m/ and ilk;and /s/, /a/, and /t/. Which of these words starts with a different sound-- "bag", "candy", "bike"? Do "boat" and "baby" start with the same sound? Learn Letter Sounds Sound out letters.Point out other words that begin with the same letter as your child'sname, drawing attention to the similarities of the beginning sound. Use alphabet books, computer games, or car games such as, "I'm thinking ofsomething that starts with /b/" to engage the child in alliterative andletter-sound play. If you have a book that lends itself to alliterationand rhyme, such as a Dr. Seuss book, sound out rhyming words as you reador challenge the child to do so for you. Play word games that connectsounds with syllables and words. For example: If this spells "cat, how do you spell "hat"? Sound Out New Words Point out new words. As you encounter them, say the sound whiletouching each letter in a new word. For example, say "s-u-n" and then blendsounds to create the word. In practicing new words, use predictable words withcommon sounds and spellings, like "fun" or "sat" instead of "night" or "saw." If you encounter words with unknown meanings or with complex spellings,encourage your child to try to sound out the words. However, if too many wordsrequire this kind of attention and effort, it is best to find an easier book. Play spelling games with your childAfter your child begins pronouncing words, encourage spelling by saying eachsound in the words and then writing the letter that goes with the sound. Encourage your child to spell. After your child has learned topronounce words, have the child say each sound. Independent writingEncourage your child to use inventive or independent spelling. At this stage, the child will tend to omit letters and confuse letter names with lettersounds, producing such spellings as LFNT for elephant, BN for bean, andFARE for fairy. Use correction wisely. You should be most concerned aboutis the child's sensitivity to the sounds that need to be represented. Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily Help your children to read easy, enjoyable stories as often as possible.It is likely that your child will enjoy reading more and learn more fromreading if you sit together, taking turns reading and encouraging discussion.In the beginning invite the child to read well-chosen words. Gradually, as thechild becomes able, take turns with sentences, speakers, paragraphs, and pages.At the end of each section or story revisit those words that caused trouble.Rereading the entire story over several days, and again weeks later, isa powerful way to reinforce this learning. Know Spelling Patterns Now it becomes useful to point out the similarities between words suchas will, fall, and hill or light, night, and sight. This is also the time tohelp your child learn the correct spelling of the words he/she writes. Learn to Read Reflectively Pause for discussions as you read. As you read stories to and withyour child, stop frequently to discuss their language, content, andrelevance to real life and other knowledge Pause to explore the meanings of new words, using them in other sentences and contrasting what they meanwith words that have similar meanings. Make an effort to revisit new words and concepts later, when the book has been put aside. When reading stories, pause to discuss the various characters, problems, events in the story,and invite your child to think about how the problems might be solved orto wonder about what might happen next. When resuming a story, ask yourchild to review what has happened so hr, drawing attention to looming mysteries and unresolved conflicts In reading expository text, invite the child to marvel at the creatures or events described and to wonder aboutdetails or connections not mentioned by the text. Above all: Read, read, and re-read. Glossary Alphabetic awareness - Knowledge of the letters of the alphabet coupled with the understanding that the alphabet represents the sounds ofthe spoken language. Alphabetic understanding - The understanding that, in principle, theleft-to-right spelling of printed words represents their phonemes from first to last. Background knowledge - All children bring some level ofbackground knowledge to beginning reading (e.g., how to hold a book, knowledge of words, knowledge of the world). Priming this backgroundknowledge--relating new knowledge so that which is alreadyknown--helps children draw on their experiences as a means of understanding new information. When sufficient background knowledge does not exist, itwill be necessary to adjust instruction accordingly. Fluency - The ease with which students translate print to speech. Phonemes - The elementary speech sounds represented by the letters of a perfect alphabet. In the English alphabet, which is not perfect, somephonemes are represented by combinations of letters (e.g., /th/, /sh/),and some letters represent more than one phoneme (e.g., c, g, a, e, i, o, u). Phonemic awareness - The awareness that spoken words or syllables can be thought of as a sequence of phonemes. Phonemic awareness is asub-category of phonological awareness. Phonological awareness - The ability to attend to the phonological or sound structure of language as distinct from its meaning. Types ofphonological awareness include word awareness, syllable awareness, rhyme awareness, and phonemic awareness. Phonological decoding - Translating the letters or spelling patternsof a written word into speech patterns in order to identify the word andto gain access to its meaning. Phonological encoding - Writing a letter or word based on its sounds. Phonological recoding - Translating the spelling of written words into the speech sounds they represent. Print awareness (orthographic awareness) - Awareness of how print works and how it looks. Print is made up of letters, the letterscorrespond to sounds and words, and text is read from left to right acrossthe page.

Understanding the organization and meaning of text andinstruction in both phonics and literature is essential to helpingyoung children read. By understanding the prerequisite skills forreading, teachers can build a solid foundation for their students tolearn and succeed in school. Create Appreciation of the Written Word Share stories with children and invite them to explore a story'smagic. Share informational texts and invite children to wonder about the newideas presented. Take every opportunity to point out the ways in which reading isessential to the communications of everyday life (e.g., on labels,instructions, and signs). Develop Awareness of Printed Language and the Writing System Make sure students know how books are organized. They should be taught the basics about books-that they are read from left to right and top to bottom, that print may be accompanied by pictures or graphics, that the pages are numbered, and that the purpose of reading is to gain meaning from the text and understand ideas that words convey. Read to children from books with easy-to-read large print. Use stories that have predictable words in the text. Use "big books" to help children notice and learn to recognize words that occur frequently, such as a, the, is, was, and you. Teach the Alphabet A strong predictor of the ease with which a child learns to read is his or her farniliarity with letters of the alphabet. This familiarity is a critical building block for learning to read. It is important to go beyond knowing the names of letters. Studentsmust also develop a sense of the purpose of letters. Help them noticethe letters in the print that surrounds them and that you share withthem every day. Engage the students in activities that will help them learn torecognize letters visually. Help students learn to form the letters and encourage them toembellish their work with their names and with other first attempts atwriting. Develop the Students' Phonological Awareness In listening and speaking, we pay attention to the meaning oflanguage rather than to its sound. To learn to read, however, studentsmust be taught to attend to the sounds, or phonology, of language. Thisis necessary for them to understand how speech is represented by print.Children with learning disabilities need special help in learning todevelop such phonological awareness. Model and demonstrate how to break short sentences into individualwords. For example, use the sentence "Frogs eat bugs," and demonstratewith chips, cards, or other manipulatives how the sentence is made upof three words and how the order of the words matters. Usingmanipulatives to make sentences, play with each word and put it inorder. Develop students awareness of the sounds of individual words byasking them to clap out syllables and to listen for and generaterhymes. Once children are comfortable in playing games with words,syllables, and rhymes, move onto phonemic awareness. Develop Phonemic Awareness Phonemic awareness refers to a understanding that words andsyllables are comprised of a sequence of elementary speech sounds Thisunderstanding is essential to learning to read an alphabetic language.The majority of children with reading disabilities fail to grasp thisidea. In teaching phonemic awareness, the focus of all activities shouldbe on the sounds of words, not on letters or spellings. Use strategies that make phonemes prominent in children's attentionand perception. For example, model specific sounds, such as /s/ in theword sat, and ask children to produce each sound in isolation and inmany different words until they are comfortable with the sound andunderstand its nature. Begin with simple words and simple challenges, e.g., listen forinitial /s/ in sat, sit, sip, and sad ... or for long /e/ in me, see,bee... Teach students to blend phonemes into words. Begin by identifyingjust one phoneme, e.g., /m/-ilk, /s/-at, working gradually towardblending all the phonemes in words, e.g., /s/-/a/-/t/. Teach students to identify the separate phonemes within words,e.g., what is the first sound of soup? What is the last sound of kiss?Beginning phonemes are easier to identify than final phonemes. Once students are comfortable listening for individual phonemes,teach them to break up words, into component sounds, e.g.,/m/-/oo/-/sl= "moose". Create a sequence of segmenting and blending activities to helpstudents develop an understanding of the relationship between sounds inwords. Provide children with more support when first teaching a task. Forexample, model a sound or strategy for making the sound, and have thechildren use the strategy to produce the sound. Model and practiceseveral examples. Prompt the children to use the strategy during guidedpractice, and gradually add more examples. As the students master theseskills, provide less teacher-directed instruction and more practice andchallenge. Make teaching phonological awareness a top priority. Opportunitiesto engage in phonological awareness activities should be plentiful,frequent, brief, and fun. Phonemic awareness is essential for learning to read, but it is notenough by itself. It must be coupled with instruction and practice inlearning the relationship between letters and sounds. Teach the Relation of Sounds and Letters Students should learn the letters of the alphabet and discriminateeach letter from the other, because each stands for one or more of thesounds that occur in spoken words. When presenting each letter, model its corresponding sound and havechildren produce the sound themselves. For children with learningdisabilities, the teaching activities must be explicit and unambiguous. At first, teach and work with only a few letter-soundcorrespondences that have high utility in many words (e.g., /m/ in man,mad, him, and ham). Postpone teaching less frequently occurring lettersuntil students have a firm understanding of how left-to-right spellingsrepresent first-to-last sounds (alphabetic understanding). Teach Children How to Sound Out Words After students have mastered a few letter-sound correspondences,teach them to decode words or sound them out. Begin with small,familiar words Teach the children to sound out the letters, left toright, and blend them together, searching for the word in memory. Model sounding out the word, blending the sounds together andsaying the word The ability to sound out new words allows children toidentify and learn new words on their own. Give children stories containing words that reflect theletter-sound patterns that have been taught, and encourage them tosound out words whenever they are uncertain. Help children learn spelling conventions, such as the use of final/e/'s to mark long vowels, by comparing and contrasting lots ofexamples. Teach Children to Spell Words Teach children to spell words by sounding their letters one by one.Model the sounding and spelling process for children as they spell. Begin with short words children can sound out, because these wordsfollow regular spelling conventions, e.g., cap, bat, and sit instead ofcape, bait or sight. Begin with simple words that do not contain consonant blends, e.g., ham and pan instead of slam and plan. Encourage students to use spelling knowledge and strategiesregularly in their own writing. Introduce spelling conventions systematically. Begin with wordsthat exemplify the most frequent and basic conventions, and providesupport and practice to help students generalize from these words toothers. The goal is to help them see the spelling conventions in thewords. Use words in which letter-sound correspondence represent their mostcommon sounds (e.g., get instead of gem). Develop a sequence and schedule of opportunities that allowchildren to apply and develop facility with sounds and words at theirown pace. Specify what skills to assess and when to assess them so thatyou will know when to move on. Take into account each student'sbackground knowledge and pace in moving from sounding out to blendingwords to reading connected text. Help Children Develop Fluent, Reflective Reading Help children learn to read fluently by requiring them to read newstories and reread old stories every day. Help children extend their experience with the words, language, andideas in books by interactively reading harder texts with them and tothem every day. Relate information in books to other events of interest tochildren, such as holidays, pets, siblings, and games. Engage childrenin discussion of the topics. In both stories and informational texts, encourage wondering. Forexample, "I wonder what Pooh will do now?" "How do you think the fatherfeels ?" or "I wonder what frogs do in the winter? Do you think that'sa problem? Why?" Model comprehension strategies and provide students with guidedassistance. Point out how titles and headings tell what a book is about. Help students identify the main ideas presented in the text, aswell as the supporting detail. Graphics help to reveal main ideas, andthe relationship between text and graphics helps students understandwhat they are reading. Point out unfamiliar words and explore their meaning. Revisit thesewords frequently and encourage students to use them in their ownconversations. Show children how to analyze contextual dues to figure out themeaning of an unfamiliar word. Research shows that most vocabularygrowth comes from learning new words in reading.

She had justcompleted her first IEP meeting as the "meeting facilitator." All thatpractice on the Self-Advocacy Strategy[1] with Mr. Hart and the otherstudents in her class had really paid off. She had been really scared inpractice during her turn as the facilitator but watching the other studentsas each one took turns as facilitator had helped. The videotapes of thepractice sessions had been fun to watch. Everyone had laughed at Jeffrey when he put on glasses and carried Mr. Hart's briefcase for his role as theschool psychologist. Being in charge of the meeting for "real" had been REALLY scary at first.Marianne felt better having her folder and notes with her so she could followthe agenda and share what she thought everyone needed to know about her goalsand how she learns best. To begin the meeting, Mr. Hart asked Marianne if shewould share information from the inventory she had completed. Marianne hadshared what she had written down about her reading and writing skills, whatworked for her and what didn't, and the learning strategies she wanted tolearn during the year. Since she had learned the Sentence Writing Strategylast year, she said she wanted to learn the Paragraph Writing Strategy thisyear. Marianne shared how well the Sentence Writing Strategy had worked forher in English and how excited she was to begin learning more strategies. Shealso said she wanted to learn the FIRST-Letter Mnemonic and Test TakingStrategies this year. Mr. Bergman asked Marianne to describe the SentenceWriting Strategy, and, when she had done that, suggested she use it inwriting the reports required for his science class. Marianne thought Mrs. Hazelwood, the school counselor, had been really nicewhen she reminded the psychologist that "the team needed to hear fromMarianne about her career interests first" and not just from her parents.Marianne thought she was going to die when her mother started to talk aboutall the family's relatives who were in health occupations when Marianne saidthat was her long term career goal, but the "eye contact" Marianne made with her mother seemed to help cut that short. Marianne was glad when the meeting was finally over, but was surprised thatso much time had gone by. It seemed to be over very quickly. Everyone seemedto be excited about the plan they had made for the year. Marianne was alittle embarrassed that her mother had tears in her eyes when she shook handswith the teachers and the principal at the end of the meeting, but she guessedthat her mother was proud that it had gone so well, at least that was whatboth her mother and father kept saying. Mr. Emerson, the principal, saidhe was "really impressed" with how well Marianne had done as facilitator. Being facilitator was usually his job, and he said that Marianne had done "as well as he had ever done" even though this was her first time in that role. She had been concerned before the meeting that the adults would ignore what she had to say and pretend that she wasn't there like they did when she went to the IEP meeting in fifth grade, but that didn't happen, and she was glad. In fact, Mr. Hart had written down almost everything she said just the way she said it on the plan which made her feel good. Mr. Bergman, the scienceteacher, had winked at her when he shook her hand after the meeting andwhispered, "Nice job, Marianne!" The Purposes of Learning Strategies Instruction For students with learning disabilities, like Marianne, participating in planning their own educational experiences can be a critical element in their journey to become independent learners. Another critical element is thelearning strategy instruction they receive since such instruction offers new ways to succeeding in general education courses. First, it provides them witha validated means of being efficient, effective, and ultimately independent as learners. Second, it offers long-term benefits of learningto think and act "strategically'' that can continue through post secondarytraining experiences and on into adulthood as individuals are faced with newand ever more complex problems to solve. Third, it offers students a growingsense of independence and control over their own learning processes. Relatedto this last factor is the increased emphasis that a learning strategy instructional approach places on students to assume greater amounts of personal responsibility during the middle and junior high school years. This is seen as especially important given that many students with learning disabilities possess poor organizational skills and thus they often arrive atmiddle junior high) school ill-prepared to act responsibly. Acting responsibly covers not only getting to school class on time, keeping track of books and assignments, knowing the dates of upcoming assignments and tests, and taking home the necessary materials for information to enable them to complete assignments properly. In short, when the instructional emphasis shifts to teaching students how to approach tasks strategically, changes can be notedin the degree to which students act responsibly. If you think this sounds too good to be true, think again. Thousands ofstudents with learning disabilities have been successfully learning to uselearning strategies and to become independent learners in schools all acrossthe country. In the sections that follow, what strategies are, the rationalebehind strategy instruction, how strategies are taught, types of learningstrategies, an example of a student's journey with regard to learningstrategies over several years time. the evidence that supports use ofstrategies with students who have learning disabilities or those who areat-risk for school failure, and suggestions for putting strategy instructionin place will be described. By now, you are probably wanting a description of what learning strategiesare. Strategies are tools that students can use to approach tasks in contentclasses or other learning situations. They aren't tools in the sense that awrench or a hammer are tools, but they are helpful tools for learning andsolving problems. A strategy is the way a person thinks and acts whencompleting a learning task like getting information out of a textbookchapter or studying for a test. The significance to the student of having aset of learning tools for fulfilling the demands of a classroom situationcannot be overstated. With learning strategies, students can utilize skills tomaster the information that is being taught in science or social studies orlanguage arts classes, and, most importantly, to do this on their own. Whenstudents use the skills they have learned in a strategic manner, they becomeindependent as learners. An example of a student's use of a learning strategyin the general education setting may be helpful. Dana read the question printed in her social studies book, "What are the twomajor industries in our state?" She knew the answer to this question. Dana'sseventh grade teacher, Mrs. Peterson, had reminded the class to use completesentences in writing their answers. Dana closed her eyes and thought throughthe steps in the Sentence Writing Strategy. "PENS" is the memory device sheused to recall the steps because each of the letters in "PENS" stands for astep in the strategy. She said to herself, "'P' stands for 'Pick a formula,'"and looked at her card and chose the second simple sentence option of the fourlisted on the card: "S S V." She thought to herself, "That would be the bestchoice since the answer to this question has two subjects." Quietly toherself she said the second step in the strategy, "E stands for explore wordsto fit the formula. " She thought to herself, "I want to write this sentenceabout the two most important industries in this state, so I should use thewords 'manufacturing and agriculture' as my subjects. I want to use 'are' asthe verb. 'Are' is not an action verb, but a linking verb," she remindedherself. "The rest of the sentence will be words from the question," shethought. "That will be easy!" Next, Dana instructed herself to do the thirdstep in the strategy, "Note the words." Dana wrote the words she had chosenfor the sentence on her paper: "Manufacturing and agriculture are the two most important industries in our state." She thought about step four in thestrategy: the "S" step in "PENS," called "Search for the Verbs and Subjects."Dana knew that she was improving in her ability to identify subjects andverbs. She read her sentence again to make sure she knew which word was theverb and to check whether her sentence fit the formula she had chosen. Mrs. Peterson stopped by Dana's desk to ask "How is the strategy working foryou, Dana?" "Great," was Dana's reply as she showed Mrs. Peterson the fouranswers she had written on her paper. "Those are very good sentences, Dana. You are doing an excellent Job using'PENS!' The strategy seems to be working well for you," Mrs. Peterson statedand moved on to answer another student's question. Many people ask, "How is learning strategy instruction different from otherinterventions that may be used for students with disabilities?" One differenceis that each strategy includes a very explicit set of steps for completing aclassroom task. Thus, students are taught how to complete particular tasks in successful ways. Instruction in the use of learning strategies also requires intense practice sessions until students have mastered the strategy. Students need to become highly engaged in the task (e.g., reading a section of a chapter in science) to the extent that they are not only thinking about the task, but also about how they are responding to it. This requires a higher level of thinking than students are often asked to engage in and will seem strange to them at first. It also requires somebalancing or shifting of focus back and forth on the students' partbecause thinking about both the task and how one is thinking about it atthe same time is almost impossible. This process of shifting focus, called "strategic thinking," gives studentsan important problem-solving skill that can be adapted to lots of differentuses. An example may be helpful. If you've ever been in a situation and foundyourself getting frustrated, then a little angry, and have stopped to tellyourself, "Hold it. Take a deep breath and count to ten! How can I thinkabout what is happening here in another way? Instead of getting angry, maybeI should...," in an effort to control yourself from getting angrier and toget yourself to proceed productively, in that moment you were using strategicthinking. Strategic thinking is thinking about the situation you find yourselfin, looking at your options for dealing with the demands in the situation, andmaking a decision about what may be your best option. In learning situations,strategic learners think about what they've been asked to do, think about thedifferent ways they might do the task at hand, and select what they considerto be the best approach. In work or social situations, the same kinds ofstrategic thinking apply. Learning strategy instruction gives the student aprocess for strategic thinking AND a set of options, the strategies, fromwhich to choose the best approach given the demands of the situation.Students who master learning strategies have a whole box of "tools" at theircommand as they approach new tasks. As you may be able to imagine by now, the process of learning to usestrategies does not happen overnight. Another dimension that characterizesstrategy instruction is that it may take longer than other interventions. Thedisadvantage is the amount of time required; the advantage is thatstrategic thinking skills are lifetime skills. They are not a "quick fix" toget through a test on Friday. Instead, strategies require a longer timeinvestment with a much bigger pay-off down the road. Strategic thinkers are better students, better workers, and better decision makers. While strategies aren't the solution to every learning problem, they doprovide an important solution to a problem that is common to many adolescentswith learning disabilities: these students typically will have difficultiessucceeding in general education courses. Any student may benefit from use ofstrategies, but students with learning disabilities or other at-risk learnersbenefit especially from using them. These students, like the ones in thefollowing examples, typically have inefficient learning patterns. Greg has a great deal of difficulty keeping himself and his assignmentsorganized. Though his eighth grade teachers and his parents remind him often,he can't seem to stay organized for more than about three hours at a time. Heoften loses something important that he really needs for a particular class.He rarely remembers what he needs to do for homework or when the next test iscoming up. To this point, both Greg and the adults in his life have spentamazing amounts of time trying to keep him organized, though nothing seems tohave worked for more than a day or two. Sarah spends long hours preparing for tests. Sarah and her mother often spendfour or five hours preparing the night before a test, and Sarah and Mrs.Shanley, the resource room teacher, usually spend a couple of hours studyingthe day before. Nevertheless, Sarah often receives a poor grade on the test,not because she doesn't know the information, but because she becomes anxiousin the testing situation in the classroom and sometimes puts her answers inthe wrong places, doesn't write an answer, or doesn't finish the test. Jose struggles with writing tasks. He writes very slowly, and the poorlyorganized paragraphs that result are not what he had in mind to say. Hisideas become all jumbled as he attempts to write them down, and sometimes theparagraphs do not make sense when he is finished. Learning strategy instruction might be an appropriate solution for each ofthese student's learning difficulties. Their use of learning strategies mayenable them to be more efficient and effective learners. Strategies may alsoassist students in becoming independent learners. Independence is importantfor success as an adult. For example, in the case of Greg, the teacher mightwant to teach him The PROJECT Strategy (Hughes, Ruhl, Deshler, & Schumaker,in press) This strategy was designed to improve student organizational skillsrelative to completing assignments. Each of the letters in the mnemonic"PROJECT" prompts the student to do certain things (i.e., P = Prepare [getforms ready; listen for assignments]; R = Record and ask [record assignmentusing abbreviations; ask teacher for clarifications]; O = Organize [breakassignment into parts]; J = Jump to it! [tell yourself to get going; sayaffirmations]; E = Engage in the work [review requirements of the assignment;do the work; ask for help if needed]; C = Check your work [check work againstthe requirements; check for quality; reward yourself; store it and rememberto bring it to school]; T = Turn it in and evaluate [check your grade; figureout how to do better; store the assignment]. When students with LD are taughtthis strategy, both the quantity of assignments they complete and the qualityof their work improve dramatically. The instructional services that students with learning disabilitiesreceive for their learning problems often have the effect of making them more dependent than independent. The "quick fix'' solutions that get studentsthrough immediate demands in general education classes exemplify suchservices. Each new demand becomes a crisis for the student who lacks theskills to deal effectively with learning challenges. The instructionalservices these students receive often become a cycle of crisis-to-crisisinterventions that never address the students' long-term needs forindependence, but instead encourage students to rely more and more on adults.As they grow older, some students respond to the desire to become moreindependent by choosing to refuse support services, no matter what. Otherscontinue to be dependent on adults to "bail them out" and abdicate the desirefor greater independence. The real hazard in the dependency cycle option isthat students may miss important opportunities to learn independentproblem-solving skills that will have life-long benefits and may carry theparadigm of dependency into adult life. There are several other reasons for involving students in learning strategyinstruction. In addition to making coursework easier, learning moreefficient, and increasing independence, strategies are aids to students'organization and management of learning tasks. First, strategies can aidstudents' organization and management of learning tasks because they promotea systematic, orderly approach to learning. Second, because strategies are"portable, adaptable and combinable," they may be used in a wide variety ofsituations: in school, on the job, in post secondary training, in socialsettings, and in daily-living situations. In daily-living situations, forexample, students may use strategies to paraphrase directions for completinga tax form, write a rationale for why they are qualified for a particular jobon an application form, or recall the steps in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.Once students learn to use learning strategies well and become "strategicthinkers," they are in a much better position to respond to the broad arrayof problems that will come their way throughout life. Finally, strategies can be used any time a student determines they areappropriate to use. Strategic instruction initially allows for others toprompt or cue students that a task requires the use of a particular strategy,but these reminders are faded as students grow more capable of makingdecisions about when strategies should be used. Family members can alsoprovide these cues and prompts for the use of strategies in daily life andsocial situations, again fading their reminders as the student demonstratespersonal capacity in using the strategies. The desired goal is studentindependence in use of strategies any time they are needed. How Strategies are Taught While each learning strategy is designed to address a different settingdemand in general education such as reading a passage or taking a test, allstrategies are taught using a similar set of procedures. This similarityacross the instructional process allows for more efficiency in learning onthe part of the student. The process for learning the strategies is divided into two phases: alearning phase and an applying phase. During the learning phase, the studentlearns about the strategy andpractices using the strategy under both easy andmore difficult conditions. Within the learning phase are seven stages. In theapplying phase, the student uses the strategy tosucceed in classroom and other situations. The applying phase has four partswhich facilitate gradual growth in the student's competence as the strategyis used in more settings. During the first stage of instruction, the Pretest Stage, students aretested to determine current strategies they use effectively and whatstrategies/learning habits should be modified or changed altogether. Thedeficits identified during pretesting relate to specific setting demands inthe general education classroom. Once students have completed the pretestprocess, the teacher shares observations with students regarding bothstrengths and areas needing improvement. The teacher describes an alternativestrategy that will help students meet the demands of the general educationsetting and also explains how the strategy might be applied beyond the schoolsetting at work, home, or in other situations The teacher talks about what isrequired to learn the strategy and the results that other students haveachieved using the strategy. The students are then asked whether they wouldlike to commit to learning the strategy in light of this information. Ifstudents are interested in learning the strategy, the teacher describeshis/her own role and commitment to effectively teach the strategy to thestudents. The students set goals for learning the strategy and are made awareof the criterion for how well the strategy must be performed before it isconsidered to have been mastered. The second instructional stage is the Describe Stage. Here, theteacher describes the rationales for use of the strategy, thecharacteristics of the strategy, and engages the students in a discussionof where and when the strategy might be used in school situations as wellas in work and community settings. The discussion also focuses on currentlearning patterns of the students and how the strategy may improve theirsuccess. The teacher describes the steps in the strategy and presents amemory device to make remembering the steps easy. A final part of theDescribe Stage involves the students in setting personal goals for thepace at which the strategy will be learned. The third stage is Modeling. This is a particularly important stagefor at-risk students who tend not to talk themselves through the learningprocess as effective learners do. For this reason, the teacher's taskbecomes twofold: visually showing how the strategy is used and "thinkingaloud" to demonstrate the mental parts of the strategy. Students observeas the teacher demonstrates how to do self instruction, how to problemsolve, how to monitor one's own learning, and how to put all of theseelements together in performing the whole strategy to complete a task.Also during this stage, the teacher begins to draw the students into the"thinking aloud process." This guided process may seem strange first tostudents who have not used "self talk" in their learning; however, theprocedure becomes more comfortable as students practice being reflective. The fourth stage is Verbal Practice. This stage maximizes use of thethinking aloud/self-talk process in consolidating students' knowledgeabout the strategy and their own learning processes. This stage requiresthe students to relate what they are learning to previous learningthrough the use of their own words. This "verbal elaboration" processengages students in thinking about the strategy, what the steps of thestrategy mean to them, and why each is important. The elaborationincreases the students' knowledge of the strategy and builds on students'commitment and motivation to learn the strategy. In addition, studentsverbally rehearse naming the strategy steps. As they gain facility innaming the steps and provide evidence that they understand them, they areready to begin practicing the strategy. The fifth stage of strategy instruction is Controlled Practice andFeedback. The practice portion of this stage focuses initially onstudents' knowledge of the strategy steps through use of materials thatare relatively easy. At first, students' concentration needs to be onlearning the strategy and not the content of the materials, hence the useof easy materials. As students master using the strategy in easymaterials, the focus shifts to increasing the difficulty level of thematerials gradually until they begin to approximate the difficultystudents would experience in the general education classroom. For eachsession of controlled practice, there is a corresponding individualfeedback session. Instruction in this stage begins with the teachertaking major responsibility for noting the student's strengths and areasneeding improvement in each feedback session and gradually shifts suchthat the student assumes more and more responsibility for evaluating aprevious performance. In stage six, Advanced Practice and Feedback, students use thestrategy on tasks and materials similar to those assigned in the generaleducation classroom. This offers an opportunity for fine tuning anyskills before application in the "real" classroom learning setting. Thisstage may necessitate that students problem solve how to apply thestrategy in poorly designed materials or materials that do not fit thenorm of the classroom (as may be the case in doing library research for aterm paper, for example). This problemsolving experience is important ingiving students alternative ways to meet varied learning demands and asense of confidence in their own abilities to adapt. As in the previouspractice stage, emphasis is placed on students taking on greaterresponsibility for self evaluation as more and more efficiency isdemonstrated in use of the strategy. The seventh stage is to Posttest and Make commitments. The posttest isa confirmation that reflect on what has been learned about the strategyand about each of the student's own learning patterns. This stagecompletes the learning phase and serves as a transition to application ofthe strategy. As students get closure on what has happened with theirlearning up to this point, they prepare for generalization into theclassroom and other situations by making commitments and setting goalsfor Stage Eight, the applying stage. While the stages up to this point will have taken several weeks tocomplete, Stage Eight, the Generalization Stage, has no time frame. Itcould potentially go on throughout the individual's lifetime as thestrategy is applied or adapted across a wide variety of school and lifesituations. The "early" part of application, however, occurs in thegeneral education classroom as studentsbegin to apply the strategy in that setting. Dana's use of the SentenceWriting Strategy (Schumaker & Sheldon, 1985) in her seventh-grade socialstudies class described earlier is an example of the early stages ofapplication. This can be a rather precarious phase for the student who iswithout the reliable support of the strategy instructor or peers who arefamiliar with the strategy. Though the general education teacher will haveknowledge of the strategy and how to prompt students' use of it, there willbe differences in teachers' styles and attention to an individual student'sneeds in the general education classroom. For these reasons, the strategyinstructor will work closely with the general education teacher and thestudent to problem solve ways around any concerns that may arise.Acknowledging this "touch and go" period is important for everyone involvedand especially for the student who may tend to revert to less effectivepractices unless prompted to use the strategy for specific tasks. As the students begin to use the strategy appropriately and moreindependently within the general education setting, the strategyinstructor and the students may begin to work on self-reflective(strategic thinking) skills again, but with the focus on modification ofthe strategy or parts of the strategy to a wider range of settings: otherclasses or settings outside the school such as social situations or work.As the students demonstrate mastery of the strategy in the generaleducation setting and adapt its use to a broader range of situations,planning occurs on long-term use of the strategy. The students and theteacher may think ahead to potential applications and set goals for howuse of the strategy will be monitored.They also will conduct regular reviews of the strategy in order to ensurethat the strategy continues to be used at criterion levels. As more strategies are introduced, students are participating in a "largerlesson" (or meta-lesson) about how they learn beyond the actual strategiesthemselves. Within this larger lesson, students begin to understand theprocess of their own learning so that, through several instances of masteringfirst one and then other strategies, students learn a great deal about how tolearn efficiently, which learning tasks are easiest or most difficult forthem as individuals, how to make adjustments that will increase learning,when to use strategies and when not to use them, and what is required tocreate a reliable system for dealing with changing educational demands.The knowledge gained from the larger lesson about their own learning patternsthat they accumulate from learning and using strategies allows students totake on more responsibility for learning and problem solving in generaleducation and life situations. Built into the instruction on each learningstrategy is the gradual turning over of responsibility for guiding thestudents' learning from the teacher to the students as the students gainconfidence and skill in using each strategy. As a result, students are armedwith both confidence and skills to meet the general education classroom'sdemands. The success that students achieve in the general education setting,in turn, reinforces the students' growing sense of independence and controlover the process of learning. This activates a success cycle which is verydifferent from the failure and dependency cycle described previously. Types Of Strategies By now you would probably like to know more about the types of strategies thathave been created for students to learn. There are several groups of learningstrategies.[2] One group that includes several strategies helps studentsacquire information from written materials. An example strategy from thisgroup is the Paraphrasing Strategy (Schumaker, Denton, & Deshler, 1984). Whileusing this strategy, students read a passage from a general educationassignment, identify the main idea and details in the passage, and put theinformation in their own words. The strategy requires that students becomeengaged in the author's message and activate self-talk about what the authoris saying. The purpose of the Paraphrasing Strategy is that the students willincrease their understanding of what is being read by transforming theauthors' words into their own words. Another strategy in this group is the Visual Imagery Strategy (Schumaker,Deshler, Zemitzsch, & Warner, 1993). It is used to gain knowledge of andremember new information by forming mental images of the content. Studentsare encouraged to create these images through the use of previously acquiredknowledge. Students read a passage while simultaneously creating anddescribing a mental picture story or "movie" with accurate details. Thisengagement in visualizing events and in describing stories in their own wordsassists students in understanding and recalling what has been read. A second group of learning strategies are those that enable students toidentify, organize, and store important information. An example strategyin this group is the FIRST-Letter Mnemonic Strategy (Nagel, Schumaker, &Deshler, 1986). This strategy is designed to help students identify the keyinformation to be learned, to organize the information in list form, andremember the list of items through development of a memory device with thefirst letters of the words that make up the list. Other strategies in thisgroup include the LINCS Strategy (Ellis, 1992), a strategy for learning themeaning of new vocabulary words and the Paired Associates Strategy (Bulgren,Schumaker, & Deshler, in press), a strategy for learning information that isrelated (e.g., the significant contributions of a certain historical figure). A third group of learning strategies are those that facilitate writtenexpression and demonstration of competence. An example in this group ofstrategies is the Paragraph Writing Strategy (Schumaker & Lyerla, 1991).Instruction in the Paragraph Writing Strategy enables students to plan andwrite different types of paragraphs based on typical demands in the generaleducation Setting. Other strategies within this group include the Test TakingStrategy (Hughes. Schumaker, Deshler, & Mercer, 1988) which enables studentsto most effectively express their knowledge in testing situations and theError Monitoring Strategy (Schumaker, Nolan, & Deshler, 1985) which enablesstudents to identify errors and edit their own writing. Another group of learning strategies are those that enhance studentperformance in solving mathematics problems. The Strategic Math Series(Mercer & Miller, 1993) consists of a series of seven math strategies thathave been designed to enable students to quickly solve computation problemsinvolving basic facts and how to use these strategies in solving storyproblems. Students can learn these strategies across the grades in a variety ofsequences depending on the demands they are facing in their general educationclasses and their individual strengths and weaknesses. In some schooldistricts across the nation, strategy instruction begins in the elementarygrades and continues through the high school grades as needed by a givenstudent. A case study example might be instructive in understanding theprogression of the instruction. Mike entered sixth grade at Jefferson Middle School after his family movedfrom Arizona during the summer. He had been receiving services in a learningdisabilities program since he was in third grade for problems with bothreading and writing. During his sixth-grade year at Jefferson, he receivedinstruction from Ms. Cartwright, a support class teacher, on the Paraphrasing,Word Identification and Sentence Writing Strategies. He used the strategiessome in the sixth grade classroom, but not as consistently as Ms. Cartwrightwould have liked, and his sixth-grade teachers, Mr. Just and Mrs. Winters,had to remind him often to use the strategies in science and social studies.At the end of the year, Ms. Cartwright recommended that Mike continue to workon these strategies in seventh grade. During the seventh and eighth grades at Jefferson, Mike improved his use ofthe Word Identification, Paraphrasing and Sentence Writing Strategies. Throughadditional practice, he learned to use them automatically and fluently. Inaddition, he learned the Paragraph Writing Strategy, the Error MonitoringStrategy, Visual Imagery and the FIRST-Letter Mnemonic Strategies. Soon, hebegan using the strategies in his general education classes and elsewherewhenever possible. For example, Mike developed a memory device for learningthe safety rules in shop class that Mr. Stevens, the shop teacher, liked somuch that Mr. Stevens shared it with his other classes. Mike used the SentenceWriting and Paragraph Writing Strategies to write letters to a girl met atsummer camp. Mike was especially pleased with his success in writingassignments in English classes, and his teachers commented on his excellentimprovement. Additionally, as he learned more strategies, Mike began toisolate parts of the strategic thinking processes he was using into simplestrategies and to use these simple strategies in other situations a varietyof combinations on his own. He was becoming a lot more confident in hisability to succeed in his coursework, and his grades improved. During his ninth-grade year, Mike learned the LINCS and Test-Taking Strategiesand easily applied them in his courses. He had become very adept at "learningto learn" and was quite good at explaining strategy use to other students. In grades 10 through 12, Mike grew a lot in size and maturity. This wasevident in his needing less and less time in the support class with Mrs.Miller who said he had "matured into using strategic thinking at a deeperlevel." At one of their scheduled monitoring sessions to see how Mike wasdoing at the end of eleventh grade, Mike had told Mrs. Miller that he was notusing the strategies at all any more. When they talked about this more, andMrs. Miller checked with Mike's English and History teachers, Mike wassurprised to find that he was using the strategies, but he did not have tothink about using them any longer-they were part of what he always did;"they had become automatic." As part of planning for his transition from high school, Mike decided hewanted "a regular job with regular hours" after having the experience ofworking in a restaurant for awhile and made plans to enter vocationaltraining to learn architectural drafting. He knew his math skills were prettygood, but he would have to "invent" some strategies for the kinds of writingand spelling that need to be done on architectural blueprints. His aunt whois an architect, really encouraged him and said she would help him find a jobwhen he finished the program. He had enjoyed working with computers andthought he would be able to succeed at the technical college in a nearby citythe fall after he graduated from high school. He took a summer job as alumber yard so he could get "a feel for building materials." Mike knew there were support services available to him at the technicalcollege when he started classes in the fall, but he thought he would try tosucceed without them for the first part of the semester, at least. After hisfirst test in the introductory drafting course, he decided he had better check in on the program right away. He was surprised to learn that the tutorfor the drafting program was aware of learning strategies. She shared some ofthe strategies other students had used for the introductory course he wastaking. He showed the tutor his old notebook containing notes about thelearning strategies he had learned at North High School. Mrs. Miller had toldhim he might need his notebook in college, although he really had not believedher. Mike was eager to find out more about the learning strategies forintroductory drafting and to use the computerized study materials that wereavailable for that class from the support services program. He set up anappointment to attend the study group for the drafting class. Arguments that Explain and Evaluate Strategies Instruction By now you may be wondering why learning strategies instruction is the way itis and how effective it is. About seventeen years ago, researchers at theUniversity of Kansas set out to learn more about secondary students withlearning disabilities. One of the researchers' tasks was to discover thekinds of problems that these students encountered in school, and, particularlyin general education classes. The results of their studies indicated thatstudents with learning disabilities were struggling with understanding whatwas read from textbooks, writing sentences, paragraphs, and themes, takingtests, listening and taking notes, to name a few of the concerns. Theresearchers also learned that the methods being used at the time to providesupport services for these students seemed to be having no real lastingeffects at improving students' skills, and the students with learningdisabilities were becoming increasingly more dependent on support personnelfor assistance while continuing to perform poorly in their classes. To address these problems, the researchers set about developing methods forstrategy instruction that would help these students succeed in generaleducation classes and become more independent as learners. A "learning how tolearn" focus was applied in developing a wide range of strategies specificallydesigned to meet the types of demands that students were experiencing insecondary school classrooms. This "learning how to learn" focus comes fromcognitive theory, a theory of how learning occurs. Research on this theoryhas provided a great deal of practical information about what can be done toenhance learning. Strategies instruction is based on cognitive theory andresearch related to it. The process of developing each of the strategies included validating theinstructional methods associated with the strategy as effective means forstudents with learning disabilities to learn to succeed at classroom tasks.The instructional methods described in the third section of this chapter,"How Strategies are Taught," were found to be effective if students withlearning disabilities had certain prerequisite skills. A total of fifteenresearch studies have been conducted (see Deshler and Schumaker, 1988, andSchumaker and Deshler 1992 for reviews). Each study has demonstrated thatlearning strategy instruction allows students with learning disabilities tosucceed on tasks like those they might encounter in general education classes and to do so on anindependent basis. While no formal studies have been conducted on the long-term effects oflearning strategy instruction, the levels of independence achieved, or justhow students become strategic thinkers and apply these skill to post-secondaryeducation, daily living, and employment situations, case examples are veryencouraging. Senior high school teachers report that students with learningdisabilities who have received strategies instruction from middle schoolonward require little, if any, support services by the time they are in theeleventh grade. Many of these students become very capable of meeting learningdemands without assistance from support services personnel. They alsodemonstrate abilities to creatively apply strategic thinking to a wide rangeof situations. Making It Happen in Schools Putting together middle or secondary school services for at-risk learners isnot a simple task. Assuring that these services emphasize independence andlong-term skill development is even more complex. Developing services thatenable students to learn strategic thinking skills that can be applied inschool and life situations requires collaboration among educators, students,families, and community members. This collaboration needs to occur at several levels. The first ofthese levels is collaboration within the school district. The role ofcentral office administrators is important in making the schooldistrict's commitment to life-focused outcomes and to removing barriersthat may stand in the way of implementing strategic instruction.Administrators must look at students' experiences throughout the entireschool program and across buildings. For example, because reading is askill that requires several years to master, a good deal of coordinationis necessary to assure that reading programs emphasize a continuousprogression in terms of reading skills development.This ongoing progression in skill development is necessitated by thecomplexity of the tasks involved in reading well. No one would consider notteaching reading in grades 4 and 5, for example. Central office administratorsare responsible for assuring that skill development in reading occurs inelementary and middle school buildings, and as needed at the high schoollevel, and that programs are of high quality and build on prior learning.Administrators must ensure that support programs, such as those emphasizingstrategic instruction, are carried out across buildings so that they will bemaximally beneficial to students and focused on the long-term outcomes thatare so important for young people with disabilities. These administrativepersonnel are in the best position to provide opportunities for district-wideplanning and remove scheduling barriers and other limitations to developmentof programs that span across buildings within the district. Building administrators carry out much the same role at the level of theindividual school. They are involved in arranging planning time for teachers,working with families and students within their buildings, and affirming theschool's commitment to provide quality services for all its students includingat-risk learners across the grades within a given school. Teachers across the school district, including those in general education andsupport services roles, need to plan collaboratively to provide for uniquelearning needs of students. In some districts, this planning occurs as partof curriculum planning or school accreditation activities. In others,collaborative planning for at-risk students is carried out as a targetedactivity in its own right. In either case, planning for implementation oflearning strategies instruction and methods of communicating progress ofindividual students is an appropriate task for such educator groups. Doingthis type of planning across the whole school district will help to assurethat services are well coordinated and encourage long-term outcomes. Plansdeveloped for the entire school district need to be considered withinindividual buildings as well. Building personnel will need to develop moredetailed plans for how student needs will be addressed at each school site. A second level of collaborative activity occurs among the students and theirfamilies and educators. At this level, educators provide information about learning strategy instruction to students and their families, and engage indiscussions about what this means to students' long-term success and to thefamilies' role in the educational process. This provides families anopportunity to discuss concerns they might have about learning strategiesinstruction, to see how this method of serving young people with disabilitiesfits into the total school program, and to learn about the process of planningfor post-school outcomes. The third level of collaborative activity is more individualized to eachstudent. At this level, collaboration might occur between any number ofpeople and would typically facilitate students' generalization of strategiesin non-school situations. For example, collaboration might occur between astudent and his employer. In such a situation, the student might ask his/heremployer to assist him/her in developing some strategies for carrying outwork-related tasks. In another case, a support services teacher, the student,and a post-secondary training program instructor might meet to plan for use ofStrategies in the post-secondary setting. A third example might include aparent, the student, and a youth program leader (e.g. Boy Scouts, YMCA, or achurch program) planning for the student's use of strategies in giving aspeech or presentation to the youth group. Clearly, making strategy instruction work successfully for students withlearning disabilities requires commitment, collaboration, and effort on thepart of administrators, teachers, parents, students, and others in thestudents' lives. Fortunately, strategy instruction is one case where effortsyield positive outcomes in terms of student grades, feelings of competence,self- esteem, and overall attitude toward learning.

Footnotes [1] The Self-Advocacy Strategy is a motivation strategy tended to involvestudents in key aspects of the learning process and is intended to increasethe students' commitment to their educational program. The memory device,"I PLAN," is used to help the students recall the five steps in the strategy:"I" which stands for "Inventory your strengths, weaknesses, goals, and choicesfor learning;" 'P" is for "Provide your inventory information;" "L" is for"Listen and respond;" "A" is for "Ask questions;" and 'N" is for "Name yourgoals" (Van Reusen, Bos, Schumaker, and Deshler, 1994).

Silver M.D. At the time a student is diagnosed as having a learning disability, there arecertain givens. Two of these are the areas of learning disabilities and theintellectual potential of the individual. There are also other factors thatgreatly influence the progression and outcome of this student's educationalexperiences: how early the disabilities are identified; how comprehensive thespecial education interventions provided are; and whether these interventionsare provided, as needed, throughout the student's education. There is yetanother factor that is less easy to identify and measure but critical: thestudent's personality. Does he or she take on the disabilities as a challenge,understand the need to work at overcoming the disabilities and to work atdeveloping coping strategies? Does she or he relate in a way that makes peoplewant to reach out and help or in a way that pushes people away? We know what is needed to help a student with a learning disability succeed.Efforts must be made to recognize students with academic difficulties and toidentify if they have a learning disability as early as possible. Oncediagnosed, individualized, appropriate, and comprehensive services areessential throughout each year such services are needed. Educational systemsall too often fail because such known concepts are not practiced. Children andadolescents are not identified and diagnosed early. Some are not identifieduntil middle school or high school or are missed completely. Services might beprovided in grade school then, whether needed or not, they are decreased orstopped in middle school or high school. Other chapters (of this book) will emphasize the need for early identificationand comprehensive interventions. In this chapter, I would like to address anequally critical issue if the student with a learning disability is to succeedthough high school and is prepared to move successfully into his or herpost-secondary world. I refer to the student's feelings about himself orherself and to the student's ability to learn to advocate for his or herspecial needs. Critical to the development of a positive self-image and agood feeling of self-esteem and to the ability to learn to be one's ownadvocate is the knowledge of self. Knowledge of self is the key to acceptanceof self, self esteem, and self advocacy. Only with a sense of positiveself-esteem can an individual see himself or herself as a human among humans,as an equal among equals. THE OTHER SIDE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION: TEACHING KNOWLEDGE OFSELF Students finishing high school need self-esteem and self-confidence to feelcomfortable and safe when moving out into their post secondary world. Once inthis world, they will need social confidence and social skills to adapt and tofit in. Of equal importance, individuals will need the knowledge and skills toboth qualify for and to succeed in this next phase of their life, whether itis to be as a partner in a relationship or in the job market, a trade school,the military, or college. What about students with learning disabilities? Are their needs any different?We know that learning disabilities are life disabilities. Theynot only impact on reading, writing, math, and other academic areas, theyimpact on all aspects of life, within the family, with peers, in sports and inactivities. Thus, they impact on an individual's success in school. within thefamily, and with peers. We also know that learning disabilities are lifetime disabilities. That is, the child with a learning disability willbecome the adolescent with a learning disability will become the adult with alearning disability. All efforts to help must be provided throughout gradeschool, middle school, high school, and into their post secondary world. Thus, for the student with a learning disability, the need for self-esteem andself-confidence, the need for social confidence and social skills, and theneed for understanding of self are of even greater importance. Key tocompetence with these traits and skills is the individual's totalunderstanding of his or her learning disabilities and learning abilities aswell as the best strategies for success when with peers, in a work setting, orin the classroom. With this knowledge, he or she can build a healthy, positiveself esteem. With this knowledge, she or he can become successful selfadvocates. Ideally, students with learning disabilities are identified early in theirschool experiences. Each receives the needed special education and relatedservices throughout their education. Thus, each succeeds in mastering basicacademic skills or in learning to accommodate for any difficulties and eachlearns their own unique set of strategies for learning. In addition, eachstudent learns his or her areas of learning disabilities and learningabilities. Further, as each student moves from grade school to middle school,he or she has learned to understand what special accommodations are necessaryand how to advocate for these accommodations both in school and out of school.By high school, each student not only knows what is needed, but learns to beassertive as a self advocate. Ideally, each family of a student with a learning disability is educated abouttheir son's or daughter's learning disabilities and learning abilities. They,too, learn what is needed and how to be an informed and assertive advocate fortheir child. As this child becomes older, they learn to help him or her beginto take over some of the advocacy roles so that by high school he or she cancomfortably accept the role of advocate. This family, with knowledge of theirson's or daughter's strengths and weaknesses, knows how to select homeactivities, peer activities, sports, and other important experiences for thisson or daughter that build on the strengths while compensating for andminimizing the effect of the weaknesses. Ideally, therefore, each student hashad successful experiences in the family and with peers. Each individual hashad a happy and successful childhood and adolescence.Under these ideal conditions, this student would leave high school withcomprehensive self knowledge, good self-esteem, and the ability to selfadvocate. He or she would feel good about self and feel both confident andcapable of peer relationships. This student would move into any post secondaryworld with the maximum chance for success. Unfortunately, most school systems do not provide this ideal world. Mostfamilies are not fortunate enough to be taught what they need to how to besuccessful parents and siblings. All too many high school graduates do nothave adequate knowledge of self with a resulting low self-esteem and limitedself advocacy skills. Too many high school students give up and either dropout of school or enter their post secondary world neither psychologically,socially, nor academically prepared. They are forced to pay the price of alifetime of underachievement often along with few personal or socialsuccesses. Let me illustrate these important concepts by reviewing the stories of astudent with learning disabilities who succeeded and one who did not. Marie was first identified as having a learning disability in tenth grade.prior to this time she had been told by teachers and parents that she was justlazy and unmotivated. She often was punished for not getting good schoolgrades or for lying about her school work. Marie was quiet and shy in schooland appeared to avoid relationships. At home, she let out her frustration bybeing angry and by fighting with her two siblings. She was referred for psychiatric treatment because of her aggressive behaviorat home and her "unwillingness" to try in school. During the initialevaluation, the evidence of a probable learning disability was noted.Comprehensive psycho-educational testing showed her to be very bright but withsignificant learning disabilities, primarily in the visual perception,sequencing, organization, visual short-term memory, fine motor, and writtenlanguage areas. She had excellent strengths in all receptive and expressivelanguage areas. The initial interventions with Marie focused on explaining herlearning disabilities and learning abilities as well as on what would beneeded for her to succeed. The same information was reviewed later in sessionswith her parents followed by sessions with her family. She started specialeducation tutoring. Her regular education teachers were informed of the neededclassroom and curriculum accommodations. Once these efforts were in place, Marie shifted to individual psychotherapy.She was depressed, had a poor self image and low self esteem. In addition, shewas angry that she had had to struggle and suffer for so many years beforesomeone found out what was wrong. Once she was able to work through theseissues, she became free to learn more about herself and her disabilities. Shebegan to see herself as bright and capable and gained self-confidence. Withthis new confidence, she became more involved with her friends. Marie learnedwhen it was safe to disclose her problems and when it might be best not to doso. Her family benefitted from their new knowledge of Marie and changed theirimage of her as well as their behaviors toward her. Her parents became Marie'sallies in dealing with her disabilities. In her junior year of high school, Marie returned to me for help. She hadcovered up her low reading level with her friends; however, doing this wasgetting harder. They would go to a restaurant and she could not read the menu.They would pass notes to each other and she could not write or spell well.Covering up was a major challenge. We discussed her need to trust one friendwith information about her disabilities. Marie was afraid that this friendwould then think of her as dumb and reject her. Finally, she did tell this onefriend who then became her helper. At a restaurant, this friend would turn toMarie and say, "I don't know if I want ..." then read the menu to her. Later,with more confidence, she shared her problems with all of her friends. Theydid not reject her, but, instead, became closer and helped her whenever shehad difficulty. These experiences were valuable for Marie and served her welllater in life. Through counseling, role playing, and insistence that she act on her ownbehalf, she learned to be her own advocate. By the time she entered her senioryear of high school she knew how to select the teachers who taught in a stylemost helpful to her. She, not her mother or the special educationprofessional, met with each teacher to review her areas of strength andweakness and the needed accommodations in curriculum and in the classroom. Ifa teacher was not understanding or cooperative, she discussed the problem withsomeone at the school and went back to deal with the teacher directly. When it was time to select a college, she interacted actively with thecounselor helping the family select colleges. During college interviews, shespoke of her special needs and asked if the college could provide for theseneeds. When it was time to leave for college, she felt confident that she hadthe environment and professionals in place to maximize her chances forsuccess. And she was successful. Midway through college, Marie called me. She had to declare a major and "pick" a career. All of her old fears of inadequacyand of "being dumb" surfaced. Could she ever be "an adult" or be successful ina job? Could she support herself? We met over that summer and worked on herself-esteem. She met with a consultant who helped her sort out her strengthsand interest vs. her weaknesses in order to decide on a major as well as apossible future career. Interestingly, she chose education with the thought ofsomeday going into special education. Marie successfully completed college and started working as a first gradeteacher. She joked that she did not want to teach anyone who needed to knowskills at a higher level than hers. I did not hear from her for several years. Then, at age 24, she called again. "Help. I have this serious boyfriend and Ihave serious problems." We met. She discussed her difficulty covering up herlearning disabilities. "He hands me the movie list or TV Guide and asks me todecide." Or, he would give her a letter with directions while driving and askher to read where they should turn. Occasionally, he would hand her anewspaper article and ask her thoughts. Again, the deep fear that if she toldhim she was "disabled" he would no longer like her. We discussed her fears andhow she might approach explaining herself to him. It worked. I was invited tothe engagement party. It was good to see the teamwork starting. He read thecards while she opened the gifts. End of story? The story never ends when one has a life time disability. Shecalled several years later in panic. She was now married and just learned shewas pregnant. "What do I do if my child has a learning disability?" I laughedbut she was frightened. We had to discuss the possibility that she might beright. However, for her child, the problems would be picked up very early andthe necessary help provided. This child would not have to suffer until tenthgrade before being identified. She relaxed. Soon after the baby was born, Marie called asking if I would be willing to docouples therapy. What became clear was that Marie's ways of compensating forher disabilities were not known to her husband. He would do something that"threw her off" and then she would blow up at him. Over a series of sessions,she was able to understand and explain that in order to work and to take careof a child and a family, she had to be super organized. Otherwise, her naturaldisorganization would result in a disaster. She knew what time she had to behome. what time the baby needed to be fed, what time to start dinner, and whattime to serve dinner so that she would have enough time after dinner to takecare of the baby and put her to bed. Then, she would have time for lessonplans, etc. Her life was super organized and almost rigid. If her husband camehome 15 minutes late, maybe because he could not leave work on time, she felther whole routine was thrown off and she would explode. He did not know whathit him and often she did not know why she exploded. As she began tounderstand why she needed to be the way she was and he began to understand herdisabilities and how they impacted on her life, they both worked at changes.They rethought evening and morning responsibilities. With his support andadded effort, she was able to relax more. With his sensitivity to her need forroutine and organization, he made a point of being home on time or of calling.She learned to not blow up. All benefitted. At this time Marie is successful with her career, marriage, and family. Eachphase of her development has presented new challenges. With her knowledge ofherself and her inner drive to solve problems, she has overcome eachchallenge. I mention the times she called me. She solved most of her lifecrises by herself. Yet, I anticipate hearing from Marie again in the future. Then there is Bob. He was identified as having a learning disability in firstgrade. Bob received special education, speech and language therapy, andoccupational therapy through sixth grade. His parents were pleased that he waslearning. No one ever explained his learning disabilities to them or taughtthem what role they needed to play to help him. Because of hisvisual-motor disabilities, he did poorly in the sports his friends played andgradually lost what friends he had. He spent more and more time at home. When he entered middle school, the school system decided that he no longerneeded intensive help. He was placed in lower-functioning regular classes withteachers who were to accommodate to his needs. Bob went to a "resource room"each day for one period with 15 other students. Bob got through middle schoolwith passing grades. However, he did not learn as much as other studentsbecause of the level of expectation in the lower-level basic classes as wellas the school's approach which focused only on accommodating for hisdisabilities. No efforts were made to continuing to work on improving theareas of disability while helping him to develop compensatory skills. Duringmiddle school he related poorly to classmates and had, at best, casualfriends. He stayed at home and participated in no activities. High school was a disaster. The school had few services for high schoolstudents with learning disabilities. He was in lower-functioning basic classeswith students who were not interested in school and he was provided no specialeducation services. By the middle of 11th grade he gave up and quit school.Initially, Bob got a job at a fast food restaurant and appeared to be happy.He spoke of going to night school to finish high school. By now, he wasisolated with no peer contacts. Over the next two years, Bob moved from job to job because he was either firedfor not being on time or he quit. He found a group of adolescents who were ina similar situation and began to hang around with them. His parents were angryand frustrated with Bob and feared that he would "never grow up." Yet, theydid not know what to do. They contacted me when Bob was 24. He was sleeping all day and going out withhis friends at night. They were concerned that he might be an alcoholic. Hehad not held a job for over a year. They felt helpless and had allowed him tolive at home while they supported him. When I obtained a history andquestioned about his learning disabilities, they wondered why I did so. "Thosewere only problems when he was a child. He learned to read." My evaluation of Bob showed him to have academic skills at about the eighthgrade level with significant evidence of learning disabilities. He wasdepressed with a very poor self-image and very low self-esteem. Bob had nopositive concept of himself, did not feel that he belonged anywhere, and hadno sense of a future. He was alcohol dependent. Bob spoke of his helplessnessand hopelessness and described himself as someone so dumb he could not evenfinish high school. If only his school had realized that learning disabilities are lifetime disabilities and that they could not stop services after grade school.If only his parents had been provided the knowledge about learningdisabilities so that they would have been able to advocate for better helpduring middle school and high school. If only Bob had receivedpsychological help before he became a casualty. If only... We see too many"if onlys" with our adolescents and young adults. We acknowledge that theyhave learning disabilities and then fail to do what is necessary to help them.We do not educate the parents. School professionals and families fail and theindividual fails. The future for Bob is not good. He now has his learningdisabilities along with significant emotional, social, and family problems anda substance abuse problem. We see too few Maries and too many Bobs. How do we change this? What is neededto develop the level of self knowledge that results in a positive self esteemand the ability to learn to be a self advocate? We know the answers. We havenot yet learned to practice what we know. The answers are clear: School systems must identify students with learning disabilities early andprovide the necessary help throughout their education. Individuals must be educated about their disabilities and special needsearly and throughout their education. They must first have advocates, then beshown how to be an advocate, and then allowed to practice being their ownadvocate. Parents must learn about their son's or daughter's learning disabilities andlearning abilities and how they can build on strengths while addressing theweaknesses in all family and social situations. Parents must have the knowledge of their son's or daughter's needs and betaught how to be informed and assertive advocates. They need to understand theneeds for each phase of their son's or daughter's life. The individual with a learning disability must finish high school with theacademic knowledge and skills needed to move into the post secondary world.This individual must have a positive sense of self, resulting in a high levelof self-esteem. He or she must be knowledgeable about his or her disabilities,abilities, and special needs and be able to advocate for these special needs.With these successes, each has a chance to make it in the post secondary worldand in adult life. Without these successes, their disability may become ahandicap and their chances for success become greatly restricted. BUILDING THROUGH KNOWLEDGE Until the diagnosis of a learning disability is made, the child or adolescentis as confused as are parents or teachers. This student has only had one brainand does not know that it is "wired" differently. She or he tries as hard aseveryone else to learn and to succeed but does not. He or she does not want tobe bad yet everyone seems to be angry. The child often feels no control overlife. How they are perceived and how they perceive themselves appears to bebased on people or events outside of themselves. They often feel frustratedwith their school and peer difficulties yet do not know what to do. They feel helpless. Until the diagnosis is made, teachers become frustrated.The teacher is tryingand the child is not learning. Further, this student may be misbehaving anddisrupting the class. The teacher might let the student know of his or herfrustration. In addition, this teacher might let the parents know. Parents getcalls. "You have to make your child do his homework." "Please tell yourdaughter to get her work done in class and to write neater." "You must punishyour son for clowning in class." Parents, already frustrated, now react to theteacher's frustration. The teacher also feels helpless. Because learning disabilities are life disabilities, the child who is notdoing well in school may also not be doing well within the family or withpeers. Parents, worried and frustrated, begin to feel inadequate. They feelhelpless. Once the diagnosis is made, all must change. It is critical that the family beeducated about learning disabilities and specifically about their son's ordaughter's learning disabilities. The educational diagnostician, specialeducation tutor or another professional must accept the responsibility forproviding this information to parents. Classroom teachers must learn of thisstudent's learning disabilities and what accommodations will be needed in eachclassroom. The coordinator of special education services for this student mustaccept the responsibility for educating the classroom teachers. Of equal importance, the child or adolescent must learn of his or her learningdisabilities. Without such knowledge, nothing makes sense. With thisknowledge, they can begin to understand and to regain control over theirlives. They can stop blaming themselves. As they learn about themselves andtheir needs, they can become active rather than passive. They can take controland begin to feel empowered to have a positive impact on their life. BUILDING THE PARENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHILD: Because learning disabilities are life disabilities, interfering withfunctioning in school, in the family, and with peers, it is critical that theparents understand their child's areas of disabilities and abilities to thesame extent as the professionals who are to work with this child. They mustknow the areas of learning abilities so that they can build on them. They mustknow the areas of learning disabilities so that they can advocate fornecessary school services and can accommodate to these disabilities duringnon-school activities. They can learn to help their son or daughter compensatefor the disabilities when necessary. With this knowledge, parents can select family activities, chores, sports andother activities, and peer interactions that maximize the strengths whileminimizing or adjusting to the weaknesses. With this knowledge they can beinformed and assertive advocates with the school system as well as withactivities outside of school. With this knowledge, they can begin to helptheir daughter or son accept and understand the problems. They can demonstratehow to be an advocate and then teach this child or adolescent to become his orher own advocate. The learning disabilities will be apparent at home. Parents must let thischild or adolescent and the other family members know that they understand.They understand and they accept. They can reassure this child that thenecessary help is there. They can point out when the disabilities interferewith family or peer activities and begin to talk about resolutions. What about household chores? Parents do not want to excuse this child fromsuch activities. First, they will be giving a clear nonverbal message thatthey agree he or she is inadequate. Second, they will create sibling anger atthe double standards. With knowledge, parents can begin to select chores thatbuild on strengths rather than magnify weaknesses. The child with visualperception and fine motor disabilities might do poorly loading or unloadingthe dishwasher. But, he or she might do well with tasks that require minimaleye-hand coordination and that build on gross motor skills. He or she couldwalk the dog or take out the trash or bring in the newspaper. Suppose thischild has a sequencing problem (i.e., getting the steps of a task in the rightorder). He or she might need more help with homework or with getting dressed.Knowing this, parent can adapt the ways they help. Knowing this, they canteach this individual to compensate. Suppose a mother says to her child,"Look, I know it is hard for you to set the table because you are confusedabout where to put the fork, knife, spoon, and glass. So, I just drew apicture of a typical place setting. I will put it in this drawer in thekitchen. Whenever it is your turn to set the table, feel free to take it outand use it." What is this parent saying? "You have a disability. I cannot makeit go away; but, I can teach you how to compensate." This child or adolescentwill not be excused from life but will be helped to learn how to succeed inlife. Success in peer activities is critical to a positive self image and tobuilding the social skills needed as an adult. With knowledge of their son'sor daughter"s learning disabilities and learning abilities, parents canmaximize the possibility of successes with these activities. How do theyselect sports, clubs, and other programs that are most likely to besuccessful? They need to select events that build on strengths and then workwith the activity leader and others to maximize accommodations. Each sport requires different strengths. The child or adolescent with visualperception and visual motor disabilities might have difficulty with sportsthat require quick eye-hand coordination, doing such tasks as hitting,throwing, or catching a ball. Baseball or basketball might be poorly playedand avoided. A parent can look for sports that require more gross motorabilities with minimal eye-hand skills such as swimming, soccer, bowling,horseback riding, sailing, canoeing, and certain field and track events. Thechild who refuses to play baseball might excel at swimming. Let swimming behis or her area of success. Some may find all sports difficult. It might bepossible to improve some of the required skills through practice. If he or shehas difficulty following directions or doing activities in the propersequence, parents might practice or provide additional time to learn suchtasks. What about activities? With knowledge, parents can maximize successes in thesame way as with sports. Suppose a son or daughter in a scout group has visualperception and visual motor problems but strengths in receptive and expressivelanguage. He or she goes to a meeting and everyone is working on a project,e.g., cutting out pumpkins or drawing turkeys. This child does not draw,color, or cut well and everyone laughs. End of scouts and another failure.But, if the parents spoke to the scout leader about building on strengths andminimizing weaknesses, the ending could be very different. He or she mighthave been given the job of handing out the paper, squirting the glue, smearingthe paste while others did the drawing and coloring. Or, this child might havebeen given the assignment in advance of learning why the turkey is the symbolof Thanksgiving. While the others did the arts and crafts activities, thischild told the group the history of Thanksgiving. Building on strengths ratherthan exposing weaknesses can lead to successes rather than failures. Parentknowledge and appropriate interventions are essential to accomplish this. The same strategy is used in selecting day camps or sleep-away camps. If thechild described above was a boy and went to a camp with a major focus oncompetitive sports, the outcome might be disastrous. This child would not playwell. His team would not do well and, everyone would get angry with him. But,suppose the parents thought ahead, using their knowledge of strengths. Whatcamps would build on his strengths? Perhaps he would do well at awater-activities camp. Swimming, sailing, canoeing, rowing are all gross motorsports with minimal need for eye-hand coordination. There, the parents couldthink of other problems. Perhaps the camp director needs to tell everyone thatthis child might not understand directions the first time told. Or, that hehas a reading and writing problem. Thus, parents will mail tapes for him tolisten to. He will then erase the tape and dictate a letter to be mailed.Counselors will appreciate such knowledge and, with such knowledge, can makethe camp experience a happy and successful one. BUILDING THE CHILD'S KNOWLEDGE OF SELF: Once the diagnosis of a learning disability is established, it is criticalthat the child learns as much as possible about the disabilities. Someone,probably the diagnostician or special education professional working with himor her must share this information. The only difference between explaining toa five year old or to a 15 year old is the style of communicating. For theyounger child, the information might be very general. "You learn better whenyou hear things than when you see things." As he or she gets older, moredetails can be added. When explaining the learning disabilities, it isessential that the learning abilities be stressed as well. It us alsoimportant to stress who will be helping the child or adolescent overcome theseproblems. The special education tutor or other professional working with the child oradolescent with a learning disability is critical to this educational process.The traditional model for tutoring or for providing speech and languagetherapy, occupational therapy, or other intervention is a passive model. "Sitdown and start to work on the pages I marked in this workbook." or "Today I amgoing to say a group of words and ask you to tell me what they mean." Thechild or adolescent has no idea why he or she is doing the exercise and has noopportunity to learn about himself or herself. What a difference if the tutorwere to say, "You know that you have a visual figure-ground problem and thatbecause of this you might skip words or lines when you read. I want you towork with me on this exercise that will help you become more aware of thisproblem so that you can learn to correct yourself." Or, "I have been workingon helping you improve your auditory perception skills. Today I am going tosay a group of words that sound similar so that we can practice helping you tominimize this problem area." The passive model makes the student dependent andoften ignorant of the reason for the work. The active model helps the studentlearn more about his or her disabilities and abilities. By middle school or high school, the tutor or other professional working withthe student must shift to the role of consultant and helper. thus forcing thestudent to clarify his or her needs. The usual model is for the tutor to say,"Today I want to show you a way of sequencing and organizing materials beforeyou begin to outline and then write a paper." Suppose the tutor went overprevious work, gradually helping the student see how his or her problem withsequencing and organization interfered with writing papers. Then, the tutorsaid, "It looks as if you will need to learn how to compensate for yoursequencing and organization problems if you are to put all of your excellentthoughts down in a paper. I need to help you learn how to compensate. Let mesuggest an approach." By high school, the student needs to be in control andto see the tutor or other professional as an assistant, helping him or hersucceed. The student should come in and say, "This teacher lectures a lot. IfI just listen to her I understand. But, then I go home with no notes and haveto trust my memory. If I try to take notes, my written language problem messesme up and I end up with poor and incomplete notes. Worse. I am so busy tryingto take notes, I cannot pay attention and listen. What do I do?" With knowledge comes understanding and a sense of control. Parents, teachers,and members of the special education team must increasingly push theindividual to problem solve. It would be easier if the special educationprofessional spoke to the classroom teacher. But, by high school the studentmust understand what needs to be done. If students do not learn to be theirown advocate in high school, they will not be able to be their own advocateafter high school. How do parents and professionals teach an adolescent to take on theresponsibilities of being their own advocate? This must be done in astep-by-step process. First, the parent or professional must becomeknowledgeable and become the assertive advocate. Next, this adult must modelthrough their actions and later through role playing how to be a successfuladvocate. After modeling, it is essential that the responsibility berelinquished to the adolescent. The parent or professional must trust that theadolescent can do the task. Unless the adolescent feels that he or she didwhat was needed, he or she cannot take ownership for the outcome or accept thesuccess as belonging to him or her. Finally, the parent or professional mustbe there to cheer and praise the adolescent for his or her success. First comes knowledge of self. This knowledge improves self-esteem. Then thestudent sees parents and professionals advocating. Next comes demonstrationson how to advocate as they watch how the adults do it. Finally, the studentmust learn to be his or her own advocate. Building the Child's Self-esteem Self-esteem is usually defined along two themes. It is based in part onoutside feedback and in part on internal feedback. That is, it is based onperceived appraisals of significant others and based on the individual'sfeelings of performance and competence. The outside feedback representsinferred social approval while the internal feedback represents self approval. If a child or adolescent is unsuccessful in school, his or her self-concept,self-image, self-confidence, and self-respect can only be low. He or shecannot be talked out of this assessment because these impressions are acollection of real experiences. When this child or adolescent sensesdissatisfaction with his or her efforts and hears the suggestion that he orshe is not working up to potential, self-doubt moves in. When the best effortsare met with criticism, failure, and frustration, self-doubt increases as doesa sense of inadequacy. The poor self-esteem of the child with a disability will be compounded if heor she is also unsuccessful with peers and/or within the family. It appearsthat he or she is inadequate every place. Gradually, a cycle may begin. Lowself esteem impacts on academic work and on the individual's personality,resulting in even less successful experiences in school and out of school.These failures lead to a greater loss of self esteem. As discussed throughout this chapter, it is critical for the individual with alearning disability to be identified early and for all of the essentialservices to be made available throughout his or her education. It is equallycritical that the family understand the learning disabilities and theessential role parents must play in helping to maximize success with peers andin home-based and other activities. With the help of the school system and thefamily and with an opportunity to learn about self, the individual with alearning disability will feel good about himself or herself and build a goodsense of self-esteem. Only with this knowledge and self-esteem can any childor adolescent move toward self advocacy I can do no better job of illustrating the concept of self-esteem and theimpact of a learning disability than to let Jill explain for herself. Shewrote this essay (copied exactly as she wrote it) as a college Englishassignment and sent it to me shortly after starting college. We had workedtogether since she entered middle school and she understood her learningdisabilities and special needs. It was this knowledge of herself that helpedher describe her life. I think that when I was born I was put in a rocket ship and taken to anotherplanet - earth. I never felt that I was like anyone else here. From the time Iwas five, I can recall feeling like an outsider. I first remember feeling likean alien when I tried to communicate. People would raise their eyebrows andmake other facial expressions of confusion when I tried to express myself. Iwas aware of starting a sentence in my head but only the last half came out ofmy mouth. I know how E.T. must have felt. It was like I was speaking anotherlanguage and thinking on another wave length. Constant rejection createdfeelings of isolation and isolation created anger and anger creates selfdefeat. I could not judge time and was anxious about being late. I never got ajoke (no matter how simple) because it was abstract, and I could never getmyself or my work in order because of my sequencing problems. Printing wasmurder because of my perceptual problems and my spacing was the worst. I couldnever remember anything but the first part of a direction and the noise levelof the then popular "open classroom" drove me crazy. I always wondered whyeveryone got everything the teacher did but me. Definitely wrong planet! I found one accepting person to be friends with and stuck to her like glue.Most of my anger at my environment and my inability to control it or even makesense out of it was directed at my parents and brother because I knew theycouldn't leave me like the others, no matter what I did. Once I kicked a holein the wall because I couldn't find my shoes and that proved how dumb I reallywas. Only a moron could lose their shoes - I wanted to kick myself but was atleast smart enough to choose the wall instead. It was so hard getting througheveryday life; things that other people automatically did required constantthought and concern for me. To protect myself, I built a wall around myself. I could only handle myself and my needs. No one else mattered, not my familyor friends. My family was angry at my self-centered ways. I was the blacksheep - the alien - the different one. I never understood why everyone was soangry with me. Why didn't they understand that I was just surviving? Mydaydreams were of me in a rough and choppy ocean where a storm was raging. Iwas all alone in the middle of a great black sea. It took all of my strengthjust to stay above the water. I had no energy left to call for help or evennotice if anyone else was around. That's how my life was. I had to beself-centered to survive. School was no haven. The teachers said I was unmotivated and not payingattention. Some even yelled at me and physically shook me. One teacherwho really thought she understood learning disabilities would say "doeseveryone understand?" And then she turned to me, as the class followed hergaze, and said, "and do you, Jill?" I suddenly felt my antenne'ssprouting from my head. Everyone knew I was different when I was taken fromthe room for tutoring and later I had to lie about special teachers and the"resource room" (a place for the "slower kids") In school, it's everyteenagers nightmare to be different. By high school my conversations had improved to the point where I was acceptedas an "airhead" but I still had to keep my special "help room" a secret. Withcareful planning I could sneak into the resource room just as the bell rangand everyone was out of the halls. Talk about being different - when someoneasked who my English teacher was, no one knew her because only "SPEDS"(Special Education students) had her and normal kids didn't know she existed.High school was a turning point. I started noticing things. Dr. Silver, apsychiatrist who really understands how to explain learning disabilities, mademe aware of ways to compensate for my shortcomings. I began to read peoplefrom their faces and body language. If their faces looked confused, I wouldsay, "Did I say something wrong?" Or, I would make a joke. Sometimes I wouldjust start over. Dr. Silver showed me how to use little tricks to get aroundmy disabilities like leaning forward to concentrate on a professor's lectureand this trick also helped force out disturbing background noises. Dr. Silverexplained that with my auditory discrimination problems, bars with largecrowds would become very difficult social meeting places for me. I feel likeI'm there, people are there. Music is there but I'm in a plastic bubbleseparated from everyone. All the noises, the conversation, the band, theglasses clinking - all are amplified and blended together like a senselessdrone. I can't hear anyone's conversation because I only hear parts of whatthey say and none of it makes sense. I try to fill in the missing parts but myanswers must be off the wall from the reactions I got. I keep thinking in themiddle of everyone having fun. "Scotty, beam me up. Get me out of here!!" At college, there is a wonderful learning disabilities program. The term L.D.has come to mean learning desirable to me. I have found my planet! People likeme do exist and they aren't crazy. We even joke about being L.D. Its like aprivate club and its not impopular. At dinner, if someone forgets theirsilverware there is a chorus of L.D., L.D., L.D. and a knowing smile ofacceptance. (Once, four of us got lost driving to a dance and my friend, thedriver, said, "Oh, no! Four L.D.s and not one has a pencil." She quicklyassigned one part of the directions to each of us. "You remember the firstpart, you the second, and you the third." We all laughed at ourselves. At thiscollege I cannot use L.D. as an excuse. I found that in real life no one caresif I'm L.D. They only care if I don't try. Its results that count, notexcuses. I really wanted to be a radio d.j., but I knew that with mydisabilities it would be impossible. How could I "cue"" records, answer phonerequests, and check scripts all at the same time. But, guess what? The girlvoted "Biggest Airhead - Class of 1984" just got her F.M. license. Everyonefrom professors to students had quizzed me whenever they saw me. No one let mequit. Life is still not a breeze. My friends, who say they understand, still get madwhen I say I can't listen to the radio, talk, and hear directions at the sametime. They still can't believe it when I go left when they say right.Actually, I have more trouble understanding why I do the exact opposite, but Iknow I'm not dumb or an airhead. That's how my brain works or doesn't work.That's me. I'm not different. I'm special! No one is more sensitive to othersthan I am. I am my own friend and I have recently begun to feel better aboutmyself and to like myself. I am having success. I will be an L.D. forever. Itwill never go away, but each day I learn to handle another thing or worksomething out and things get better for me. How many people can say that?? BUILDING THE ADOLESCENT'S ABILITY TO DO SELF ADVOCACY For a person with a learning disability to be successful in any post secondaryexperiences, he or she must understand his or her needs and know how to be aninformed and assertive advocate. Parents can no longer play this role. Asdiscussed earlier, parents are the advocates for the child. By middle schoolparents and teachers must teach the young adolescent the role of being anadvocate. By high school, the older adolescent must become his or her ownadvocate. Let me illustrate. John was in twelfth grade. He requested to meet with hisEnglish teacher, Mr. Bratten, during the time in August when teachers reportedto work but school had not yet started for the students. John introducedhimself and explained that he had personally selected him as his Englishteacher. He then went on to say that he had a reading disability and could notread very fast. But, the teacher did not have to worry. John had visited theteacher in June and gotten the list of books to read during the course. He hadread the first four over the summer to get a head start. He knew he would havea lot of difficulty with one book and had ordered it on audiotape. Thus, hedid not ask for accommodations for reading time. However, he explained that hedid not read well out loud, often mispronouncing words. He asked if theteacher would mind not calling on him in class to read. He went on to explainthat he had a written language problem and could not write as fast as hewanted to. He also made spelling and grammar errors. He asked for more time ontests so that he could finish and that the teacher not grade him down forspelling. He commented that he would do all home assignments on his computerand did not need special consideration then. Mr. Bratten thanked him forcoming in and agreed to help in every way possible. Let's go over John's conversation to see how well he knew himself and hisspecial needs and how he had learned to be his own advocate. He did not saythat he personally picked this teacher to impress the teacher. He knew how helearned and what style of teacher was best for him. During the end of hisjunior year, he asked all of his friends in the senior class to describe theirEnglish teacher. He picked the one who taught in the way that he learned best.His special education teacher made sure he got that teacher. We often tell children and adolescents with learning disabilities that they"just learn differently" and that with special help they can do well byworking just as hard as everyone else. John knew this was not true. If youhave a disability and want to succeed, you have to work harder than theaverage student and you have to plan ahead. He was willing to use part of hissummer preparing for the course because he wanted to succeed. John knew something else, If his mother had met with the teacher and read offthe list of accommodations, the teacher would have probably said, "Look, Ihave 30 kids per class and five classes a day. If your son cannot make it in aregular class, he should not be in my class." He knew that the teacher wouldbe more willing to listen to him, especially if he sounded responsible andmore than willing to do his share of the work. Think of the knowledge John hadof himself. Think of the self-confidence and self-esteem needed to meet with his teacherin this way. Think of how successful he was as an advocate. Since he did itall himself, he could claim ownership and could claim the success. None ofthis could have happened if the education and modeling work had not startedwhen he was a child. To be a successful advocate for oneself, then, requires first of all a fullknowledge of one's learning disabilities, learning abilities, and specialneeds. With this knowledge, the person can look ar new subjects, new teachers,new experiences and project what will go well and what will require specialtime, help, or accommodations. He or she can then plan ahead and advocate forthese needs. With this knowledge and advocacy role, the adolescent and youngadult feels in control of life and not helpless. There is confidence gainedwhen a student knows what he or she needs and how to fight for these needs. Advocacy takes place with friends as well. If she or he has a receptive orexpressive language problem, communicating with friends might be a majorproblem. If he or she has visual perception or visual motor problems, certainactivities or sports might be difficult. He or she needs to assess situationsand decide how to compensate and cope. Perhaps it means selecting certainactivities over others. Perhaps it means meeting with key people in advanceand learning what to expect. Perhaps it means disclosing to a friend so thatfriend will understand and hopefully help. As with the earlier example ofMarie, the adolescent might need to learn how to be a self-advocate bydiscussing the issues with an adult and, possibly, by modeling the necessaryactions with this adult before trying with the real person. IN SUMMARY Whether as a parent or a professional, helping the child or adolescent with alearning disability requires a full understanding of the total person in hisor her total world for each stage of psycho-social development. It is clearthat more is needed than appropriate special education interventions. Schooltime represents about half of the total world for the child or adolescent. Therole of the family in helping i$ critical as is the help that can be providedby the leaders of outside of school activities. The special education team must understand the child's or adolescent'slearning disabilities and abilities in order to develop the bestindividualized education plan and interventions. This knowledge is criticalfor the regular classroom teachers if they are to be able to accommodate andadapt the curriculum, teaching style, and classroom. This knowledge is essential for the parents. They must know their son's ordaughter's areas of learning disability and learning ability if they are toaccommodate and adapt the family to provide the supportive and nurturing homeneeded by the child or adolescent with a learning disability. Only with thisknowledge can they intelligently select chores, home activities, sports, andother peer activities that build on strengths while minimizing, accommodating,or compensating for the weaknesses. This knowledge is equally essential to the child or adolescent who haslearning disabilities. She or he must understand fully their learningdisabilities and learning abilities if they are to understand themselves andif they are to learn to accept and develop a positive image of self. Only withthis knowledge can they understand their special needs and learn to selfadvocate to get these needs met. With this knowledge, school programs can be designed to help the student witha learning disability fit in and succeed. With this knowledge, parents canprovide the proper family and can maximize social and peer successes. Withthis knowledge, the individual can accept, understand, and like himself orherself. This knowledge of the needs of a child or adolescent with a learningdisability, when applied to the total world he or she lives in, results in thedevelopment of a positive self-image and a strong feeling of self-esteem. Withsuch feelings, this student will be available to learn to be a self advocate.The successes that result from being an informed and assertive advocate willfeed back to increase the feelings of self. First comes knowledge. Knowledge is the key to self-esteem and the abilityto self advocate. SUGGESTED READING Books Osman, Betty B.: Learning Disabilities. A Family Affair.

Carr, M.Ed. Due to size, this paper is divided into three parts: Part 1: Beginnings of School-Based Management (this part) Part 2: Forms of School-BasedManagement Part 3: Making School-Based ManagementSucceed Beginnings of school-based management American schools in the 1950s and decades following searched for"equality of opportunity." Although living in America became increasingly complex with fundamental changes occurring in the American family and society in general, schools were made responsible for educating a greater range of students than ever before. In special education, for example, in the 1970s, students were brought into the public schools who had never been allowed previous enrollment. Between the 1950s and 1980s the focus of public attention gradually began to shift from equality to concern for greater productivity from schools. The public was bombarded with stories about failures of the public school system. Schools found themselves responsible for all children and, at the same time, the recipients of an unprecedented demand for "excellence ineducation." During the 1980-81 school year the writer was teaching aspecial education class for severe emotionally disturbed children at atypical elementary school in Fort Worth, Texas. The students were busedto the school from all over the district because of the severity of theirdisabilities. As part of a district-wide pilot program, this school was involved in an effort to get more parental involvement, more parental "say so"in the school. The principal selected several teachers to work withparent leaders on a "school management team" which met at leastonce a month. The principal invited other faculty members to attend themeetings to promote awareness. A few teachers elected to attend themeetings, mostly out of a sense of curiosity to see if some of the rumorswere correct. Some of the parents began to take pads and pencils into classrooms, making notes about strategies and methods being used by individual teachers in instruction, discipline, and other aspects of daily routine. Some of the parents took rather vocal exception to a few of the things they reported. A number of the meetings, especially in the beginning, were hostile, divisive, and marked by defensive stances on the part of school personnel. Attendance at those meetings was the very first exposure for some of us to the latest fad coming down from on high -- parental involvement and participatory management. I remember retreating to the safety of my self-contained special education class, grateful that no members of the management team were selected from my classroom. Reform received impetus in April, 1983, with the release of ANation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform. Thisdocument, prepared by the National Commission on Excellence in Education,represented a "report card" on educational quality in America.Created because of the public outcry for reform, ANation at Risk codified the status of American education: American students fared poorly when compared with students fromother nations, millions of American were functionally illiterate, standardized test scores were lower, achievement of gifted students was not commensurate with expectancy, Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores were declining overall, highest SAT scores were lower, students were unable to demonstrate "high level thinkingskills," scores on measures of science and math were lower, achievement scores of college graduates were lower, and business and the military complained they were having to spendmillions of dollars to remediate their employees or recruits. Recommendations to improve the sorry state of American education included increased graduation requirements, stringent and more demanding assessments, more instructional time devoted to the "basics," and far morerigorous teacher training. The final recommendation was one ofaccountability--educators and elected officials were made responsible foreducational improvement and reform. The prevailing popular thought during this time was that excellence could be achieved by a series of top-down mandates including implementation of merit pay, career ladders, mentoring programs, more stringent graduation requirements, restrictions of extracurricular activities for poor academic performance, denial of driver's licenses for school dropouts, exit tests, etc. Research suggested, however, that excellence in teaching and learning proved to be elusive. Reforms left teaching and learning either unaffected or negatively affected by these efforts (cited by Midgley and Wood, 1993).In 1985 the writer was named principal at a school which served two distinct minority populations - Hispanic and southeast Asian. Each group made up approximately one-quarter of the total population of students. The school had a history of high achievement which had fallen in recent times. Texas had responded to the reform movement with a vast array of edicts and mandates covering everything from the numbers of minutes of instruction for various subjects taught in school to site-adopted frameworks and curricula, instructional strategies, student grouping, methodology, and the like. Achievement was to be measured by statistics on dropouts, attendance, and state-wide tests whose results were published in the newspapers and were to be used to compare schools and their efforts at "excellence." Site-based management was also being mandated in the district. From the beginning, management teams were composed of both teachers and parents. Both were now to be elected from their constituent groups. The success or failure of the teams appeared to be contingent on the make-up of the team, and, most importantly, upon the willingness of the principal to share decision-making. There was little training provided. Principals were guided by a written report which included how the members were to be selected, etc. My first management teams were used as advisory boards to help makedecisions which would affect the entire school. I had begun myadministration by implementing collaborative decision-making with theteachers. It made sense that if you wanted teachers to do something, andto do it well, you had to give teachers not only the responsibility butalso the need to make it succeed. Teachers would have to "buyin" to what they were doing if they were to really devote themselves,their time and energy to success! It also made sense that parents wouldhave to have some "buy in." We had little parental involvementat their school in terms of numbers, but those who became involved werededicated and insightful in their recognition of problems and search for solutions. With strong support from the teachers and management team we began such innovations at the school as a volunteer program to teach English to parents ("hooking" the parents into coming under the guise of teachingthem to help their children with homework). The students actually beganto tutor their parents in speaking and reading English. Writtencommunications were sent from the school, whenever possible, in Lao aswell as English and Spanish. All teachers were required to obtainendorsements in instruction of English as Second Language (ESL). Our program for limited English proficient (LEP) students was total English immersion--non-English speakers were placed in their age-level peer classrooms regardless of their English-speaking ability. A modified Joplin plan was followed whereby students went all over the school to have their reading and math instruction. It was not uncommon for students from a fourth grade homeroom to have reading in a first or second grade room with mathematics at the fourth grade level. Older students in younger classrooms were called "assistants," and they were allowed to progress as slowly or asquickly as they needed to master components of the curriculum. Whileother schools in the district were doing away with reading levels andreading level assessments, we were using them to measure relativestrengths and weaknesses, to advance students, and to reteach untilmastery was attained. As a result of changes supported by the management team, gains in English acquisition and scores on state-wide tests were documented. The school received recognition from the National Council of Teachers of English as a "site of excellence in language arts instruction" as a resultof the writing process implementation and concomitant achievement. In 1986 the Carnegie Forum published a report, A NationPrepared. This report called for "restructuring" schoolsin order to provide a professional environment for teachers (cited inO'Neil, 1990). With the advent of this publication, nay-sayers werealready dooming recommendations put into place as a result of theearlier A Nation at Risk. In 1990 the National Governors Associationissued a report, Results in Education: 1989 which provided a "framework" for "restructuring" (cited in O'Neil,1990). Included in the framework were the following: Curriculum and instruction. More instruction in higher-orderthinking skills, flexible time usage, challenging and engaginginstructional activities, grouping promoting studentinteraction and cooperation. Authority and decision making. Decentralization to allow teachers,parents, and administrators to determine the direction of education at aschool site as well as instructional organization, strategies, andarrangements. New staff roles. Principals to provide vision and leadership toencourage teachers in taking risk, to reward their efforts; teachers towork collegially to improve instruction, plan/develop new curriculum, design/implement professional development. Accountability systems. Building-level consequences for studentperformance, schools develop measures to assess performance outcomes. With the two-pronged thrust for change and reform, a strange"wash" occurred in education. School-based management becameintertwined almost irrevocably with "restructuring." One way todemonstrate what happened is perhaps to visualize restructuring as agreat canopied tree in midsummer into which a vine, school-basedmanagement, has proved so invasive that an observer looking at the tree cannot differentiate its leaves from those of the vine. The definition of restructuring became confused. To some,restructuring implies fundamental reform, changes in curriculum andinstruction, changes in school organization and administration, provisionof supportive work environment for teachers, business-to-school andschool-to-school partnerships and networks, and increased parentalinvolvement. This, however, is not the prevailing view of restructuring.For many, restructuring means shared governance, "School-basedmanagement is the reform" (Midgley and Wood, 1993).

And, to assure that those modifications arenot unduly restrictive, in violation of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment, a written plan must be developed which is based on the uniqueneeds of that one child with a disability and which will direct the classroomteacher and other school personnel in dealing with that child for the comingyear. The IEP meeting is the heart of the special education laws. It is ananalysis of what is going right in a child's education and what is goingwrong. It is the blueprint for next year's program. The teacher is vitalto the development of the IEP, in speaking up about how the program wentthis year, what is needed for changes next year, and what problems mightbe foreseen for the next teacher. Laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and theEducation of All Handicapped Children Act (PL 94-142), now the Individualswith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) were passed by Congress more than20 years ago specifically to make teachers and school districts aware thatthey were discriminating against students with disabilities and that suchdiscrimination hurts. The laws were passed to order school districts andteachers to change. Twenty years later we are facing much of the same discriminationand intolerance from school officials and teachers when it comes to endingdiscrimination because they often refuse to change. I always have to point out to teachers that IEP meetings are not a paperworkburden, which is the usual teacher union and administrator position, butare the judicially and congressionally required method to end discriminationagainst students with disabilities. It must be upsetting when I remind people that we are completing the19th school year requiring full compliance with Section 504 and the 19thyear requiring full compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Act.When school districts accepted funds under IDEA they had to promise tocomply with it and with Section 504 and promise to train regular classroomteachers and administrators in the provisions of IDEA. Apparently, very often in talks, I must explain in too great detailwhat the law requires of teachers who deal with students with disabilities.Teachers seem to get upset when it becomes clear in such presentationsthat teachers generally do not know what the law requires, teachers learntheir school is probably far out of compliance with the law, and they donot like the law because they don't understand it and would prefer to ignoreit. After a recent speech, a good friend said, "I'm concerned thatyou really upset some of our teachers." However, the usual complaintthat I get is from parents, who report that too many teachers are upsettingour children with disabilities - refusing to comply with the IEP and makingstudents with disabilities the subject of repeated disciplinary sanctions. So what did I sat that leads people to accuse me of upsetting someteachers? In a discussion with Dr. Ed Martin who was head of the Bureauof Education for the Handicapped (now called Office of Special EducationPrograms) at the time the Education for All Handicapped Children Act waspassed into law, we talked about those early days and Appendix C to thefederal regulations. Ed knew that implementation of the law would requiresimple straightforward guidance toward compliance. He created AppendixC, and asked me among others to help with practical questions and answersabout the IEP process. Appendix C is sixty questions and answers aboutthe IEP process. Appendix C is as much a part of the law as any of theregulations that it explains and has been quoted as the law by courts inall of the federal circuits. To date, I haven't met a teacher that has read Appendix C even thoughAppendix C tells teachers exactly what is expected of them at the IEP meeting.I am sure that there are a lot of good IEPs out there, but what I hearwhen I listen to tapes of IEP meetings are two voices: the parent's andthe administrator's. If there are a teacher's comments on the tape, toooften they are supporting the school district on some policy and explainingto the parents why their request cannot be accommodated. Every school district has a booklet that urges the parents to get involvedin their child's education. Many surveys blame the decline in educationon parents not being involved. Yet when a parent makes a request to seetheir child's records as a first step in getting involved, the requestmay be denied or the acquisition made difficult. Letters from administrators and even school board members are produced,which criticize the parents for making such a request. Many parents whocontact me fear retaliation if they ask to see their child's records. But most disputes arise because teachers will not share their notesabout a child with the parents. In a current (but not the only) case theteacher comes to the IEP meeting, reads from a folder of notes, then refusesto allow the parent to see them. The teacher always insists they are privatenotes and that the teacher's right to privacy supersedes the parents' rightsthat are spelled out in the 1974 Family Educational Rights and PrivacyAct and IDEA. Teachers are unhappy to learn for the first time what thelaw has been for over 20 years and that they can not choose to play bydifferent rules. Continual problems also arise when students with disabilities are inregular ed where the teacher believes in the status quo: the teacherruns the classroom and the student must conform or suffer. Inclusionsets up this controversy wherever there is a failure of educational leadershipto develop appropriate program modifications and acquaint regularclassroom teachers with the requirements of the law. The basic fact isthat the child with a disability has a right to be in the class and theteacher has to make reasonable accommodations. As we require the teacher to modify the classroom to meet students'needs, we may shift our suspicion for the reason for failure in the classroomfrom the student, who doesn't try hard enough to the teacher, whoisn't able to reach the student. That concept is difficult for manyteachers. At the IEP meeting, the competency of the teacher to handle aparticular student may well be on the table. The teacher might be directedto learn a different methodology or employ a different behavior managementapproach. I have been in several cases where a teacher who won last year's Teacherof the Year Award in that state, and who is wonderful for gifted students,has shown an inability to teach a student with learning disabilities. Whenthe law is explained to such a teacher, it must be upsetting. Many teacherswho do not understand the IEP process complain about it taking too muchtime. Many teachers, who never speak up at the IEP, will follow me into theparking lot and say "I hope you pursue this because our program ishurting your child." When I ask, naively, "Aren't you the teacherwho a few minutes ago was sitting in the meeting that was called to discussthat very problem?", the teacher will say "Oh, but I couldn'tsay anything in front of the administrator." The law requires theteacher to speak up. It must surprise teachers and administrators who arecomplaining about lawbreaking in the schools when I say the biggest lawbreakersin the schools are not the students. I guess I will continue to upset teachers and administrators when Iforce them to realize how far they are out of compliance with the law.Noncompliance is discrimination and discrimination hurts children. I personallydo not think people who hurt children belong in the classroom. And I amsorry if that upsets anyone. ____________________ Reed Martin is an attorney with Martin and Bishop, Attorneys atLaw, Houston, Texas.

Cessation of educationalservices will not be mentioned, but proposals to allow cessation will nodoubt be introduced. Hearings - one on discipline and one on funding -will be held on February 4 and 6, and the full Economic and EducationalOpportunities Committee is expected to mark up the final bill in the secondweek in March. Senate Labor and Human Services Committee Chairman Jim Jeffordsalso expects to act swiftly on the reauthorization. The Subcommittee onDisability Policy has been eliminated, so, as in the House, there willbe no opportunity for input before the full committees act on the bill. Time is short and the need to help Congressmen understand the importanceof IDEA for students with learning disabilities is great. Almost a thirdof the 45 members of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committeeare new, as are many of the members of the Senate Labor and Human ServicesCommittee. However, because of the short time frame, it is vital that ALLmembers of Congress hear from their constituents. IDEA is only the firstof the bills affecting individuals with LD which will be reauthorized bythe 105th Congress. Input will be needed as well when bills reauthorizingthe Rehabilitation Act, the Higher Education Act, the Juvenile JusticeAct, and the Vocational Education Act are introduced. A list of the addresses, phone and fax numbers of members of relevantcommittees is attached. Please keep this list for future reference. Remember,personal contacts are the most effective way of reaching Congressmen. Otherways of making an impact, in descending order, are personal letters orpostcards, form letters, or phone calls. Letters or faxes have more impactthan e-mail. However, anything is better than nothing. Please add your personal input to the following sample letter. LDA'sposition on last year's IDEA bills was sent to all state and localpresidents and to the network. It is posted on the LDA Home Page on theInternet and was reprinted in the Washington Update section of the Nov./Dec.1996 Issue of Newsbriefs. Please add your own experiences, - particularlyabout the difficulty of determining eligibility for students with learningdisabilities who are performing at grade level only because of their effortsand the support of their families Stories about the success of studentswho benefited from IDEA are also needed. SAMPLE LETTER FOR THE REAUTHORIZATION OF IDEA TO A SENATOR The Honorable (Full name) U.S. Senate Washington, DC 20510 TO A REPRESENTATIVE The Honorable (Full name) U.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Senator (last name) Dear Congressman (woman)(last name) I am (an individual with LD, a parent of a child with LD, a professionalworking in the field of LD). I am asking you to support the continued federalcommitment to the education of ALL children with disabilities as promisedby IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Despite its flaws,children with disabilities have greatly benefited from that law. Societyhas also benefited as more IDEA graduates have gone on to higher educationand competitive employment. (EXAMPLES HERE) One of the first acts of the 105th Congress is expected to be the reauthorizationof IDEA. I hope that this reauthorization will make very few changes toPart B of IDEA Many of the positive changes proposed in the Reauthorizationbills which died at the end of the 105th Congress could be brought aboutby regulatory changes. I am afraid that other changes, particularly thosewhich would deny educational services to certain students with disabilitiesor would curtail their rights, would severely limit their opportunity toobtain an appropriate education. (Attached is LDA's position on the IDEAbills introduced in the 104th Congress.). I will let you know of specific concerns when the bills are introduced.In the meantime, I would be happy to discuss IDEA with you at any time.My telephone number is Thank you Name AND address SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE, 105TH CONGRESS 428 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.

Why? Does your child have an uneven pattern of "Can Do's" and "Can'tDo's"? You may worry that your child is not developing like other pre-schoolersin some ways. Development may be confusing unpredictable erratic inconsistent Consider Your Child's Preschool Skills Below are frequent comments describing common characteristics ofpreschoolers who might be at risk for being identified as having alearning disability. "He knocks over blocks, bumps into doors, falls out of his chair,crashes into playmates and catapults himself through space." poor estimation of space poor coordination tendency to lurch forward double jointed sitting "Her big eyes look up at me and she listens, but I don't seem to getthrough." problem understanding what is said difficulty remembering what she hears problem remembering sequences of sounds over-sensitivity to noise doesn't enjoy being read to difficulty following simple directions "He understands what I say to him but doesn't express himself well." delayed speech and language sounds and words out of sequence (aminals, pasghetti) poor vocabulary "He overreacts or underreacts to everything - it's as though hisemotional thermostat isn't working." indiscriminate or overreactions loss of emotional control laughter one moment, crying the next under or overreaction to touch "She can talk about topiary trees, but she can't pull up a zipper ordraw a circle." difficulty using hands to manipulate toys, buttons, etc. difficulty, or avoidance of, playing with puzzles and blocks clumsiness, knocking over glasses of milk, juice "His vision is good, yet he doesn't seem to perceive things well." difficulty focusing problems distinguishing shapes and colors difficulty remembering what he sees difficulty remembering the order/sequence of what he sees difficulty understanding what he sees "He never seems to be 'put together' right, yet I spend so much moretime and energy helping him than the other children." untied shoes, shirt hanging out disorganized movement difficulty keeping up with his things Often it is the parents who first have concerns when their toddlers arenot "on target" in their development. Sometimes areas of delayeddevelopment are first detected in the doctor's office. It often takeslonger to notice uneven development patterns than to notice overalldelayed development. Warning signs are just that . . . warnings. They don't necessarily mean there are problems, but they should bediscussed with your pediatrician or family physician at your next visit.If your toddler is developing normally, your doctor will be able toreassure you. Early intervention with a child who is behind in social, cognitive,fine motor, gross motor, and/or language development can make a world ofdifference. If you see some of these signs in your child, you want tocontact your school district, primary physician, or the local, state ornational LDA office for information. They can guide you on where to startin determining whether your child has some delays in areas of development. Federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities IDEA), provides for afree and appropriate education for all children with disabilities. Thisincludes early intervention for preschool children who need specialeducation services.

This stems from the similarity of parent complaints: the teacher refuses to comply with the their childï¿½sIEP, or the teacher subjects our children to unfair and unnecessarydisciplinary sanctions, and in some cases the teacher simply does not seem to care. So, if we, speaking as lawyers who represent many parents,offend teachers it is because our clients demand that we do so. Ourusual defense, however, is that it is the law and the requirements of the law that upset teachers and we, lawyers, are merely the messengers. Upon calm reflection, one must wonder what it is about lawyers thatupsets teachers and school personnel. Is it the way we present issues,blaming the problems on the school administration and teachers? Or, is itthe requirements of the law (IEPs, related services, dealing withparents)? While either of the above reasons would be sufficient to upsetteachers, we really believe that it was neither but was something else.Presenting the requirements of the law merely contributed to and gavefocus to a sense of frustration and possibly anger that was there beforethe presentation. The something else, we believe, are therestraints keeping the professional teacher from doing a professional job. We sometimes lose sight of the fact that whether we are lawyers,teachers, factory workers, entrepreneurs, or public service employees, weall have some attributes in common. If we are successful, it is because we have found a method of doing things that leads to success. Success as we use the term is adding quality to whateverwe do. To the factory worker success is producing a better, more reliableproduct while to the entrepreneur success may be earning higher profitsor capital appreciation. To lawyers, success is making our clients happyor, at a minimum, reducing their unhappiness to an acceptable level. Toteachers, however, success is feeling that sense of accomplishment whenone sees the incidents of self esteem blossom in a student as it becomes clear that the student is learning what the teacher is teaching andperhaps much more. The teacher's vision and goal is growth and happinessfor their students in the sense of the students' realization of their individual potential as reflected by each student's individual abilities. Like the rest of us, teachers have developed and honed their skillsover the years by improving on the methods that were successful anddiscarding the methods that resulted in failure until reaching a point of adopting specific teaching methods which work well for the majority ofstudents. It is no wonder that the teacher becomes frustrated to the point ofanger when given a student with learning disabilities, who not onlydefies all known teaching methods, but reacts to his or her frustration at being unable to learn like the others by disrupting the class. Thisstudent who inherently wants to please the teacher does the opposite, andit frustrates the teacher, who inherently wants the student to learn and be successful. This is not only a problem today, but it was the situation 20 yearsago which was one of the reasons Congress passed PL 94-142. One wouldthink that we should have corrected the situation by now. Thus, the realissue is, why hasn't it been corrected? If a factory worker wereexperiencing 7% to 12% rejects in the product being manufactured, thatworker would not only not feel successful, the business would probably benear bankruptcy. By analogy, is our education program with its 7% to 12% failure rate near bankruptcy? If we can use our assets wisely, the answeris no. If we waste our assets, bankruptcy is inevitable. Our assetsthat need to be used wisely are the wisdom and the integrity of the professional teacher. Let us suggest as an opening premise that any teacher proud of his orher profession would very much look forward to IEP meetings if theteacher (1) knew at the time what would be a successful program for a student with learning disabilities; (2) were free to prescribe theprogram, and (3) the school had the ability and the willingness toimplement the program. In such events, the object of the IEP meetingwould be focused on obtaining the parents' input and the parents' help.So why do teachers dread IEP meetings? Anyone in business will tell you that quality is added at the factoryfloor and not from the headquarters. By the same token, educationalquality is added in the classroom -- nowhere else. The federal laws(IDEA, Section 504) assume this premise by directing the IEP to bedeveloped on the educational "factory floor", i.e. the classroom. Wesuggest that it is time for school administrators to assume that samepremise and let teachers be the professionals that they are trained to beand they have learned to be. This would remove the first restraint. The quality problem in special education is the realization thateither no one knows a prescription that will ensure success for students with learning disabilities or, moreprobably, those who know are either afraid to say or have no incentive to say what would be successful. Thisis the second restraint, i.e. silence attributable to fear or lack of incentive to develop a successful plan.Thus the teacher enters the IEP with restraints self-imposed or imposed by the school administration and withlittle hope of success. The teacher feels professionally inadequate as a result. The teacher at theIEP meeting is in very much in the same position that the student with learning disabilities is in when inthe classroom, i.e. an overwhelming dread of facing up to his or her own inadequacy in that particularenvironment. No matter what the outcome in either the IEP meeting or the classroom, there is a very highprobability that both the teacher and the student will be frustrated. One law (the truancy law) makes the student with learning disabilitiesattend school and another law (IDEA) makes the teacher attend IEP meetings. Simply stated, the lawforces both into an environment they both dread and find frustrating. It should not be surprising thatboth react in the same manner. Frustration leads to anger. The anger of both the student and the teacheris directed at the nearest representative of the frustrating cause -- each other. The normal andpredictable reaction of anger born of frustration is either fight or flight. The studentfights with disruptive behavior. The teacher fights with stonewalling the IEP. Alternatively, the studenttakes flight with depression followed by truancy followed by social drop-out. The teacher takes flightby resorting to alternative disciplinary programs or other measures (resource room) to get the causeof frustration out of sight. It is a strange paradox that both the teacher and the student are really comrades-in-arms on different sides of the same battle. The student suffers with learning disabilities for regular education and the teacher suffers with teaching disabilities for special education. Both disabilities result in frustration and anger directed at the law or laws which throw them together in an environment that high lights their respective disabilities. Unfortunately, the law cannot add quality. Only people can add quality. The frustration with the law and the anger directed toward its messengers (lawyers) will begin to subside when the teachers with teaching disabilities and the students with learning disabilities begin to experience success, i.e. when quality is added to the educational process for each. To begin the search for quality, the fight or flight reactions can no longer be viable alternatives. Educational bankruptcy will occur as an inevitable consequence if there is continual failure to address the underlying problem which prevents quality education for persons with disabilities. Most businesses nowadays address quality problems with a team approach. The IEP team is the team approach contemplated by the law. In this sense the law was ahead of its time. The team approach cannot function, however, until the frustration, anger, and resentment is addressed and resolved. This will occur when the team members (parents and teachers) recognize their own limitations and look to other members of the team as people with special expertise that can help. The next barrier to success will be removed when the teacher responds as an independent professional and not as a spokesperson for the school administration. When professional teachers can put the full force of their cumulative wisdom gained from professional training and classroom experience to developing methods to respond to the needs of students with learning disabilities, they will find an effective way to add quality to their teaching and to their studentsï¿½ learning. We, the parents and the lawyers who have lost faith in the educational system, do have faith in the law. But, more importantly, the law still has faith in teachers. By simply following the spirit as well as the letter of the law, teachers will be free to be professional. They need not perjure themselves to protect the administration's policies. They need not corrupt their professional integrity by remaining silent when their professional opinion is sought and needed. They need not undermine their professional authority by placating to the outspoken parent with promises and platitudes. They need not diminish their own self-esteem by disrespect of the parents or the problem student. The laws are designed to free them from restraints. When that freedom -- the freedom to be a professional teacher -- is achieved, quality education will begin.

Total Quality Management: Whatï¿½s in it for Schools? Robert "Mick" McNiel Editorï¿½s note: This article gives furtherinsight into what is meant by "quality education" discussed in therelated article, "Quality Education for Teachers and Special Education Students". Many superintendents, teachers, and local business leaders arestudying the concept of total quality and its focus on continuousimprovement within their organizations. Most school districts are vigorously involved in numeroustransformational efforts, such as site-based management, outcomeassessments, and strategic planning. Is Total Quality Management another educational program that needs to be added to the already filled plate ofeducators? The answer may lie in the fact that much of what we arecurrently doing is part of the concept imbedded in the quality movement. Many might speculate that they are already working long hours, havebeen doing an excellent job for years, and, if people would just leavethem alone, they could get on with what they were hired for the education of children. One might also suggest that everyone in education is doing anoutstanding job, but the threats to public education as we know it mightencourage us to re-evaluate services offered. Todayï¿½s educational challenges include: school choice public funds used for the benefit of private schools private vendors hired to take over educational school systems millions spent by businesses on employee retraining Channel One programming Hooked on Phonics materials The Impact of Total Quality Management (TQM) How can the concepts of Total Quality Management help us? First of all,we need to understand that TQM is not a program; it is a value-based,information-driven process for continuous improvement. (Even Dr. W. Edwards Deming, one of the originators tied to the quality movement,responded negatively to the terminology of TQM. He stated, "There is nosuch thing as a Total Quality Management program. Our focus should be onquality enhancement.") So what is quality? Quality is perceived by the customer; the job ofthe school system is to know customer needs on a daily basis. Educatorshave difficulty with the term customer, but basically it refers to someone who has benefited from your work both internally and externally.Internally, customers might refer to the district administration,faculty, and staff. External customers are the students, parents, businesses, community, and even the Board of Education. Plan, Do, Study, Act Now that your customers are defined, whatï¿½s next? In actuality, it comes down to a plan, do, study, act cycle that allows individuals to: Continually plan for improvement. Carry out improvement plans. Utilize measurement tools to study customer needs in relation toimprovement plans. Continually improve the processes that exceed customer needs. In other words, whatï¿½s good enough for today is not good enough fortomorrow. Total Quality Management focuses on the processes andcontinually improves those processes rather than looking at the end result and blaming people for it. It gives people the ability tobreak down barriers that prevent them from working well together andsharing information. It helps them to focus on problems rather than finger pointing. The hard part of TQM, according to Dr. James Leonard, a consultant inDeming philosophy, is creating an environment in which students,teachers, staff, and parents will accept and fulfill their new roles correctly, effectively, comfortably, and without fear. The Deming Philosophy Managers in manufacturing and business organizations receive usefulguidance for creating the environment from 14 principles developed andtaught by Dr. W. Edwards Deming over the past several decades. Theseprinciples are often referred to as The Deming Philosophy. We all recognize the problems we face in our schools. we all want tosee changes and improvements. The issue becomes one of how to accomplishthese changes. Total Quality Management may not have all the answers, butadditional study of Dr. Demingï¿½s principles might provide a schooldistrict a sound road map for accomplishing desired changes andimprovements. 'The Deming Philosophy': 14 Points Restated for School Boards and Administration: Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of the entire schoolsystem and its services. Adopt a new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Cease dependence on tests and grades to measure quality. Cease dependence on price when selecting curriculum, texts,equipment, and supplies for the district. Improve constantly and forever every process for planning, teaching,learning, and service. Institute a more thorough, better job related training. Drive out fear. Break down barriers between groups in the school system. Eliminate the use of goals, targets, and slogans to encourage performance. Closely examine the impact of teaching standards and the system ofgrading student performance. Remove barriers that rob staff and administration of pride of workmanship and rob students of the job of learning. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement foreveryone in the system. Plan and take action to accomplish the transformation.

He was often referred to affectionately as theFather of Learning Disabilities. Dr. Kirk, who was born in Rugby, North Dakota, in 1904, obtainedbachelors and masters degrees in psychology from the University of Chicagoand a Ph.D. in physiological and clinical psychology from the Universityof Michigan in 1935. He began his career in 1929 in Chicago teaching boyswho were mentally retarded and delinquent to read while employed at theOaks School. Samuel Kirk continued his work on reading during his doctoral studies,while also working at the Wayne County Training School in Michigan. AtWayne Country Training School, Kirk collaborated with T. Hegge and W. Kirkto create the Hegge, Kirk, and Kirk Remedial Reading Drills. Thesematerials, which were influenced by the work of most of the prominentfigures in remedial reading at that time (M. Monroe, S. Orton, and G.Fernald) as well as the effects of Kirk's training in functional(behavioral) psychology at Chicago, are still in use 60 years after theywere developed. The work with physiological psychology during his doctoral studies ledKirk to discount biophysical identifications of disability and recommendmore behavioral descriptions (child doesn't read) that could leadto remedial planning. After completing his Ph.D. in 1935, Kirk worked asthe director of a teacher education program at Milwaukee State TeachersCollege (now University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee). Continuing hisinterests in reading, in 1940 he published the book, Teaching Readingto Slow-Learning Children. His early research on remedial methods forstudents with mental retardation was interrupted by service in the U. S.Army during World War II. In 1947 Dr. Kirk joined the faculty of the University of Illinois todevelop a program in special education for undergraduates and graduates.Much of Dr. Kirk's pioneering work was done while he was Director of theInstitute for Research on Exceptional Children at the University ofIllinois, which he helped to establish and was its first Director. Duringthe 1 960s he also served as director of the Division of HandicappedChildren, forerunner to the US Department of Education's Office of SpecialEducation, in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Later Dr. Kirk devoted considerable effort to developing a means ofmeasuring specific aspects of linguistic, perceptual, and memory abilitiesin young children. The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA)appeared in an experimental version in 1961 and was revised and publishedin 1968 (co-authored with J. McCarthy and W. Kirk). This test, which waswidely used in the 1960s and 70s as a clinical and research tool, provokedsome controversy in special education. Kirk explained that the controversywas probably because the test "spawned many illusions and false hopes.Some people have taken the ITPA as the instrument for diagnosis of allills and educational problems. In spite of our warnings, it is used forjunior high school students, even though it is intended for young children. Many also use it to diagnose problems to which the ITPA does not apply.Furthermore, many people want to use it without taking the time to learnhow to give it." (Reference Kirk, S. A. ( 1976). In J. M. Kauffman & D. P.Hallahan (Eds.), Teaching Children with Learning Disabilities (p.253). Columbus, OH: Merrill.) Throughout his career, Dr. Kirk contributed regularly to the academicliterature. In addition to the volumes already noted, he also publishedother books on mental retardation, reading, and learning disabilities.Certainly one of the most influential of these was an introductory text inspecial education, Educating Exceptional Children (1962), that hasbeen revised repeatedly and, now co-authored by James J. Gallagher, is inits 6th edition. During his tenure in Washington, he contributed to early federallegislation that ultimately led to contemporary laws on special education.Perhaps his greatest legacy to the field of special education is the manystudents who studied with him, including several who have been highlyinfluential figures in special education during the last 30 years. In addition to his scholarly work on mental retardation, Kirk is widelyknown for his contributions to the development of the field of learningdisabilities and is often said to have coined the term learningdisabilities. Dr. Kirk was present when groups of frustrated parents first met toseek help for their children who today we know had learning disabilities.He was instrumental in helping those parents form the Association forChildren with Learning Disabilities (ACLD, now the Learning DisabilitiesAssociation of America, LDA) and served as the first Chairman of itsProfessional Advisory Board. In honor of his devoted service to theorganization and to the field of learning disabilities, he remained theHonorary Chairman of the PAB for the remainder of his life. Much of the progress made in understanding learning disabilities and inserving persons with learning disabilities is attributable to thepioneering work of Samuel A. Kirk and his longtime collaborator and wife,Winifred D . Kirk . We, in LDA, are thankful that we had the privilege ofknowing and working with Dr. Kirk. The insight shared by Dr. Kirkbenefited us all and the accomplishments of many professionals in thefield of learning disabilities are directly attributable to thefoundations he laid. After more than 20 years at Illinois, Kirk movedto the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, where he continued toplay an active role in special education. He is survived by his wife, Winifred D. Kirk, his daughter, Lorraineand son, Jerry. If you would like to write a note to Mrs. Kirk, heraddress is 7500 N. Calle Sin Vidia, Tucson, AZ 85718. If you would preferto do something special in Dr. Kirk's honor, the ACLD Foundation hasestablished a fund in his memory. Contributions can be sent to ACLDFoundation, 4156 Library Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15234. The Foundation willacknowledge the gift directly to the family.

The Republican response to the argument that a number of statesdo not cease educational services to students but rather send them to alternativeeducation programs was that advocates in states which did not have alternativeeducation programs should work for legislation at the state level, becausethe federal government should not tell states what to do. Fortunately,the Committee passed the Miller amendments which would require that a hearingofficer review any decision to end educational services and to make itharder to find that the behavior was NOT a manifestation of the disability.Amendments to require that the evaluation be multi-disciplinary, to restorethe child count for funding, and to strike restrictions of the Policy Lettersfrom the Department of Education failed. Rumor has it that the Senate bill may come to the floor for a vote nextweek. The House bill may move to the floor within a couple of weeks. Thereare only 20 legislative days left in this session of Congress. If IDEAis to pass in this Congress, these bills must be passed without amendmentsand/or a lengthy floor fight. Moreover, one staffer whose member supportedthe removal of the cessation provision warned that if the bill is opento floor amendments, the final bill could be worse than the one just passedby the Committee. Several national organizations, including DLD (the Division for LearningDisabilities), TASH (The Association for the Severely Handicapped), SAFE(Schools are for Everyone), and UCPA (the United Cerebral Palsy Association)have come out in opposition to the bill, willing to give up discretionaryprograms in order to keep Part B as it is. The LDA Board must now decidewhether to oppose both bills now because they include cessation of educationalservices. stay silent on both bills because LDA cannot support cessation of services. support the bills because the positive changes outweigh the negativechanges. wait until the final bill comes out of the House Senate conference,and if it is unacceptable, ask for a Presidential veto. LDA must also take into consideration the facts that the authorization for the discretionary programs (early intervention,personnel preparation, research and development, and information clearinghouses) will expire, Appropriations committees are reluctant to providefunding for programs which have no authorization, as shown by this yearï¿½sbattle to restore funding for discretionary programs the 105th Congress, particularly on the Senate side, may be more anti-federalgovernment than this Congress. Hence, new IDEA bills could be worse thanthe current ones. efforts to reauthorize the discretionary programs could get waylaidbecause of the need to reauthorize the higher education act, and parents and advocates are beginning to burn out. This process has beengoing on for 3 years now-. The following information is given to help make that decision. IMPROVEMENTS OVER CURRENT LAW (General concepts only. Details on demand.) Parents are to be involved in eligibility and placement decisions fortheir child. Evaluation to consider the emotional and social needs of the child.

Despite the fact that civil rights laws and IDEA were exempted from the unfunded mandates, ACIR's initial report, which was issued in February, had recommended that the private right to legal action under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the IDEA be eliminated. Although the final report does not mention either the ADA or the private right to actionunder IDEA, including the IDEA in a report on unfunded mandates is potentially very dangerous, particularly in view of the fact that the chances for a reauthorization of IDEA in the current Congress are dim and getting dimmer. The three recommendations on IDEA are: Increase federal funding for IDEA to 40% of the excess cost Relieve state and local governments from "prescriptive administrative and recordkeeping requirements". Increase the use of mediation and other forms of alternative disputes resolution. LDA President Sandra Britt has written to all members of the Commission urging that IDEA be removed from the report because: States clearly have the responsibility to provide an education to all theirchildren. Children which disabilities are entitled to the same educational opportunities as their non-disabled peers. The funding provided by IDEA is intended to help the states to provide those opportunities. The "prescriptive administrative and recordkeeping requirements" of the law are intended to ensure that federal funds are spent wisely for the purposes for which they were intended. The report perpetuates the myth that IDEA is not a litigious law. LDA has no objection to the use of mediation as an alternative to due process because it benefits both children with learning disabilities and the school systems which serve them. However, children with disabilities and their families must retain the right to redress wrongs under the law. Because IDEA is clearly exempt from the Unfunded Mandates LAW and because the reauthorization of IDEA now being considered by Congress addresses some of the concerns expressed in the ACIR report, LDA urges the Commission to remove all references to IDEA in its final report.

Winter, Chairman U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations 600 K Street, N W Suite 450 South Building Washington, DC 20575 Dear Governor Winter: LDA, the Learning Disabilities Association of America, is a national, non-profit volunteer organization whose membership is approximately 60,000. Our membership is comprised of individuals with learning disabilities, their families and friends, and the professionals who serve them and is dedicated to improving the lives of individuals with learning disabilities. Over half of thechildren served under IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, are identified as learning disabled. The effectiveness of IDEA in preparing these children to be productive citizens is demonstrated by the increasing number of students with learning disabilities who go on to college or into competitive employment. LDA is very concerned about the recommendations regarding IDEA which appear in the revised draft of the ACIR (Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations) report to Congress for the following reasons: The ACIR, which was created by the Unfunded Mandates Law of 1995, has no authority to make recommendations about IDEA because that legislation specifically pointed out that IDEA is NOT an unfunded mandate. States clearly have the responsibility to provide an education to all their children. Children with disabilities are entitled to the same educational opportunities as their non-disabled peers. The funding provided by IDEA is intended to help the states to provide those opportunities. The "prescriptive administrative and record keeping requirements" of the law are intended to ensure that federal funds are spent wisely for the purposes for which they were intended. The report perpetuates the myth that IDEA is not a litigious law. LDA has no objection to the use of mediation as an alternative to due process because it benefits both children with learning disabilities and the school systems which serve them. However, children with disabilities and their families must retain the right to redress wrongs under the law. Because IDEA is clearly exempt from the Unfunded Mandates LAW and because the reauthorization of IDEA now being considered by Congress addresses some of the concerns expressed in the ACIR report, LDA urges you to remove all reference to the IDEA in your final report.

(Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology)  IDEA When Congress recessed on August 2 without acting on IDEA, most advocates thought that the bill was dead because there was so little time left (5 weeks) in this session of Congress. However, on Aug. 15, Sen. Bill Frist e-mailed the following message: "September offers last chance for IDEA to pass this year. S.1578, the IDEA Amendments of 1996, failed to make it out of the Senate before the August recess. I had hoped to get the Senate bill passed on Aug. 2, but literally ran out of time. After months of intense negotiations, a final package of amendments failed to clear the calendar for debate and vote. As of now the Senate stands in recess until September 3. When the Senate returns in September, we will continue to negotiate a package of amendments that all sides can agree upon and hopefully bring IDEA to the floor for a vote. If successful, we will sit down and work out the differences (between) the Senate and the House bills. I believe that we can all work together to get a bill out of Congress that we are proud of and that we can support, and that will continue authorization for critical IDEA programs." Reportedly, Senate and House staff or working on the conference report to reconcile differences between the two bills. However, in view of the short time left, and the number of bills to be considered, there still may not be enough time to pass a final bill. However, our position remains that of the position paper adopted by the Board on June 6, 1996, which lists provisions that LDA can support, those with which LDA has serious concerns and those which LDA is not prepared to support. We will keep you posted.  Legislation which has been or is expected to be signed into law The Conference Report for the five year extension of The developmental Disabilities Act, which funds the DD Councils and the Protection and Advocacy Systems, was signed into law by President Clinton. The Conference Report for The Welfare Reform Act - (HR 3734) which denies cash assistance to some low income children with disabilities; denies medical assistance, including early intervention, to children who no longer qualify for SSI and cannot qualify for Medicaid through another eligibility category; and denies access to most immigrant with disabilities; and limits access to food stamps for people with disabilities - is ready to be sent to the President for his signature. Unfortunately, the Simon Specter Literacy Provision in the Senate Bill, which would have allowed states to count the participation of welfare recipients in adult basic education, literacy training, and GED preparation programs as educational activities meeting the work requirement of this bill, was dropped in the conference report. The Conference Report for The Kennedy Kassenbaum Health Care Bill (HR 3103), which would prohibit the denial of health insurance for a pre-existing condition, is expected to be signed by the President.  Legislation on which further action must be taken The Education Appropriations Bill for fiscal 1997, which includes funding for the IDEA discretionary programs, has passed the House (HR 3755). The Senate is expected to act on it in September. The Conference Report on The Workforce and Career Development Act (HR 1617 - The Job Training Bill) which would replace more than 80 programs with block grants for at-risk youth programs, vocational education, adult literacy, and adult job training was passed on July 17. The bill is stalled awaiting House and Senate floor action. The Local Employment and Flexibility Act (S 88, HR 2086) would allow states or localities to submit "flexibility or coordination plans" for any federal program "under which financial assistance is available". Although Civil Rights under Section 504, IDEA, or ADA cannot be waived, a state or community could decide to use IDEA funds for general education rather than for special education for children with disabilities. The Parents Rights and Responsibilities Act (HR 1946, S 984) would prohibit any government official from interfering with a parent's desires in the areas of medical care, discipline, home schooling and religious education. The implications for children with disabilities are unclear.  A victory to savor Remember The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations(ACIR)? Thanks to inputs from consumers all around the country, the Commission, on a 13 to 7 vote, rejected the controversial report, which included recommendations that IDEA be amended to "relieve state and local governments from prescriptive and recordkeeping requirements." Authorization for ACIR ends in October, so hopefully, that crisis is over.

Bipolar disorder: Classic manic-depressive disease characterizedby discrete periods of depression and mania interspersed with well states. Cyclothymia: Chronic, long-standing (greater than one year) state ofhypomanic/ hyperactivity with moment to moment, day to day (mixed days) ofboth manic and depressive moods and feelings with no prolonged, stable(well) states. Depression: A discrete period of symptoms persisting for morethan 34 weeks and associated with poor functioning either at work(school), home, or in play. The two major symptoms are: 1)dysphoric moodcharacterized by both statements and appearance of sadness, unhappiness,pessimism, loneliness with associated moodiness and often being difficultto please; and 2) low self-worth (self-deprecation/poor self-esteem):feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, and being dumb, stupid, ugly, orguilty, along with beliefs of persecution, death wishes, and suicidalthoughts. Four or more of the following symptoms are usually presentduring the depressive episode: agitation insomnia lowered school performance diminished socialization (or change to an unacceptable social group) loss of interest in school, physical complaints loss of usual energy and dropping out of usual fun, sport, oraesthetic activities change in appetite or weight. Depending upon the number of symptoms and severity of malfunctioning,depression is characterized as either "minor" or "major". Dysthymia: (chronic minor depression) Chronic. long standing(greater than one year) depressive moods and feelings (dysphoria) alongwith variable vegetative symptoms of insomnia, low energy, and decreasedinterest that fluctuates in the pattern of mixed days with occasional "allbad" days, but with no prolonged, stable (well) states. Dysthymia With Bipolar Features: Dysthymia with brief, recurrent"moments" (periods) of hostile anger. Hypomania: (Chronic hypomanic/hyperactivity) Persistenthyperactivity with inappropriate cheerfulness, silliness, giddiness,intrusiveness, and interruptive-disruptive behavior. Racing thoughts withpush of speech, inappropriate, provocative sexual activity, irritablemoods, and decreased need for sleep can become apparent in older children(ages 3-8 years). Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder (JRCBD): Chronic, longstanding (greater than one year) moment to moment or day to day (mixeddays) fluctuations of both manic and depressive moods and feelings with noprolonged, stable (well) states but without any evidence of chronichypomanic/ hyperactivity. Mania: The hallmark of mania is two symptoms: 1) euphoria (mostcommonly a total denial of any problems as one is disrupting theenvironment and life of others and/or inappropriate feeling ofwell-being); and 2) rages, hostile anger (ire) that can be associated withhomicidal thoughts and statements. An episode of mania is characterized bythese two symptoms persisting for a period greater than 1-2 weeks alongwith the symptoms and behaviors of hypomania. Associated with thesesymptoms, there must be malfunctioning in three environments of school,home, and play. (Occasionally the individual will have malfunctioning inonly one or two of the environments.) Manic-depressive Disease (Classic Bipolar Disorder): Episodes ofdepression persisting for more than 2-4 weeks and mania persisting formore than 1-2 weeks interspersed with long periods (months or years) ofstable (well) states. Primary Disorder of Vigilance: A dominantly inherited conditioncharacterized by loss of alertness/wakefulness (vigilance) duringactivities requiring continuous mental performance(attention-concentration) or continuous task performance Individuals withthe Primary Disorder of Vigilance have a unique temperament: kind, caring,affectionate, compassionate, and the inability to hold a grudge.

Complaints of tiredness, drowsiness, sleepiness, lethargy b. Yawning, stretching, sleepy-eyed (glassy-eyed) appearance c. Falling asleep; excessive napping Decreasing attention to present activities a. Daydreaming b. Difficulty focusing attention; loses place in activities and conversation c. Poor performance d. Slow, delayed, or incomplete tasks e. Disorganized Avoidance of structured or repetitive activities a. Loss of interest in or complaint that structured activities are dull, boring, monotonous, tedious, uninteresting (or no longer interesting) b. Preference for shifting activities that have random or irregular changes in schedule or activity (orderly randomization) Motor restlessness and behaviors to improve alertness a. Fidgeting b. Talkativeness c. Moving about d. Busyness Caring, compassionate, affectionate, kind temperament B. A major symptom category is accepted as positive when the symptom or one or more of its behaviors is identified in a semi-structured, closed-end interview of patient and primary caretakers (historians). C. This symptom complex must precede the onset of other medical disorders (including depression, narcolepsy, various medications, alcohol and drug abuse, hypothyroidism) that can cause secondary hypovigilance. D. Although symptomatology may be identified at any age, the disorder generally becomes more symptomatic with schooling and aging and can result in increasing maladaptation.

Supportive: Be a positive advocate. Reassuring: A treatable and self-limiting condition with anticipation of long periods of well states. Assist with order and planning: Toward school, work, play, and pursuit of assets and talents. Assist with decision making "Continue usual pursuits"; "Do not drop out." Cognitive coaching on a "mini" daily basis: "Learn to think positive _ act positive." "Come to know that actions should dictate feelings," "Intelligence should overrule emotions."

Bypass Compensatory Strategies to Reduce Stress in Children with Cerebral Dysfunction Problem Area Strategy Reading 1. Listen to "good readers" read age-appropriate (not "skill" level) material while eyeing the printed page; avoid listening to poor readers reading. 2. Use talking books, listen to tapes, and view films and filmstrips for information; if necessary, read salient material using well-prepared course handouts and worksheets. 3. Read silently for meaning, but never read aloud. 4. Test orally and provide a reader and recorder for necessary written tests (such as the college entrance examinations and group achievement tests). Word finding Vocabulary Reading comprehension Picture-word association 1. Use picture-to-word matching tasks (including associating names and faces) for vocabulary development. 2. Test both orally and in writing using multiple-choice, true-false, yes-no, or circle-the-correct-answer formats; avoid both oral and written "fill-in the blank" testing situations. Spelling 1. Look at word while simultaneously hearing the word spoken. 2. Test spelling by multiple-choice format using age-appropriate (not "skill" level) words. 3. Use The Bad Speller's Dictionary (New York, Random House, 1974). 4. Use a good speller as a secretary or write using computer word processor with appropriate spell-checking software. Writing 1. Encourage oral expression or demonstration instead of written tasks. 2. Allow the child to dictate information or answers into a tape recorder or directly to a secretary. 3. Use a circle-the-correct-answer written text format. 4. Provide computer with word-processing software that contains a built-in dictionary and thesaurus. Computation Arithmetic Mathematics 1. Pursue instruction of age-appropriate (not "skill level") mathematical concepts and principles, avoiding specific calculations. 2 For instruction of computation, teach by example showing both correct and incorrect responses. 3. Provide calculators and/or computers with appropriate software to perform the necessary computations at age-appropriate (not skill") level. 4. Utilize pick-the-correct-answer testing formats. Organization 1. Offer one small task at a time, or divide larger tasks into several mini-tasks. 2. As necessary, provide reminders to child of tasks; avoid nagging and avoid checklists. 3. Avoid punishment for "forgetting," not finishing, or being late with assignments or tasks. 4. Provide the child with a pictorial system for self-reminding of tasks, chores, and events. 5. Offer all testing using an untimed format. Adapted from Levy HB, Harper CR, Weinberg WA: A practical approach to children failing in school.

Bateman, Ph.D., J.D. Due to the length, this paper is presented in three parts: Part I Part II (this part) Part III DEVELOPING THE IEP The proper team has assembled, the student's photo is prominently placed, thecalming herbal tea has been served, the tape recorder is on and the newsprintis on the easel. It is time to begin developing the IEP. A three-step IEPdevelopment process is strongly recommended:(a) List the student's unique characteristics or needs that requireindividualization (and which entitle the student to individualized services);(b) Determine and specify the district-provided services and modificationsthat will appropriately address each need; and(c) Write the goals and objectives that will be accomplished by the student ifthe services and modifications are appropriate and effective. An IEP "Non-Form" consisting solely of a blank piece of paper orientedhorizontally can accommodate this process far better than existing forms.Divide the paper into thirds and label the three columns something like: (1)Student's Needs; (2) Services; and (3) Evaluation of Services. Other headingsthat work well are (a) Individualize because.....; (b) What the district willdo; (c) How we'll know it is working. The Student's Unique Characteristics or Needs First, the IEP team must determine the student's unique characteristics orneeds to which the special services will be directed. One helpful way to learn to think in terms of these essential characteristics is to imagine that youare describing the student to a volunteer who has never met the student and isgoing to take him or her camping for a week. The IEP is required to addressonly the portions or aspects of the student's education that needs to beindividualized. The student should be visible in the IEP. Too many IEPs revealonly the academic program available in the resource room and show nothingwhatsoever about the student. The primary focus of the IEP is going to be thespecification of services. This initial step is to determine what isnecessitating the services. If we complete the statement, "We are individualizing Johnny's program because"_______" those "because" are his unique needs. The "because" may be suchthings as: (a) he is reading several years behind where he should be; (b) heis unable to organize his assignments, homework; or (c) his attention is tooeasily distracted away from work, etc. These are the exact needs to beaddressed in the next column. When a legal dispute arises about a student's program, a common concern iswhether the services provided addressed all the student's special needs. Thosespecial needs are what must be specified in this first stage of IEPdevelopment. It is difficult to imagine how one could either attack or defendthe services offered to meet unique needs unless those needs had beenspecified. In addition to the real world knowledge the IEP team members haveabout the student's characteristics/needs, it may be helpful to consult anycurrent evaluations. This is particularly important for the first IEP whichimmediately follows the evaluation which found the student to be IDEAeligible. Some evaluations fail to address a student's special needs; otherscan be very helpful. Characteristics or needs will often "cluster." The team may well decide in thenext stage that one service will address more than one characteristic or need.However, at this point it is important to just "brainstorm" and list all theunique characteristics that require individualized attention. Sometimes thenatural flow seems to be to work "across" the IEP Non-Form, i.e., when acharacteristic has been identified, to then decide what service oraccommodation will address it and finally determine the goals and objectivesfor that service that will indicate its appropriateness. Other times it may bebetter to list all the characteristics first, then move to services and thento goals. Either way, or a combination, is perfectly OK. Examples of characteristics (not all from the same student) in both academicand social-emotional-behavioral areas follow. Remember that for each, the nextinquiry will be, "What will the district do about this?" Some examples ofunique characteristics or needs in academic areas are: (a) Handwriting that is slow, labored, "drawn," nearly illegible due toimproper size and spacing of letters and words; (b) Lacks understanding of place value and regrouping in both addition andsubtraction; (c) Attributes literal, concrete meaning to everything he hears and reads;doesn't get jokes or slang; (d) Understands spoken language, decodes words accurately, but does notcomprehend material read independently; oral reading reveals severe lack ofexpression and no attention to punctuation; (e) Works very slowly, becomes upset if he makes a mistake, quits and refusesto continue if paper is "messy", (f) Answers before thinking, both in oral and written work; work is impulsive;many "careless" errors; and (g) Gets arithmetic problems `"messed up" and copies them incorrectly offboard and out of book. Lines up problems incorrectly and also lines up answerswrong in multiplication and division. The law requires that the Present Level of Performance (PLOP) in these areasof need be indicated in a way that is readily understandable and is preciseenough to allow us to measure progress. The PLOP can appear either as anelaboration of the characteristic or need or as the chronological beginningpoint in a succession of PLOP, behavioral objectives, and annual goal. ThePLOP is now, the objectives are short-term goals, and the goal is where thestudent is headed by the end of a year. If the PLOP is treated as a quantification of the characteristic or need, thena PLOP for the slow, barely legible handwriting in example (a) above might be"copies 5 words per minute with 1 or 2 of the words illegible." Some characteristics or needs are sufficiently descriptive as they are andneed no quantification, e.g., lacks understanding of place value andregrouping. To say that the student performs zero regrouping problem;correctly adds little to the description. Sometimes a present level of performance can be best described by a worksample. A picture can speak very loudly, as in a timed handwriting samplewhich could be attached to the IEP as a PLOP. Such a sample can reveal bothquality (content) of written expression as well as mechanics of handwriting. Some examples of unique characteristics or needs in social-emotional-behavioral areas would be : (a) Shy; no friends; never volunteers in class; never initiates social contactwith other children; (b) Bully; doesn't know how to play with other children; physically aggressivewith smaller children; (c) Over-reacts and has temper outbursts; is noncompliant; pouts and whines;is sullen and negative when suggestions are made; and (d) Short attention span; easily distracted by sounds. These characteristics would be treated just the same as academic needs. A PLOPwould be added if necessary and then the team would ask what the district willdo about the bullying or the shyness or short attention span. The Special Education, Related Services and Modifications - the DistrictWill "Do's" The second inquiry the team should make is, "How will the district respond toeach of the student's needs? What will we do about Joe's need for help inmaking friends? What will we do about Toni's tendency to work rapidly andcarelessly? What will we do about Manuel's anger problem?" The specialeducation, related services or modifications the district will provide can beconveniently thought of as the "district do's." The "do's" are listed in themiddle column of the Non-Form. They may be as creative, flexible, innovative,and often inexpensive as the team's brainstorming and combined wisdom allow.This listing of services becomes the "Special Education and Related Services"which the law requires be on the IEP and which is too often omitted or simplyperverted into a mere check mark or a percentage of time in special education.The amount of related services such as speech therapy or physical therapy thatis needed must be shown, along with the date the service is to begin and theanticipated duration of the service. One of the interesting issues about services is the question of whethermethodology need be specified. If, for example, the service is remedialreading, must the method be spelled out? In general the answer is "no".In 1977, when the IDEA rules were first proposed, they would have mandatedthat methodology and instructional materials were to be included in IEPs.However, when the rules became final that requirement had been dropped, In themeantime, some states and districts had moved quickly and already had formsthat included methods and materials. It is not unusual to find those formsstill in use. One disadvantage of including method is that so doing means anIEP meeting would have to be called to change the method. If method isn't onthe IEP it can be changed unilaterally as the teacher sees fit. Methodology becomes a source of conflict when parents are convinced theirchild will receive benefit from a particular method and will not benefit fromthe method the district wants to use. The most frequently sought methods are aparticular method of communication for students who are deaf and directinstruction and/or phonics based reading programs for students who arelearning disabled. Almost all courts agree that schools may usually select themethod. However, in rare cases parents have been able to show that aparticular method is necessary to allow the IEP to be "reasonably calculated"to allow benefit, e.g., Hawaii Dept. of Education v. Tara H., Civ.No. 86-1161, (D.HI 1987). It is extremely important to note, as no court hasyet done, that when the U.S. Supreme Court said methodology should be left tothe state (school) it said so in the context of presuming the school hadexpertise in all relevant, effective methods Board of Ed. v. Rowley,102 S.Ct. 3034, (1982). This is not usually the case. A common and interesting question related to these "District Do" servicesrelates to in-service training for teachers. Rob, e.g., has Tourette'sSyndrome and needs a teacher who is knowledgeable about how his involuntaryvocalizations are affected by stress. The agreed upon service to be providedby the district is inservice training by the local physician for all theschool staff. Does that "district do" belong on Rob's IEP? Yes, it does. It isa service to meet his unique need. One concern is that such a service doesn'tlend itself directly to a goal formulated in terms of Rob's behavior. Thisconcern is easily addressed by looking to what we hope to see in Rob'sbehavior as a result of having an informed, sympathetic teacher who assistshim in avoiding unnecessary stress. One obvious answer is improved academicperformance. Other outcomes could be a direct decease in frequency andseverity of his symptoms and an increase in socialization. Another issue is that the service is not being provided directly to Rob.Legally, an important question is whether Rob is receiving some specialeducation, i.e., some specially designed instruction to meet his unique needs,which is delivered by qualified special education personnel. If he is notreceiving any special education, as defined in the law, he is either noteligible under IDEA or he is not receiving the free appropriate education towhich he is entitled. If he is receiving special education then it does notmatter how the in-service training for his teachers is conceptualized.Logically, in-service staff training is perfectly analogous to parent trainingand is, therefore, a related service. If so, it is important to specify, asfor all related services, how much in-service is to be provided and when. For many years some districts resisted including on IEPs the modificationsneeded in the regular classroom. However, it is well settled law that theymust be included. A checklist of types of modifications (e.g., in grading,discipline, assignments, texts, tests, etc.) can be helpful to insure allnecessary modifications are addressed. The Present Levels of Performance, Goals and Objectives-Evaluating theDistrict "Do's" The third step, after the needs have been delineated and the servicesspecified, is to write the required annual goal and behavioral objectives foreach special education service or cluster of services. The clustering ofservices can be very efficient as well as conceptually illuminating. Forexample, think of a secondary student who has a severe learning disabilityaffecting his written expression. He might need several services includingkeyboarding instruction, tutoring in writing, modifications in test-taking andlength of written assignments, substitution of oral presentations for someterm papers, and modified grading. The entire service cluster could bereasonably evaluated in terms of his improved rates of successful coursecompletion and attendance. Other goals could also be very appropriate. Thepoint is that just as characteristics or needs can be clustered to provide oneservice, so services can be clustered to be assessed by a common, single goal. Writing goals and objectives begins with asking, "If the service we areproviding is effective, what will we see in Todd's behavior that tells us so?"The purpose of the mandated goals and objectives is to evaluate the service.We need to know when or if to change what we're doing, to change the servicewe are providing. As long as we're on track and the child is makingreasonable progress we just keep going. That's why objectives are to bestatements of how far the student will progress toward the annualgoal (12 month objective) by when. One of the common and major problems with goals and objectives is that theyare not taken seriously by their writers who have no intention of actuallychecking whether the student has reached them or not. It is as if we neverunderstood the most basic tenet of the IEP, i.e., that we are going to try thelisted services and see if they work for that student. The goals andobjectives are to be real. They are to be used to evaluate programeffectiveness. They are not just legal requirements to be completed and filed.The contrast can be seen easily. Examples of Annual Goals Real Goal Not Real Goal Joe will have no more than 5 unexcused absences / tardies this year Joe will have a better attitude toward school 80% ofthe time. Sara will participate regularly in a supervisedextra-curricular activity that meets weekly. Sara will make wise choices in her use of leisure time. Max will maintain a C+ average in his regular classes. Max will be 75% successful in the mainstream. Beth will pass upper body strength items on the fitnesstest. Beth will show an appropriate level of upper bodystrength. One easy and effective way to include the mandated present levels ofperformance (PLOP) in the areas of concern is to use them as the beginningpoint in a sequence going from the PLOP to the objectives to the annual goal.This kind of sequence is illustrated in Joe's Non-Form IEP. Joe is anidentified student with learning disabilities who was in the 9th grade in avery small, rural district. Additional examples of sequences that are intended to be used to evaluate theservices are shown below: Examples of Sequences A: PLOP: Anita averages 10 unexcused absence/tardies per month. Obj. #1 By Feb. 1 she will have fewer than 5 unexcused absences/tardies per month. Obj. #2 By April 2 she will have fewer than 2 unexcused absences / tardies per month. Goal From April through June 1 she will average less than 1 unexcused absence/tardy per month. B: PLOP: Jeremy submits fewer than half his homework assignments. Obj. #1 By Nov. 15 he will have submitted 75% of all homework assignments. Obj. #2 By Jan. 15 he will have submitted 85 % of all homework assignments. Goal By the end of the year he will regularly submit all assigned homework on time. C. PLOP: Jill silently reads 6th grade material at a rate of 50-75 words per minute and correctly answers 30-40% of factual comprehension questions asked orally. Obj. #1 By Dec. 1 Jill will read 6th grade material orally at 75-100 words per minute with 0-2 errors. Obj. #2 By Mar. 1 Jill will read 6th grade material orally at 100-125 words per minute with 0-2 errors and correctly answer more than 70% of factual questions over the material. Goal By June 15 Jill will orally read 7th grade material at 75-100 words per minute with 0-2 errors and correctly answer 90% to 100% of factual questions asked over the material.

Bateman, Ph.D., J.D. Due to the length, this paper is presented in three parts: Part I Part II Part III (this part) LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSITION COMPONENTS OF IEP Transition services must be included in all IEPs when the student reaches age16 and may be included for younger students if deemed appropriate by the IEPteam (OSEP Letter to Anonymous, 17 EFLR 842). Preventing schooldrop-out is to be a major factor in determining when transition services areneeded (OSEP Letter to Bereuter 20 IDELR 536). Transition servicesare a coordinated set of activities that promote movement from school to suchpost-school activities as post-secondary education, vocational training,employment, adult services, independent living and community participation.They must be based on the individual student's needs, taking into account hisor her preferences and interests. Transition services must includeinstruction, community experiences, and development of employment and otherpost school adult living objectives. If appropriate, daily living skills andfunctional vocational evaluation may also be included. If the IEP team determines an individual student does not need services in one or more of these areas the IEP must contain a statement to that effect and the basis upon which the determination is made (OSEP Letter to Cernosia.19 IDELR 933). See Jim's Non-Form IEP transition component for an example of such a statement regarding employment. Before the student leaves school the IEP must also contain, if appropriate, a statement of each public agency's andeach participating agency's responsibilities or linkages (including financial)for the transition activities (34 CFR 300.346(d) and comment). The IEP meeting must include a representative of the public agency providingand supervising the transition activities and, if appropriate, representativesof other participating agencies. In almost all situations the familiardistrict representative required for all IEP meetings would qualify as thisrepresentative. If appropriate, the student should also be there to ensure heror his needs, preferences, and interests are addressed. It is difficult toimagine circumstances where it would not be appropriate for a student who hasa learning disability to be at the meeting. If the student cannot attend,other methods of participating must be used (34 CFR 300.344(c)(3)). The ultimate responsibility for providing transition services rests with theschool district (or state education agency if district fails) and there is noprovision for a waiver of this requirement. Thus it applies to all publicagencies to whom IDEA applies and, if a participating agency defaults onservice provision, it is the school that must find an alternative way toprovide the service. However, nothing in IDEA relieves a participating agencyof any of its responsibility for serving or paying for services for thatstudent. Two 1994 due process hearings against an Iowa district resulted in rulingsthat the district's failure to provide appropriate transition planning andservices precluded the district from graduating the student and obligated itto provide further vocational programs (Mason City Comm. Sch. Dist.21 IDELR 241 and 21 IDELR 248). DEVELOPING THE TRANSITION COMPONENT OF THE IEP The transition component of the IEP is just that, a part of the student'sregular IEP. It is not a parallel document, a separate thing, or a "transitionIEP." All the IEP development requirements and procedures discussed earlieralso apply to the transition component. The legal significance of transition,being but one aspect of the IEP process, is substantial. A student is entitledto those transition services which for that student are either specialeducation or related services necessary to enable the student to benefit fromspecial education. The period of "benefit" to be considered has arguably beenlengthened beyond school and into adult life, but the substantive entitlementis still to special education and related services, not to those plustransition services. One logical beginning point for the transition component is with the teamreaching agreement about the individual student's needs with regard to thethree mandated areas of: (a) instruction; (b) community experiences; and (c)employment and other post-school living objectives. If the team deems itinappropriate to address an area, presumably because the student presents nounique needs, the IEP must include the basis for that determination. Thestudent's needs, taking into account interests and preferences, can beexplored prior to the meeting and substantial input should also be sought fromthe parents. Questionnaires are appropriate. Zigmond (1990) has studied extensively secondary programs for students withlearning disabilities and suggested four major areas of program need. First,many of these students need, and too few receive, intensive basic skillsinstruction. Too many programs slight basic skills altogether, believing it istoo late while others require students to "do" basic skills activities, butprovide next to no real instruction. What Zigmond calls "Survival Skills"includes explicit instruction needed by most LD students in behavior control,teacher-pleasing and study skills including test taking. The third need is forsuccessful completion of courses required for graduation. As schools sufferfunding cut backs, so-called basic level courses in math and English oftendisappear, leaving IEP teams to struggle with issues of granting graduationcredit for resource room courses or for extensively modified regular courses.One legally correct solution is for the district to establish what theessential, minimum requirements are for credit toward graduation. Those may berigorously adhered to, as long as reasonable modifications are allowed in howthe requirement is met. The IEP should lay out these understandings clearlyand explicitly. Transition needs are the last area Zigmond addresses. She points out thatabout 12 to 30% of graduating LD students go on to college and they, ofcourse, have transition needs related to selecting and applying to a school.She also notes that vocational education programs in high school are notnecessarily a better ticket to job success than are more academic programs. Weare left reaLizing, again, that many secondary programs still need improvementand that we must truly look, in the IEP process, at the individual needs andsituation of each student. One of the most important additional skills needed by many students who havelearning disabilities is self-advocacy. The student's presentation of his orher needs at the IEP meeting may itself provide one opportunity to assess anddiscuss self-advocacy skills. Another concern for some students with learningdisabilities is passing the examinations required to obtain a driver'slicense. Using the same basic three-step inquiry process used in the rest ofthe IEP and with self-advocacy and obtaining a driver's license as thestudent's needs we can illustrate the inclusion of transition services on theIEP. This Non-Form is nearly identical to that used earlier to show Joe's IEP.The only difference is that the present level of performance is included inthe first rather than last column. That is just another way of doing it and isunrelated to the fact we are illustrating transition. It is important to note that the Secretary of Education has acknowledged thatnot all the IEP content requirements, especially goals and objectives, areappropriate for all transition services (FR 44847, discussion of 34 CFR300.346). No IEP team should use time or energy trying to fit transition needsand services into a format including annual goals and objectives unless ittruly makes sense to do so. CONFIDENTIALITY OF IEPS Many secondary teachers report they have no idea which of their students, ifany, are on IEPs and that they never see the IEP even when they are informed astudent has one. This is sad, perhaps sometimes even tragic. By its verynature a good IEP is always helpful and sometimes essential in providing anappropriate program for the student. Rarely is a student's disability so mildor limited that she or he requires no modifications or accommodations inregular middle school or high school classes. When this process of hiding IEPs from teachers is questioned the common answersuggests a belief that confidentiality would be violated if IEPs were shared.While it is true IEPs are education records and must be treated as such, theFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) has an exception which ispertinent. Under Reg. 99.31(a) of the FERPA regulations, an educational agencymay disclose personally identifiable information from the education records ofa student without the written consent of the parent "if the disclosure is toother school officials, including teachers, within the educational institutionor local education agency who have been determined by the agency orinstitution to have legitimate educational interests" in that information. Furthermore, even if there were a confidentiality problem under state law ordistrict policy it could be readily solved by parental permission to share theIEP with all teachers. Parents should insist teachers have copies of the IEP,even if it means they themselves must provide them to the teachers. Of course,it should go without saying that the IEP should not contain any informationbeyond what is required. It would not be appropriate, e.g., to include thecategory of disability or an intelligence score, etc. DISCUSSION We are all new at incorporating transition services into the IEP and into thebroader world. Few rulings are yet available to assist us in understanding newrequirements. Already a few areas of confusion are emerging. Several are inthe direction of an unduly expansive reading of the new regulations. First, the transition activities which must be addressed, unless the IEP teamfinds it unnecessary, are: (a) instruction; (b) community experiences; and (c)the development of objectives related to employment and other post-schoolareas. There is a tendency to confuse these three requirements with thepost-school activities to which the three are to be directed, i.e.,post-secondary education, vocational training, employment, adult services,independent living, etc. Many "lists" are available which can be seen assuggesting the IEP must address the latter directly rather than the former. A second source of confusion is that by erroneously viewing the transitioncomponent of the IEP as a thing unto itself it is easy to forget that IDEAentitles the student who has a disability only to special education andrelated services. The transition services to which a student is entitled mustfit the definition of one or the other. Therefore, each required transitionservice must be either specially designed instruction to meet the students'unique needs (taking into account his preferences and interests) or it must berequired to enable the student to benefit from that instruction. The fact thattransition services must qualify as either special education or relatedservices may not pose a significant limitation since one could argue thatalmost any transition service is necessary to enable the student to reap thebenefits of all the special education she or he has had to date. A third overly broad reading is the failure to recognize that "student'spreferences and interests" refers to determining the student's needs, not todelineating the services to be provided (34 CFR 300.18(b)(1)(2)). One way toapproach the question of student needs is to envision a typical weekday and atypical weekend after secondary school. Is the student still living in his orher parents' home? Has she gotten an apartment? Does he know how to findapartment ads in the classifieds? How to respond to an ad? How to locate theaddress? The exact process the IEP team goes through in looking into a student'spost-school future and planning for it will differ from student to student, asit should. The essential elements which will not vary include student andfamily participation and the willingness of the IEP team to address all theareas of need-intensive and effective basic skills instruction (not justexposure and not just repetitious practice), explicit survivalskills, graduation requirements, and transition. Properly used, the IEP can be an extraordinarily useful tool in building thefuture we desire for our students who have learning disabilities. Reference Zigmond. N., (1990).

Carr, M.Ed. Due to size, this paper is divided into three parts: Part 1: Beginnings of School-BasedManagement Part 2: Forms of School-based Management (this part) Part 3: The Parent in School-BasedManagement Systems Forms of school-based management What is school-based management? School-based management takes many forms, depending upon its shareholders or constituents. Regardless of its component parts, however, school-based management has one commonality. It is school governance from the bottom-up rather than top-down. (Midgley and Wood, 1993) School-based management was implemented to empower school staff to create conditions in schools that would facilitate improvement, innovation, and continuing professional growth. Because the prevailing reforms had failed to repair the system despite great public focus, teacher morale had diminished; and the diminution of morale was accompanied by reduced teacher effort. School-based management would delegate more authority and flexibility to school staff Along with authority, however, was accountability in the threat of parental choice or open enrollment and annual school performance reporting (David, 1989). The premise of school or site-based decision making is a relatively simple one - "restructure" the planning, implementation, and evaluation of educational programs by bringing decision making from the central administration to the local school. "Site-based decision making is a process for decentralizing decision to improve the educational outcomes at every school campus through a collaborative effort by which principals, teachers, campus staff, district staff, parents, and community representatives assess educational outcomes of all students, determine goals and strategies, and ensure that strategies are implemented and adjusted to improve student achievement" (Texas Education Agency, 1992). The rationale for school-based management was learned from industry - the school has the primary decision-making role, and its outcome, decisions should be made at the lowest possible level (cited in David, 1989). In order to bring about change, participants must share ownership both in its definition and in the flexibility to adapt that change to individual circumstances. Successful change cannot be imposed externally. The notions of lowest-level decisions and definitions of change account for the very essence of school-based management, increasing school autonomy through some combination of school budgetary controL, relief from constraining policies and contracts, and shared authority to make decisions (cited in David, 1989). The true basis for school-based management is delegation of autonomy from the district to the school level. Analysts have described authority, or autonomy, as decision-making authority in the three critical areas of budget, staffing, and curriculum (cited in David, 1989). Budgeting authority has been given to schools, if at all, in varying ways. Schools may receive lump-sum budgets or some portion of budgets for certain expenditures. Autonomy is dependent upon the degree of freedom allowed in budgeting at the school site. Typically funds are allocated to schools on the basis of per-pupil figures. Many districts require approval of school-based budgets by line staff members, while others require only superintendent or board approval with oversight by central finance staff (David, 1989). In Fort Worth budgets for individual schools are expected to be developed by the school-based decision-making team. Funds are placed at the school on a per-pupil basis with certain funds marked as "carryover," while other funds, also allocated on a per-pupil basis, are designated as "non carryover." Each year additional monies have been placed in site-based budget by program directors, thereby increasing the autonomy of the local school in terms of prioritizing expenditures. Costs for all aspects of school management are budgeted at the site with the exclusion of basic salaries and benefits for allocated staff. Lunchroom monitors, for example, if desired, must be budgeted using school-based funds. Custodial overtime must be covered by school-based funds. Staffing decisions allocated to school-based management councils or teams usually are one of two types-- defining positions, and selecting personnel to fill those positions. Once the number of certified teachers is determined by enrollment, residual dollars are available to many councils for additional teachers, part-time specialists, aides, or clerical support. Under school-based management, vacancies due to retirement, transfer, or increased enrollment may be filled at the local school level, often from a pool of applicants screened by the district. In 1990 the writer was transferred from the original 450-member school to a larger, new school. Early on at the new school, hiring staff on recommendation of grade-level peers was implemented. Interviews are usually done by several teachers and one or both administrators. The teachers and administrator(s) usually reach consensus about the applicants before positions are filled. The rationale is simple--if a teacher, either new or experienced, is to succeed at a school, he/she must have peer support. By being involved in placement decisions , teachers are more willing to share their professional expertise and valuable time. Curriculum decisions made by school-based management teams are usuallymade within the framework of goals and core curriculum mandated by the state and/or district. Curriculum decisions are impossible, however, in some school sites because of highly prescribed curricula, required texts, and mandated testing (David, 1989). When curriculum decisions are school-based, coordination is required for students who move from school-to-school within a district. Delegation of control over curriculum stimulates creation of new, innovative ideas and materials, but it requires new lines of communication and district wide committees to coordinate. David (1989) observed that most teachers have neither the desire nor the time to create and adapt curriculum beyond what they normally do in their own classrooms. Typical participation does not require formal school-based management decisions on curriculum; many districts have committees of teachers who actively choose texts and define curriculum while providing opportunities for input into both from other teachers in the field. Most curriculum is written during the summer by teachers who are paid stipends for their efforts. Under school-based decision making in the area of curriculum, the school staff, instead of district personnel, initiate and lead the efforts. School-based management is not limited to staff empowerment. Schools where staff are empowered, however, are characterized by greater teacher collegiality and collaboration, "schools within schools," ungraded classes, and even creative uses of technology and equipment. Under school-based management, schools may gain authority to make changes in areas not typically designated to them by a waiver process. Texas has a system whereby textbook publishers solicit the state board of education for adoption. The board typically adopts textbook series from five publishers from which the local districts may select one. In 1992-93 Fort Worth was in the process of selecting basal reading texts. Committed to "whole language," the texts reflected a wide array of literature-based choices. The school-based management team at our school had begun to realize that there was a problem with reading at the school. Every year from 10 to 20 percent of first graders were unable to read on first grade level. The dilemma was one of what to do -- retain the child (which was largely rejected because of negative results on the child reported in research), place the child in second grade, or work intensively with the child at both first and second grade. Combinations of all three solutions were tried, none was totally satisfactory. The team began looking for alternatives. Research articles, summaries of research studies, etc., everything we found on reading instruction was shared. Members of the team visited other schools to see what they were doing in the area of reading. Part of the school-based budget funds was used to secure substitutes for the teacher members of the team. It was finally decided to utilize an entirely different approach to language arts instruction--an approach tied to a publisher who was not one of those selected by the state. As a result of a waiver, the school was allowed to implement the Open Court language arts program. Initial data suggest the change was a productive one. The waiver process itself was extremely time-consuming. The members of the management team had to win the support of their constituents -- nothing would have succeeded without the total commitment and agreement of the faculty. They "bought into" the program and were enthusiastic in their training by company consultants during the spring of 1993. Training opportunities have been maintained by company consultants for new and experienced staff. Research on school-based management support personal observations. Schools with autonomy plus participatory decision making have much higher teacher satisfaction, morale and professionalism. Teachers are willing to try innovations and risk failure with instructional arrangements and practices in the classroom. They are willing to take the time to try new methods, new ideas, change. When teachers feel that their time and energy are balanced with real authority, they are not only more satisfied, but they also grow professionally. They are willing to assume responsibility for success or failure of planned change (David, 1989) Researchers who studied school-based management councils in three districts, Dade County, Florida, Prince William County, Virginia, and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for two years found that transferring power allowed staff to respond to students' instructional needs and to redirect school finances accordingly (United States General Accounting Office [GAO], 1994). It was difficult, however, to ascertain any impact on student performance, in part because of the diversity of the quality of reforms adopted by the councils (cited in Richardson, 1994). Experience in the three districts with school-based management studied ranged from four to eighteen years. Most of the schools changed instructional programs by extending the school day, adding accelerated courses, and offering all-day kindergartens. They also adjusted school budgets, shifting resources between staff, supplies, and equipment. Teachers and administrators in some of the schools were found by the researchers to be so concerned with school governance they were unable to focus on instruction (GAO, 1994). Dade County Florida Public Schools was the fourth largest school system in the United States in 1989. Some form of school-based management was used by many of the schools in the county. Committees consisting of teachers and the principal met to develop academic priorities and to draw up school budgets based on those priorities. The committees reallocated funds to increase teacher stipends, develop lead teacher programs, and, in one school, to contract with an outside firm to teach Spanish. Some principals had veto power over decisions, but many relinquished that right in favor of persuasion and consensus-building (Stover, 1989). Research on Dade County councils, however, found no significant change in standardized-test scores over the pilot program period. One reason may be that standardized tests may be inappropriate measures for assessing the types of educational innovations that school-based management is intended to promote, such as greater problem-solving skills and the ability to work collaboratively in groups. Such measures may ignore the benefits derived from collaborative decision making, such as higher staff morale and more positive school climate (Bradley and Olson, 1993). By 1992 at least four states, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Texas, had mandated some form of participatory school decision making. Initial enthusiasm in such large systems as Chicago, Illinois; Miami, Florida; Los Angeles and San Diego, California; and Rochester, New York had given way to intensive reevaluation of its usefulness. Many educators and members of the general public agreed that school-based management had provided a mechanism for greater parent and community involvement as well as improved teacher morale, but anticipated achievement gains as measured by standardized tests had not occurred (Bradley and Olson, 1993). Priscilla Wohlstetter, director of the School-Based Management Project for the Consortium for Policy Research in Education, observed "School-based managementis everywhere, but nowhere" (cited in Bradley and Olson, 1993). School-based management evolved into many things, diverse and variant, making evaluation of the entire movement difficult, if not impossible. Mandated by Governor Roy Romer in 1991 in Denver, Colorado's 112 public schools, results of school-based management have been mixed. There was criticism that the central administration had not implemented collaborative decision making. Critics complained that there were no formal goals and no evaluation of effectiveness in place. Spokesmen from the Citizens for Quality Schools, a Denver advocacy group supporting reform, complained that the district had not "embraced collaborative decision making as a primary reform strategy" (cited in Bradley and Olson,1993). After the first year, the advocacy group perceived that the administration was reluctant to yield power to the schools, and progress toward tangible goals was sluggish. While the district had identified major goals for achievement and attendance, they had failed to couple these with reform, to focus attention and evaluation of school-based management councils on growth in those areas. Denver councils who have made progress have done so in the areas of attendance, discipline, and tardiness policies (Bradley and Olson, 1993). Problems in school-based management Problems have surfaced in school-based management. There has been a tendency to start local school management with inordinate concern over governance. One school moved into school-based management with a council composed of faculty members elected by peers and the building principal. The faculty council requested the school secretary to uke minutes for all teacher meetings. The principal voiced objections, pointing out that with all the team, grade-level meetings, etc., too much of the secretary's time would be consumed. The council persisted. The secretary attended several meetings, generating some 12 to 15 typed pages of texts which were given to faculty members to edit. Another meeting was called, and the vote was reconsidered. Although the entire process had taken a great deal of staff time and produced no tangible results, the process had in effect been a "reality-test" by the faculty. The principal had not vetoed the bad decision, and the faculty had acted responsibly in reconsidering (Aronstein, Marlow, and Desilets, 1990). Another problem with school-based management is the notion that school improvement should come from dominant "values" in each community.Decisions to improve instruction should be based upon research. Local school groups need to be involved in goal setting and decision making, but they must have information to enable them to accomplish the task. Research has identified the kind of learning environment that enhances student motivation, challenges all students, accelerates learning, and maximizes potential. Such knowledge and research must be shared with teachers and parents who are in a position to decide how that knowledge relates to their schools and circumstances (Midgley and Wood, 1993). Although school-based management teams should attend more to research than to community values, management teams must be cognizant of community values. They must inform and represent their constituents in order to avoid fire storms of controversy. In 1992 Adrian Michigan schools undertook a "whole child" approach to school improvement. The school board was challenged by vocal protestors who claimed that the program had "New Age" elements and"promoted satanism." The schools finally had to retreat from their position (Willis, 1992). Persons in a well informed community where all sides are allowed to express their concerns and views before decisions are finalized will not be herded into accepting views held by a vocal minority. Before effective sustained change can be implemented, there must be a common vision for what the education environment will look like once changes are made. Pervasive changes in the cultures of schools must occur rather than add-on programs, new instructional strategies, or the latest curriculum reform (Midgley and Wood, 1993). Seymour Sarason (cited in Midgley and Wood, 1993) proposed the notion that "schools are cultures." Cultural change is complex and difficult because it involves questioning basic assumptions, challenging the status quo. Reformers who call for pervasive change stress that reform in education must be an ongoing process rather than a series of attempts to respond to the latest educational innovations. School reform, has, unfortunately, largely continued to stress one change at a time, without considering specifics of context and school culture (Ann Liberman, cited in Midgley and Wood, 1993). When schools are given only marginal authority and are asked to form site councils which must develop written improvement plans and annual progress reports, teachers tend to perceive the entire process as more "top-down demands." This perception is intensified when districts retain tight control over accountability. The practice of delegating responsibility without real authority leads to staff alienation (David, 1989). One reason cited for problems with school-based management is that teachers have been given little opportunity to make decisions about "tracking, design of report cards, prevalence of gifted and talent program or programs for at-risk, use of standardized tests, and structure of the school day" (Sharon Conley, cited in Midgley and Wood 1993). Teachers want to be allowed to make decisions about issues which are of primary interest to them. The Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) was implemented in that state after the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the state's system of schooling was unconstitutional. KERA created a new system of public education supported by increased and more equitable funding. In exchange for being held accountable for improvement, schools were given authority to make school-level policy decisions. Monetary rewards were attached to success with sanctions for failure (David, 1994). Each school was to form a council with authority to set policy in eight areas: curriculum, staff time, student assignment, schedule, school space, instructional issues, discipline, and extracurricular activities. Councils were also given responsibility for staffing decisions when vacancies occur, consulting on other staff hiring, and changing staffing patterns at the margins. KERA requires all public schools by the year 1996 to form councils composed of three teachers and two parents (elected by peers) and the school principal (David, 1994). KERA also included curriculum frameworks that communicate goals, professional development in support of their implementation, mandatory ungraded primary program, and a set of new assessment instruments forming the basis for accountability. The new assessments emphasize direct measures of performance and thinking, including portfolios and performance tasks (David, 1994). During the first year of KERA, the school management councils were a major force in communicating the importance and seriousness of the act. Teachers welcomed the opportunity to select principals, and parents were glad to have a voice in school policy making. Challenges which had to be overcome that first year included shifting from adversarial to partner relationships, focusing school decision making on teaching and learning, ensuring ongoing opportunities for on-the-job professional development and finding balance between state and district requirement and school council discretion (David, 1994). The second year reflected progress toward the goal. With the ceding of budgets, clarification of council authority, release of baseline test scores and targets for each school, the state stressed school-based management as a significant change in decision-making authority. The Kentucky Court of Appeals recently ruled that school councils have "real authority" to run the schools while school boards are limited to "oversight" (David, 1994). Researchers have repeatedly identified leadership as a crucial element in effectiveness of school-based management. The key to success of local school councils lies to a great extent with the principal (Guthrie, 1986). David (1994) found that principals determined to a large degree the type of operation of the Kentucky councils. "Principals who are accustomed to sharing authority are more likely to have effective councils whose members feel that they have a real voice. Principals who are traditionally more authoritarian are more likely to head councils whose teacher and parent members feel powerless" (David, 1994). When the school staffs give background information to parents and value their participation, parents become active participants. In some cases parents on the council or auxiliary committees are valuable sources of information on group-process skills and budgeting (David, 1994). Council members cause problems when they come to the council with personal agendas. School management councils cannot become forums for dealing with problems of individual students, teachers, or parents. Issues need to be debated openly if they are to be resolved effectively. Councils must also communicate their roles to their constituencies if they are to be successful. Councils that see themselves representing the whole school will bring issues to the staff and the community for discussion and input, conduct surveys, and create clear channels of communication (David, 1994). The leadership style of principals plays a major role in determining the type of council their school will develop. The role of the principal, however, has greatly changed as a result of school-based management. Principals find they are no longer the primary decision maker. Their role has shifted from decision maker to facilitator (Drury, 1993). Effective principals work to spread power throughout the organization and increase commitment of all constituents to change. Effective principals and councils have vertical and horizontal work groups or subcommittees embracing nearly every teacher as well as parents and other community members. These work groups or subcommittees focus on certain areas such as assessment, curriculum, professional development, offering forums for teachers and others to discuss school-specific issues and make recommendations to the school management council (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994). Members of effective school management councils, received continuous staff development in planning instructional and program changes, current knowledge about teaching, learning, and curriculum. They received training in teamwork processes -- work groups, decision making, attaining consensus, and leadership. They received training in budgeting and personnel skills. Principals who were associated with successful teams called not only upon district staff development personnel but also consultants from private industries and universities (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994). Successful principals must utilize communication skills to a higher degree. Successful principals disseminated information on school activities and student performance, not just scores from their own school but their scores compared with other schools and districts. They shared information with other principals. They informed their staffs and council members about research and innovative practices (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994). Successful principals rewarded staff for assumption of greater responsibilities. They provided lighter teaching loads or made it possible for staff to attend professional development activities. Principals who increased their visibility in the community by becoming more active in public relations were often rewarded by financial and in-kind contributions (Wohlstetter and Briggs 1994). Successful principals have learned to listen, established frameworks for communication, understand styles of others, promote open communication, work to build trust, think with new perspectives, empower others, and take time for self-reflection (Bergman, 1992). One study followed principals who received training in team building with their teachers. Principals who trained with teachers were more likely to share convictions, strengthen ties between themselves and teachers, and experience a narrowing of the gulf between teachers and administrator. When principals were insecure or lacked self-confidence, they impaired team effectiveness. Teams most likely to bring about change were those where the principal was receptive to change and sharing authority (Maeroff, 1993).

Whatmust be in place? Central administrators must accept change and not be allowed to sabotage. Conflicts in some districts have been resolved by a school-based management director who answers directly to the superintendent. Members of the school-based management councils must be trained in the skills of consensus-building, avoiding resistance, and successful guidance (see also Glickman, 1992). Principals and management councils must be allowed freedom and time even if they make mistakes. Where unions and labor contracts place restrictions on principals, personnel issues such as hiring, dismissal, or different treatment across the system must be resolved. The role of central administration must be defined. Principals may be accountable for test scores, evaluated by parent, teachers, or student surveys, and supervised by line position staff (Neal, 1989). Members of the management team must be held accountable for their decisions as a group. There must be an efficient system for communicating and sharing information with shareholders (David, 1994). Members of the council must constantly be reminded that their purpose is to improve student learning. Instructional improvement is the standard against which each decision made by a school-based management council must be measured. School-based management should be part of broader systemic strategies for improving teaching and learning (Bradley and Olson, 1993). An information system must be developed to support school-based management (Bradley and Olson, 1993). Performance of the school-based management council must be constantly evaluated. Newmann (1993) identified six valued outcomes against which proposals and programs can be evaluated: Authentic student achievement - what kind of achievement should bevalued? Conventional achievement - learning, reproducing specific definitions,facts, skills Authentic achievement - use mind to produce discourse, materialobjects, performance tasks with personal. aesthetic, utilitarian value Problem:Critics claim conventional achievement dominates formal educational system and stifles student engagement in learning, suppresses critical andcreative thinking, and minimizes application of school learning to life. Equity - to the extent educational opportunities are determined by race, social class, gender, cultural background, the system violates the democratic principle of equal educational opportunity Empowerment Prominent theme - new decision-making structures raise complex issues of score and authority; increased empowerment Increased empowerment of teachers brings increased responsibilities, school curriculum, hiring, budget, interactions with parents Communities of learning Research suggests society would benefit from efforts to transform impersonal, fragmented bureaucratic organizations (such as schools) into places where participants share common goals, pursue common agenda of activities though collaboration In communities of learning Teachers and students relate to each other as whole persons Teachers and students participate in, take responsibility for collective life of the school Three social forces that work against communities of learning include: cultural differentials related to race, ethnicity, class, gender, and urbanicity professionalism cultural value attached to individual autonomy as most important criterion for quality of life Reflective dialogue "Belief systems cannot be changed by unilateral imposition or by the simple replacement of an old belief with a new one." Beliefs change - dialogue stimulating opening questioning, testing of basic assumptions through new experiences Reflective dialogue allows teachers, administrators, policy makers, and parents to make decisions about optimal educational practice through study and discussion. Reflective dialogue requires access to knowledge. Accountability Rather than controlling and regulating the process of education (such as course credits, curriculum content, staffing ratios) schools will be held more accountable for student learning. Accountability means assessment must be gathered whose indicators can be compared across classrooms, schools, and districts. Accountability must make assessment data accessible to the public. Allocation of positive, negative consequences for student performance Issues - what standards should be used to evaluate student performance; this is particularly problematic if the point of accountability is to enable the public to compare schools. Cole (1992) wrote that in order to have successful school-based management, districts must be ready in terms of support and flexibility. Cole offered these questions to measure the readiness of a district with regard to support, flexibility: Are policies, programs, and people sufficiently flexible to ensure the capacity to respond to changing conditions? Do contracts, board policies, and state laws and regulations permit flexible use of time, people, space, knowledge, technology, and physical support? Are time, people, space, knowledge, technology, and physical support assigned in a manner that is responsive to the needs of those with responsibility to carry out tasks? Do those who carry out tasks for the district feel supported by district leaders and by the resources of the district? Cole (1992) identifies time, people, space, knowledge, technology and physical support as six key elements that combine to create the chemistry of a school, the building blocks of innovation and improvement. Redefining schools requires rethinking of deeply held assumptions about the use of space and time in school, for example. Before a new calendar can be adopted must come recognition that the use of time is something that can be changed. Before change, however, must come a change in vision. Cole (1993) states that a shared vision ensures commitment to change and to improve; it prevents reform from being a "revolving door." Visions that provide direction must be grounded in a thoroughly articulated set of beliefs about the purpose of schools; the ability of students to learn; the factors that determine the opportunity to learn; the roles of the family and community in relation to students and schools; the kind of society for which children are being prepared; the proper focus of school activity; the rules, roles, relationships that govern behavior within schools, between schools, and the district office, between schools and community; the obligation of the system to employees; and the role of the system in encouraging and supporting innovation. Cole (1993) said, "A vision of schooling taken for granted and thus unshared is not a vision that has the power to compel change." If lasting change is to occur, Cole (1993) states the following questions must be asked and answered regularly: What is the purpose of the school? Who are the school's clients, and what are their needs? How well does the school meet its clients' needs? How, then, does a school-based management council or team begin? Most of the articles published on school-based management chronicle what not to do in order to be successful. One excellent manual for training facilitators to develop and implement school-based management was compiled by James Mitchell, superintendent of Adams Twelve Five Star Schools in Colorado(1990). Mitchell (1990) suggests that each council meeting begin with a team-building activity. Such activities allow members an opportunity to express anxieties, establish verbal territory (get contributions going, avoid one person domination), begin group bonding and acceptance, and allow practice in listening with respect to no side conversations, no walking out, no judgments, etc. Management teams usually have members with a wide variety of personalities, backgrounds, talents, and skills (Mitchell, 1990). Team members have different knowledge, motivation, and enthusiasm levels. Each team members comes with an agenda peculiar to that individual member. There are a number of ways teams may problem-solve together (See Appendix, Soffer, 1992). One method utilized for problem-solving by school-based management teams is brainstorming. Basic rules which encourage successful brainstorming (Mitchell, 1990) include the following: No criticism. Participants may make no negative comments about any contributions. All contributions should be listed as stated. Write contributions on a chalkboard, flip chart, etc. using a scribe. Encourage all team members to contribute. Encourage team members to modify ideas suggested to make a new idea or combine two or more ideas into another possibility. Continue the process until no further contributions are generated. Ask the participant who suggested it to clarify any contributions which are unclear. Contributions may be categorized to assist in clarification. If the team has been divided into small groups, allow each group to report back to the larger group. Avoid repeating contributions already listed. Record contributions made. Consensus must then be developed. Mitchell (1990) suggests a rather unique method to determine if consensus is being reached. He uses a "straw vote" procedure which utilizes a show of fingers. Five fingers indicate "Total agreement, best solution, complete support," four fingers indicate "Agreement, support, good solution," three fingers indicate "Willing to support," two fingers indicate "Don't agree, won't support, won't sabotage," and one finger indicates "Will sabotage." One important point which Mitchell (1990) makes is that every organization, including schools, has twenty percent who are "blockers." Blockers can be promised double salary, pay for staying home, and other enticements, but they will still balk at innovation or change. Because it is extremely difficult to get everyone to agree, Mitchell recommends going ahead with seventy to eighty percent agreement which he calls "sufficient consensus". At our school we make a conscious effort to get "buy in." If eighty percent of the staff, parents, or community members will "buy in" by giving a proposala "six on a scale of ten," and will agree not to block decisions made by the group, we will move forward. While this system acknowledges that some will disagree, it values all opinions and has allowed our management team to maintain forward thrust. Mitchell (1990) notes that in his district, principals do not have power to veto the school-based management team. Principals are part of the decision-making committee; if they veto, they destroy the process. The group, in turn, should be held responsible for a decision. According to Mitchell (1990) any planned change should include a plan for managing it. School-based decisions can be managed by educating the masses (good old fashioned communication to the shareholders), receiving a commitment to the decision from the central office, generating union support/evaluation, beginning facilitation/team building training, and by providing a support system. If a school based management team is not working, members should try to ascertain the cause (Mitchell, 1990). School-based decision making is hampered by misinformation, poor communication, uncertainty that the product is what is wanted, an inappropriate purpose for the request, lip service with no follow-through, lack of support, and no input into the decision-making process, "them" vs "us" attitude between parents and principals or parentsand teachers, principal mistrust, lack of central office commitment, inconsistency, lack of parameter to define what the team can/cannot do. and no support to eliminate incompetent personnel. Mitchell (1990) has also identified blocks to school-based management - deadlines, regurgitation of the same information already available through technology, lack of response, too much communication, turf wars, innovation overload, hidden agenda of individual members, and changes implemented without adequate communication. Mitchell (1990) warns that it is essential for any group representing a larger group to go back to the larger group prior to speaking for them. Such lack of feedback gives rise to criticisms of "elitism," a criticism which can effectively kill school-based management. What can I do for my learning disabled child in a school with school-basedmanagement? What then is the role of the parents of students with learning disabilities in school-based management? What can a parent hope to accomplish for their children in the school-based management process? First, the parent must become absolutely knowledgeable about what is happening at the school. Make sure you are receiving copies of all written communications from the school. If your child has an organization problem, do not assume that all written communications are coming to you. Request that communications be mailed to you. You may be more successful in this request if you take stamps to the school or even self-addressed, stamped envelopes.Once you learn what is happening in your own school, become involved with meetings. Attend meetings of the largest parent group at your school, either the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) or Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), booster club, or whatever. Usually school-based management team members are selected by the largest parent body at the school, although membership in the group is not usually a prerequisite for election. Attend meetings of the management team. Most schools publish at least the meeting time and place for all such team meetings. Our school publishes a newsletter giving the minutes of the previous meeting as well as the agenda for the coming meeting, the date, place, and time of day of the meeting. If this is not being done, request it from whatever entity communicates by newsletter from the school. Once you are familiar with what is happening at your own school, begin to pay close attention to the kinds of shareholders who make up the council or team. Are the members only teachers? Are parents members? Are there subcommittees or other councils? Who makes up the membership? How and when are members selected? Does the management team make recommendations for courses? If so, what provisions are made for students with learning disabilities? Are all students with learning disabilities mainstreamed? Are there resource classes? What subjects are taught utilizing special education teachers? You may want to become a member of your school-based management team. If you learn, for example, that none of the students with learning disabilities are being taught in special education classes with qualified, trained teachers, you may want to gather information for the council or team in terms of what research indicates students with disabilities need. Consult authors such as James Kauffman (Exceptional Children, September 1993), the Learning Disabilities Association of America position paper on Inclusion, February, 1993, and Reid Lyon ("Inclusion: Can it work for students with learning disabilities," National Institutes of Health, 1994). You may want to get copies of articles or pamphlets to share with members of your school council or team. What about transition services at your school for students with learning disabilities? Who is responsible for transition planning? When must transition planning be done? What data are brought to transition planning meetings? With what agencies does the school work to ensure smooth transitions from school? Questions such as these may be answered by the principal, school counselor, vocational counselor, special education counselor (if any), vocational teacher or supervisor, special education supervisor or even special education director. Once you know what is being done, begin to formulate ways to improve the situation. Meet with other parents of students with disabilities - do they have problems? What has happened to their children? What should happen but is not being done? Certainly a local LDA affiliate is a place to begin to contact parents representative of your school. If you find that little or nothing is being done toward easing the transition from school to work or post secondary education, articulate with other parents what is needed. Make written recommendations to the school-based management council with details as to strategies, resources needed, time lines, etc. Brainstorming is an excellent process for defining such recommendations. Ask your group how transition should look if it were to meet the needs of all students with learning disabilities. What barriers currently exist to the ideal? How can these barriers be broken or overcome? What resources are needed to effect a positive change? It is important at the high school level to think of what comes next for students. Students graduating from high school have essentially two options - go to post secondary educational settings, colleges or universities, or enter the world of work. What skills or knowledge must a student have to be successful at either? What is currently in place in the curriculum, accessible to the student with learning disabilities, that would prepare him/her for post secondary education or for employment? If there is none, there must be a beginning. If, as in Texas, so-called "basic classes" have been discontinued at the high school level, then the curriculum formerly taught in those classes must be available in other settings, i.e. resource rooms, for students with learning disabilities. If a student is unable to master algebra, is there a course where pre-algebra will be taught to mastery? Is algebra the "gate-keeper" course at your high school through which Students must pass if they are to go on to post secondary education? Can students with disabilities pass algebra at your high school? The school-based decision making team is a mechanism which can effect changes in time, scheduling, tracking, course curricula, assessments, etc. Accessing the system requires information, both of the management team and of the current system. Creating change requires a vision of how the ideal looks -- how will you know you have what is needed in order to facilitate your child's entering college successfully or acquiring vocational skills to get at least a beginning-level job? How can you translate that vision so it will be shared by other members of the school-based management team? Conclusion School-based management councils or teams are apparently an accepted, integral part of the reform movement in the United States. Whether the needs of students with learning disabilities are being met in our educational institutions depends on knowledge and interest of shareholders and participants. Parents must become informed -- they must learn to access the system, to share the power, to be a part of the solution if reform is to equate to change and improvement in the system for the learning disabled.Members of our school-based management teams have at one time or another included parents of students with disabilities being served in regular class, resource, or other instructional arrangements. In almost every instance, these parents have informed the larger group about what is needed in order for theirs and similar children to successfully participate in learning. Our school-based management teams have decided upon the physical location of classes for students with disabilities, sought and provided accessibility to classrooms and other areas of the school, and even facilitated inclusion of students with disabilities in field trips and extracurricular activities. Your willingness to work, to share, and to be a responsible part of the decision-making team at your school could well be the difference between success or failure, not only of your child but also other students with disabilities.

One additional central public school office administrator designated by the district's chief school administrator may become a voting member providing he/she is certified as a school administrator and is designated to serve the district in that capacity in the absence of the chief school district administrator. *GOVERNSHIP Management of the affairs of this Association shall be vested in a Board of Directors. Board members shall be elected from within the voting membership in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaws. *OFFICERS The officers of the Association shall be the President-elect, the President and the Past President. The officers shall serve as an Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. *EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR The Board of Directors shall hire an Executive Director who shall also act as Treasurer of the Association. *SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ALLIANCE WASDA, the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators and the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials have united in their legislative efforts to promote the improvement of education for the children of Wisconsin. In these politically volatile times it is essential that all school administrators work together to take a leadership role in educational reform. *LEGAL COUNSEL AND ASSISTANCE The WASDA maintains a policy whereby assistance will be provided to members in order to assure that due process is followed at the local school district level when members find themselves in conflict with the school board. The assistance is provided both through a visitation team program established with the WASB and the other administrative associations, as well as through direct financial assistance for legal counsel. *COMMITTEES The WASDA operates under the committee structure and looks to the action, activities and recommendations of the committees when developing policies. The following committees have been established by the WASDA: STANDING COMMITTEES: Awards Committee Constitution, Policies & Resolutions Committee Ethics & Administrator-Board Relations Committee Jt. Convention Booth & Planning Committee Legislative Committee Professional Improvement Committee Retirement Committee Small Schools Committee Teacher/Principal of the Year Committee AD HOC COMMITTEES: Administrative Salaries & Fringe Benefit Committee Child Advocacy Committee Education for Employment Committee Gifted & Talented Committee K-8 Administrator Issues Committee Liaison With Higher Education Committee Management Team Committee School Facilities Committee Special Education Committee *WASDA IN-SERVICE PROGRAMS The WASDA provides a variety of professional improvement seminars and workshops such as: New Administrators Workshop, Annual Summer Bill Kahl Seminar, New/Beginning Administrators Conference, Annual Political Seminar, seven Drive-in conferences, a group trip to the Annual AASA National Convention, Annual Small School Conference, and the Annual Educational Conference. *WASDA The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators began as an organization on July 1, 1959. Dr. Miles Turner serves as the Executive Director for the WASDA. *ETHICS The WASDA has established and adopted a Code of Ethics that should be adhered to by all WASDA members. While space does not permit the inclusion of the entire Code of Ethics in this pamphlet, the general tone can be grasped by printing the first sentence of the WASDA Code: "The professional school administrator constantly upholds the honor and dignity of the educational profession in all actions and relations with pupils, colleagues, school board members, and the public." *AASA The WASDA maintains a charter membership in the AASA and also enjoys a close working relationship with the American Association of School Administrators.

WISCONSIN ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS POLICIES AASA ELECTION POLICY (Financial support for candidates) In order for a candidate running for AASA office to qualify for financial assistance from the WASDA, the candidate first must receive the endorsement of the WASDA Board of Directors. Any WASDA candidate that receives the endorsement of the WASDA Board of Directors shall receive financial assistance on a matching basis not to exceed $500. Thus, the candidate would have to spend a minimum of $1,000 of his/her own money in order to receive $500 from the WASDA. ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION A.The association should continue this committee and take the initiative in arranging for a joint meeting with representatives from the various state administrative and supervisory groups in an effort to reach mutual agreement on guidelines for compensation. B.The guidelines reached through the mutual efforts and agreement of the administrative groups should be presented to the WASB by the WASDA committee at a joint committee meeting. This joint committee should be charged with the development of administrative compensation guidelines that can be submitted to the various administrative groups for their approval. C.A document should result from the successful implementation of the above recommendations that will provide uniform guidelines for the compensation of administrators in all Wisconsin public schools. D.The committee recommends that the association encourage all districts to develop written plans that include the rationale used to compensate the administrative staff. ADMINISTRATIVE EVALUATIONS Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators endorse the concept that written evaluations be provided each member of the administrative team on an annual basis. The written evaluation would be utilized when the decision process is used regarding the renewal or the nonrenewal of any member of the administrative team's contract with the local school district. ADMINISTRATOR SHORTAGE The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators is concerned with the current and developing shortage of qualified candidates for entry level administrative and middle management positions in the state. This situation, if not corrected, will create a vacuum of leadership in Wisconsin schools at a time when the challenges facing public education are greater than at any time in our state's history. The shortage of qualified candidates, it is believed by WASDA, has been caused by a number of factors. The main contributing forces are: 1.The large number of current administrators nearing retirement age. This is borne out by studies completed in the state. The number of retirees will be accelerated by the early retirement window and permanent retirement benefit changes recently enacted. 2.The lack of financial incentive for talented educators to leave the classrooms and move into administrative positions as in the past. Teacher salaries have increased to the point that many assistant principals, principals, supervisors, and coordinators make less than their counterparts in the classroom. This is not only the case when comparisons are made on the basis of daily rate of pay, which has been a reality for years, but on an annual salary basis. 3.The increased demands on administrators in the rapidly changing world of education. The level of training, experience and knowledge necessary to deal with the stresses, decisions, and problems in a modern school system have increased dramatically. This has led to potentially talented administrators selecting less challenging positions with equal or greater material rewards. 4.The lack of convenient administrative training opportunities for practicing educators. The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators recognizes that a long term solution to the situation cannot be developed and implemented quickly or easily. However, institutions and organizations concerned with the quality of schools and school leadership need to work together to develop a long range approach to supplying leadership for Wisconsin's schools. There are some short range solutions to easing the shortage that should be considered pending development of a more permanent resolution of the problem. They include: 1.The development of incentive grants for local districts or consortiums to provide for administrative training programs for promising educators. This could be combined with internships to provide a more practical and relevant program. 2.Encouragement of institutions of higher learning to offer more administrative training programs. Efforts should be made to take the programs to the clients at times and in locations that encourage enrollment. The advice of practicing administrators should be sought in designing and establishing these programs. Qualified practitioners could be used as a valuable teaching resource. 3.School boards and district administrators need to recognize and respond to the need to provide greater financial incentives to encourage individuals to enter the administrative field and continue in the field. The cooperative efforts of the DPI, colleges and universities, local universities, local districts, legislators, and professional education associations will be necessary to develop and implement these recommendations. ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM CONCEPT The administrative team as it is perceived in education is comprised of all members of the school administrative staff. The team will vary as to size of school districts, as to job description, and as representatives are selected at all levels. Proper organization to facilitate maximum involvement of all members in decisions relating to school district policy is imperative. If the community is to benefit, goal setting, evaluation of achieved goals and implementation of positive outcomes, must be an integral part of the administrative team function. There is no single formula to prescribe procedures and techniques that are mandatory in implementing the administrative team style of operation. Each school district must consider these problems in the context of local conditions. Those responsible for the direction of public education are continually responding to pressures and criticisms, both from within and outside the institution itself. It has become impossible to effectively manage the educational institution without some formalized structure that assures the input of all components of management in the decision making process and a free flow of communication among the board, the administration, the instructional staff, students, parents and the general public. PRINCIPLES FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM A.Administrators responsible for implementing policies should provide input when the policies are developed. B.Group decision making: 1.Increases the quality of the decision. 2.Reduces the usual errors of chance which occur when one person makes the decision. 3.Increases the security of the risk taken through decision making. 4.Improves the rationality and consistency of administration. C. Involvement as a team: 1.Increases motivation and staff morale. 2. Improves individual productivity and school district climate. 3.Strengthens individual administrator's commitment to district goals. D.The involvement of many individuals provides more creative solutions which enhance the potential of the school district. E.Group decision making facilitates the implementation of the plans developed. F.School boards must adopt formal policy statements supporting the concept of the school administrative team. G.Discussion between administrative team members and school boards in respect to conditions affecting individual welfare and working conditions are not inconsistent with the concept of the administrative team.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING Collective Bargaining The WASDA recognizes collective bargaining as a legal and reasonable method for determining wages, hours and conditions of employment for nonsupervisory school district employees. Impasse Resolution The WASDA recognizes arbitration as a means of resolving bargaining impasses. The WASDA further declares its opposition to the use of strikes by school district employees as a means of resolving bargaining impasse. While the association supports binding arbitration and the arbitration "all or none" law, WASDA believes that the current impasse resolution procedures of the municipal collective bargaining law seriously hamper good faith bargaining in Wisconsin's public sector. In that regard, the WASDA supports these changes to the current law: 1.A specific cut-off date shall be established at the close of the investigation conducted by the mediator prohibiting any further opportunity for either party to change their proposed positions as submitted to the arbitrator. 2.Require that when a petition is filed for binding arbitration, the WERC shall require the petitioning party to submit its final offer on each issue in the dispute with the petition. 3.The second party shall submit its final offer on each issue to the arbitrator within 14 days of the receipt of the petitioning party's final offer. Once the second party submits its final offer, it can no longer modify the language or add any new issues. 4.The current provision in the statutes whereby a petition for arbitration must include a preliminary final offer shall be deleted. In essence, it is the position of the WASDA that the offer submitted by the petitioning party and the offer submitted by the second party shall constitute their final offers. 5.The arbitrator shall give consideration to local and/or area economic conditions and indicators such as localemployment levels, local business climate and monetary adjustments in locally negotiated public and private settlements. 6.In addition to the direct economic conditions to be considered by the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall also consider both the immediate and the long range economic impact the language and policy modifications will have upon the educational programs available to the students at the local school district level. 7.Arbitrators shall be required to hold a public hearing with meaningful prior notice given to the citizens of the jurisdiction served by the municipal employer. Comments by the citizens of the jurisdiction shall be part of the hearing record and shall be given consideration by the arbitrator. 8.The arbitrator shall be required to issue the award within forty-five (45) days of the arbitration hearing. 9.The WERC arbitrators shall be determined by chance rather than by selection by the two parties. However, this does not prohibit the two parties to jointly select an arbitrator from outside of the WERC appointment. Also, the WASDA recommends the arbitrators to be selected from the same region, area or congressional district, when possible, of the school district involved in the arbitration process. 10.The WERC shall evaluate arbitrators on a regular basis and shall remove arbitrators it finds unsatisfactory, as well as those who repeatedly fail to issue timely decisions or who do not participate in adequate training programs. 11.The WASDA supports the concept that the arbitrators shall select either the board's or the union's final offer. (Adopted as revised April 23, 1987) COMMUNITY EDUCATION 1.Whereas, community education is based on the concept that education is a life-long process designed for people of all ages, and 2.Whereas, community education is based on the needs of people in the community and coordinates community resources and facilities. 3.Whereas, communities need effective coordination of services and identification of educational needs for all age groups, in this time of limited funds and inflationary periods; and 4.Whereas, the changing nature of communities, whether it be energy use, larger adult and senior citizen population, or single parent families, call upon education to consider the educational needs of all residents, and 5.Whereas, public schools have resources and buildings which are paid for by the community and generally available for use by the public. 6.Therefore be it resolved, the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators endorse the concept of community education; and 7.Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA urge its members to develop community education programs which will serve a broad cross section of their constituents which are oriented to the unique needs of diverse populations within the school community. CONSTITUTION Whereas, the WASDA represents the educational leadership in the state of Wisconsin with the specific purpose of excellence in education, and Whereas, the WASDA shall promote educational welfare of Wisconsin youths; professional growth and welfare ofadministrative, teaching and other school district personnel; placing the needs, problems and achievements of public schools to district residents; area meetings of educational leaders for the discussion of common interest; and to cooperate with the professional organizations and other organizations interested in improving education. Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA select a Constitution Committee to monitor the association's activities in respect to compliance with the constitution and bylaws of the association, and Further be it resolved that the committee review the constitution and bylaws on a yearly basis for the purpose of recommending changes made necessary or appropriate because of circumstances or progressive outmoding to the membership. CURRICULUM We support the position that the curriculum of public schools is a local district decision, and legislation mandates to enact curriculum for the public schools be opposed. DATA PROCESSING CENTERS Data processing centers to serve local school systems are a necessity if further procedures of cost accounting, program planning-budgeting, assessment, comprehensive planning, research and evaluation are to take place. WASDA will support legislation to have date processing centers established with state financing to serve the local school systems and that there be continued DPI leadership in planning for the development of these centers. DISMISSAL OR REHIRING OF TEACHERS WASDA recognizes that negotiations are not completed in most districts before March 15 and State Statute 118.22, Section 2, requires that teachers be notified whether or not they are going to be retained or dismissed on or before this date. This is approximately four months before the end of the school year and is a detriment to both teachers and students. WASDA recommends that legislation be introduced to change Wisconsin Statute 118.22, Section 2, to read April 15 instead of March 15 and May 15 instead of April 15. EMPLOYEE RECORDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The following guidelines are recommended to all school personnel dealing with confidential records and statements concerning past and present employees: 1.Know the liability insurance coverage in the district--coverage for omission and errors is comparable to malpractice insurance carried by medical doctors and dentists. 2.Base comments only on firsthand knowledge which can be documented with records, if necessary. 3.Avoid stating opinions that cannot be substantiated. 4.Limit the response to questions about present and past teachers to the professional qualifications of the person. 5.Never furnish an unsolicited negative recommendation. 6.Make every effort to restrict the communication to proper officials. 7.Avoid telephone evaluations since there is a tendency to speak in broader terms and give opinions without substantiation. 8.Be particularly careful if a personality conflict exists between you and a teacher if that person is involved in areas such as negotiations. 9.Discontinue the practice of making generalizations or subjective opinions relative to a person. ETHICAL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 1.In situations where a teacher employed in one district seeks employment in another district, it is the responsibility of the administrator who is considering offering new employment to the teacher to communicate with the administration of the district where the teacher is currently employed. 2.A school administrator should not initiate action which encourages a teacher to break a contract with another district. 3.An administrator should not permit a teacher to teach in his/her district when that teacher is under contract to teach in another district but is not fulfilling the contract. 4.Before a contract is offered to a teacher, it should be specifically determined that the teacher is legally able to sign the contract. 5.At no time should the hiring administrator visit prospective employees in school districts without the knowledge and permission of the local school administration. 6.Applicants who have been under consideration and placement offices where vacancies are posted should be informed when vacancies are filled. ETHICS I. INITIATING ACTION Problems involving the ethical conduct of any school administrator shall be referred to the state Ethics Committee. Except as otherwise provided herein, any complaint about the ethical behavior of an administrator or request for an investigation of his/her conduct must be presented in written form to the state Ethics Committee or executive body of the WASDA, and must bear the signature of the person or persons making the complaint or requesting an investigation. Neither the state Ethics Committee nor the Executive Committee of WASDA shall initiate action on the basis of hearsay, or oral request, anonymous letter or other unsigned documents. When circumstances exist which may indicate a possible violation of ethical behavior and no formal written complaint has been filed with either the Ethics Committee or the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors, by majority vote, direct the Ethics Committee to make a "preliminary investigation." The purpose of this preliminary investigation will be to ascertain the facts connected with a specific situation to determine whether or not a formal investigation should be conducted. Any member whose behavior is being questioned by this method shall be so notified. All reports of preliminary investigation shall be filed in written form with the Board of Directors and a copy given to the member whose behavior is being questioned. No disciplinary action will be taken as a result of a preliminary investigation. Written and signed complaints received by the Ethics Committee shall be disposed of, after due deliberation or investigation by a quorum of the committee at least ninety days from the receipt of the complaint. The committee may take any one of the following actions: 1.Drop the complaint for lack of reliable evidence or because the charges are inconsequential. 2.Drop the complaint on the grounds that it involves a question of administrative judgment rather than ethical behavior. 3.Authorize and institute a special investigation or hearing. 4. Issue a warning. 5.File a recommendation for disciplinary action with the WASDA Executive Committee. Investigations authorized by the state Ethics Committee shall be organized on the basis of teams of no less than three nor more than seven investigators with the qualifications necessary to gather accurate data on the submitted complaint. The revocation of an administrator's certificate by a legally constituted state authority, conviction by a court for a criminal offense, or censorshipby a duly recognized national or state professional organization or committee may constitute grounds for initiating an investigation by the state Ethics Committee. Special hearings may be convened by the state Ethics Committee subsequent to the report or recommendation of an investigating committee. Hearings should be confined to charges made known to the accused in writing. The accused should be apprised in writing of his/her professional rights and responsibilities, including the right to obtain legal counsel at his/her own expense. The chairperson of the Ethics Committee shall preside over hearings convened by that body. Hearings based on an investigation of facts in evidence should not be confused with hearings related to appeals from the judgment of the Ethics Committee or WASDA Executive Committee. II. JUDGMENTS AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS Judgments rendered by the state Ethics Committee shall be based on careful investigation of the validity of charges, after any necessary hearings have been held, and in the light of deliberations by at least a quorum of the committee. The judgment should be recorded in the official minutes of the committee. When it becomes necessary to institute disciplinary measures for conduct judged to be unethical, the following penalties may be used at the discretion of the Ethics Committee or the Executive Committee of WASDA: 1.Warnings or reprimands. Such action may be taken by the state Ethics Committee or WASDA Executive Committee. Written warnings or reprimands shall not be released by the committee but shall be considered a confidential exchange between a member and the state Ethics Committee or the Executive Committee. The person judged to have violated the Code of Ethics may at his/her own discretion release the nature of the warning or reprimands shall insist that unethical behavior cease or more severe disciplinary action may be taken. 2.Suspension. The state Ethics Committee may recommend suspension from membership to the Executive Committee of WASDA and may also make such recommendations to the AASA Ethics Committee. Decision on suspension from the state association shall rest with the Executive Committee, and final decision on suspension from AASA shall rest with the AASA Executive Committee. During the period of suspension, which shall be for no less than one year and no more than five years, a member shall-- A.not have membership status; B. be relieved of all committee assignments; C. not hold or be eligible for any association office; D. not be sent any publications of the association, and; E.not be invited to attend or participate in an official manner in any professional meetings held under the auspices of the association from which he has been suspended. During the last six months of a suspension, WASDA Ethics Committee shall review the record of a suspended member and recommend to WASDA Executive Committee whether the period of suspension shall be terminated at the appointed time, extended or changed to expulsion. 3.Expulsion. Expulsion implies permanent and total severance of relations with the professional association. Expulsion and details of expulsion shall remain a matter between the administrator and Executive Committee unless the administrator wishes to make it public. Only WASDA Executive Committee has authority to expel a member. WASDA shall notify the AASA in writing when a member is expelled from the state association. Any recommendation by the Ethics Committee for suspension or expulsion that is subsequently approved shall be considered effective on the date it is filed formally with the Executive Committee even though formal action is taken at a later date. The exception to this shall be where a petition for appeal has been filed within the time limits specified below. In appealed cases, suspensions or expulsions that are approved subsequently by the Board of Directors shall be recorded in the formal records as effective from the date the written petition for appeal was received in the office of the president or the Executive Director of WASDA. All disciplinary recommendations and actions, along with memoranda of investigations shall be matters of written records. These records shall be kept in the permanent and confidential files of the committee and association. III. RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS Every WASDA member shall be presumed to be innocent of ethical transgressions until evidence proves to the contrary. The administrator has available the following rights and avenues of appeal whenever ethical conduct is questioned and at all levels of disciplinary procedure the administrator has the right to be represented by counsel. 1.Any member whose ethical conduct is under question shall be notified in writing by registered letter by the state Ethics Committee that a complaint has been received questioning his/her ethical behavior and that sufficient grounds exist to institute further investigation of the facts pertaining to the case. 2.Any member whose ethical conduct is under question is entitled to written notice of specific charges lodged against him/her and to know the name(s) of his/her accuser(s). 3.Any member whose ethical conduct is questioned shall have the right to appear at any session where complaints concerning his/her ethical conduct are under review. The Ethics Committee shall inform the accused member of its recommendations, including recommendations for disciplinary action, if any, at the same time its recommendations are filed with the Executive Committee. 4.Any member subject to suspension or expulsion from WASDA shall be notified in writing by the President that WASDA Ethics Committee has recommended to the WASDA Executive Committee that the member be suspended or expelled from WASDA membership. He/she shall be informed of the time limits within which an appeal may be made and of appeal procedures. 5.The WASDA Executive Committee shall establish a satisfactory time and date for a hearing. The Ethics Committee and the member shall be present to make statements. The hearing must be held within 60 days of the Ethics Committee recommendations. 6.The Executive Committee will take action following the hearing. If suspension or expulsion is determined by majority vote of the Executive Committee, notice will be provided the member with an outline of the procedures for appeal. IV. APPEAL PROCEDURE Every member has the right to appeal suspension or expulsion by the Executive Committee. An appeal must be filed within 60 days following the date of written notification for suspension or expulsion by the Executive Committee. A petition for appeal shall be made in writing to the Executive Director of WASDA. A petition to appeal the decision of the Executive Committee to the complete membership of the WASDA Board of Directors shall be made through the office of the Executive Director. It shall be the responsibility of the Board of Directors to notify the appellant within 60 days of the receipt of the petition of the time and place for the hearing of the appeal to show cause why the decision of the Executive Committee should not be approved and implemented. The Board of Directors decision shall be final. The accused member shall bear all his/her personal and privately contracted legal expenses incurred in appearing before a state Ethics Committee, as well as in final appeals to the state Executive Committee and Board of Directors. V. REVIEW PROCEDURE Any accused member has the right to request that his/her case be reopened and judgements reevaluated whenever new evidence becomes available. The request shall be made in writing to WASDA Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee shall examine the evidence and determine whether sufficient grounds exist for reopening and reevaluating the case. The decision of WASDA Ethics Committee shall be final, and no further appeals are available from it. VI. ETHICS OF NON-MEMBERS OF WASDA The behavior of all administrators, non-members, as well as members of WASDA, influences the public image of school administrators. The public may find it difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish on the basis of limited contact between apractitioner who belongs to a professional society and one who does not. All too often it is assumed that those who practice the same profession are members of the same professional society. WASDA must demonstrate concern for the ethical behavior of all practicing administrators even though its influence may be greater among members than non-members. EVALUATION WASDA strongly supports the desirability of program and service evaluation at all levels of education in Wisconsin. The focus of such evaluations shall be on improvement so as to offer students in Wisconsin the best learning opportunities possible. Such evaluations shall be used to determine modifications in existing programs and the identification of unmet needs. It is also WASDA's position that the responsibility for providing quality education rests with the local school districts. Therefore, continuous efforts should be made to avoid the need for or imposition of legislative mandates. WASDA further endorses the desirability of national and state educational assessment programs as additional means to assess local programs. Finally, WASDA strongly favors and encourages efforts by institutions of higher education and other professional organizations which strive to develop meaningful criteria and measures for the evaluation of educational programs. FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION Whereas, WASDA believes that there is an appropriate place in the scheme of American education for the participation of the federal government through a financial and fiscal participation, and Whereas, WASDA is committed to the historic and constitutional position of local control of local government functions, and Whereas, WASDA while respecting the position of fiscal participation of the federal government, wishes to reaffirm its belief and position of strong local control, Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA supports the continuing and expanding participation of the federal government in public education to the point that it does not inherently weaken the position of the local government agency or body. INSERVICE EDUCATION Whereas, WASDA believes that school governments and administrator leadership must be maintained and advanced in a regular program of inservice education in order to insure quality education programs, and Whereas, such inservice educational programs are an essential district expense that realizes district investments many times over. Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA encourages local school boards and superintendents to support and participate in adequate inservice education programs, and Be it further resolved that such inservice education programs be an essential district expense. LEGISLATIVE 1.Recommendations of WASDA, especially as they pertain to the Legislative Committee, must be structured within a broad statement of political philosophy which will lend a high degree of flexibility to the legislative tasks and processes of the Legislative Committee. 2.The effectiveness of WASDA legislative efforts are in proportion to the number of administrators who actively participate in the political processes at all levels of government. Progress has been made in that respect, but certainly more administrators must involve themselves if our legislative program is going to grow in quality and strength. 3.Every effort should be made to maintain close working relationships with other administrative organizations. WASDA should as a matter of course invite members of these other organizations to send representatives to legislative meetings in the effort to broaden our base and maximize our efforts. Further, a similar type of relationship or workable alternative should exist between the WASDA legislative committee and the other working committees of WASDA as the business of such committees and their recommendations would impact upon legislative matters. 4.We support the philosophy that the Department of Public Instruction retain its allocation and utilization of state funding in the operation and implementation of its service responsibilities to the 400 plus school districts in the state. Also, that all federal funds coming into the state of Wisconsin relating to elementary and secondary education be processed through the Department of Public Instruction. PLATFORM - LOCAL CONTROL The Legislative Committee of WASDA rejects any charge that local control of public school education is a "myth" or that such local control has outlived its usefulness. We believe that little evidence exists which supports any contention that, within our political system, levels of government above the local level produce more rational or better decisions concerning public education. We believe that intelligent decision-making on all levels of government is dependent upon the capacities, values and interests of the decision-makers involved. It is at the local level where responsive publics can be directly involved in the decision-making process of public school education, and because of the proximity of such publics at the local level, we believe that the public does and can make rational capable decisions concerning the quality of the educational programs it desires in its local school districts. Therefore, the Legislative Committee of WASDA reaffirms local control of public school education, as constitutionally mandated from the state to local school districts and boards of education, firmly believing that local control of public education can most successfully translate the informed public will into effective policies for public school educational programs. PLATFORM - POLITICAL PROCESS The Legislative Committee of WASDA believes that the political process is a dynamic process which is constantly changing and which involves a high degree of personal interrelationships, accurate knowledge and ability to perceive the "real" issues and motivations underpinning all legislation and legislating. Thus, it is axiomatic that those individuals entrusted with the task of executing a legislative program for the association must have the flexibility to act in good judgment and to effectuate compromise in all matters pertaining to legislation, irrespective of specific platform statements of the association. PLATFORM - GOALS FOR STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS 1.State general aid for public elementary and secondary schools be funded at a level of 65 percent of total costs. 2.Total principal and interest costs of buildings and the costs of capital outlay be part of shared costs in the school aid formula. 3.For calculating primary aids in the formula, the highest level of state aid would be computed on the part of the districts shared costs which does not exceed 115 percent of the previous year's statewide average shared cost which exceed 115 percent will be funded by secondary aid. 4.Categorical aids at a level of 70 percent be retained for support of Chapter 115 programs, and a level of 70 percent support be implemented for social workers, nurses and psychologists.l 5.Support the proration of state aids in emergencies and strikes. 6.The 115 percent primary ceiling serves as an adequate cost control of school expenditures on the local level. Expenditures exceeding such level must reside in the decision-making authority of local boards of education. 7.Support existing state categorical aids to public elementary and secondary schools and such aids should be adjusted upward in conjunction with increased costs due to inflation. 8.Biennial appropriations be maintained for financing the operations of the Department of Public Instruction and state financial aid to local school districts. 9.Any state legislative mandated programs to public schools, after consultation and input from the appropriate educational organizations must be funded accordingly by increases in state financial support for the operations of such programs. LIAISON WITH STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The Executive Committee, by direction from the Board of Directors, represents the WASDA in all meetings with the Department of Public Instruction. MEETINGS, INSTITUTES AND CONVENTIONS HELD DURING SCHOOL TERMS The colleges and universities and the state Department of Public Instruction are requested to limit the number of meetings and conferences called during school time requiring teacher absence from classes. It is gratifying to know that the State Superintendent is working on the problem--(1) contacts with the chief school administrators are to be made prior to the announcement of meetings, (2) as many meetings as possible will be scheduled during non-school hours, (3) the number of meetings will be kept at a reasonable level. MEMBERSHIP PERSONAL SERVICE INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES: In the event a full voting member, in good standing, needs assistance from the WASDA in his/her relations with the school board, that steps to be taken to secure such assistance be as follows: 1.If the district administrator wishes to obtain legal counsel, the administrator shall contact the Executive Director of the WASDA or, if the Executive Director is not available, the chairman of the School Administrator-School board Relations Committee. A.Upon proper authorization legal counsel will be provided the member requesting legal assistance. B.Upon authorization by the WASDA Executive Director the member requesting legal services shall be authorized to expend up to $700 in defense of his/her position or contract language. C.Financial assistance beyond the $700 must have the approval of the WASDA Board of Directors or the Chairperson of the WASDA Administrator-Board Relations Committee in order to be authorized for payment by the WASDA Executive Director. If a member incurs legal costs beyond the initial $700, the individual can make application for up to an additional $500 grant in matching funds. Thus, for a WASDA member to receive up to a $500 additional grant from the Executive Committee, the member would have to show legal fees up to an additional maximum of $1,000 beyond the initial $700 grant. For example: A member incurring $950 of authorized legal costs would receive a $825 grant ($700 + $125 matching funds.) D.The WASDA Board of Directors may request a status report and recommendation relating to the case involved prior to taking official action on a request for the additional financial assistance. 2.Should an administrator desire a fact finding investigation, the administrator shall contact the Executive Director ofthe WASDA or the Chairman of the WASDA Administrator-School Board Relations Committee. Such investigation, to be effective, should have the approval of the respective school board. In general, the investigating team shall be composed of the Executive Director of the WASDA, the Executive Director of the WASB, two members of the WASDA Administrator-School Board Relations Committee and two members of the WASB. The findings of said investigative team shall be confidential information reserved to the respective administrator and the board of education. GUIDELINES FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN CONDUCTING FACT FINDING INVESTIGATIONS: 1.The School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee will conduct an investigation only when a written request is received as outlined in the Investigation Procedures. 2.The School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee members will conduct a fact finding investigation only when such investigation is authorized and directed by the Chairman of the School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee. 3.WASDA and its School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee shall always act in a highly professional manner when participating in any requested investigation. 4.Identification of areas of conflict and reasons for local actions taken shall be of major concern to the WASDA committee. 5.The committee shall always keep in mind that a school's only reason for being is to serve the children of the community and any recommendations should in no way jeopardize this function. 6.One of the aims of the committee should be to provide help and understanding, not only for the administrator, but, the school board and community as well. 7.The investigation should be impartial in seeking out the truth and members of the committee should not get involved in any discussion of their own ideas and convictions about the particular situation. MILWAUKEE-MILWAUKEE SUBURBAN DESEGREGATION POLICY Be it resolved that the WASDA go on record as favoring improvements of the present Chapter 220 program for the purpose of voluntarily increasing the racial balance of schools and expanding the educational opportunity for all students; further, that WASDA oppose mandated school district reorganization. MINORITY ADMINISTRATORS WASDA shall in its own operations and through its assistance urge local, state and national educational organizations to: 1.establish and carry out effective programs which lead to the recruitment and appointment of minorities to leadership positions. 2.involve all minorities in all leadership training opportunities, both as participants and leaders. 3.involve minorities at all levels of decision making. 4.involve minority administrators in the total socio/political processes of the community. 5.provide for career progression in leadership positions. MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly adopt the concept that all members of the administrative team shall be provided with multi-year contracts and that the members of the WASDA shall actively pursue and recommend to their boards of education multi-year contracts for all administrative team members. POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS Whereas, it is the policy of WASDA to promote strong public education in Wisconsin's elementary and secondary schools, and Whereas, the strength and viability of public education is dependent upon political process and especially by the enactments of the legislative branch of the state of Wisconsin, and Whereas, it is deemed to be in the best interest of public elementary and secondary education if the WASDA organization would contribute to the elective process and the information available to voters by endorsing candidates for certain political offices. Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA Board of Directors shall develop procedures for political endorsement* by the WASDA organization which will allow for the statewide participation of the membership in the endorsement process, and Be it further resolved that the offices to be included in this procedure be Governor, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, State Representative, and State Senator, and Criteria for endorsement shall be as follows: GOVERNOR The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators will endorse a candidate for the elected office of Governor of the state of Wisconsin as follows: 1.Within two weeks after the date of July 12, the WASDA Political Endorsement Committee will meet. This committee will consist of the following people: the WASDA President, the Past President, the President-elect, the WASDA Legislative Committee Chairperson, the Legislative Committee Vice Chairperson and the Executive Director of the WASDA. The purpose of this meeting is to make the plans for the endorsement. Items to consider will be: endorsement if there is a primary election, dates for future meetings, development of the list of questions that will be asked of the candidates relative to the issues at the time, development of a timetable for endorsement procedures, etc. 2.Prior to the election, the candidates will be sent a list of questions asking for their positions on the various issues which are of concern to WASDA and its members. 3.Prior to the final endorsement, the Endorsement Committee will meet with the candidates to discuss with them their responses to the list of questions sent to them. In addition, the committee will attempt to secure commitments from the candidates on various issues in return for our endorsement. 4.The Endorsement Committee will then meet to select the candidate which they will recommend for our endorsement. This candidate's name will be submitted to the Board of Directors for their final approval. STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators will endorse a candidate for the elected office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction as follows: 1.Within two weeks after the first Tuesday of January, the WASDA Political Endorsement Committee will meet. This committee will consist of the following people: The WASDA President, the Past President, the President-elect, the WASDA Legislative Committee Chairperson, the Legislative Committee Vice Chairperson and the Executive Director of the WASDA. The purpose of this meeting is to make the plans for the endorsement. Items to consider will be: endorsement if there is a primary election, dates for future meetings, development of the list of questions that will be asked of the candidates relative to the issues at the time, development of a timetable for endorsement procedures, etc. 2.Prior to the election, the candidates will be sent a list of questions asking for their positions on the various issues which are of concern to WASDA and its members. 3.Prior to the final endorsement, the Endorsement Committee will meet with the candidates to discuss with them their responses to the list of questions sent to them. In addition, the committee will attempt to secure commitments from the candidates on various issues in return for our endorsement. 4.The Endorsement Committee will then meet to select the candidate which they will recommend for our endorsement. This candidate's name will be submitted to the Board of Directors for their final approval. WASDA STATE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT PROCEDURES 1.A political coordinator will be selected for each of the 33 Senatorial districts. 2.The political coordinator shall be a member of either the WASDA Legislative Committee or the WASDA AIL-PAC committee. 3.A member of either the WASDA Legislative Committee or a member of the WASDA AIL-PAC shall be appointed to serve as the chairperson for each of the 99 Assembly districts. 4.It will be the responsibility of the political coordinator of the Senatorial districts to promote and coordinate the activities and political involvement of the three chairpersons appointed to the Assembly districts within the Senatorial district. 5.The political coordinator and the chairperson for each Assembly district retain the option of selecting additional members of the WASDA to serve on their Political Endorsement Committee. 6.The political coordinator and the chairpersons of the 99 Assembly districts retain the authority to determine if it would be advisable for the WASDA members within that political boundary area to endorse any of the candidates seeking a state office. 7.If the political coordinators and the chairpersons of the 99 Assembly districts determine that an endorsement would be to the advantage of the WASDA, this determination would be made strictly by the members of the WASDA within that Senatorial district or by the members of the WASDA within a specific Assembly district. 8.If and when a political endorsement for either a state Senator or a state Representative is made, the chairperson should notify the WASDA office. The WASDA office would then notify the candidate about the endorsement and authorize the candidate to use the name of the WASDA in his/her political campaigns, if he/she desires to do so. 9.The above procedure provides local authorization for an endorsement without requiring further endorsement by the WASDA Legislative Committee or the WASDA AIL-PAC, or official confirmation by the WASDA Board of Directors. 10.It is also recommended that each candidate considered for endorsement be interviewed by members of the WASDA prior to official endorsement. 11.It is recommended that each candidate considered for endorsement be interviewed by members of the WASDA prior to official endorsement. 12.Members of the WASDA are encouraged to endorse candidates that they believe will prove to be strong supporters of public elementary and secondary education in Wisconsin, rather than selecting candidates because of personal political affiliations. Members of the WASDA are reminded that each of the 99 Assembly seats are up for election every two years. One-half of the 33 Senate seats are up for election every two years. Thus, of the 33 Senatorial districts, there will only be 16 or 17 racesevery two years. In other words, the state Representatives are elected for two-year terms, while our state Senators are elected for four-year terms. PROFESSIONAL GROWTH Because the responsibilities of the superintendency are becoming increasingly complex, and because the development of management skills of highly motivated school executives will increase their ability to lead their districts in the fast changing arena of public education, the WASDA is encouraged to pursue a training program which will deliver growth opportunities in ways which will make them both accessible and valuable to practicing superintendents. PROFESSIONAL NEGOTIATIONS The chief school district administrator shall serve as the coordinator of the procedures and responsibilities relating to the union/management collective bargaining process. The position of the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators should, therefore, support the active role of the superintendent of schools in the professional negotiations process and recommend that the superintendent exert the necessary professional leadership for the representatives serving on the board of education collective bargaining team. The basic obligation of the chief school district administrator should be to serve the best interests of the pupil. PUBLIC FUNDS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators recognizes and supports the need for diversity of educational opportunity for Wisconsin children. The association further recognizes the depth of the challenge it faces in obtaining funds in sufficient amounts to properly support existing and planned quality educational programs in the public school system. Therefore, the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators opposes direct financial aid from state and federal sources to schools which are private and/or sectarian in nature. We believe that financial support for non-public institutions would weaken the fabric of public education and would tend towards increasing rather than minimizing the divisiveness characterizing our society. Certain categorical aids are presently available to non-public school children. The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators feels that to exceed these limited and publicly supervised aids is to extend financial support to the maintenance of the systems themselves. The association supports the contention that public funds can best be expended to broaden and strengthen public school programs. The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators remains strongly opposed to the voucher system as presently proposed and reaffirms the necessity for working vigorously for the best educational opportunities within the context of the existing public school system. Also, the WASDA strongly opposes the enactment of tuition tax credits for students attending parochial and private schools as advocated by the federal government. PUBLIC GROUPS AND EDUCATION WASDA believes that chief school district administrators should provide leadership in working with and supporting all groups whose purpose is to provide the best educational opportunities for children. The association encourages its leadership to become actively involved in and cooperate in the efforts being extended by such consortiums as the Wisconsin Council of School Administrative Associations (WCSAA), the Wisconsin Council for United Action in Public Education in Wisconsin, and the Joint Committee on Education in Wisconsin. RESEARCH We believe that WASDA has a key role in identifying needed educational research. In order to carry out this role effectively there must be a continuous and systematic means of communicating and making joint research decisions between and among the WASDA membership, the Department of Public Instruction, the University System and the WASDA Research Committee. Furthermore, there must be some assurance that recommendations emerging via these shared decision making processes reach the state of priority implementation in a timely manner. The WASDA membership requests an active/involved role in the annual DPI Superintendent's Fall Conference. The forumprovided therein should be used to initiate the shared decision making process and to draw upon the insights of the State's District Administrators to identify and promote needed research. This input would then be used in further discussions with the University System, the DPI and the WASDA Research Committee in supporting the implementation of the decided upon research. The WASDA membership urges a high priority be placed on soliciting and implementing a cooperative approach to research relevant to the superintendency. We believe that the WASDA Board of Directors should be authorized and empowered to release funds in amounts commensurate with the value of the research effort to the organization and that timelines should be established to receive the research results within the year the data was compiled. We further believe that: 1.Critical administrative decisions must be based upon the findings of carefully designed, validated and relevant studies which have particular significance to an application at the local level. 2.The University System and the DPI have access to data which must be analyzed, interpreted and communicated to administrators in a coordinated manner. 3.Administrators need a coordinated support system in being able to gain access and use research data, particularly as it relates to the performance of students beyond high school. 4.The chief function of the Research Committee is to provide a standing committee to meet with and advise those individuals, institutions and/or agencies having the responsibility for the initiation of research studies having particular relevance to the administration of public education. 5.Secure help of research groups who have the expertise and technology to analyze data. 6.Coordinate the research efforts emanating from the various WASDA committees. RETIREMENT WASDA would support legislation which would merge the State Retirement System of Wisconsin; allow for full retirement after age 60; and the development of a factor which would take into account a cost of living index. Whereas, an effective and strong retirement is important to the well-being and career planning of the school district administrator, and Whereas, the district administrator's position is basically a twelve-month position as compared to a regular teacher's position of nine months, and Whereas, the position is one of high stress due to the responsibilities it involves, and Whereas, the Wisconsin retirement system affecting administrators undergoes periodic reviews and changes, and Whereas, many states include a provision for vesting the retirement account at a stage it is encouraged that the state of Wisconsin revise its vesting procedures to five years. Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA support legislation that would eliminate the present penalty for early retirement of district administrators by including them in the same or similar group as protective occupations, and Be it further resolved that the WASDA Retirement Committee, with the support of the Executive Director, be empowered to support or oppose bills related to a change(s) when there is insufficient time to gain Board and/or membership support, and Be it further resolved the WASDA support efforts to establish a reciprocal retirement system between neighboring/midwest states, and Be it further resolved that should an administrator terminate his/her administrative career for retirement or other purposes, that said administrator would have the option to draw out both the employee and employer retirement funds and its corresponding interest or dividends earned during the period said funds are in the retirement fund, and Be it further resolved that the WASDA promote and provide more information than presently exists on the retirement programs through better informational publications and continue to provide informational meetings for administrators on this subject, and Be it further resolved the WASDA encourage its members to become more fully aware of the provisions of the retirement program. Be it also resolved that WASDA supports the policy that the State Investment Board shall be prudent in all its future investments of Wisconsin Retirement System Funds with due regard for human rights and the protection of the world environment. WASDA further recommends that all Wisconsin Retirement System funds be retained for retirement purposes. RIF PROCEDURES Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly endorse the concept that each school district board adopt a policy regarding a lay-off procedure for the administrative team members that would be necessitated as a result of a substantial decline in the pupil population of the school district. The school district administrator shall take the initiative to review existing RIF policies with the administrative team members and will actively pursue adoption of an RIF policy by board action. SCHOOL DESEGREGATION Whereas, WASDA believes that each child shall have an equal opportunity for education that reflects America's pluralistic society, and Whereas, WASDA believes that school district administrators have a moral and legal obligation to provide leadership to ensure equal opportunity for education. Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA support the concept of encouraging districts to voluntarily participate in desegregation efforts and that school district administrators provide affirmative leadership to prevent discriminative or reverse discrimination in any desegregation efforts. SCHOOL FUNDING WHEREAS alternative methods of funding the public schools of the State of Wisconsin are being considered by the Governor's Commission on Education in the 21st Century; and WHEREAS there is public outcry regarding the current level of property taxes having to support an inordinate portion of school costs; and WHEREAS any change in the tax structure for the support of public education should provide for equal tax for equal cost per pupil and to ensure equal educational opportunity for all the students of the State without district islands of tax overburden; and WHEREAS legislators are seeking fair and effective cost containment techniques to be used for limiting imprudent educational expenditures; NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT: The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators make a strong recommendation to the School Finance Subcommittee of the Governor's Commission on Education to include in their recommendations retention of the equalization aid formula as the primary distributor of state school aids, which can most equitably affect the goal of property tax relief, while ensuring equal educational opportunity for all the children of the State and at the same time offering opportunity for local effort and invoking cost containment through the spending disincentive of secondary shared costs. STATE SUPERINTENDENT In view of the important role of educational leadership served by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, WASDA strongly believes that the requirements of training, experience and certification in the field of school administration be retained. We also propose that WASDA as an organization take an active role in the selection, support and election of the best possible candidate for state superintendency as determined by a WASDA selection committee. SUMMER SCHOOL Sixty-five percent or more of Wisconsin public school salary schedules require attendance at summer school or other additional training at specified intervals. In addition, another ten percent encourage such training. Although many of our institutions of higher learning are providing workshops, the selection of courses is limited. Therefore, to meet the required salary schedules, teachers are asking for four-week summer sessions. Universities and colleges should consider offering two four-week summer sessions per summer in addition to the usual eight-week sessions. It would then be possible for teachers to enroll in a four-week session or to continue for eight weeks of summer work. This would give the teachers an opportunity to continue with the formal training and would also help alleviate the strain on teachers. School administrators are also looking for ways to further their education in administration. Summer school sessions of eight weeks duration make it impossible for administrators to attend summer school unless they are released from duty or are within commuting distance. Workshops of one to two weeks would give administrators an opportunity to attend sessions and not interfere with their summer work. It is recommended that institutions of higher learning survey communities to determine the areas of interest to superintendents and that one- to two-week workshops be provided for them. TAX EXEMPTION Any legislation designed to grant special and specific exemptions should make provisions to compensate school districts, in a fair and equitable manner, for the loss of the financial resources previously realized from the property exempted. POSITION ON TAX WITHHOLDING One of the primary responsibilities of the public elementary and secondary schools of this state is the development of and training for responsible citizen participation in the democratic process. The recent phenomenon of citizen actions directed toward the withholding of that portion of their property taxes which supports local school programs must be viewed with great concern. Such efforts by municipal officers are not only clearly illegal but can very well be counterproductive if the participants in such actions are sincerely committed to both good education and effective tax reform. The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly opposes such tax withholding actions. The association continues to urge and will lend its full support to responsible efforts to bring about a comprehensive and meaningful revision of the program of financing elementary and secondary education. Our longstanding position before the state legislature regarding both the improvement of the school aids formula and the reduction of local property taxes is well established; however, we stand firmly committed to the principle that effective and lasting change in a democracy must be accomplished though utilization of appropriate and existing legal channels. TAXES WASDA reaffirms its position that increased state aids for schools are both a necessity to alleviate soaring property taxes and to tap a broader tax base for the financial support of public education. WASDA supports the economic principles of a plan which seeks to utilize broader tax sources for the support of public education. WASDA will support obtaining revenue from higher income tax, extended sales tax, increased sales tax, and new taxesrecommended by our state economics. WASDA supports legislation to refund the 4 percent sales tax on school building construction to help reduce this cost. TEACHER CERTIFICATION Support the position that retains teacher certification authority and administration in the Department of Public Instruction and support legislation that recognizes competency as a basis for initial certification, and in-service as a requirement for continued certification. TEACHER PREPARATION A.All public schools should participate in teacher preparation by: (1) providing opportunities for student teaching, and; (2) cooperating with college and university officials in strengthening and upgrading field experiences for all students of education. B.There should be close liaison with the state Department of Public Instruction and the Deans of Schools of Education in an effort to keep those concerned apprised of specific problem areas for administrators in teacher training programs, internship programs, teacher placement, and teacher certification and to work cooperatively towards solutions. C.WASDA supports the maintenance of systems that will protect the continued use of confidential credentials and recommendations. D.WASDA affirms the obligation and right of school administrators to evaluate the performance of teachers and to make, in strict confidence, professional recommendations regarding that performance and that WASDA provide legal aid in defense of any member facing legal action resulting from professional recommendations made in confidence and in good faith. E.Employment and placement agencies should be notified of WASDA's desire to participate in decision making involving significant modifications in confidential record forms and credential packets and in the manner in which such information is disseminated. TENURE The WASDA continues to hold the position that a teacher tenure law is not beneficial to elementary and secondary education programs in Wisconsin. WASDA reaffirms its position that the Fair Dismissal Act provides sufficient safeguards for the professional employees and thus, the WASDA stands opposed to tenure for teachers. TUITION TAX CREDITS Whereas, there are significant political proponents for legislating tuition tax credits, and Whereas, this could have significant impact on public schools by decreasing available financial resources for said schools, and Whereas, this could place unequal responsibilities for providing mandated high cost programs not required of private schools receiving said tax support, and Whereas, private schools have no requirements to meet minimum educational standards. Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA and its members oppose any legislation in part or whole which would ultimately grant tuition tax credits for attendance at private schools or facsimiles thereof. TRANSPORTATION WASDA should propose and/or support legislation requiring local school districts to provide and finance transportation of children to only private schools which are located within the boundaries of the school district. WASDA should support legislation which would recognize the actual and total distances involved in public school transportation. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION Whereas, the WASDA reaffirms its support of the importance of a strong vocational component within the context of a comprehensive secondary school and K-12 districts, and Whereas, a close working relationship be supported between local school districts and the Vocational, Technical and Adult Education schools, and Whereas, WASDA will support career education programs beginning in the elementary grades and continuing through adulthood, and Whereas, WASDA reaffirms its support for youth groups and clubs and other special projects relating to vocational education in the secondary schools of Wisconsin, and Whereas, WASDA strongly supports the efforts of the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) in promoting vocational education in the local school districts, and Whereas, WASDA will support the idea that the primary place for the "training" component of the Jobs Training Partnership Act to occur is the comprehensive high school setting, and Whereas, WASDA will support cooperative business, industry--school projects that enhance vocational training and opportunities for young people. Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA supports that study and possible development of a two-way communication system throughout our state of instructional and in-service purposes, and Further be it resolved that WASDA should remain alert to the possibilities offered within the structure of the newly reorganized Cooperative Educational Service Agencies and the impact they may have on vocational education. VOCATIONAL - TECHNICAL EDUCATION The 60/40 split of federal funding for vocational education in the state of Wisconsin be reevaluated in the light that allowances be made for the age of students served and proportionate populations served. A continued effort be made and that additional clarification be made between secondary schools and VTAE schools in the state of Wisconsin. Efforts be continued to work toward articulation of secondary and post-secondary vocational and technical education programs. Additional state funds be appropriated to support vocational education programs at the secondary level. That programs in career education beginning with kindergarten through adulthood be established and developed throughout the state of Wisconsin. Employment services for students and high school graduates should be established in the secondary schools of Wisconsin. That participation in youth groups relating to vocational education be supported in local comprehensive high schools. That health occupations in the comprehensive high school in Wisconsin be developed and stimulated. That work-study programs for fourteen- and fifteen-year-old students be investigated. That the 1020 committee, which will be given the authority to determine the use of federal funds as defined in Title X of the 1972 Amendments to Education, be housed with the Wisconsin Board of Vocational, Technical and Adult Education. The WASDA establish liaison with the University of Wisconsin's Career Center for Studies in Vocational and Technical Education, which will be sponsoring a career education in-service project for administrators. And further, that administrators be encouraged to participate in this in-service project. Presently vocational-technical education is allowed to levy up to two mills on local property taxes. WASDA supports the concept that vocational-technical education be supported by state and federal general revenues and by student fees. That certification standards for instructors in the area of vocational education be reviewed and revised as they pertain to general methods and criteria, local school input, competency and problems relating to unique skills. That the Department of Public Instruction, the DILHR and local school districts continuously review and update standards and policies relating to the cooperative study, work study and on-the-job training programs in secondary schools. That the WASDA promote through local districts and other related agencies a uniform definition of terms so students, parents and the general public can better know and understand the efforts of vocational education in secondary schools. That WASDA promote through local districts and other related agencies a renewed effort vocational curriculums, the values of the work ethic and the importance of attitude in the world of work. VOUCHER PLANS Whereas, voucher plans, or similar proposals, are presented for legislative consideration, and Whereas, said plans could interfere with a school district's ability to operate with consistency of enrollment and financial support due to potential competition from other schools, both public and private, and Whereas, schools already having strong programs with adequate financial support would in all probability receive more financial support from the voucher plan, while schools needing said support to build up their programs would receive less support, and Whereas, the voucher plan would have many of the similar detrimental effects upon public schools as would the tuition tax credit plan. Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA formally opposes legislation which would support this concept. WOMEN ADMINISTRATORS WASDA, in its own operation and through its assistance urge local school districts, and in the work with other educational organizations at the local, state and national levels shall: 1.Strive to insure that women have equal access to educational administrative positions. 2.Establish and carry out effective programs which lead to the recruitment and appointment of women to leadership positions. 3.Initiate support for and participate in training activities directed at assisting women to advance professionally. 4.Involve women in all leadership training opportunities, both as participants and leaders. 5.Involve women at all levels of decision making. 6.Involve women administrators in the total socio-political processes of the community. 7.Provide for career progression in leadership positions. 8.Promote the status and visibility of women in educational administration. 9.Publish dates and share information related to the employment and utilization of qualified women in educational administration. STUDENTS ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS Whereas, there is a concern about the number of Wisconsin high school students who drop out prior to graduation, and Whereas, there are fewer opportunities for unskilled and poorly trained individuals, and Whereas, unemployable individuals become wards of society, and Whereas, past and present dropout prevention has not seemed to be effective. Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA encourage the development of alternative education programs, and Be it further resolved that WASDA take a leadership role in developing joint planning with vocational districts, the CESA organization and other public and private employers. BASIC LANGUAGE Whereas, every strong nation must be able to communicate with its citizens, and Whereas, in every strong nation the citizens must be able to communicate with each other, and Whereas, schools are charged with the teaching of the basic language of our society, and Whereas, English is the basic language of the United States. Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA take a stand to encourage the teaching of English rather than teaching in the native language, and Be it further resolved that bilingual instruction be transitional in nature. CHEMICAL ABUSE PROGRAMS Whereas, chemical dependency in America is among the highest of any developed country in the world, and Whereas, a significant number of high school seniors regularly abuse drugs, and Whereas, roughly 2/3 of all Americans try an illicit drug before they finish high school, and Whereas, the single leading cause of death among youth is drunk driving. Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA support the establishment of chemical abuse programs in every high school in the state of Wisconsin, and Be it further resolved that WASDA support a uniform 21-year-old drinking law in the United States. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT Whereas, child abuse and child neglect is a growing problem in the United States, and Whereas, all school employees are charged with the responsibility of reporting incidents of suspected child abuse and child neglect, and Whereas, the district administrator is responsible for the supervision of all programs. Be it, therefore, resolved that the school district administrator will taken an active role in the reporting of suspected cases of child abuse and child neglect, and Be it further resolved that the district administrator will provide for inservice of employees to assist them in identifying, and how to handle suspected cases of child abuse and child neglect. COMPETENCY TESTING Whereas, WASDA recognizes programs for establishing minimal competencies and basic skills examination for promotion and/or graduation have been instituted by legislative action and by mandates of local school boards, and Whereas, WASDA believes that such programs should be based upon the acknowledgement that multiple levels of individual differences exist among all students, and Whereas, such programs should not limit expectations of student performance by establishing single standards of achievement, but should provide assessment including professional judgments of the students' cumulative experiences and acquisition of basic skills consistent with their identified learning abilities. Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA believes these programs should reflect concern for student needs beyond expected minimal competencies and should consider their goals beyond high school. COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AGE The WASDA supports State Statutes 118.15(1)(a) which states that unless the child has a legal excuse or has graduated from high school, any person having under control a child who is between the ages of 6 and 18 years shall cause such child to attend school regularly during the full period and hours, religious holidays excepted, that the public or private school in which such child should be enrolled is in session until the end of the school term, quarter or semester of the school year in which the child becomes 18 years of age. CORPORAL PUNISHMENT The WASDA supports 118.31 of the State Statutes, which states, "No official, employe or agent of a school board may subject a pupil enrolled in the school district to corporal punishment. The team "corporal punishment" means the intentional infliction of physical pain which is used as a means of discipline. "Corporal punishment" includes, but is not limited to, paddling, slapping or prolonged maintenance of physically painful positions, when used as a means of discipline. This section does not prohibit an official employee or agent of a school board from using reasonable and necessary force to quell a disturbance or prevent an act that threatens physical injury to any person, to obtain possession of a weapon, to use self-defense, to protect property, etc. DISCIPLINE OF STUDENTS Whereas, a well-oriented classroom and a well-ordered school best meets the educational needs of all the students enrolled, and Whereas, young people need rules and regulations, as well as the strong supporting role models of interested teachers, so that discipline can be maintained within the classroom and the school, and Whereas, our society needs disciplined people to act as responsible adults. Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA support efforts at the local level to provide the necessary staffing and programmingto afford assistance to students who need disciplining, and Be it further resolved that the WASDA encourage boards of education and district administrators to in-service teachers and support staff so that there is a consistent pattern of discipline well understood by both faculty and students in both individual classrooms and entire school buildings, and Be it further resolved that the WASDA support efforts by board of education and school administrators to work closely with the home so that discipline can be developed in elementary and secondary school-age students in joint efforts between school and home. DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS Whereas, disruptive students interfere both with their own learning and with the learning of other students, and Whereas, disruptive students undermine the positive learning atmosphere of schools, and Whereas, there are many causes for the behavior of disruptive students which can be resolved through appropriate persons and programs. Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA supports special counseling and guidance for disruptive students, and Be it further resolved that the WASDA supports special program settings if necessary so that the needs of disruptive students are met while at the same time the needs of all other students are not interfered with, and Be it finally resolved that disruptive students who continue to disrupt be confronted with consequences appropriate to their continued violations. ENTRANCE AGE WASDA supports the change in the status that brought about a uniform age of September 1 and continues to support the prospect of state aid which would be allocated for such programs starting at age 4 and proportionate to full or half-day programs. GIFTED & TALENTED STUDENTS Whereas, children are endowed with special gifts and talents; and Whereas, it is in the best interest of these children, as well as of the community, state and nation, that these special gifts and talents be developed insofar as possible, and Whereas, these special gifts and talents require special instructional strategies and special curriculum content. Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA support the development of appropriate legislation encouraging programming and providing the necessary funding incentives to meet the needs of gifted and talented elementary and secondary school students. Be it further resolved that the WASDA encourage school districts to develop programs for their gifted and talented students in recognition of the special potential of these students. Be it further resolved that the state fund a competitive grant program that will adequately fund staff appointments for gifted and talented K-12 programs throughout the state. SPECIAL EDUCATION WASDA strongly supports the idea that the State of Wisconsin should provide through its LEA's a strong special educationprogram designed to serve students with exceptional educational needs and designed to meet the requirements and standards set forth by PL 94-142. WASDA strongly supports the idea that current state law and agency rules and regulations respecting special education could be and should be revised so that the special education delivery system would be appropriate to the demographics of Wisconsin and would permit more effective ways to serve students with exceptional needs. WASDA strongly supports the idea that the funding system for special education would benefit from reform and revisions which would place the major burden of support of special education at the state level rather than at the local level and would equitably distribute aid. WASDA requests the opportunity to participate in any state study groups established to recommend reforms of the special education aid formula. With respect to these positions WASDA puts forth these considerations: 1.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to promote special education. At the time PL 94-142 was conceived, Wisconsin was a leader in the delivery of special education services. WASDA has always supported efforts that Wisconsin be a leader in the area of special education. WASDA has always supported the idea that school districts must live up to their responsibilities to comply with the letter and the spirit of the laws of the land. 2.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to provide educational services appropriate to the needs and the unique conditions of the state. At the time PL 94-142 was conceived, Wisconsin in anticipation of the law put together state law and agency rules and regulations which in the implementation have created a delivery system, which in concept not only met, but also exceeded, the letter and spirit of PL 94-142 and in general created for LEA's a cumbersome, cost-ineffective system, which cannot be shown to be appropriate to either the demographics of Wisconsin or for the best interest of students with exceptional educational needs. 3.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to provide sufficient funding to encourage and support special education. The implementation of the laws and rules and regulations which were laid down in anticipation of PL 94-142 have generated for the state and LEA's tremendous special education costs. The state is currently moving toward an alternative funding system in the hope of establishing greater equity and greater control of the budgeting and distribution of special education aids. WASDA feels there is a real peril to LEA's if a substitute formula is adopted which fails to maintain the state's obligation to support the major share of the tremendous direct and indirect costs generated by the state mandated delivery system. IMPROVING STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN BASIC ACADEMIC SKILLS As a result of expressed concerns about low student performance in academic skills and in the event of legislative action concerning the teaching of basic skills, the WASDA Committee on Educational Program Evaluation has identified a number of issues and concerns which should be deliberated prior to enactment of any legislation. The issues included herein are considered by the committee to be important considerations in order to effectively address the problem of improving student achievement in basic skills. The committee defines basic skill instruction to include reading, writing and arithmetic. Prior to deliberating any legislative remedy it is critical that specific problems related to basic skills be identified. If indeed problem(s) are identified and if legislation is deemed desirable, the following stipulations should be observed: 1.It is imperative that legislative remedies be aimed at rectifying specific correctable deficiencies rather than at the broad unspecified area of "basic skills." 2.It is imperative that legislative remedies include standards of acceptable performance for those basic skills. These standards would not only apply to students who have been identified as having exceptional education needs. 3.It is imperative that legislation allow local school districts to develop their own educational programs for helpingtheir students reach the stipulated standards. 4.In order to ascertain compliance with the law the legislation should include procedures for reporting achievement in basic skills to the Department of Public Instruction. 5.It is imperative the legislation include a stipulated time period for evaluating the impact of the law on student performance with regard to basic skills at the end of a defined time period. A sunset provision should be included which would allow for evaluation and termination or modification of the statute. A reasonable time period might be three to five years. STUDENT RIGHTS Support the position on student rights which states that students have rights, as well as responsibilities, similar to those of all citizens. SUBSTANCE ABUSE WASDA urges administrators to work with other agencies to establish prevention/intervention programs for students affected by alcohol and other substance abuse. ORGANIZATION COOPERATIVE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE AGENCIES Whereas, WASDA supports CESAs as a cost effective approach to maintaining and improving quality education in Wisconsinpublic schools, and Whereas, collaborative educational endeavors among school districts, colleges, Vocational Technical Adult Education Districts, universities, business, industry and the state can be facilitated effectively by CESA, and Whereas, CESAs are designed to coordinate interdistrict programs effectively and efficiently, and Whereas, there is a growing need for interdistrict collaboration to provide quality education with limited resources. Now therefore be it resolved that: WASDA members support CESAs through political action to stabilize state funding for CESAs and that WASDA assume a leadership role to improve the image of CESAs through public relations efforts and that WASDA support the state's commitment to strengthening the CESA role in the delivery of educational service to districts, and that WASDA continue to support its Executive Director's lobbying efforts for CESAs. DPI STAFF Because education is a state function, the DPI must have staff availability for continuing services to local school districts. A decrease of staff members in an era of increased demands on the schools of Wisconsin would have adverse consequences. PTA Whereas the PTA is the best source to resolve the communication gap regarding school programs, finances and educational needs within the local school district; And whereas membership by parents in the state affiliated PTA unit has the advantage of resources from the state and national Congress of PTA: Be it resolved by WASDA to encourage every District Administrator to initiate units of PTA in his/her local district which are affiliated with the Wisconsin Congress of Parents and Teachers. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WASDA Policies and Resolutions Committee commends all sincere efforts being made to identify areas of common concern, to clarify points of conflict, and to identify areas of agreement within the teaching profession.

With the addition of the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials in 1992 and the Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services (WCASS) in 1994, the SAA has grown to represent virtually every licensed school administrator in the State of Wisconsin. This increasingly diverse membership provides a broad perspective and a deep understanding of educational issues. MISSION To advocate on behalf of school administrators in their efforts to strengthen Wisconsin's national leadership in education so that our children receive a world class education. ADVOCACY The SAA's diverse membership is united by a commitment to continuously improve the quality of Wisconsin public education. The SAA will support legislation which focuses on the following basic principles: The education of our children must be state government's primary purpose. The state must adhere to its constitutional obligation to "provide by law for the establishment of district schools, which shall be as nearly uniform as practicable," and "free and without charge for tuition to all children between the ages of 4 and 20 years." All children deserve to receive an education that meets their needs and abilities. There must be coordination among school programs and community-based programs to ensure that the whole child receives attention. Parents must be active participants in the education of their children, from birth to graduation. Standards must be established by which parents, communities, and government can determine the quality of education provided to our children and measure their performance. The SAA legislative agenda, which is published annually, outlines legislative positions and the beliefs they are based on in the following areas: Educational Programs Finance and Facilities School Governance Support of Educational Leaders SERVICE The SAA serves as a vehicle for members to collectively advance the policy deliberations of today's most important educational issues. For example, every year the SAA sponsors project teams consisting of volunteers from around the state who are interested, have expertise and are willing to work intensively to analyze issues that impact upon the children educated in Wisconsin. Through their work these teams serve our members and the public alike. If you would like information on current project team proposals, please contact the SAA.

On November 7 the FCC and the Jt. Board (a board established to develop special rates for schools and libraries) released their recommendations. The Joint Board recommends providing higher discounts for economically disadvantaged schools and libraries and those entities located in high cost areas. Discounts are a minimum of 20% and range from 40-90% for all but the least disadvantaged schools and libraries. The 1996 Act directs the Federal-State Joint Board to adopt new universal service support mechanisms that are specific, predictable, and sufficient to advance the universal service principles enumerated in the Act. One principle enunciated in the Act is "Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries, should have access to advanced telecommunications services. " The Joint Board recommends that eligible schools and libraries be able to purchase at a discount any telecommunications services, internal connections among classrooms, and access to the Internet. The Joint Board recommends providing higher discounts for economically disadvantaged schools and libraries and those entities located in high cost areas. Discounts are a minimum of 20% and range from 40-90% for all but the least disadvantaged schools and libraries. Total expenditures for universal service support for schools and libraries is capped at $2.25 billion per year, although any funds not disbursed in a given year may be carried forward and also disbursed.

Schedule the evaluation for a retreat or spearate board meeting. Don't wait for a crisis. Use an evaluation form that's as simple as possible. Jot things down as they occur to you. Don't wait until the last minute to fill out an evaluation. If you do, you're likely to place too much weight on your most recent phone call from an irate (or, for that matter, a delighted) parent. Give everyone a voice. Several consultants suggest having board members answer essay-type questions on their own. The board president can compile the consensus evaluation that will be used in the evaluation discussion. Be fair. Don't punish the superintendent at evaluation time if you're in one of the minority blocs. Remember that the superintendent's job is to carry out the wishes of the majority of the board of education. Don't engage in psychoanalysis or assisn motives to the superintendent. Be positive. People in education know you should build on children's strengths, remember that adults are just like children. It is important to end the evaluation on a positive note. Be willing to seek outside help. It's much easier for an outside person to corral difficult board members than it is for you to corral yourselves. Your state school board association should be able to help or refer you to consultants in the field. Try to keep things in perspective. Don't be too influenced by one recent dramatic error or magnificent accomplishment. Allow time for the superintendent to respond. Don't leave your superintendent sputtering--or wondering. Now might be a good time to let the superintendent participate in an evaluation of the board. Debrief. As soon as you complete an evaluation, you should analyze what worked and what didn't. Then develop a new written plan for the next evaluation. SAMPLE SUPERINTENDENT EVALUATION INSTRUMENT A. Purpose Proper administration of the schools is vital to a successful educational program. The general purpose of the District Administrator should be to coordinate and supervise, under the policies of the Board, the creation and operation of an environment in which students learn most effectively. The District Administrator's duties and functions should be appraised in terms of the contribution made to improving instruction and learning. To this end, the School Board must endeavor to create and sustain a professional climate that calls forth and uses the full creative capacities of the Administrator. Such a climate calls for common understanding, mutual respect and a full measure of confidence between the members of the Board and the Administrator. Thus, when the objective of the School Board is to optimize student learning opportunities in an environment which is open, trusting, and caring, the evaluation of Administrators is a process designed to promote and nurture professional growth. Specifically, the implementation of a planned program of Administrator evaluation should seek to: 1. Improve Administrator performance. 2.Document Administrator performance in relationship to respective job description. 3. Measure the effectiveness of Administrator leadership. 4. Assess the compatibility of the Administrator's objectives and district goals. 5. Establish a base for planned growth. 6.Provide information to enable informed decisions to be made regarding contract renewal and compensation. B. Evaluators To enhance the validity of the evaluation process it is desirable to have more than one source of data. The following sources and forms of evaluation should be included: 1. SelfEvaluation 2. Board Evaluation SelfEvaluation shall consist of completing the District Administrator Resume and the District Admiftistrator Evaluation Form. C. Procedures Evaluation of the Administrator is the primary responsibility of the School Board, who shall insure that the following procedures are utilized from year to year on thefollowing timeline: DECEMBER REGULAR MEETING EVALUATION COMPONENT: The Administrator will submit the SelfEvaluation Form for the current year.

McCardell Date: July 26, 1995 Re: Changes in Law Regarding Administrators' Contracts You have requested our opinion regarding certain issues which arise with respect to administrators' contracts entered into on or after today's date, pursuant to 1995 Wisconsin Act 27 (the "Act"), which the Governor signed this morning. Contracts entered into prior to today's date are not subject to the provisions of the Act, and are not addressed herein. You have posed the following question to us: "May school boards offer administrators contracts obligating the parties to each other for more than two years?" The Act describes the time periods of administrators' contracts as follows: 118.24(1): A school board may employ a school district administrator, a business manager, and school principals and assistants to such persons. The term of each employment contract may not exceed two years. A contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each. 118.24(8): Personnel administrators and supervisors, curriculum administrators and assistants to such administrative personnel, when employed by the school board of any school district to perform administrative duties only, may be employed for a term that does not exceed two years. A contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each. . . . It is clear that administrators covered under sections 118.24 (1) and 118.24 (8) must have employment contracts, whose terms may not exceed two years. However, any contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each. I construe such language to mean that those contracts having terms of two years may indeed be extended in increments of one year each, thereby obligating each party to such contracts for the duration of the two-year term and any oneyear extensions to the contracts. Although the term of the contracts may not exceed two years, the one-year extensions can automaticallyand continuously roll year after year. Please note that there are no qualifications or limitations on the number of successive contract extensions which may be entered into by the parties. When the parties enter into a twoyear contract, successive extensions may be part and parcel of the original contract. Additionally, such extensions may be entered into at any time during the pendency of the two-year contract. Indeed, since the Act does not limit the number of two-year contracts a school board and administrator can enter into, one can legitimately argue that school boards may offer an administrator multiple twoyear contracts or one contract for a term of two years with multiple oneyear extensions. In any event, the parties will be obligated to each other for the duration of the original contract and any other contracts or extensions entered into by the parties. We have discussed these issues with numerous individuals directly involved in the legislative process and the drafting of the statutory language. It is quite clear that a majority of the individuals believe that since a school board can enter into successive two-year contracts, it can enter into contracts for a term of two years, whose terms also include automatic extensions of one or more years. This opinion is an initial analysis of the law, and is provided without the benefit of any court or state agency interpretation. If and when such interpretations become available, all parties must carefully analyze the law in light of such interpretations. Finally, all parties should be aware that any changes made in administrator contracts should be reviewed by legal counsel in conjunction with applicable Board policies and individual administrators' employment contracts.

By any measure the State has had, and continues to have, a strong rate of return on this investment. Despite not being among the top ten highest spending states, on per capita expenditures on public education, our students currently lead the nation in ACT scores, placement in advanced course work, and enjoy the best school to work initiative in the country. The School Administrators Alliance aggressively supports an agenda aimed at building upon Wisconsinâs national leadership in education. In its entirety this agenda is aimed at enhancing student achievement, increasing efficiency, and achieving greater equity in educational opportunity. The SAA Legislative Agenda for 1997-99 was established by the SAAâs thirty-six member Legislative Committee and endorsed by each member associationsâ Board of Directorsâ. The Agenda will guide Wisconsinâs school leaders advocacy efforts for the two-year legislative session beginning in January 1997. The Alliance The School Administrators Alliance was founded in 1991 when the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators (WASDA) and the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators (AWSA) joined their advocacy efforts. With the addition of the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO) in 1992 and the Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services (WCASS) in 1994, the SAA has grown to represent virtually every licensed school administrator in the State of Wisconsin. This increasingly diverse membership provides a broad perspective and a deep understanding of educational issues. The mission of the SAA is to represent the interests of children in Wisconsin. The SAA advocates on behalf of school leaders in their efforts to strengthen Wisconsinâs national leadership in education to ensure that Wisconsinâs children receive the highest quality education possible. Child Advocacy Statement Our children must be the most important concern in our country. If we focus on the child, everything else will fall in place. Educating every child is critical to the success, perhaps to the survival of this nation. Creating a quality education system requires a commitment by each community and neighborhood. The education of our children must be our first priority. School administrators in Wisconsin are committed to serve as effective advocates for children. The School Administrators Alliance (SAA) was formed to represent the interests of children, and declares that its members will continually strive to enact laws which enhance the interests of children and oppose bills which harm them. The SAA will support legislation which focuses on the following basic principles: 1. The education of our children must be a primary purpose as well as the fundamental responsibility of the state. The state must adhere to its constitutional obligation to "provide by law for the establishment of district schools, which shall be as nearly uniform as practicable" and "free and without charge for tuition to all eligible children .â 2. All children, regardless of ability to pay, deserve to receive an education that meets their needs and abilities. 3. Coordination among school programs and community-based programs to help ensure that the total child receives the appropriate attention and services. 4. Active participation of parents in the education of their children, from birth to graduation. 5. Standards must be established by which parents, communities, and public officials can determine the quality of education provided to our children and measure their performance. Legislation that advances these principles will strengthen Wisconsin as a national leader in public education. Educational Belief Statements I. Educational Programs WE BELIEVE that it is the right of all children to have access to effective instructional programs that provide learning opportunities based on their individual needs and promote lifelong learning. THEREFORE, we hold that effective educational programs: A. Are based on a fundamental partnership of the child, parent, teacher, administrator, business and industry; and local, state and federal governments; B. Promote the use of effective research-based educational practices; C. Promote the cognitive, physical, and affective growth of the student; D. Promote local community participation and support; E. Are accountable in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, as determined by the achievement of identifiable standards; F. Promote excellence through cooperation and diversity; and G. Provide children with the resources and opportunities to develop skills appropriate for the challenges of the future; H. Provide equitable access to emerging technologies for all students. II. Finance and Facilities WE BELIEVE that public education must be funded at a level sufficient to meet the needs of all children. Therefore: A. We support maintaining funding of public education at a level sufficient to provide an effective and efficient state educational system. B. Funding public education is a responsibility shared by local school districts, the state, and the federal government. C. Primary responsibility for expenditure levels and accountability rests with local school boards. D.State aid should be distributed in a manner designed to support the state constitutional principle of schools that are as âuniform as practicableâ. E.Any state program for funding general state aid in public schools should be equalizing, sum sufficient, fiscally progressive, and consistent with the philosophical intent of the state constitution. F. Wisconsin law should continue to require that the state share in the cost of debt service. G. Public education funds must ensure support of public education programs only. WE BELIEVE that all students must be afforded a safe and healthful learning environment which best supports the total educational program. THEREFORE, H. Local, state, and federal governments must share the responsibility of providing quality public school facilities. I. Local school facilities must be accessible to all people. J. All students must be provided with a safe and healthful environment in which to learn. III. School Governance WE BELIEVE that the state's constitutional responsibility to provide free and public education must be accomplished by maximizing authority and accountability at the local public school district level. THEREFORE, A. The state must reinforce local leadership by providing professional and technical assistance with flexible regulations. B. State legislation must encourage and assist local school boards to initiate programs designed to improve the quality of education. C.Local stakeholders must be encouraged to participate in the decision-making process..Effective school governance occurs when school boards establish school policy and support administrative teams in implementing those policies.IV. Support of Educational Leaders WE BELIEVE that research on effective schools identifies school administrators as important determinants for quality educational programs and for implementing successful and effective schooling. The highly visible and often controversial roles and functions of school administrators place many pressures and demands at professional and personal levels. THEREFORE, A. School administrators must be provided an equitable contract which includes compensation that is competitive and which provides benefits in addition to salary that are commensurate with their specific positions. B. Professional training and licensing requirements, based on high standards of competency, must serve to ensure a high quality and ethical work force of school administrators. C. Support and fair treatment is critical to the retention of effective school administrators. D. Within the educational system, emerging leaders should be identified and actively encouraged to pursue administrative roles. E. Equal opportunity must be a guiding principle for staffing administrative positions. Legislative Position Statements I. Educational Programs A. Standards and Assessment We support clearly defined educational standards. We support assessments which measure studentsâ success in meeting these standards. B. Students Ready to Learn We support legislation assisting communities to develop a comprehensive system to implement strategies which meet local needs so that all students will start school ready to learn. C. Early Intervention We support legislation which assists school districts in implementing programs which will help all students leave the primary grades (K-2) with critical, developmentally appropriate skills. D. Alternative Education Programs We support statutory and administrative rule provisions and funding which both encourage and allow school districts to develop and implement research based programs that effectively and efficiently address the needs of a diverse student population. E. Staff Development Needs We support school improvement measures which place a high priority on staff development programs with emphasis in technology. F. School to Work Transition We support further legislation and administrative rules designed to implement comprehensive school to work transition programs in Wisconsin. Local school districts should develop these programs in collaboration with federal and state agencies, educational institutions, and local businesses. Increased business involvement in school-to-work transition supported by tax credits for businesses which provide apprenticeships, job site coordination, and other tangible contributions to a coordinated school-to-work program. G. Educational Technology We support legislation which enacts a comprehensive state technology plan which provides for the following.Technologies which enable each student in every school district in the state to access two-way full motion video/voice/data. These technologies should be installed to the âschoolhouse doorâ at no cost to the district. Broadband service to each Wisconsin school at affordable discounted rates. These should be equal for all schools, fixed at a flat cost, and neither mileage nor usage sensitive. Each school in the state the opportunity to effectively access the superhighway to enhance student learning. Incentives and resources should be dedicated to staff development, acquisition, installation, software, and maintenance of systems to assure all districts the opportunity to bring the power of technology to each student. A technology network throughout the state that is mutually compatible to all users. The system design must be effectively integrated among members of the broader community including, but not limited to, all PK-12 schools, the University of Wisconsin system, technical colleges, libraries, and all levels of government plus their agencies. A comprehensive state commitment guaranteeing each student the opportunity to engage the powers of technology to maximize learning. H. Alternative Post Secondary Policies We support legislation which directs Wisconsin post-secondary educational institutions to develop and implement alternative admission policies which accommodate non-Carnegie unit entrance requirements. Further, we support legislation directing the establishment of seamless academic programs between secondary schools and all Wisconsin post-secondary institutions. I. Public School Choice The SAA would support legislation on public school choice, or open enrollment, provided that the following conditions are included in the legislation in order to ensure fair and equitable implementation: 1. Incoming transfer students must bring revenue into the receiving districts which is at least equivalent to the per pupil cost of the receiving district, or the specific cost of educating an individual student, whichever is greater. If the state aid which a sending district receives is not sufficient to meet the costs of a receiving district to serve any student, the difference must be paid from a state tuition fund. There may be no direct or indirect transfers of local property tax dollars. Applications from students wishing to transfer to other public school districts must be submitted to sending and receiving school districts by January 15, of the year prior to the anticipated transfer, and the receiving school district must either confirm or deny the transfer by August 1, of the same year. All transfers must remain in effect for one full school year. 5. Transferring students must meet the requirements for graduation, class rank, grade points, and scholarship eligibility for the receiving school. 6. Transportation costs must be paid by the state. 7. Children disadvantaged by economic, educational, or disabling (EEN) conditions may not be discriminated against. 8. Racial balance must not be adversely affected. 9. Resources must be provided to facilitate the development of cooperative efforts among schools that will increase opportunities for all students. 10. Transfers must not be approved which allow students to avoid pending disciplinary action. 11. Choice, or open enrollment, must be limited to public schools only. 12. Choice, or open enrollment, must be phased in over several years to lessen the impact on school districts and to provide time for planning and evaluation. 13. Resources must be provided for planning and staff development so that they have the capability to plan for needed staff, facility, and program changes. 14. Public funds should not be utilized for marketing purposes. 15. All special education functions must be carried out by the receiving district. The receiving board of education shall have the sole authority in determining space available. (SAA Position Paper #1) II. Finance and Facilities A. REVENUE LIMITS 1. Institute a 15% hold harmless on the percent of revenue generating capacity a district experiencing a declining student population could lose in one year. 2. Reinstate prior law (pre 1995 Act 27) in regard to school district transfer of service requests. 3. Exclude revenues needed for the payment of debt service authorized by school district resolution from the limit only if all of the following applies: The debt must be issued to repair or maintain existing facilities or build new school district facilities; and/or for the purchase, installation, and integration of technology into the curriculum. â¢The aggregate outstanding indebtedness of the school district incurred under this subdivision without a referendum shall not exceed the total of $500,000 per district plus $250 per student. 4. Include summer school membership in calculating the 3-year average used in determining the revenue cap limit. 5. Allow a district to capture unused levy authority from prior years. 6. Give school boards the same authority as other governmental bodies to finance and construct facilities and that repeals the statutory provision which permits the filing of a petition for a referendum on a school board resolution to issue a general obligation promissory note. 7. Repeal the recent mandate to go to referendum for all borrowing and would exempt borrowing from revenue cap controls. 8. Retain revenue cap penalty funds for use in redistribution through general aid. 9. We would support the following exemptions from the revenue caps: Exempt districts whose prior year per pupil expenditure was below the state average expenditure per pupil. Exempt Fund 80 (Community Services). Exempt costs incurred under the post-secondary options act and mandated options for children at risk. Exempt any loss in revenue related to servicing debt. B. SCHOOL FUNDING: 1. MODIFICATIONS IN EQUALIZED AID FORMULA: "95 IN 95" The equalized aid formula is an efficient and could be an equitable way to fund education in Wisconsin. It does, however, need to be modified to meet the changing needs of education for the future. With this in mind, we recommend the following changes: 00.0The DPI will list the equalized value per student for each school district in the state. It will then rank order each district in the state from lowest to highest. The department shall then add the number of students in each district beginning with the lowest value per student. When the total number of students equals 95 percent of the students in the state, the district's value per student, in which that student resides, shall be the state primary guarantee. We believe that this will provide more access to the tax base for participation in the formula. The DPI shall list the shared cost per student for each school district in the state. It will then rank order each district in the state from lowest to highest. The department shall add the number of students in each district beginning with the lowest shared cost per student. When the total number equals 95 percent of the students in the state, the district's shared cost per student, in which that student resides, shall be the state primary cost ceiling. We believe that this will provide access to the formula for a larger number of students. The secondary guarantee should be set at 95 percent of the state average valuation behind each student. This would be calculated by the DPI exactly as it is currently, but using the multiplier of 95 percent instead of 106 percent. This will provide a stronger penalty to those districts that exceed the primary cost ceiling than does current law. These recommendations will provide the changes that are necessary to increase equability among districts while still meeting the criteria commonly employed by the courts, i.e., by including 95 percent of the students and 95 percent of the tax base in the formula. It also preserves the current formula, (which is not always easily understood) and will provide a stabilizing and comfort factor for school districts. Union high school and K-8 districts are not included in this plan specifically and we prefer that the expertise of the DPI be utilized to determine by what means the suggested formula might provide equitable funding for them. 2. ELIMINATION OF OTHER DISEQUALIZING FACTORS: The formula modifications listed will go a long way to provide equity in the equalized aid formula. However, there are several other modifications that will need to be made to it to provide more equitable distribution of funds.Eliminate minimum aids. We recognize, however, the need for property-rich income-poor districts to have some relief. With that in mind, we recommend that homestead tax credits be increased to assist low income individuals located within these districts. Eliminate special adjustment aids. Modifications in the base formula should remove any need for these adjustments. Eliminate the levy credit as this contributes to disequalizing the formula. All funds associated with the levy credit program should be added to the equalized aid formula. 3. MODIFICATIONS OF CATEGORICAL AIDS Currently, there are over 30 categorical aid programs identified and funded by the state. The goal of the SAA is to simplify the equalized aid formula and removed disequalizing factors. To accomplish this goal, the following recommendations are made regarding categorical aids: Aid for programs for the handicapped should be funded at the level dictated by state statutes. Continued reduction of special education funding creates animosity towards handicapped children's programs in local school districts. Transportation, CHCEB, library aids, and tuition aid should be continued as currently in place. Other categorical programs should be funded through a category entitled Achievement Goals Program. The SAA believes that accountability for students' performance must be an integral part of any school funding proposal. We also recognize that students in lower income homes present challenges for educators to overcome because research indicates that low incomes inhibit students' achievement of state mandated goals. With this in mind, we recommend a categorical program titled, "The Achievement Goals Program" which will distribute moneys to schools to develop special programs for low achieving students. In order to allocate these funds, we propose that each school or district receive $2,000 per student who is eligible for free or reduced cost lunches. These funds must be targeted for locally-developed programs for these students with special needs. We also recommend that other current categorical aid programs be closely examined to see whether they can be folded into the Achievement Goals Program. For instance, one categorical program which might be better served by inclusion is integration aid (Chapter 220). Our recommended funding level of $2,000 per student, as identified by those eligible for free or reduced lunches, is based on the cost of the Success for All Program, which is identified for illustrative purposes only. The Success for All Program was developed by Robert Slavin, of Johns Hopkins University, for schools with high concentrations of low income and minority students. It includes preschool for four-year-olds, full-day kindergarten, one-on-one tutoring for students in grades one and two who are performing below grade level, a language development program, a problem solving-manipulative focused mathematics program, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and a family liaison person reaching out to families and helping to coordinate social services. The primary goal of the program is to have all students performing at grade level in reading and mathematics by the third grade. 4. RESOLUTION OF ADDITIONAL DISPARITIES: The following issues are identified as needing further discussion and resolution: â¢ The financial impact on school districts providing services to children who are severely/profoundly handicapped. A formula must be developed to address these extremely high costs. A recommendation related to this problem will be forthcoming from the Council of Administrators of Special Education. â¢ Integration Aid under Chapter 220. It has been recommended that support for the program be removed from the equalized aid formula. Whether the program should be funded most appropriately as a categorical aid or under the achievement goals program, is yet to be determined. There is no question regarding the need to support children eligible for the 220 program, it is only a question of where the financial support is budgeted. â¢ Current revenue caps present a problem to those districts who tax at a high level and have low school expenditures. Under current law, it is not possible for those districts to increase their spending per pupil; in fact, the disparity between low spending and high spending districts can be expected to increase. It is recommended that exemptions to the current revenue caps be considered for those districts who are classified as low spending (lower quartile). A formula for controlling the extent of the exemption would have to be developed. â¢ The question of accountability received considerable discussion from the planning group. Participants are unanimous in recognizing the need for accountability as part of any school funding proposal. However, the development of an accountability system must be prefaced by a more complete definition of the primary educational program the state will finance. It is time to review the specifics of that primary program in light of the educational changes that have occurred during the past 20 years (SAA Position Paper #2).5. EEN FUNDING: We support legislation which will establish a fixed percentage of expenditures which determines the pool of money available for the support of educating EEN students. We support greater flexibility in programming for EEN children at the local level. School Governance A. Mediation/Arbitration The State should maintain the mediation/arbitration process which was in place prior to July 1, 1993 with the following modifications: 1. Incorporate appropriate timelines that prevent school districts from competing with each other and which fit the districts' budget cycle in a more timely manner. 2. Eliminate the ability to select a state-provided arbitrator unless mutually agreed to by both parties to a labor dispute. 3. Allow for local arbitration as an option. 4. Require all school districts to use a standard costing procedure. 5. Assign weighted consideration for statutory arbitration criteria. 6. Unless otherwise stipulated by both parties, any modifications in working conditions for which costs can be determined, shall be included as part of the compensation package for the year the costs become an obligation of the school district. 7. Establish criteria within Wisconsin statutes for arbitrating non-monetary language items. 8. Define more clearly what are mandatory, permissive and prohibited subjects of bargaining. 9. Restrict the identity of comparables for non-credited employee units to the immediate labor pool from which the district's employees will come. 10. Preclude districts from naming a particular vendor in a labor contract. 11. Require that the arbitrator be precluded from attempting any kind of mediation of a labor dispute for which he/she has also been asked to render an arbitration decision (SAA Position Paper 3). B. Compensation Caps The School Administrators Alliance opposes compensation caps for any public sector employee (SAA Position Paper 5). C. Compulsory Education The SAA believes in compulsory school attendance until age 18, with an option for school boards to provide alternative educational opportunities for children beginning at the age of 17. School boards should be allowed to enter into agreements with youths and parents in this age group who have a full time job or other opportunity available and want to take a temporary leave-of-absence from school. The student, his or her parent(s), and the school board should have the flexibility to agree on ways for the student to continue his or her education toward receiving a high school diploma at a later time. D. Residency Requirements We support legislation which clarifies the student residency laws of the state with respect to such situations as joint custody settlements, emancipated minors, aliens, married minors, and minors who are living with non-custodial relatives or adult friends. E. Collection of Prescribed Statutory Data We support legislation that provides for a state-wide data collection system to gather prescribed statutory data in a uniform, non-duplicative manner. This system should create a state data base that can be conveniently used by all state and local governmental agencies. F. Cooperative Educational Service Agencies (CESAâs) We support efforts to remove barriers for CESAâs to allow them to maximize inter-agency collaboration, provide for equal educational opportunities, and encourage the innovative sharing of human resources and technology. G. Pay-for-Performance We oppose mandated pay-for-performance programs for public school employees. (SAA Position Paper 4) H. Recall Elections We support an amendment to SS 9.10 (2)(b) that will limit recall petitions for a city, village, town or school district office to cause related to malfeasance or conduct that is deemed to be a breech of the ethical or moral standards of the community. I. Establishment of School Calendar We support legislation which makes the school calendar a prohibitive subject of bargaining. J. Home-Based Instruction We support legislation which requires home-based private educational programs to provide information to the department of public instruction regarding attendance, curriculum, enrollment, testing, and children with exceptional needs. K. Site-Based Management We support site-based management efforts as defined by local school districts. L. Truancy We support legislation that creates a model for collaboration among schools, social service agencies, community-based organizations, health services, juvenile justice, youth employment, child care, and other appropriate public and private agencies. Elements of this legislation must include a) an elimination of unnecessary and frequently destructive duplication of services, b) a system for cross-agency sharing and use of relevant information about youth and families placed at risk because of economic or environmental circumstances, and c) regular case-specific exchanges of information among appropriate personnel. M. School Consolidation We support legislation that provides additional monetary incentives for those school districts that are voluntarily consolidating. N. Family and Medical Leave We support legislation which aligns the Wisconsin family and medical leave law with the similar federal law. O. State Department of Public Instruction We support legislation which provides DPI with adequate funding to meet its constitutional and statutory obligations. We also support efforts to balance the departmentâs regulatory and support roles. P. Charter Schools: We support current charter school law. We recommend local school districts be allowed the same consideration as charter schools. Q. Discipline/Order/Safety Legislation initiated to combat school violence should be balanced on three components: Prevention, Intervention, and Suppression. Legislation should encourage communities (parents, students, educators, and the public, non-profit and private sector) to work together, share resources, and assume responsibility for ensuring that our children do not become victims of violence (SAA Position Paper #6). Support of Educational Leaders A. Administrator Contracts We support legislation which would allow local school boards the discretion to award continuous contracts beyond the length of time in current law to licensed administrators. We support legislation that allows local school boards the flexibility to establish administrative contracts at a level that will retain and promote the highest quality administrators. B. Contract Renewal We support legislation that requires that administrators be provided with a fair and equitable contract nonrenewel procedure that addresses the following criteria: (SAA Position Paper #7) 1. NOTICE 2. REASONABLE RULE OR ORDER 3. INVESTIGATION 4. FAIR INVESTIGATION 5. PROOF 6. EQUAL TREATMENT C. Benefits We support legislation that maintains, as a minimum, those administrator contract benefits gained through previous contracts unless by mutual agreement.. D. Retirement We support legislation which provides a permanent "rule of 85" in order to qualify for full retirement benefits from the state teachers retirement system. We support legislation which enforces the IRS non-discrimination rules for the multiplier (i.e. 2.0 for all). We support legislation which provides for the inclusion of medical insurance benefits within the state teachers retirement system. E. Professional Development We support legislation that provides on-going financial resources for continuous administrative training. F. Professional Standards We oppose legislation which removes the current requirement that all school administrators, except for school business administrators, have at least three years of successful teaching experience or its equivalent in order to qualify for an administrator license. We support the establishment of an alternative educational process that allows individuals to acquire the proficiencies needed to be licensed as an administrator. We support legislation that requires appropriate licensure for all educational administrator positions.

Raising a child is one of the special joys of life. Unfortunately, nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession. The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) is a world renown surrogate parenting and egg donation program located in Beverly Hills, California. CSP was established because we strongly believe that couples who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity. Having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to meet that need. Unlike some alternative methods of creating a family, the surrogacy process allows a child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of In-Vitro Fertilization) both parents. It also gives the couple the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself. And finally, since their child is conceived only because of their own existence, the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the couple.

The staff at the Center believes that educating people about surrogacyis one of their most important responsibilities. However, many peoplewho are considering this option have difficulty envisioning the type of womenwho become surrogate mothers. In addition, couples may also be curiousabout other couples' experiences with surrogacy. In Creating Your Family you will meet seven surrogate mothers aswell as two couples whose children were born with the assistance of surrogatemothers. They will answer questions that most couples have about surrogacy,in addition to some questions that no one thinks to ask. You will beguided through the surrogate parenting process that has been so grosslymisrepresented in the media. Most importantly, you will be introducedto the human factor of this process that is so often clouded with statisticsand legalese. Some of the topics covered in the video include: What motivates a woman to be a surrogate? What motivates infertile couples to ask a surrogate for help? Why group support meetings for the surrogate are important. The role of the counselor in the process. How couples and surrogates choose each other. The role of the doctor, lawyer, and other professionals. The first meeting between a couple and their surrogate. How surrogate mothers tell their children about surrogacy. What happens at the time of delivery. The relationship between Surrogate mothers and couples after their babyis born. What do parents tell their child about this special birth.

The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), offers an organized, comprehensive program, which includes advertising, administration as well as coordination of psychological, legal and medical services. We are proud to offer an "open" program where the couple and surrogate choose each other, then meet one another prior to determining if this is the surrogate they would like to work with. The counselor is present at the meeting to assist with overcoming any initial uneasiness in meeting someone for the first time and more importantly can direct the conversation as well as encourage the discussion of important issues. CSP has been practicing surrogate parenting for 16 years. We have had over 427 births, and have never had an Surrogate Mother change her mind. This is due to our strict screening process. Our statistics show that only 1 in 20 Surrogate Mother Applicants are accepted. CSP has very strict requirements as to who we accept into our program. We are assisted by 4 full-time counselors who specialize in field of surrogacy and egg donation, and provide psychological screening and ongoing support for the surrogate mothers and egg donors throughout the process and as long thereafter as she desires. The typical surrogate mother profile is a woman of fertile age, between 21 and 34, who has children of her own and presently acting as a parent to those children, and has a good medical and pregnancy history. She is a responsible and empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertile couple have a child of their own. Other criteria for participation in our program include her intelligence, stability and sense of self fulfillment. She understands that the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the intended parents. How is Our Program Different?

The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation offers to both donorsand recipients an organized, comprehensive egg donor program, which includesadvertising, administration as well as the coordination of psychological,legal and medical services. Our egg donors are specifically solicited,psychologically counseled, medically evaluated, provided with legal counseland matched with the intended parents. We at the Center are proud to offer an "open" egg donor program whereparticipating couples and egg donors have the opportunity of meeting oneanother. The intended parents have the opportunity to know the woman theyhave chosen as their egg donor. They can find out about her history, herlikes and dislikes, her personality, etc. The donor they have chosenis presented with some information about the recipient couple. We encourage Recipient Couples and Egg Donors to meet one another. Thegoal of the egg donation process is two fold. It enables women who can carrya pregnancy but cannot produce viable eggs to conceive through the In VitroFertilization process (IVF) and bear a child. It allows fertile women theincredible opportunity to help childless couples have the child they haveyearned for. The Center has been very successful in advertising for egg donors; as of December 1995 we have over 150 profiles of women hoping to be chosen bya recipient couple. In recent years there have been two major advances in reproductive technologythat make use of donor eggs a viable option for women who would not otherwisebe able to have a child. The first advance has been the introduction ofultrasound guided transvaginal (non-surgical) recovery of donor eggs. Thisis an outpatient procedure requiring sedation. Laparoscopy and general anesthesiaare not required. The second advance is the success in cryopreservation(freezing) of in vitro fertilized embryos. Typically, donor and recipient'scycles are synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thusoptimize the chance of a conception. When there are more embryos than necessaryfor a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle,thus making the procedure more cost effective. In the last five years, the use of in vitro fertilized donor eggs hasbeen widely accepted with resulting births to our couples who live in manycountries including Australia, England, Israel, and the United States. Our 15 year history with screening potential candidates, administratingand coordinating of third party arrangements has provided us with the necessaryexperience to make successful and appropriate matches between donors andrecipients. The typical egg donor profile is a woman of fertile age, between21 and 34, who is a mother with a good medical history. She is a responsibleand empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertilecouple have a child.

Consulting Services at the Center Center for Surrogate Parenting & EggDonation, Inc. The Need for Psychological and Legal Counseling Unlike any other alternative method of creating a family, the surrogateprocess allows a child to be biologically related to one, or in the caseof embryo transplant, both parents. It also gives the couple the opportunityto become involved and experience the pregnancy itself. Also, it allows thecouple some control over the ultimate genetic makeup of their child. Havinga child with the help of a surrogate mother can be an exciting and fulfillingway to experience the joy of parenthood. Women have varied motivations in their decisions to be surrogate mothersand egg donors. (Many times this motivation is more instinctive as in "Iam helping someone who desperately wants a baby", or hard to articulate.)The potential psychological and emotional harm to the surrogate mother oregg donor and her family is a risk that no couple should ask her to takeuntil she is fully informed. Every surrogate mother and egg donor needs a private session with an expertcounselor in the field to enable her to discuss all parameters of surrogacyand egg donation. She must understand that there will be a child "out there"that she has carried or help create and yet she will not be considered themother. If she participated in the Artificial Insemination (AI) program,the child so conceived will have a genetic connection to her. Only with fullyinformed consent can a surrogate mother or egg donor make a healthy decisionthat she can participate and fulfill the obligations of being a surrogatemother. The desire to assist a childless couple must be approached with fullinformation and careful consideration. It is important that the surrogate mother or egg donor meets and talksto other surrogate mothers or egg donors. During group support meetings,(held under the guidance of the counselor), surrogate mothers and egg donorsmeet other surrogate mothers and egg donors who are in all stages of theprogram. Some in the group may be on medication and others may already havegiven birth. Through exposure to all stages, the surrogate mother and eggdonor can finally decide if participation is safe for her. Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D., Carol Wolfe, MFCC, Donna Robertson, LCSW and Elaine Gordon, PhD, and The Law Offices of Vorzimer, Garber, Masserman & Ecoff, offer a four hour legal and psychological orientation for couples who have their own potential surrogate mother or egg donor. This includes a private session with the counselor to discuss the psychological aspects of surrogacy and egg donation, thereafter they meet with the attorney, whose practice emphasizes this field of law, to discuss the legal ramifications and finalize parental rights. Surrogate mothers and egg donors need to seek independent legal counsel. Some important issues for discussion during psychological and legal consultfor surrogate mothers: compensation, birth defects, abortion, lost wagesdue to complications of pregnancy, guardianship of child in event coupledies before the birth, death of surrogate while pregnant, financialaccountability for medical bills, insurance coverage and potential denialof insurance coverage, multiple fetus development and selective termination,contact during pregnancy and after birth, and effects on all the childreninvolved. It is important that these issues are discussed in depth and eachparty understands the other's feelings, liabilities, duties and responsibilities. There is too much at stake ... seek psychological and legal counseling. Consulting Services for Couples Who HaveTheir Own Surrogate Mothers Â©1995 Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation,Inc.

Is CSP more expensive than other programs? No, not if you compare apples with apples. Here is why. Our programis comprehensive. Please note all the services we offer and compare us withother agencies. We have a full support staff of eight, including medicalcoordinator, surrogate coordinator, and trust administrator, among others.In addition, our team consists of a psychological group of four experiencedcounselors, and an experienced law firm we are associated with. We are affiliatedwith the finest medical groups currently practicing in the field of infertility. We also state all costs. Our estimate anticipates all of your expenses,instead of giving you an initial low fee which excludes many expenses youwill later be asked to pay. If other agencies gave you the same service wedo, their costs would probably be greater than ours. Our fee is $15,800.00.The remainder of the costs are medical, psychological, legal and surrogatefees. Please note most of these costs are incurred no matter what programyou select. We offer over sixteen years of experience in this field with a sterling record of success. The Center offers the most comprehensive program available. Weare proud to provide you with the experience and track record that is simplynot available with other agencies or programs. Ask questions. Compare theprograms! The more information you have, the better informed you will beto make the appropriate choice for you. Do you have a waiting list to be matched with a Surrogate? Yes, and that is the good news! Only a small percentage (about 5%) of potential surrogate mother applicantsare accepted into our program. It takes approximately four months to fullyscreen a surrogate candidate before she is able to be matched with a couple.We are very particular in our selection process. When you are matched witha surrogate, she will have already been thoroughly screened. You meet yoursurrogate only after she has undergone medical evaluations, psychologicalscreening and testing, criminal background check, insurance evaluation, etc. Our philosophy is simple. You have waited a long time to come to thispoint. A wait of several months for the best surrogate working with the bestprogram seems reasonable to us and our more than four hundred clients duringthe past sixteen years. Do we need to come in for a full consultation? Yes. We believe this decision is so important, you must have fullinformed consent and knowledge of our program before joining us. The onlyway we know how to accomplish this is for you to spend four to six hoursat our Center, meeting with our entire staff, a member of the psychologicalteam and an attorney experienced in the field of surrogacy. There is a lotof information given at this meeting, and at its end, you will have a verycomprehensive view of all aspects of surrogacy; psychological, legal,administrative and procedural. In this complex and emotional partnership, it is also important that priorto our working together over the next eighteen months to two years, we getto know you and you get to know all of us. A little familiarity breeds alot of comfort when it comes to surrogacy. If you think there's any obligationin coming to our consultation, let us reassure you we never allow couplesto join our program at the consultation. Even our overseas couples must gohome and digest all of this information prior to making any decision. Do you have a waiting list for Egg Donation? No. Our Egg Donor program has a surplus of Egg Donors for severalreasons. First, many of our Egg Donors are former surrogates who want tocontinue to help couples, yet do not wish to enter into another surrogacyarrangement (remember, that's a two year commitment!). So, we have a numberof screened, terrific women who are Egg Donor candidates. Also, the number of women who wish to be Egg Donors is vastly greaterthan the number of women applying to be surrogates. So we find ourselveswith an abundance of Egg Donors as opposed to the usual, chronic "shortage"of surrogate mothers. Finally, our Egg Donor program is fairly small and is used primarily as an adjunct to physician's Egg Donor programs (Egg donor programs at a Doctor's office is usually run like a sperm donor program with "closed", anonymous matches). Our Egg Donor program is "open", much like our surrogacy program. Open referrs to a range of contact possibilities: you can meet one another face to face; you can talk on the phone; you can write a note to your egg donor thanking her for her assistance; you can send her flowers after the transfer as a thank you; you release only your first names, etc. In our program we have found that many parties have elected to meet one another with the counselor present. This enables our Intended Parents to ask questions and get a better understanding of who their donor is. The totally anonymous situation is rare in our organization. We are experts at matching specific Egg Donors for specific couples. Ourclients find that our experience in screening and matching women to helpinfertile couples is simply unparalleled by any group, much less a medicalgroup where the emphasis is on the medical procedures not the matching process. Do we get more personal service with a "small" program than with theCenter for Surrogate Parenting? No, you don't! Our staff is very available. After office hours, there are emergency numbers to call anytime to reach one of our staff members or one of the psychological team members assigned personally to you. We have a staff of eight trained members, as well as being associated with five counselors and an attorney's office, we are able to share the responsibilities and utelize the strengths each staff member or associate has. With tasks being shared between everyone, we all have time to deal with each issue and pay attention to each and every client. Our organization is staffed with real professionals working together to help our couples create their families. We are a multidisciplinary team of counselors, lawyers, physicians and administrators, and after sixteen years, we know what our clients need; communication, dedication and real commitment to our couples and surrogates. To quote one of our couples from a March 9, 1995, letter to our Center: "Your staff was wonderful. Whenever we called (and we did frequently) the response was immediate. Words can never express our appreciation to you and your staff. Please know we will be thankful that your center exists and if ever you need someone for references we are available." Thank you for your interest in our program. Â©1995 Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation,Inc.

The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation offers an organized,comprehensive program, which includes advertising, administration as wellas coordination of psychological, legal and medical services. Our surrogatesare specifically solicited, psychologically and medically screened, providedwith legal counsel and matched with the intended parents. We are proud tooffer an "open" program where the surrogate chooses her couple, then theywill meet one another prior to determining if this is the couple she wouldlike to work with. The Surrogate has the opportunity of finding out in personabout the couple's history, their likes and dislikes, their personality,etc. The counselor is present at the meeting to assist with overcoming anyinitial uneasiness in meeting someone for the first time and more importantlycan direct the conversation as well as encourage the discussion of importantissues. The Surrogacy process provides fertile women with the opportunity to helpchildless couples create their families. They can share the joy of parenthood,experience pregnancy again, and feel fulfilled knowing that they made someone'sdream come true. There are two surrogate programs, and deciding which is right for youis an individual decision. Artificial Insemination Program - the Surrogate mother's egg is usedand she is artificially inseminated at an infertility clinic with a verysimple medical procedure. In-Vitro Fertilization Program - This program is more complex. The couplewill create embryos using their own eggs and semen, then transfer the embryosto the Surrogate Mother. Typically, the Couple and Surrogate's cycles aresynchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus optimizethe chance of a conception. When there are more embryos than necessary fora single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle,thus making the procedure more cost effective. In both programs, an Infertility Specialist will oversee the caseuntil 6-8 weeks after confirmation, then release the Surrogate Mother tothe care of her own OB/GYN and local hospital.

Our Surrogacy Program Center for Surrogate Parenting & EggDonation, Inc. Are you a potential surrogate? Our 15 year history with screening potential candidates, administratingand coordinating of third party arrangements has provided us with the necessaryexperience to make successful and appropriate matches between donors andrecipients. The typical surrogate profile is a woman of fertile age, between21 and 34, who is a mother with a good medical history. She is a responsibleand empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertilecouple have a child. We only work with women who have known fertility and are raising the child.It is easier for a surrogate mother not to bond with the child carried forthe adopting couple, if she can go back to the stability of her own family We do not allow women on welfare or AFDC to be surrogate mothers for theCenter. We feel it is not to their families' benefit to be dependent uponthe money with which the surrogate mother's time is compensated. It is difficult to put a price on the gift of a family. In particularlawsuits, the judicial system is asked to determine reasonable compensationfor the loss of limb, physical function and sometimes even of a life. Breakingdown the compensation given to a surrogate mother, approximately $1.50 anhour, is a small token of gratitude for the gift of life and family. Women who become surrogate mothers do so because they love their own childrenand cannot imagine a world without them. These fertile women have a deepcompassion for infertile couples. For most of these women, being pregnantwas an easy and enjoyable experience. It is difficult for people who have never experienced infertility tounderstand the desperateness by which the infertile couple's life becomesconsumed. The need is great for a professional organization, such as theCenter of Surrogate Parenting, to be available to guide all the parties involvedthrough the important practical issues of the highly emotional situation. The Center is dedicated to making the process of surrogate parenting positivein all ways for both the prospective parents and surrogate mother, and theirfamilies. If a husband is not supportive, or a potential surrogate's child becomesfrightened by the idea of "Mommy giving the baby to someone else", or thereis discomfort in the experience and uncertainty about the idea, the Centerdeclines the prospective surrogate mother's application. The process of surrogateparenting is not for everyone, no matter how caring and sincere a woman maybe. If a prospective couple is unable to understand the philosophical andpsychological motivation of the surrogate parenting process, the Center willlet them know that they are not appropriate for the program. The surrogatemother, whether traditional or gestational, is giving a great gift to theinfertile couple. The Center provides very careful medical, psychological and criminal screeningon all parties involved. Requirements include attendance at surrogate mothersupport groups, which are provided once a month in the Los Angeles, OrangeCounty and San Francisco areas.

Why I Wanted to Help Your Mom & Dad Dear Katie: In less than a week you will see the world for the first time, feelthe touch of your parents, and journey to the comfort and safety of yourown home. I find myself wanting to write to you now, while I still feel yourlife inside of me. It is hard to put into words what I am feeling and whatI'd like you to know about me. I guess a good place to start is at the beginning,and I why I wanted to help your mom and dad have a baby in the first place. Before I had Ryan and Karen, I knew I wanted to have children. I wantedchildren born out of the love between my husband and I. I used to wonderwhat I would have done if I tried and tried, but was unable to have children.I'm sure I would feel a deep void in my life ...an emptiness which couldnot be filled. Fortunately for me, I was able to have children easily. Ryanand Karen have filled my life with joy and given me a feeling of fulfillmentwhich goes beyond words. When I heard about how hard your mom and dad had been trying to have ababy, and saw how sad and lonely they were that they couldn't, I knew I wantedto help them so they could experience the happiness that I have enjoyed withmy own children. Even though pregnancy is not all fun and games, I enjoybeing pregnant ...feeling a life grow inside of me. Twice we tried and nothing happened. On the third try, you beat the odds!I'll never forget telling your mom, "So are you ready to be a mommy?" Shecouldn't believe it. I said, "I'm not kidding, we're pregnant!" Then shecried. Ryan and Karen have handled my pregnancy with you well. Ryan couldn'twait to pick out a gift for you and always reminded me to play your musicalbear to you everyday. Although he was excited about seeing you, he pointedout that he'll be happy when your born because then I can go in the jacuzziwith him again. Karen loved to talk to you. She would see other pregnantwomen and say "I wonder whose baby that is?." I know you will always be specialto her. Ray has been a wonderful husband through my aches, pains and moodswings. He never really understood why I wanted to be pregnant again, buthe supported me all the way and is happy to be helping your mom and dad havea family. Having you grow inside me has been a wonderful, amazing experience. Helpingyour parents bring a new life into the world has brought me much happinessand satisfaction. I want you to know that I have very special feelings towardsyou. Despite these feelings, there was never any doubt in my mind that youbelonged to your parents. There will always be a special place for you inmy heart. I will feel a loss when you go home, but I will also feel greatknowing I've helped your parents have the child they've always wanted. Iknow you will be loved and cherished as much as any baby could possibly be.My only wish is that your life be a happy one - full of love and joy andfulfillment.

A LOVE LETTER Dear Julia, By now, you know me pretty well. And you know that I can write onjust about any subject. But I feel as though there are no words to expresswhat you have done for me and Gregory. Jamie is a miracle if ever there wasone. He is the baby of my heart. The one I've always wanted and imagined.But, he wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. One year ago, I couldn't even look at a pregnant woman without feelingpain. I couldn't look into the window of a nursery furniture store or a babyclothiers store without wondering what I could have done to deserve suchpunishment. Every time there was a story about an infant abandoned or abused, I wantedto take that child and make it my own. I couldn't understand why someonewho had been so blessed could abuse that privilege. Now, after eight years of waiting, I am actually somebody's mommy. Youcan't imagine what it feels like to write those words. Every little thingJamie does is so precious to me. You gave what so few have the power to give. Not just an egg and a uterus.The care and concern for others to make being a surrogate mother worthwhile.How many people have the ability to make someone else's dream come true?That's just what you've been able to do. And you've done it with such openness,such selflessness, such pride. I hope that Jamie will inherit a little ofthat from you. Julia, I hope that you realize that with your strength, and your positiveattitude, you can do anything you set your mind to. I hope this experiencehas proven that to you. Soon, you will start a new life in Idaho. I know that you and Ken willmake it a fantastic success. I see your children, Alex and Seth, growingup in an atmosphere of wonderful values and plenty of love. They can't helpbut be successes, too. I know, too, that we will not continue to be as close as we've been. Andthat's probably only natural. But understand that I will be thinking of you.Jamie will know who you are as soon as he is old enough to understand. Andhe will be taught to love and respect you. Of course we'll keep in touchand keep you informed of his progress. And I hope you will let me know whatis new and exciting in your life, too. It's obvious how many people in your life think you are terrific and special.But, with the exception of Ken and the boys, no one will really know thefull extent of what you have done the way Gregory and I do. I don't know if I could feel any closer to you. Not if we were sisters.You've changed my life for the better and in the process I can see the positivethings you've done for yourself. No matter what else happens in the rest of your life, you have alreadydone more to prove you are a caring person than most people will ever beable to do. And I have the baby to prove it. I love you, Julia. And, I always will. Caroline Â©1995 Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation,Inc.

FINANCES Just as Surrogate Mothers give a gift to a couple, the couple needsto give something back. Traditional (Artificial Insemination) Surrogates receive $15,000, andGestational (In-Vitro Fertilization) Surrogates receive $12,000. The surrogatemother receives these amounts over the course of the pregnancy. Medical expenses are paid by the couple. Additionally, there is a $500 maternity clothing allowance and our surrogatesreceive monthly reimbursement checks for expenses relating to participationin the program, such as childcare, lost wages, mileage, phone calls, etc.In the event of a high-risk (i.e., multiple) pregnancy, the surrogate motheris taken care of. COUNSELING Each surrogate mother is assigned to a specific counselor, who willprovide ongoing support and guidance throughout the surrogacy process. Everymonth, our surrogates attend a group support meeting where they meet withother surrogate mothers in their area. The Center believes that it is veryimportant that each person involved in the surrogacy relationship is takencare of, therefore, not only the surrogate mother, but also her spouse andchildren are taken into consideration during screening and participationin the program. The counseling team also does a psychological evaluation on both the Intendedparents to determine their appropriateness for surrogacy. Those couples whothe Psychologists do not feel are appropriate are not accepted by CSP's program. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS The Center only works with women who are: between the ages of 21 & 35 years. mothers already. not receiving any form of government assistance (such as AFDC.) Surrogate mothers must also be given medical clearance from aninfertility specialist and be screened by a member of the counseling teamaffiliated with CSP.

Traditional Surrogacy (AI) Gestational Surrogacy (IVF) Egg Donation (ED) Will I meet my couple? The Center runs an "open" program. This means that you willmeet your couple prior to any medical procedures being undertaken. Inour program, you will choose your couple and the couple will choose you. You couple participates in the pregnancy as much as is comfortablefor you, e.g. going to doctor's appointments, attends the birth, and sendsphotos to you after birth. Have you ever had a surrogate mother change her mind and keep the baby? No. The actual number of cases in the entire country that have goneto court are a tiny handful (actually less than 17).

It seems thateach of the hundreds of couples who have asked the Center for help in creatingtheir family has chosen a different way to tell the good news to friendsand family. Some have written letters, others get on the phone, some eventhrow a big party! Deidre Hall, star of Days of our Lives, and husband SteveSohmer, decided to tell the world their story first with a cover story inPeople Magazine and now, a made for TV movie. Airing November 12 on the ABC television network, Deidre Hall's Story:After All (starring, of course, Deidre Hall), details the 20 years of Deidretrying to have a baby. Like all couples experiencing infertility, Deidreand Steve endured numerous visits to the infertility specialist, failed IVFattempts, and experienced their hopes and dreams dash away month after month.The movie also takes us on their journey to the Center for Surrogate Parentingand their meeting with Robin, the surrogate who completed their family with2 beautiful children. Deidre and Steve decided to go public and produce theirsurrogacy story because as Deidre says, "Women are spoon fed a lot ofmisinformation and they are terrorized by stories of failed adoptions andfailed surrogacies. The Baby M story, a nasty battle involving the surrogatemother, was a nightmare. I'm not trying to teach people how to be involvedin surrogacy. I'm trying to say there is a successful way to do this. There'smore to this than people realize. It's an exquisite trust; it's a profoundsharing." While Deidre Hall's Story: After All is not a documentary, it does asurprisingly good job at realistically describing the process and the emotionsinvolved in surrogacy. A particularly gratifying aspect of Deidre Hall'sStory: After All, for the staff at the Center is the recognition paid tothe professionals involved in Surrogate Parenting. We thank Deidre, Steve and their two lovely boys, David Atticus and Tully.We also thank Robin, the surrogate, for allowing us to share in part of theirlives. A successful surrogacy arrangement is always cause for joyous celebration. Return to CSP Home Page Surrogacy on the Net Director's Editorial KarenSynesiou, L.L. B. We have spent the last month surfing the Internet looking for informationon surrogacy and egg donation. There have been a few sites where we havefound some information, but no main source of information or access toprofessional opinions. So, we have decided to begin creating and developingour own site on the World Wide Web, which will offer information and updateson surrogacy and egg donation. From our Home Page, Net users will be ableto link to other sites or receive information on a large range of topics.Some topics to be covered are: general information on surrogacy and egg donation;myths and realities of surrogacy and egg donation; psychological aspectsof third party reproduction; updated success rates; names of infertilitydoctors; names of sperm banks for semen analysis and workups; social diseasetesting recommended; legal issues; legislative updates, and Frequently AskedQuestions. We envision that the Center will facilitate an evening of Internet RelayChat (a "party line" real-time conversations on the Net), with a guest host.These guests will include: psychologists and psychotherapists specializingin the field of surrogacy and egg donation, infertility doctors, lawyers,social workers, couples at different stages in the surrogacy process, andsurrogate mothers sharing their stories. We feel that an occasional opendiscussion will be beneficial. We welcome any ideas, suggestions, comments and help in establishing ourWWW Home Page. Please e-mail the Center at:centersp@aol.com. Return to CSP Home Page The Surrogate and Bedrest by Carol Wolfe,M.F.C.C. The vast majority of surrogate mothers have had smooth and easy pregnancies.When a surrogate has a difficult and complicated pregnancy she requires bedrest.She is often surprised and finds herself with some difficult coping and stressmanagement ahead. The surrogate knows that people in her life are watchingto see if she will fall apart at the birth. She often will feel that shehas to present a picture that "everything is OK...no problem!". Surrogatesare usually "givers", meaning that they volunteer for everything and areusually bad at receiving. It can be very difficult for them to recognizetheir own needs, much less ask for help. One of the most challenging aspects of bedrest is that the surrogate maybe able to take care of the needs of her own children. She may be unableto do the thousand things a mom does to keep the family running, such asmeals, getting kids up for school, music lessons, Girl Scouts, etc. A pregnancyin the third trimester can be difficult with its limitations anyway, butbedrest will amplify those difficulties a hundredfold. The surrogate is disabledand uncomfortable. She may be on monitors and medications, and wants to besure that her responsibility to the baby is taken care of. Additionally,she may be feeling very guilty that her family has to sacrifice so much. The second most challenging part of the pregnancy and bedrest, is thestrain on her marriage. It is inevitable that her husband is going to haveto cover some of these duties. He is supportive of her desire to do this,but husbands have varying degrees of desire to participate at all. He maybegin to be grumpy and disgruntled over his added responsibility and willrarely let the couple see this. It is not that he is unhappy about the overallgoal of helping to create a family, but that he is concerned about thedifficulties that may be endured by his own family. Sometimes a difficult pregnancy can involve anything from the scare ofmiscarriage with a few weeks of bedrest, to weeks of hospitalization. Financialcompensation a surrogate receives is not emotionally comforting when a surrogateis completely disabled. A couple should be very careful not to have the attitudethat "she is getting paid for this anyway". This attitude can be extremelydamaging to the relationship. The surrogate/prospective parents relationshipis benefited by each party trying to understand what the other may beexperiencing. Those who are able to understand and empathize usually reporta more successful experience. Return to CSP Home Page International Seminars As the Center's reputation grows internationally, we continue to bringour message of positive surrogacy to couples on virtually every continent.Over the next few months, we will be hosting seminars in Taiwan, Australiaand Israel. Our first international seminar took place in Israel in 1991where we discovered couples were very eager to get our information and meetthe Center's staff, without having to spend the time and money to fly toBeverly Hills. Since a meeting at the Center is almost always mandatory priorto joining our programs, these international seminars provide all of us withgreat opportunity; the couples have their consultation in their place ofresidence, and the staff at the Center enjoys great sightseeing! Incidentally, we now consider next year's seminars in New York, Chicagoand Dallas as just a trip around the corner. Return to CSP Home Page A Letter to the Center Greetings from Cloud 9! Enclosed are a few photographs of Brianna (born Dec. 14, 1994 by Polly,surrogate mother) and some of the people who helped to make her possible.We hope that the last earthquake has not created for you as big a "shakeup" in your lives as Brianna has for us! We don't regret a sleepless minute.Actually, she has been very understanding of us, and has tolerated almostall of our foibles and lack of comprehension of the lectures she gives useach day. She is very good-natured and seems to love people (she certainlygets passed around like a football). We credit part of this apparent adaptabilityto the first few weeks of her life in which she traveled 1/3 the length ofCalifornia a couple of days after she was born, flew to Kansas and back at5 days old, and then few to Canada a couple of weeks later. Then there havebeen several parties in her honor to attend, etc. etc. Quite the social schedulefor one so young. We thought you might like the photographs enclosed. To be sure, you willreceive others. Proud? Who, us? Thank you again for helping to facilitate the most wonderful experienceof our lives! With our best wishes, Bruce, Betty and Brianna Return to CSP Home Page CSP Philosophy on EggDonation THE CENTER OFFERS AN "OPEN" EGG DONATION PROGRAM WITH A REGISTRYOF OVER 150 AVAILABLE DONORS. "Open" refers to the range of communication between the IntendedParents and their egg donor. Some couples elect to meet their egg donor andbe open about their full identity, while others may wish to divulge onlya limited amount of information. Each couple must select their own comfortlevel. At a minimum, couples will receive a photograph of their donor andher children, as well as her full application form. The application coversquestions of ethnic background, education, family genetics and medicalhistory. A DONOR MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE GENETIC CHILD OF HER OWN. This proves her fertility. She has carried a pregnancy and becomea parent; she has also experienced "bonding". DONORS SHOULD NOT DONATE MORE THAN THREE TIMES, PREFERABLYONLY TWICE. We must be concerned about the genetic history of your child. Sinceegg donation is a fairly new field, we do not know the full medical side-effectsof stimulating the ovaries. We also do not know the effects of a child knowinghe/she has many half-siblings with several different families. Return to CSP HomePage Egg Donation: Reversing the BiologicalClock by Elaine Gordon, Ph.D. The Center is proud to announce its comprehensive eggdonation program utilizing the team approach. Donors are thoroughly screenedboth medically and psychologically in an effort to assess whether they meetthe stringent guidelines established by the professional staff. There isnew hope for women who have previously been unable to conceive due to prematureovarian failure, age, or genetic considerations. The success rate using donoreggs is far greater for these women than In Vitro Fertilization, where theyuse their own eggs. Although the odds are significantly better, theyunfortunately are not 100%. Recipients are interviewed and counseled regarding the medical andpsychosocial implications of the process. Introductions and matches are madeby consent of both parties. Egg donation is said to be a new reproductivecure which enables patients to achieve their dream, to bear and nurture achild. Egg donation provides a means for the medical community to turn backthe biological clock of women nearing the end their reproductive years. The old tradition of donation is based on anonymity, secrecy, andnondisclosure. However, there is one question that emerges as the foremostin recipients minds when they begin to contemplate egg donation: The issueof anonymous verses non-anonymous donation. Tradition and experience haveled us to question the wisdom of old policies and consequently resulted indeveloping a program that offers the opportunity for non-anonymity. We realizeit is very easy to keep egg donation a secret and we also know there areno easy answers to this very difficult dilemma. Whether one turns to egg donation or not depends on the medical diagnosis.In consultation with your physician, the decision should be made whetheryou are an appropriate candidate for egg donation. If you are, you must alsodecide whether you are psychologically prepared to be a candidate. This meansbeing ready to make a commitment to parenting a child that is geneticallyrelated to only one of you. It also involves asking yourself and your partnersome hard questions which deserve some very honest answers. These questionswill be extremely difficult ones. Who to tell or not tell; when to tell;the non-genetic relationship disclosure issues, and what to tell the child,are all important questions that need to be discussed. If you have any questions concerning the egg donation program, pleasefeel free to call our office for more information.We look forward to working with those patients who find egg donation to betheir option and making their experience a rewarding one.

Return to CSP Home Page Legal & Medical Birth Certificate reflects the Genetic Parents in Gestational Surrogacy John K. Ciccarelli, Esq. advises that Paternityand Maternity Judgments remain the method of choice for finalizing the parentalrights in gestational surrogacy in California. Mr. Ciccarelli explains thatby his appearance in court prior to the birth of the baby, he is able toobtain an order from a judge directing the hospital and physicians to completethe birth certificate by listing the couple's names as the mother and father.Therefore, there Is no need for an adoption to take place. While Mr. Ciccarelliemployed this method prior to the California decision in Johnson vs. Calvert,there is no doubt that the Court's ruling in that case provided the lowercourts with additional guidance to this procedure. This method has beensuccessfully used in more than 126 IVF births. To date, no California courthas refused to recognize the couple's parental rights. Folic Acid & Pregnancy: A New Discovery Folic Acid is important prior to and during the early stagesof pregnancy. It helps to protect the unborn baby against birth defects ofthe spine and brain, like spina bifida or "open spine". Once a potentialsurrogate mother is medically cleared and accepted into our program, sheintakes 0.4 mg of Folic Acid every day for approximately 4 monthsprior to pregnancy. Folic Acid is a B vitamin and is found mainlyin green leafy vegetables, beans, asparagus, citrus fruits/juice, whole grainfoods and liver.

Special Bonds - Deciding On A SecondChild Together Genetic Screening Will HelpAssure a Healthy Pregnancy Center Offers A Variety ofServices Surrogacy Sourcebooks Egg Donor Registry Now Available at CSP Center News-N-Notes Professional Update Surrogacy Recognized As ParentingOption Parental Rights Upheld by U.S. Supreme Court In a case of paramount importance to the infertile community, the SupremeCourt has let stand a California decision that establishes the biologicalor intended parents in a surrogate arrangement as the legal parents of anychild born from such an arrangement. The court also upheld that the contract employed by the Center For SurrogateParenting between surrogates and the intended parents is legally enforceable.Finally, the higher court ruled that surrogate parenting is not againstCalifornia public policy. By refusing to hear a challenge to existing laws, the U.S. Supreme Courthas concurred with the California Supreme Court that a gestational surrogatehas no rights as a mother and cannot claim parental rights. Although therulings were only applied to gestational surrogate agreements, the decisionsmay also impact agreements whereby the surrogate is both the genetic andbirth mother since in both types of arrangements the "intent" is identical:to provide the infertile couple with a child. The rulings arose from the case of Anna Johnson vs. Mark and CrispinaCalvert. Ms. Johnson had agreed to carry the genetic child of the Calvert'sand then attempted to claim parental rights. Although the parties were notin the Center's program, the Calvert's did use a contract prepared by theCenter. It was this contract specifically that was ruled enforceable. Thiscase redefines parental rights, reinforces surrogacy arrangements and onceagain establishes California as a leader in expanding procreative rightsfor infertile couples. Return to CSP Home Page Comprehensive Study of Gestational Surrogate TransfersNow Completed The Center For Surrogate Parenting has completed studying 294 gestationalsurrogacy transfers that involved 111 Center clients between 1986 and 1993.This is the largest number of cases analyzed at one time. Clients studiedincluded those who supplied fresh embryos and frozen embryos and surrogateswho underwent IVF or ZIFT. The overall full-term or ongoing pregnancy rate for all clients was 26%.As with other studies, the rate for women under 40 using fresh embryos washigher, 28%, than those for women over 41 which was 6%. Although the statisticsfor women over 40 using frozen embryos was actually higher than those usingfresh, 12% vs. 6%, the study showed that those women undergoing fresh transferswere much older, up to 48 years old, than those using frozen embryos. The Center conducted the study in response to the most frequently askedquestion: is IVF more successful with a younger uterus even if the eggs areolder? The overall gestational surrogate success rate, 26%, for full-termor ongoing pregnancy is higher than the overall IVF rate. But the resultsare still somewhat inconclusive and some, such as the ZIFT results whichshow a 35% success rate for women under 41, are inconsistent with other studies. The study found that the majority of pregnancies, 51 out of 60, occurredby the second attempt. Eleven out of the 60 were multiple births. It was also found that the miscarriage rate for gestational surrogates,26%, was similar to the miscarriage rate for women over 35 in the generalpopulation. Most studies show that the miscarriage rate for women under 35is 20%. The Center's clients participating in the study were patients of 18 differentphysicians who performed the actual IVF and ZIFT procedures. Return to CSP Home Page Before You Begin: Questions to Ask ConcerningSurrogacy The Center For Surrogate Parenting offers a full range of psychologicalcounseling for surrogate mothers, egg donors and prospective parents to helpthem decide if surrogacy is the best way for them to build, or help someoneelse build, a family. Because of its careful screening and on-going counseling,legal coordination and guidance services, the Center has a perfect 1.5-yearrecord of all parties fulfilling their agreements. Before entering any surrogacy program, consider the following: Does the program recruit its own surrogate mothers, and if so, throughwhat means? Will the program work with a surrogate mother recruited by the couple? Are surrogate mothers provided with established, experienced psychologicalcounseling, and if so to what extent? Is medical screening required of the surrogates, and if so to what extent?Does the program require testing beyond that recommended by the AmericanFertility Society? Does the program offer gestational surrogacy (surrogate IVF, ZIFT, hostuterus) as well as traditional surrogacy? How does the program assist with the medical procedures and treatmentsrequired in AI, IVF, and ZIFT? Are they able to coordinate the logisticsbetween physicians, surrogate mothers, clinics and hospitals? What type of emotional support does the program offer the couple andsurrogate mother - counseling, group support, both? To what extent is contact between the couple and surrogate encouragedprior to birth? What type of legal counsel is provided to the couple and the surrogatemother and does it include the preparation of contracts and legal representationto finalize the parent/child relationship? What are the financial obligations incurred by the couple? What is thepayment schedule? At what point is the couple responsible for the surrogate mother's medicalexpenses? Must the couple pay for a surrogate's medical care prior to hercompleting the full screening process? Does the program have a medical registry for updating the medical historyof the surrogates or the children? Does the program have a referral list of previous client couples? Does the program have access to the latest legislative policies and lawsregarding surrogacy and are they able to respond in a timely manner to anychanges affecting surrogacy? Do they have back-up personnel to immediately cover in the event of illness,vacations, other contingencies, etc.? Return to CSP Home Page "We're Pregnant!" Just as the ways to conceive a child now takes many forms, so dothe methods of telling couples that a baby may be on the way. The Centerplans ahead with couples, physicians and surrogates on how to deliver thepregnancy results. Most often, the physician's office will call the Center and the coupledirectly if the results are negative. They then agree on who will tell thesurrogate. When the results are positive, they calls goes out to the surrogateand Center. The surrogate then helps to inform the couple of their success. Some women want to personally tell their husband of a positive resultin order to replicate the birth process more closely. Others are happy tohave the surrogate give the news. The way surrogates do this are as variedas they are. Teddy bears, positive pregnancy tests, and streamers and balloons haveall been used to inform waiting couples. One surrogate learned of her pregnancyright before Mother's Day and sent a Mother's Day card to announce theirsuccess to the intended parents. Whatever method of communication the message is the same: a baby is onthe way and with it the fulfillment of a couple's dreams and hopes. Return to CSP Home Page Special Bonds - Deciding On A Second ChildTogether For infertile couples the path to parenthood is one that requires newdecisions with nearly every step. Once they have decided to create a familythrough surrogacy, they must select the surrogate. And, once they have onechild, they must decide if, and how, they will have another. Those who wantmore than one child may again look to their surrogate for help. Surrogate mothers are not asked to commit to carrying more than one pregnancybut about 20% of surrogates choose to do so. Some become pregnant for thesame couple, others bring a first child to another family. Typically, the decision to repeat a surrogacy experience for a familyis made when the first child is 6 to 12 months old. By this time, the coupleand surrogate have an established relationship and have decided on the boundariesof their extended family. Most gestational surrogates want to provide a couple with a second childfor the same reasons the couple want another child - reasons that are nodifferent than those given by any family, including those with no fertilityproblems. Genetic surrogates agree to more than one pregnancy so the childrenwill have similar genetic ties and have a shared history of their birth. All surrogates who go on to a second pregnancy, do so because they foundthe first experience positive and safe and believe that what they have doneis special enough to warrant repeating. Return to CSP Home Page Genetic Screening Will Help Assure a HealthyPregnancy by Ann Garber, M.S. Dr.P.H. Genetic screening for certain inherited disorders provides importantinformation for couples who are planning a pregnancy. It is estimated thatall individuals are "carriers" of between 5 to 10 recessive genes. A carrier has one normal gene and one abnormal gene for a specific disorderin each of his or her cells. Generally, the carrier of a recessive gene doesnot have the symptoms of that inherited disease because the normal gene disguisesthe abnormal gene. However, when both the mother and father carry the same defective recessivegene, there is a one-in-four chance that any child they have will inheritthe recessive gene from both parents and be born with a severe form of thedisease. Screening for carriers of genetic traits is important when matching coupleswith a surrogate using artificial insemination (AI), as well as in vitrofertilization, (IVF). Certain groups are at risk Genetic screening is particularly important for certain ethnic groupsthat have a higher incidence of a genetic disease than found in the generalpopulation. Those groups include African Americans, who have a higher risk of carryingthe sickle cell trait; Ashkenazi Jews who have an increased risk of carryingthe Tay Sachs gene; and individuals of Mediterranean or Southeast Asian descentwho can carry Thalassemia. Disease Often Hidden A common misconception is that genetic screening is not necessaryunless there is a family history of a genetic disease. In fact, in the majorityof cases where an individual is recognized as being a carrier of a recessivedisease, there is no relative with that disorder. That is because the disease only shows itself when two carriers contributean abnormal gene in the egg and the sperm, and an affected offspring is born.Usually there is no known prior history of the disease in either side ofthe family. Genetic screening for all individuals in high risk populationsis the only way to identify carriers. Dr. Ann Garber is a reproductive geneticist and a consultantto the Center. Return to CSP Home Page Center Offers A Variety of Services Since its inception 15 years ago, the Center For Surrogate Parenting hasdeveloped a range of services and referrals to meet the needs of couplesand surrogate mothers and prepare them for the surrogacy experience. The services and referrals provided are revised as necessary to meet newdevelopments in the legal, psychological, medical insurance coverage andtechnical areas of surrogacy. For example, advances in the use of egg donors provide new options forclients and require additional support, legal and educational services. Services offered by the Center include: Psychological screening and counseling for all parties. Comprehensive education for all parties to understand, give and receiveinformed consent. Coordination of legal contracts and documents including paternity andadoption documents as determined by the parties' independent counsel.

Return to CSP HomePage Egg Donor Registry Now Available atCSP Many couples will be able to benefit from the latest advance in assistedreproduction technology - egg donation - because of the Center's new eggdonor registry program. Egg donation enables women who cannot produce eggsbut can otherwise carry a pregnancy to conceive through IVF. The Center offers the first organized, comprehensive egg donor registryto match donors with recipients. A complete guide to egg donation detailingits history, the process for both donor and recipient, the legal coordinationand psychological counseling services provided and a list of costs is availablefrom the Center. Return to CSP Home Page Center News-N-Notes International Surrogacy The Center has gained international expertise and now provides surrogacyservices and counseling for clients worldwide. Recent advances in embryofreezing have reduced the cost of procedures for those living in countrieswith socialized medicine, shortened travel time and alleviated some of theemotional turmoil of long distance, third-party cycle synchronization. Successfulsurrogacy partnerships have occurred for couples living in Italy, England,France, Denmark, Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, New Guinea, Hong Kong,Argentina, Venezuela, Singapore, Guatemala, Nigeria, Taiwan, Egypt, Germany,Mexico and Sweden. CSP Invited to Address RESOLVE Conferences The Center has recently presented lectures on the protocols, safeguardsand practical considerations for third-party assisted reproduction at theChicago, Salt Lake City and San Diego chapters of RESOLVE. RESOLVE is a national non-profit organization offering counseling, referraland support groups to people with infertility problems as well as providingeducation and assistance to associated professionals. Dr. Hanafin Lectures at AFS Dr. Hilary Hanafin, the psychologist atthe Center For Surrogate Parenting, spoke on psychological assessment andcounseling in third-party reproduction at the recent meeting of the AmericanFertility Society in Montreal, Canada.

Slated to air this year, theTV special will dramatize Ms. Hall's experience highlighting her 20-yearbattle with infertility the turning point of which, with the help of a surrogatemother, was the triumphant 1992 birth of her son, David. Ms. Hall's storywas featured in a "People" Magazine cover just after the birth of herlong-awaited son. Return to CSP Home Page Professional Update New Method of Preparation has 56% Pregnancy Rate Dr. Michael Feinman and his colleagues at Pacific Fertility MedicalCenters of California have reported a 56% pregnancy rate for egg donationand gestational surrogacy. This unusually high level of success is achievedby preparing the recipient with injectable estradiol valerate instead ofgiving her oral estrogen or using an estrogen patch. The chances for pregnancyalso increased when the egg provider was under 35 and the recipient had ahealthy uterus. PZD, SUZI Methods Show Successful Results The Huntington Reproductive Center (HRC) in Pasadena reports 30 livebirths and approximately 10 ongoing pregnancies utilizing the PZD and SUZImicrofertilization procedures. HRC also is among a handful of clinics inthe U.S. to offer the new ICSI technique, where a single sperm is injecteddirectly into the cytoplasm of an egg. Using this method egg fertilizationwas achieved where only a few immobile sperm were present in the entireejaculation.

More than just one child... Family BuildingSolutions Center News-N-Notes Professional Update Return to CSP HomePage Surrogacy in the 1990s The RealStory The common perception of surrogacy-what it is, who does it, and how itworks-has seeped into the public consciousness by way of sensationalizednews headlines and aftemoon talk shows, via politicians who find it expedientto denounce surrogacy, and from religious, pseudo-feminist and antiabortiongroups whose tenets require women to abdicate the right and responsibilityto control their own bodies. Those who speak out the loudest against surrogacyseem to know the least about it. Few have ever faced the devastation ofinfertility themselves. Yet seldom have they included infertile couples orsurrogate mothers in public policy-making decisions about surrogacy. SURROGACY WORKS 99% Success Rate Understandably, an infertile couple trying to resolve childlessnesswould be hesitant to pursue surrogacy without accurate information and reliableresources. But any enquiring mind delving deeper than NationalEnquirer headlineswould discover that surrogacy works! According to the health department ofthe state of New York's estimate of approximately 4000 surrogate births sincethe late 1970's, only 11 documented cases involving custody of the childhave gone to litigation, and in every case except one, custody has been awardedto the intended parents. Compared to other forms of social contract suchas marriage or adoption, surrogacy enjoys a significantly higher successrate (over 99%). The 1992 Information Please Almanac states that in 1990,there were approximately 2,448,000 marriages in the U.S., and 1,175,000divorces-a failure rate of almost 50%. In adoption, one study conducted byadoption specialist Carol Wolfe, MFCC, foundthat out of 250 birthmothers who had agreed to place their child with prospectiveadoptive parents, in 38% of these cases, one or the other party withdrewfrom the agreement prior to or following the birth. (This differs from theoften-quoted figure of 5 - 15% of birthmothers who change their mind afterthe birth.) GESTATIONAL SURROGACY "...a second wave of surrogate mothers..." Not only is traditional Artificial Insemination surrogacy highlysuccessful, but according to a front-page article in the August 12, 1990issue of The New York Times,"surrogacy is not only actively practiced butexpanding in a new direction, bringing hope to some families... ." This newdirection, which the Times heralds as the "second wave of surrogate mothers"is gestational surrogacy, in which a woman carries an infertile couple'sembryo and delivers a baby to whom she has no genetic connection. The articlealso interviews internationally recognized infertility specialists Drs. RichardMarrs and Paulo Serafini who perform embryo transfers into gestational surrogatemothers when medically indicated. The Ethics Committee of the American FertilitySociety states "there could be a role for surrogate gestation in reproductivemedicine." The Times quotes Lori B. Andrews, a lawyer specializing inreproductive law at the American Bar Foundation. "This is a growing areaof surrogacy... more in vitro fertilization centers are offering it, andmore couples are drawn to it." Clearly, growing acceptance within the medicalcommunity has moved surrogacy from the media spotlight into the medical joumals. PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS Professional surrogate practitioners can now provide full-serviceprograms which address every aspect of the process. At the Center for SurrogateParenting, comprehensive case management of each couple and surrogate motherensures the best possible outcome for all parties. This means independentlegal counsel for both surrogate and couple, complete medical screening,ongoing psychological counseling for all participants, and finaricial managementto insure that all fees, insurance and anticipated expenses are covered. Surrogacy has moved beyond the shadows and innuendo of the tabloids andtalkshows, emerging in the 1990's as an established practice offering realsolutions for creating families. Return to CSP Home Page Surrogate Mothers CompareExperiences Independent Arrangements vs. Professional SurrogacyPrograms Three surrogate mothers share insights gained by working both independentlyand through professional programs. All expressed the hope that their experienceswill prove helpful to women considering becoming surrogate mothers. "Susan" Susan wanted to be a surrogate mother ever since the day her ownchild was born, after learning that the woman in the hospital room next toher had tried to take her own life. The woman's child had been stillborn,necessitating an emergency hysterectomy. Susan placed an ad in her localpaper, using her home phone number, offering to become a surrogate motherfor an infertile couple. She received many calls. Using her own intuitionand good sense, she screened the couples herself, finally selecting a warmand deserving couple. They had no contract, the agreement was sealed witha handshake. After the third insemination, Susan became pregnant. The wife,whose doctor had suggested surrogacy since she had severe tubal damage, becamepregnant herself when Susan was three months pregnant. The couple was wonderful,insisting they were thrilled with two children. Susan gave birth to a boy,the wife a girl. All parties honored their agreement and the experience wasa great success. Only after researching surrogacy for a college paper did Susan realizehow perilous her situation had been and how very fortunate she was in itsoutcome. The second time around she worked through a professional surrogacyagency which offered her far better protection against unforeseen events.She noted that doing it on her own made the process appear less expensivefor the couple, and she could see no real advantages for the surrogate. "April" April loved being pregnant but a messy divorce made being a singlemother a tremendous burden. She wanted to have a child for someone who couldreally enjoy motherhood. She felt confused and ambiguous about being paidfor this service. After becoming involved with a professional surrogate agency,it became clear to her that she was being paid for her services, not a child.She felt comforted that the agency took care of all legal matters, screenedthe couples for social diseases, and provided ongoing counseling and support.She was matched with a couple and the three of them produced a beautifulbaby boy. The experience was so successful that two years later, they alltried again, but this time they felt confident that they could do it on theirown. April became pregnant with twins. In retrospect, April felt the mainproblem was that they all had become too close, taking too much for granted.Communication broke down - everyone was afraid to say what he or she wasreally feeling, or to ask for what was needed. Money was an uncomfortablesubject. The birth was an emotional rollercoaster - the couple, unpreparedfor twins, April desperately needing to hear a "thank you." She says shewants to be a surrogate one more time, to end on a positive experience. Thistime she wants to go through a professional program. "I will never do itany other way!" "Emily" Suffering two years of infertility herself, Emily wanted to helpa childless couple after completing her own family. She found a reputablesurrogate agency and helped two infertile couples to become families.Subsequently she was contacted by a couple who offered her more money towork with them independently. Because of her previous successful experiences,she felt confident about doing it on her own and agreed. Once she becamepregnant, the couple could "see I had no back-up. They were very nice tome until they got what they wanted." After the birth, they refused to paythe balance of her fee as well as the obstetrician's bill of several thousanddollars, which Emily eventually paid herself. Her husband insists she workthrough a surrogate program the next time. Return to CSP Home Page International Frozen Embryo Shipping Program ASuccess Customs Agent Plays Crucial Role As our international clientele expands and the technology of embryo freezingadvances, the Center's program has opened the door to international shipmentof frozen embryos. This allows couples who live in countries with socializedmedicine, such as Israel, Australia and England, to create embryos lessexpensively. It also reduces the travel expenses and emotional rigors oflong distance, third-party cycle synchronization. So far, our program hasproduced two births from embryos shipped from England and Australia, withanother five couples currently in the process. Our customs agent is responsible for all aspects of shipping, from filingcomplicated customs paperwork and fee payment, to pickup and delivery torespective doctors. Because the embryos are shipped in liquid nitrogen, whichis considered a "hazardous material" it requires special clearances. Contentsare referred to as "human tissue", the client's name never appearing on anyof the forms. In addition, the agent must make special preparations to insurethe embryos are not x-rayed. Direct routes must be booked and detailed knowledgeof suitable airlines is essential. We hope to be shipping embryos from Japan soon, as worldwide interestin this option continues to grow. Return to CSP Home Page Issues and Inquiries Preconceptions About Surrogacy The Center Asks Its InfertileCouples ... Q. What was your initial reaction to surrogate parenting? A. In the beginning stages of exploring this option, most coupleswere aware of the negative press surrogacy had received, fueling their mainfear that the surrogate mother would have problems relinquishing the baby.Several couples also worried that their own relationship would be adverselyaffected, since the wife, in the case of artificial insemination, would haveno genetic connection to the child. Other concerns were that it might beexploitative of the surrogate, or that the whole process was just toocomplicated. Many couples were positive about surrogacy. They believed itwas neither the government's nor the public's business to interfere in thisvery private area of their lives. They saw it as a win/win situation forall participants. Q. At what point did you decide to pursue surrogate parenting? A. Several of the couples maintained that the turning pointoccurred after meeting with the Center's psychologist and staff. Becominginformed about surrogacy, knowing that the surrogate mothers were well-screened,both medically and psychologically, and meeting other couples who hadsurrogate-born children, all contributed to a decision to move forward withsurrogacy. All felt that good mental health professionals were at the heartof the process. In addition, couples were reassured by the Center's full-serviceprogram which provided comprehensive legal, financial, and case managementof the arrangement. Q. How did your feelings about surrogacy change once you became involved? A. "Surprised" is the word most often used by couples to describetheir feelings about surrogacy once their child is born. They are surprisedby their feelings toward their surrogate mother. One wife, who helped delivertheir baby, said she felt an intense love and connection with the surrogate.Couples report that they knew would feel indebted to her, but they were surprisedat how much they learned from her and the high regard they felt for her asa person. One wife who was worried about the possible exploitative natureof surrogacy, was amazed to discover how many benefits the surrogate motherenjoyed, independent of the financial aspects. She watched her own surrogategrow in confidence, having managed and completed the surrogate process withsuch success. She also felt having the extra money was very empowering andallowed her to think more broadly regarding her life's choices. Another couplenoted that all parties had grown and changed, having learned a great dealfrom each other. Another common "surprise" reported by most couples was the desire to "letthe world know." They were intentionally open about the circumstances oftheir child's birth. Several couples also believed that people should be discouraged from pursuingsurrogacy on their own. There could be too many unanticipated twists andturns. They also felt strongly the need for some kind of legal guidelinesand regulation. There was a general concurrence that surrogacy was a synergistic experience.The process itself transformed participant's lives in many ways, enriching,empowering and enlightening all who took part. Return to CSP Home Page More than just one child... Family Building Solutions The Center For Surrogate Parenting salutes the ingenuity and determinationof its infertile couples who have decided to have more than one child. Thefollowing are examples of some unique family combinations created by ourclients using adoption, surrogacy and high-tech reproductive technology: Three children - one "homemade" child, one adopted child, onesurrogate-born child. Fraternal quadruplets, born through gestational surrogacy, from embryosplaced into two different surrogate mothers at the same time. One had triplets,the other a single baby. Twins, a boy and a girl, from the same egg retrieval, one embryo placedinto a gestational surrogate, the other embryo returned to the biologicalmother. One surrogate-born child and one child the result of an egg donated bythe same surrogate mother but carried by the infertile wife. Three surrogate-born children, two girls from the same surrogate mother,and a boy from a second surrogate. Two children a boy and a girl, born with the help of two differentgestational surrogate mothers. These parents will pass on a legacy of love, faith and courage totheir children. They have given a whole new meaning to the word "family." Return to CSP Home Page Center News-N-Notes One Way or Another ... The Center received a lovely thank you letter from a couple who hadjoined the Center's Gestational Surrogacy Program. Although the embryo transferinto their surrogate mother had not produced a pregnancy, the leftover embryostransferred back into the biological mother did! Congratulations Mom! Genetic Testing Genetic testing has become an integral part of the Center's screeningprocess. Dr. Ann Garber, a Certified Geneticist, has developed a genetichistory for completion by all participants in the Artificial InseminationSurrogacy and Egg Donation Programs. Dr. Garber reviews all completed historiesand provides a written assessment for each individual. Standardized STD Testing Working with Smith Kline Beecham Laboratories, the Center hasstandardized the testing of surrogates and couples for sexually transmitteddiseases. Special specimen packets have been developed for our clients totake to their own physicians, who perform the necessary tests and ship themto Smith Kline Labs. The results are then printed across a teleprinter directlyto the Center and evaluated by our Medical Coordinator. Israel, France, and Japan Once again the Center will submit for presentation at the 8th WorldCongress on IVF and Assisted Reproduction in Kyoto, Japan, its updated paper,"Success Rate of Surrogate Gestational Pregnancies UsingIn Vitro Fertilization Donor Oocytes" which they have previously presentedat the 6th and 7th World IVF Congresses in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Paris, France. Its A Small World! One of our clients tells a story about how her father, who was waitingfor a connecting flight in a Colorado airport in the middle of the night,happened to strike up a conversation with the only other person in the terminal,a woman also waiting for a flight. They began talking about their grandchildren.The woman's daughter had just given birth to her first granddaughter. Ourclient's father talked about his granddaughter and a new grandson that wouldbe born in a few months. Eventually, all the waiting and talking producedthe amazing revelation that all their respective grandchildren were conceivedwith the help of gestational surrogate mothers! Return to CSP Home Page Professional Update DES Patients Can Benefit from Gestational Surrogacy Dr. David Meldrum from the Center for Advanced Reproductive Carein Redondo Beach, California, reports in Fertility and Sterility, 54:287,1990, that physicians should be aware of the marked reduction of viable pregnancywith IVF in DES exposed women with uterine abnormalities other than a smalluterus. Rates were decreased to as low as one third of controls with T-shape,constrictions or irregular margins. Microfertilization Success Huntington Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California, under thedirection of Drs. Paulo Serafini and Joel Batzofin, has perfected two procedures,PZD (Partial Zone Drilling) and SUZI (Sub-Zonal Sperm Injection), which allowsthe management of previously untreatable male factor fertility. Their pregnancyrate is 35% for PZD and 43% for SUZI. As of August 1992, they have had ninelive births with thirteen pregnancies ongoing. Immunologic Response Treatment Achieves Pregnancy The Center is pleased to announce a pregnancy for a client followingimmunologic response treatment of their surrogate at the University of Utah.The client had attempted several inseminations with their surrogate beforedetermining that the surrogate had a negative percentage inhibition responseand no blocking activity on a mixed lymphocyte culture with the donor. Aftertwo months of treatment their surrogate became pregnant and subsequentlygave birth to a healthy baby boy. Egg Donation Success in Women Over Forty Drs. Jacobson, Galen and Weckstein of the Bay Area Fertility MedicalGroup in the San Francisco East Bay, report on the success of their egg donorprogram in recipients over forty.

As if the pain and grief of infertility weren't enough, most people strugglingwith childlessness are also saddled with massive medical bills. In response,RESOLVE has been working on passing mandated infertility medical coverage.So far, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, Arkansas, Californiaand Hawaii have passed legislation covering in vitro fertilization (IVF)and/or other infertility procedures. The very concreteness of these actions is bringing more men into theorganization. While RESOLVE has always been an organization for both menand women, women, in our culture seem to be more disposed to ask for andaccept help. Doing something, taking action - this seems to be a masculineway of coping. Indeed, all of us may feel that affecting change is a methodof gaining some control over one's life. What's more, one gets not only information at those late night advocacymeetings; the sharing of similar experiences provides emotional support forthe people who work together for a common goal. While RESOLVE's purpose was to advocate for expanded insurance coveragefor infertility-related procedures, we found that participation in this effortoften helped to meet the emotional needs as well as ease the financial burdenof the infertile community. RESOLVE is a national organization for over 20,000 people with 53 chaptersin forty states. Their mission is to support, educate and advocate aboutfertility issues and to assist the infertile person and/or couple to finda unique solution to the painful dilemma of infertility.

Return to CSP Home Page A Love Letter New Mom Writes to Her Surrogate Mother Dear Julia, By now, you know me pretty well. And you know that I can write on justabout any subject. But I feel as though there are no words to express whatyou have done for me and Gregory. Jamie is a miracle if ever there was one.He is the baby of my heart. The one I've always wanted and imagined. But,he wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. One year ago, I couldn't even look at a pregnant woman without feelingpain. I couldn't look into the window of a nursery furniture store or a babyclothiers store without wondering what I could have done to deserve suchpunishment. Every time there was a story about an infant abandoned or abused, I wantedto take that child and make it my own. I couldn't understand why someonewho had been so blessed could abuse that privilege. Now, after eight years of waiting, I am actually somebody's mommy. Youcan't imagine what it feels like to write those words. Every little thingJamie does is so precious to me. You gave what so few have the power to give. Not just an egg and a uterus.The care and concern for others to make being a surrogate mother worthwhile.How many people have the ability to make someone else's dream come true?That's just what you've been able to do. And you've done it with such openness,such selflessness, such pride. I hope that Jamie will inherit a little ofthat from you. Julia, I hope that you realize that with your strength, and your positiveattitude, you can do anything you set your mind to. I hope this experiencehas proven that to you. Soon, you will start a new life in Idaho. I know that you and Ken willmake it a fantastic success. I see your children, Alex and Seth, growingup in an atmosphere of wonderful values and plenty of love. They can't helpbut be successes, too. I know, too, that we will not continue to be as close as we've been. Andthat's probably only natural. But understand that I will be thinking of you.Jamie will know who you are as soon as he is old enough to understand. Andhe will be taught to love and respect you. Of course we'll keep in touchand keep you informed of his progress. And I hope you will let me know whatis new and exciting in your life, too. It's obvious how many people in your life think you are terrific and special.But, with the exception of Ken and the boys, no one will really know thefull extent of what you have done the way Gregory and I do. I don't know if I could feel any closer to you. Not if we were sisters.You've changed my life for the better and in the process I can see the positivethings you've done for yourself. No matter what else happens in the rest of your life, you have alreadydone more to prove you are a caring person than most people will ever beable to do. And I have the baby to prove it. I love you, Julia. And, I always will. Caroline Return to CSP Home Page Book Review Birth Power: The Case for Surrogacy by Carmel Shalev.201 pp. New Haven Yale University Press, 1989. Carmel Shalev, an attorney educated at Yale University and living in TelAviv, writes, "just as men have the right to be compensated for their sperm,so should women have the right to be compensated for their reproductive servicesand become surrogate mothers." This is the thesis of Ms. Shalev's "BirthPower," which explores the social and legal issues raised by combining impersonalreproductive technologies with increasingly varied challenges to the traditionalfamily. Looking ahead, she maintains that surrogacy contracts should be legaland binding. She contends that legalizing surrogacy would empower, not enslavewomen. This is a provocative and insightful book, raising fundamental questionswhich Ms. Shalev cannot always answer. Return to CSP Home Page The Endometriosis Association An Important Resource The Endometriosis Association is a non-profit organization that, for thepast ten years, has been dedicated to providing information and assistanceto those suffering from the disease, as well as to researchers and doctorsstudying its relationship to infertility. Endometriosis is a disease of women in their reproductive years in whichtissue similar to the lining of the uterus is found growing outside of theuterus. Endometriosis affects 5-1/2 million women in North America, causinginfertility in 30-40% of the cases. It often causes pain and scarring, resultingin blocked tubes and adhesions. But researchers now believe that there maybe inflammatory and immunological changes that occur as well which may causeinfertility in endometriosis patients. The Endometriosis Association provides support services on a group, individualand crisis basis, an education program through their newsletters, videotapes,and written information, and a research program which includes the largestendometriosis registry in the world. For further information, call1-800-992-3636, or write to the Endometriosis Association, 8585 North 76thPlace, Milwaukee, WI 53223. The Center has assisted couples suffering fromendometriosis to have children, through both its Traditional Surrogate Programas well as its IVF/Host Surrogate Program. Return to CSP Home Page Issues and Inquiries After the Birth by Dr. Hilary Hanafin,Ph.D. Psychologist, Center for Surrogate Parenting Q. What feelings do surrogate mothers experience after the birth? A. Feelings after the birth are unique for each woman andare reflective of their individual experience. On the positive side, themost commonly reported feelings include relief from the physical drain ofpregnancy and the emotional strain of preparing for the birth and separation.Surrogates also report a feeling of relief to recover their own lives andget on with the business of living. Other postpartum feelings include a senseof pride for having made a childless couple's dream come true, and accomplishmentin having achieved such a challenging goal. A good surrogate program shouldleave a surrogate feeling fulfilled, resolved and satisfied. She should feelthat she has personally benefited from the experience. In follow-up studies,surrogate mothers report a greater appreciation of their family, an enrichmentof their lives, and an increase in self confidence. Of course, every surrogate experience has some negative postpartum feelingsas well. The two pervasive ones are: the loss of the pregnancy itself (whichfor some surrogates may be their last), and the other is the loss of theinfertile couple. After the birth, the open, warm and caring relationshipundergoes a change, and the loss of the attention and specialness is keenlyfelt. After the birth, negative feelings can also be triggered if a surrogatehas some painful, unresolved history. The surrogates reported a range of feelings about their birthchildren.Very often, their attachment is reportedly greater to the couple than tothe baby. Commonly, her perception is that the child is "their child", bothmorally and existentially; the child would not have come into being if itwere not for this particular couple's love and desire. Surrogates describefeelings of love, care, interest and joy toward the child, but report thattheir feelings are different from those they experienced with their own children.A curiosity about the child remains and a sense of caring and moral obligationusually continues. However, typically surrogates have reported an absenceof long-term grieving over the loss of the child. A primary variable in the surrogate's feelings is the infertile couple'streatment of her during the pregnancy, the hospital birth and directlyafterwards. A woman's grief is greatly intensified if she feels abandoned,rejected or used by the parents. Her separation is greatly eased and facilitatedif she feels respected, trusted and appreciated. The new parents' behaviorcan have a tremendous influence on their surrogate mother's long-term feelingsabout herself and her participation. Return to CSP Home Page In a Family Way Increasingly, family members are helping each other to solve the painfuldilemma of childlessness. The Center has assisted many couples with the legaland psychological issues which may arise when working with a family member.The Center reports involvement in a wide variety of situations: a sisterbeing a surrogate via artificial insemination for her sister, a sister-in-lawcarrying the embryo of her brother and his wife, and a twin sister donatingeggs. Third-party reproduction within a family presents a unique psychologicalsituation in which professional counseling is essential; one cannot simplywalk away from family if problems arise - it is a lifetime involvement. Someof the psychological issues to consider are who, what, when and how to tellextended family members. It is also important for them to understand theirown family history together prior to conception and how the birth of theintended child may affect their future relationship. Legal issues must be addressed as well, including resolution of the legalstatus of the child. In the case of egg or sperm donor, the woman givingbirth from a donated egg is the legal mother, as is the husband in the caseof sperm donor. In the case of surrogacy via artificial insemination, astep-parent adoption must be completed in which the wife adopts her husband'schild. In the case of IVF/Host surrogacy (in which the embryo is producedby the infertile couple), an attorney may petition the courts to enter thegenetic parents names on the birth certificate, thereby eliminating the needfor a step-parent adoption. Other legal issues needing attention might includethe drafting of a contract or agreement to meet the needs and expectationsof all parties. The Center for Surrogate Parenting can advise coupleson where to seek assistance as well as provide guidance to families consideringthird-party reproduction. Return to CSP Home Page Center News-N-Notes Birth of Egg Donor Twins The Center congratulates both recipient and donor in the birth thisMarch of twin girls. Working in conjunction with our Center, Dr. Paulo Serafiniof Huntington Memorial Hospital Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California,helped perform this medical miracle. The donor, who lives in Southern California,was previously a surrogate mother in the Center's Surrogate Program. Whenasked about her experience, she laughed, "it was the easiest way I ever helpedbring twins into the world." Her couple called her from the hospital afterthe birth to share their joy. She noted that they were planning to implantthe two frozen embryos (remaining from the initial egg retrieval) sometimeearly in 1991. New Reproductive Center Dr. Ricardo Asch, Director of the Center for Reproductive Healthin Orange, California, will be completing his new facility this summer. Itwill include a full, in-office operating suite to facilitate egg retrievaland implantation. Dr. Asch has been an integral part of the Center's EggDonor Program, and has assisted many of our clients. International Surrogacy The Center reports working with many international clients. So far,our surrogate mothers are helping to create families for couples living inItaly, England, France, Denmark, Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, New Guinea,Hong Kong, Argentina, Venezuela, Singapore, Guatemala, Nigeria and Taiwan. Center Adds Nurse to Staff We are pleased to introduce Amy Grant Rivera, R.N., who has justjoined our team. Amy is a registered nurse with 10 years experience. Shegraduated with a B.S.N. from The Catholic University of America in 1980.She has most recently worked at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in LosAngeles, delivering IVF babies conceived with the help of Dr. Richard Marrs.Amy will act as medical liaison with our infertile couples, surrogate mothersand physicians. Worlds First Frozen Embryo Birth via Surrogacy Beginning life as an embryo frozen in the blastocyst stage, a babygirl was born this March to a gestational surrogate mother in the Center'sprogram. Dr. Richard Marrs, of the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in LosAngeles, performed the initial egg retrieval, which did not produce a pregnancywhen used in a fresh transfer, but did succeed in the subsequent frozen attempt.Mother and surrogate mother are still amazed and doing well after a routinedelivery. Operator Assistance Since we do not advertise for clients, a routine question asked ofour prospective parents is "how did you hear about The Center?" Many replythat we are on RESOLVE's referral list, or that various gynecologists, IVFclinics, or university teaching hospitals refer them - but our favorite wasthe couple who found us by calling the wrong number. Upon discovering wewere not the credit department of Sears, they proceeded to ask who in factwe were. And the rest is history, including their family's newest member,little Lillianne.

The sensational publicity surrounding a handful of surrogacy cases ("BabyM" in particular) should not overshadow the fact that there have been anestimated 1,500 successful surrogate births. A professional program thatmatches infertile couples with carefully screened and counseled surrogatemothers is newsworthy only to the participants. Understandably, media ignoresthe quiet, consistent successes in favor of sensational controversy. The application of advanced reproductive technologies such as IVF, GIFT,ZIFT and embryo freezing to the field of surrogacy is new opportunities forchildless couples who have refused to give up the dream of someday havinga family. It is perhaps the American spirit of never saying never nor acceptinga situation as hopeless which is responsible for keeping the United Statesat the forefront of applied reproductive technology. Return to CSP Home Page Federal Trade Commission Role in Protection of IVFConsumer We have recently had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Michael Katz,Supervisory Investigator with the Division of Service Industry Practicesfor the Federal Trade Commission. The recent proliferation of IVF clinics, including some that are suspectedof making deceptive claims, has prompted action by the FTC. Mr. Katz reportsthat there are approximately 200 clinics in the United States, a 25% increaseover 1987. Thus far, the FTC has asked 25 of them to substantiate and clarifytheir publicized "success rates." For example, the FTC has asked clinicsto differentiate between chemical pregnancies, clinical pregnancies, andthe "take home baby rate." We are impressed with the FTC's involvement in the policing of fraud againstinfertile couples. Their monitoring of the IVF community is of great potentialbenefit to the infertile couple. Besides taking legal action and imposingpenalties for fraud, the FTC hopes to eventually provide a consumer guideto assist patients in choosing IVF clinics and understanding their statistics. Return to CSP Home Page World's First ZIFT Birth An important milestone was reached in May of this year with the birthof a healthy baby boy conceived by ZIFT (Zygote IntraFallopian Transfer),an innovative procedure. This major event occurred at the Hospital of theGood Samaritan in Los Angeles under the direction of Dr. Richard Marrs, workingin conjunction with our Center. In the ZIFT process, the infertile couple produces their own embryos throughin vitro fertilization. By means of a laparoscopy, the newly fertilized embryos(rather than simply the sperm and egg as is done in GIFT) are placed intothe fallopian tubes of a surrogate gestational mother, whose cycle has beensynchronized with the donor mother's cycle. The Center provided the professional components for all parties involvedin this technological miracle, including selecting and screening the surrogatemother, as well as coordination of all legal, psychological and medical aspectsof the surrogate process. Return to CSP Home Page Issues and Inquiries Frequently Asked Questions About Surrogate Parenting Q. What motivates a woman to become a surrogate mother? A. According to studies conducted by psychologistDr. Hilary Hanafin, a recognized authority on surrogacyand adoption who has interviewed over 500 surrogate mother candidates inthe last six years, major motivations are: enjoyment of the pregnant stateand the desire to be pregnant again. These women uniformly describe theirprevious pregnancies as relatively easy. Being pregnant provides an opportunityto feel special and to experience a sense of wholeness. They also have empathyfor childless couples, an empathy increased by prior contact with an infertilecouple's pain and by the importance of children in their own lives. A thirdreason was the desire to do something remarkable with their lives and tomake a unique contribution. Many perceive being a surrogate as providinga sense of accomplishment. Financial gain is not the primary factor. Q. What is the legal status of surrogate parenting in the U. S.? A. Surrogate parenting has become a states' issue, with individualstates differing in their legal approach to surrogacy. Florida makes it illegalto pay a surrogate anything other than expenses. Louisiana, Michigan, andNew Jersey have declared surrogate contracts unenforceable, while statessuch as Nevada and Arkansas have declared surrogacy legal and contractsspecifically enforceable. The majority of states, including California, haveyet to pass laws on surrogacy. However, surrogacy continues to flourish here,with the complete cooperation of the courts, and the state Department ofAdoptions. The Center for Surrogate Parenting welcomes questions regarding any aspectof the surrogate parenting process. Return to CSP Home Page Family Planning ThroughPerseverence A personal story from a couple experiencing the IVF/HOSTsurrogate process. It was sunny and I was able to sit out on our deck while I waited nervouslyfor the phone call from California. Maureen, the nurse coordinator from theIVF team would be calling with the results of the pregnancy test. When thephone finally rang, I was so nervous that I found it hard to breathe as Ianswered. Would the miracles of modern science allow us nature's miracle:a child'? My husband and I began this journey in 1981, little knowing how difficultand emotionally draining it would be. Like all parent-hopefuls, we were veryoptimistic about conceiving in short order. Three, six, twelve months- andpages of temperature charts later- my period kept coming with painful regularity. Over time, five top-notch fertility specialists examined, counseled, operatedon and treated me. No one had an explanation, just the label "idiopathicinfertility." Under various doctors' directions, I tried treatments almostrandomly. Drugs first; clomid to stimulate ovulation, progesterone to beefup endometrium, and parlodel, which sometimes is effective in cases ofunexplained infertility. Next we tried artificial insemination several timesa month for four months. I joined the waiting list for our local in vitrofertilization program (IVF) which had just been opened up to "unexplained"infertility patients. Every month that went by was agony. I wanted a baby. I needed a baby.If nothing else, I had to know that someday there would be a baby. We signedup with the government's adoption program but the waiting period was projectedto be four to five years and, because of an age limit, it was unlikely that,in the end, we would be permitted to adopt a child. Some couples say they will only go through IVF once - the emotional andfinancial consequences of failure are too painful. It didn't work for usthat first time in June, 1985. But I was determined to persevere. Feelingthat I absolutely had to keep trying has carried me through more surgicalprotocols than I care to add up. Once, twice, three more times with no success. I think we first heard about surrogates in 1985 and kept the idea in theback of our minds. With our IVF experience, and knowing that we could produceapparently viable embryos, we contemplated how marvelous it might be to conceivea child of our own and have the embryo carried by a surrogate mother. Whenthe news broke about an Ohio medical team having done this, we were thrilled.If our attempts continued to fail, there might still be a way for us to haveour own child. I feel very lucky when I consider the dramatic changes in options forinfertile couples that have arisen in the past ten years. Bless the researcherswho were brave enough to extend IVF studies from animals to humans. And blessthe medical teams who were brave enough to extend the technology of embryotransfer to surrogate mothers. After another failed IVF attempt in July, 1987, we felt that it was timeto earnestly pursue surrogacy. We joined a comprehensive program at the Centerfor Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills, California. We were matched withfour possible surrogates before biology cooperated enough to give us a shotat a successful IVF attempt. Toward these four women I feel a strange mixtureof gratitude and awe; they can get pregnant! They have easy pregnancies.They want to help me! They are willing to go through all the trials andtribulations of pregnancy and birth so that I, too, can be a mother. After having had eggs retrieved surgically seven times and completingfive embryo transfer procedures, I was willing to try one last time. Butthis time, I was counting on the miracle of someone else's body to make itall worthwhile. The day before the results came back, I hit rock bottom.I was sure it hadn't worked, and my emotional turmoil was so great that,for the first time, I vowed I would not do it again. I experienced a briefperiod of emotional limbo when the results of the first blood test showedlow levels of HCG (the pregnancy hormone). There was a chance that it hadworked! False hopes; it had been a transient, terminated pregnancy. The medicalworld has a name for it "chemical pregnancy." Only in the world of infertilitycan this be considered "progress." Despite vowing "never again," my emotional strength did rebound, or ratherstubbornness and resigned determination carried the day. There would be ONEmore time. I needed to try that one more time as soon as possible. With a somewhatgreater degree of medical intervention, we were able to try to simultaneouslyachieve pregnancies with two new surrogates in June. Both tried so hard tomake it work for us. Again, the day before the results were due, I was bothparalyzed with fear and overcome with gratitude that someone else - a surrogate- was trying to share my emotional burden and help me try to become a mother. Just as I answered the phone, my husband arrived home to provide moralsupport. Walking towards the deck, he saw me talking on the phone with Maureen,tears pouring down my cheeks. He didn't say a word as he came towards me,feeling that inexpressible wave of crushing disappointment once again. Ifinally managed to sob out Maureen's first words to me: "Do you have anychampagne?". His tears came as fast and furiously as had mine. With thosewords, an emotional burden built on six long years of agony, frustrationand tears began to lift. We are finally expecting a child. Return to CSP Home Page Community Infertility News Egg Donor Program The Center is pleased to announce the first twin egg donor pregnancyunder its new comprehensive Egg Donor Program. The program allows women whocannot produce viable eggs, but can carry a pregnancy, to utilize donor eggsfor in vitro fertilization. Since the recipient mother gives birth, she isconsidered the legal and natural mother of the child. Unique Reproductive Center The Huntington Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California is oneof the few facilities worldwide which combine full-time female and maleinfertility specialists in a comprehensive program. The team approach ofDrs. Paulo Serafini, Joel Batzofin, William Blank and Gary Hubert combinestheir expertise in IVF/ET, GIFT, ZIFT, IUI, and EARS (electrically assistedrecovery of sperm) to help a reported 44% of all their patients take homea child. Long Distance IVF Surrogacy Dr. Jirair Konialian of Granada Hills, California has achieved aviable pregnancy with an infertile British couple and an IVF/Host surrogatemother in the Center's program. Working in conjunction with Century CityHospital in Los Angeles, Dr. Konialian coordinated the synchronization ofboth women's cycles via FAX, letter and telephone. The entire process, includingthe aspiration of eggs, was filmed as part of a British documentary series,"The Human Factor," scheduled to air this Fall. Return to CSP Home Page First British Surrogate Mother Investigates Surrogacyin the U. S. Kim Cotton Visits the Center for Surrogate Parenting Kim Cotton, Britain's first financially compensated surrogate mother whowas the focus of British media attention in 1985, spent a week this summerat the Center recounting her experiences as a surrogate and learning aboutthe Center's protocols, safeguards and group support approach to surrogacy. Both professional surrogacy and private adoption are illegal in Britain.With the help of Gena Dodd, who herself had a surrogate-born son, Kim foundedCOTS (Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy), a volunteer organizationwhich helps put infertile couples and potential surrogate mothers in contactwith each other, as well as providing a psychological support system forsurrogates currently pregnant. They are in their second year of operationand have 165 members, hold an annual General Meeting, and publish a quarterlynewsletter. Mrs. Cotton frequently lectures on surrogacy at universitiesand has provided testimony for various ethical committees, including theBritish Medical Association (who have yet to report). Upon her return to England, Kim Cotton reported in the latest COTS newsletter,"The Center for Surrogate Parenting in California is, in my opinion, surrogacyrun to absolute perfection... It is regarding the surrogate mothers wherethe agency really shines ... she is closely monitored and supported throughoutthe whole procedure... You will never meet a girl until she has passed themedical and the psychological screening ... I sat through a surrogate interviewwith her husband and child present. I compared notes with Hilary Hanafin(the Center's psychologist) afterwards ... I thought she was ideal, but Dr.Hanafin had reservations ... The chances are extremely high that you willbring home a child of your own without difficulty and with the knowledgeyour surrogate will be looked after, long after you have gone home ... Tosum it up, if you want Host/IVF surrogacy, definitely go to Los Angeles -if you want AI surrogacy (artificial insemination), again definitely L.A.! Return to CSP Home Page Medical First: Surrogate Mother Pregnant withFrozen Embryo The world's first frozen embryo pregnancy with a surrogate mother wasachieved at our Center this June, working in conjunction with Dr. RichardMarrs at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. This medical first marks the beginning of the Center's Frozen Embryo Program,whereby infertile couples who are able to create embryos may retrieve themat their own IVF clinics and subsequently ship the frozen embryos to LosAngeles for implantation into host uteri. In other cases, it may be appropriatefor the surrogate to travel to the prospective parents' home town for theimplantation. For couples living a great distance from southern California, the FrozenEmbryo Program offers the opportunity to create a genetically related childwithout the cost and time expenditures of previous methodologies.

The medical proceduresreported were conducted by: Jirair Konialian, M. D., Century City Hospital,Los Angeles, CA; Jaroslav Marik, M.D., Beverly Hills Medical Center, BeverlyHills, CA; Richard Marrs, M.D., Hospital of the Good Samaritan, Los Angeles,CA. The Sample The sample consisted of twenty-two infertile couples who came to the Centerfor Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills, California. All participants inthis sample had comprehensive medical and psychological screening and counseling,as well as full medical and legal informed consent. The Results The pregnancy rate for this sample group is 32% per transfer. The "takehome baby" rate is 25.8%. Overall, of the 22 couples attempting to end theirchildlessness, thus far eight of them will take home a baby, resulting ina 27.5%, success rate for the couples in the sample.

Success rates for IVF when used in conjunction with ahealthy fertile, gestational surrogate mother during her unstimulated, naturalcycle, is over three times greater than in traditional IVF programs. Thisinformation will be more thoroughly presented by the Center for SurrogateParenting to the World Congress in In-Vitro Fertilization in Jerusalem onApril 2-7, 1989, in a keynote speech by Center Director,Attorney William Handel. Mr. Handel, on behalf of the Center's clients, has successfully petitionedthe California Superior Court to declare the biological parents of the childcarried by a gestational surrogate to be the natural and legal parents oftheir baby. While the surrogate bears the child for the biological parents,the parents' names appear on the birth certificate as the mother and fatherof the child. Thus the need for any adoption procedures is eliminated. Because of the expanded possibilities and greater chances for conception,a growing number of in-vitro fertilization clinics, as well as individualphysicians, have requested the help and participation of the Center for SurrogateParenting in providing all non-medical components for theirHost Surrogate Programs. These professional servicesinclude finding, screening, counseling and matching of IVF/host surrogates,providing the contractual agreements and administration of trust funds. Return to CSP Home Page New Comprehensive Egg Donor ProgramOffered Many couples who are considering surrogate parenting may now be candidatesfor a comprehensive Egg Donor Program offered by theCenter for Surrogate Parenting. Egg donation enables a select portion ofthe infertile community to take advantage of new reproductive technologies.Women who can carry a pregnancy but who cannot produce viable eggs (or whoseeggs carry a genetic defect) can conceive through the In-Vitro Fertilizationprocess with donor eggs and bear a child. No adoption is necessary as thewoman who gives birth is considered the legal and natural mother. In the past, egg donor programs have relied on IVF patients (who are infertileto begin with) to donate excess eggs to infertile couples on a random basis.Until now, there has never been a formal program that specifically solicited,screened and matched egg donors with prospective recipients, as well ascoordinating all legal, psychological and administrative functions. The Centerreports that there is no wait for the many carefully screened egg donorswho are available to assist an infertile couple. Return to CSP Home Page Legal Status of Surrogacy inCalifornia We are pleased to report that California still remains one of the mostenlightened states in its attitude towards surrogate parenting. The Californiacourts, the Department of Adoptions and the enforcement agencies throughoutthe state have consistently cooperated with us and facilitated the surrogateprocess. The Petition for Adoption (stepparent), Judgment of Paternity andJudgment of Genetic Parenthood have been accomplished smoothly in concertwith courts and state agencies. In early 1989, a legislative task force was formed to study surrogateparenting and recommend legislation that would protect all parties involved.The Center for Surrogate Parenting has been asked to provide model legislationfor the task force to study, thus establishing California as one of the firststates to consider enlightened and comprehensive surrogate legislation. Return to CSP Home Page OPTS: The Organization for Parenting ThroughSurrogacy OPTS is a non-profit, national volunteer organization based in Los Angeles,founded in 1988 by parents whose children were born through surrogacy orby other birth methods. OPTS advocates, supports and protects the birth rightsof all children. OPTS actively seeks to keep open the options made availableby the new reproductive technologies to infertile couples. Kathe Linden,founder and spokesperson for OPTS, has appeared on numerous occasions beforethe California State Legislature as an expert witness, representing the viewsand concerns of infertile couples. OPTS also acts as a resource for information about surrogacy. A primaryobjective is to facilitate the exchange of information between couples justbeginning to explore the process with couples who have already had a childthrough surrogacy. Return to CSP Home Page Research Pays Off for InfertileCouple The Center for Surrogate Parenting, with the help of an infertile couplein its program, has pioneered the recent development and use of TEST YOLKBUFFER for fresh semen shipping. This enables a husband to collect a semenspecimen at home and ship overnight (via Federal Express or other next-daycourier service) to the inseminating physician's office for a next dayinsemination - without freezing or even refrigerating the sample. Not only is damage from freezing eliminated, but the Test Yolk can actuallyimprove the sperm's ability to penetrate the egg. Unlike frozen sperm, semenshipped in Test Yolk Buffer can be manipulated as if it were a fresh sample;for example, it can be washed for intrauterine inseminations, if necessary. In addition to the superior quality of semen in Test Yolk Buffer, thetime and costs involved in inseminations for our out-of-town clients aredramatically less than for frozen sperm. The Center's infertile couple whodid extensive research of their own on Test Yolk Buffer (since he was usingit himself), greatly contributed to the development of its use in our program.We are delighted to announce that their research has proved fruitful andthey are currently expecting their first child. Return to CSP Home Page NASM: National Association of SurrogateMothers The National Association of Surrogate Mothers (NASM) represents the viewsof the vast majority of surrogate mothers in the United States who feel verypositively about their participation in a surrogate mother program and stronglybelieve that it is their constitutional right to create a child for an infertilecouple. Beginning in 1987, Ms. Jan Sutton, R.N. president of NASM, and severalother members of the National Association of Surrogate Mothers visited statelegislatures throughout the United States, appearing as expert witnessesand disseminating information, advice, and experience in the area of surrogateparenting from the surrogate's perspective. The philosophy of the National Association of Surrogate Mothers is thatsurrogate parenting is a viable option for infertile couples and that thepractice must be regulated and controlled. The safeguards must be strictand rigorous, and the professionals involved must be well trained, conscientious,and at all times be held accountable. With the safeguards in place, surrogacynot only is an option that should be available to infertile couples, butit also has been an extremely successful method of creating a family. Return to CSP Home Page Center Notes The Center for Surrogate Parenting is pleased to announce its tenth pregnancyin the IVF/Host Surrogate Program, including one set of twins born in December1988. We concluded 1988 with a total of 83 births. The year 1989 promises arecord number of deliveries in our traditional, non-IVF program (we have18 pregnancies in progress), as well as our IVF/Host Surrogate Program andthe new Egg Donor Program. In 1988-89, under the direction of Dr. HilaryHanafin, the Center participated in five separate, independent studieson the various aspects of surrogate parenting, acting as a general resourceand providing statistics as well as professional opinions and recommendations.These five studies are providing interesting insights and will be publishedlater this year. In 1987-88, The Center for Surrogate Parenting was joined by three newmembers. Elizabeth Tilles, Program Coordinator at the Center, has had a childdelivered by a surrogate mother as well as personally having struggled throughthe infertility maze including IVF. Carol Sanchez has joined us to work asa psychotherapist with Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D. Ms. Sanchez has a degree inMarriage, Family and Child counseling and is a former surrogate mother candidatewith our program. Janice Paur, our Administrator, struggled for years withinfertility herself, and with the help of a specialist, is happy to reportthat she is now the mother of three sons. We invite inquires from anyone wishing to have any information of surrogateparenting or using the Center as a resource regarding various aspects ofinfertility. Return to CSP Home Page Community Infertility News ZIFT pregnancies Dr. Richard Marrs of Los Angeles (Hospital of the Good Samaritan)reports that he has achieved two successful ZIFT (zygote intra fallopiantransfer) pregnancies (out of four attempts) with Host Surrogate Mothersfrom the Center's program. In addition, through his own programs, the traditionalIVF process, Dr. Marrs has achieved five pregnancies using frozen embryos. IVF/Host Surrogate Mothers success rates Dr. Jirair Konialian of Granada Hills Medical Group (Century CityHospital) reports one of the highest success rates utilizing the IVF/Surrogateprocess. Dr. Konialian also notes that preliminary statistics from throughoutthe U.S. on IVF/Surrogate procedures indicate that these success rates arenot aberrational. ZIFT without surgery Using specially developed instruments, Dr. Ricardo Asch (Universityof California, Irvine) has achieved a viable pregnancy by performing anultrasound guided low-tubal transfer of an embryo to the fallopian tube. Retrospective study Dr. Jaroslav Marik (Los Angeles) is doing a retrospective study basedon thirteen years of work in the field of surrogate parenting, in bothtraditional (AI) and IVF/Host surrogacy. Return to CSP Home Page Surrogate Parenting Reassessing HumanBonds By Hilary Hanafin,Ph.D. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY CONDUCTEDON SURROGATE MOTHERS AND COUPLES WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE SURROGATE PROCESS.IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION CONVENTION NEWYORK ON AUGUST 28, 1987. This study included follow-up surveys that were mailed to surrogate motherswho had relinquished a child and to couples who had received a child throughthe surrogate process. The survey consisted of 25 questions, both short answerand likert scale, that addressed their reactions to and thoughts about theirsurrogacy experience. A questionnaire was mailed to the 37 sets of adoptiveparents who had received children from these surrogate mothers. Of the adoptivecouples, 16 responded. The infertile couples reported very little emotional discomfort due totheir having worked with a surrogate mother. Of the 16 couples, three reportedstress and discomfort concerning the artificial insemination process andanxiety regarding achieving a conception, and three others reported thatthey had wished they had been more involved with the pregnancy. The infertilecouples consistently reported that the child's genetic connection to onlyone parent had very little influence on how they related to closeness andunderstanding because of their genetic relation to the child. All of thecouples reported that they perceived the child as theirs, not as the surrogate'sor a child they feel is shared with the surrogate. It could be hypothesizedthat the surrogate's and couples' shared perception that the child is thecouple's helps to minimize discomfort. Both surrogates and couples reported that they felt they had sufficientcontact with the other party. The twenty surrogates who responded all hadpost-partem contact through the child's first birthday. Of the nine surrogatesfor whom over two years or more has passed, all but one had contact throughthe second year. Typically, the adoptive parents sent cards and photos atChristmas and/or the child's birthday. Fourteen of the surrogates whoparticipated in the study reported that they had met face-to-face with thecouple and child at least once after saying good-bye at the hospital. Onlyone couple reported any degree of fear that the surrogate will make uninvitedcontact. Within this group of adoptive parents, 15 couples stated that theyplan to tell the child of its adoption, and one couple was uncertain as towhat they would do. The infertile couples and the surrogate mothers seemed to agree on severalpoints in this follow-up survey. None of the couples of the surrogate mothersregretted their decision to participate in the program. Additionally, theyboth reported that knowing each other was beneficial to their experience.In the surrogate's reports, as well as in the couple's reports, the appreciation,warmth, sharing, and knowledge of each other were helpful in making theexperience meaningful and enabled the surrogate to more easily relinquishthe child. They also predicted that knowing each other benefited the childreninvolved. For instance, both sample groups felt that surrogate mothers shouldhave a psychological evaluation prior to participation in such a program. This study suggests that contact between the individuals and the familieswho have come together to create this child should be open. The contact appearsto provide a positive and communicative environment for all participants.Furthermore, the open relationship helps to minimize secrecy and denial whichare detrimental to the children.

Surrogate Parenting Reassessing Human Bonding Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D. Center for Surrogate Parenting Beverly Hills, California Mental health professionals are being confronted by the new forms ofreproductive technology. Specifically, the surrogate mother, herself, challengesmany of our assumptions about human behavior. In this new arena psychologistshave had to question personal and theoretical beliefs regarding bonding,attachment, loss, pregnancy and family. We are being called upon to collectdata, predict behavior, and counsel participants in the varying options availableto creating families. In an attempt to understand behavior and the effects of surrogate parenting,two studies were conducted. They explored the perceptions of women volunteeringto serve as both the gestational and biological mother to the purpose ofrelinquishing their parenting rights to an infertile couple. The first of the studies included 89 surrogates who were participatingin a surrogate mother program in the Los Angeles area. The program's staffpsychologist collected demographic information and statements regarding theirmotivations to be a surrogate during an interview. The MMPI was also collectedand 376 items were used. The second of these studies included follow-up surveyswhich were mailed to surrogate mothers who had relinquished a child and toadoptive couples who had received a child through the surrogate process.The survey consisted of 25 questions, both short answer and likert scale,that addressed their reactions to and thoughts about their surrogacy experience. Return to CSP Home Page Surrogate Mother Profile The demographics of the 89 surrogate mothers can be summarized as follows.The women had a mean age of 28 years and a mean of 2.0 children. The meannumber of years of formal education was 13. A ratio of five to one of thewomen were anglo. Of the sample, four to one were currently married and threeto one had full-time employment. The vast majority of the sample had beenraised in a Christian faith, with 25% being Catholic. The Black and Asianpopulation and the Jewish heritage were nearly absent from this sample. Abortion and adoption occurred in the histories of the sample. Only threeparticipants had adoption as part of their history. Of these, one was adopted,one had placed a child for adoption, and one had siblings who were adopted.Of the surrogate mother sample, 37% had abortion in their history. Thirteenpercent of the women had had more than one abortion. For some, unresolvedfeelings regarding these terminations were a factor in their desire to bea surrogate. The motivations to become a surrogate mother are summarized in table one.Enjoyment of the pregnant state and the desire to be pregnant again werecited by the vast majority of surrogate mothers. These women uniformly describedtheir previous pregnancies as relatively easy. Being pregnant seemed to providean opportunity to feel special and to feel a sense of wholeness. They alsofelt empathy for childless couples, an empathy increased by prior contactwith an infertile couple's pain and by the importance of children in theirown lives. A third motivation was the desire to do something remarkable withtheir lives and make a unique contribution. Many perceived being a surrogateas providing a sense of accomplishment. Financial gain was also cited butconsistently was not the primary motivating factor. The surrogates describedthe fee as becoming less important as their relationship with the adoptivecouple increased. Of the participants, 12% indicated that being a surrogatemother was an attempt to compensate for a prior loss in their history. Themost obvious examples were the surrogates who earlier had voluntarily terminateda pregnancy and believed that creating a child for someone else may helpthem resolve feelings regarding the termination. The mean scores and ranges of the MMPI are presented in figure 1. Theprofiles were typically unremarkable with most scores falling within onestandard deviation of the midline. Only 7.9% of the surrogate mothers hada clinical score above the 70th percentile. Overall, 2.3% had two clinicalscores elevated above the 70th percentile. Of the clinical scores, scale1 had the lowest mean. Scale 0 had the widest range of the clinical scores,from the 30th percentile to the 78th percentile. The correction scale wasespecially notable and overall was the most elevated scale. Furthermore,73.9% of the profiles had a F-K score of -11 or less. Because the MMPI wastaken during the women's screening process for acceptance into the programthe K score and the F-K score might be interpreted as the surrogate mothers'tendency to be guarded and/or deny emotions in the hopes of making a goodimpression. The individual MMPI profiles revealed no critical pattern typical forthis sample. Elevations of scales 1, 2, 8, 7 were notably absent from theprofiles. Scales 0, 6, 9, 4 and 5 were more present but were not significantlyelevated. In summary, it can be stated that surrogate mothers of this sampledo not exhibit pathology according to the MMPI. However, given the limitations of this measure, we must use other instrumentsand techniques to understand the dynamics of the women who choose to be surrogatemothers. Extensive clinical interviews and participation in support groupmeetings, and additional tests are valuable tools in assessing surrogates.It is important to explore both conscious and unconscious motivations soto assess whether being a surrogate serves as a functional or dysfunctionalpurpose for the participant and her family. Thorough assessment will preventcollusion with pathology, exploitation, or unhealthy degrees of denial. Return to CSP Home Page Follow-up Study Of the participants in the study described above, 37 have relinquishedthe child to the adoptive parents and are at least 10 months post-partum.Follow-up questionnaires were mailed to 37 surrogates, 20 of whom responded.A similar follow-up questionnaire was mailed to the 37 sets of adoptive parentswho had received children from these surrogate mothers. Of the adoptive couples,16 responded. The responses are summarized in table two. The 20 surrogates who responded to the questionnaire ranged from 10 monthsto 3 years post-partum. Their emotional adjustment since the relinquishmentof the child demonstrates two components. The first component being feelingsreported for approximately two weeks after birth. Four of the surrogate mothersreported post-partum blues. Two of them mentioned longer term concerns. Oneexpressed concern about her daughter's adjustment to the relinquishment ofthe child and the other expressed a concern about what the child might feeltoward the surrogate in the future. Secondly, surrogates reported missingthe contact with the adoptive parents and their special role as a surrogatemother. some surrogates grieved the loss of pregnancy itself because it wasexpected to be their last pregnancy. Additionally, several surrogates reportedthat convincing others that she felt at peace with the relinquishment causedperiodic frustration. The questioning ad doubts expressed by some friends,family, and acquaintances as to why she was not noticeably grieving werebothersome. Grieving over the separation from the child was notably absent. The attachmentwas most often greater to the couple than to the child. The surrogates'perception that it was always "their child" is often based on the fact thatthe child would not have come into being if it were not for the particularcouple's desire. the belief that the baby; was always the couple's childminimized feelings of loss. Surrogates consistently described their feelingsof attachment for this child as different than their feelings for their otherchildren. Affection and care was expressed, but the bonding was describedas similar to attachment for a friend's or relative's child. All of the surrogates reported positive feelings since the birth of thechild. These included feeling satisfied, fulfilled, resolved, and betterabout themselves. All felt surrogacy was beneficial for themselves. Fivereported an increase in confidence and an enrichment of their lives. Anothernine reported a stronger marriage and greater appreciation of family andchildren. Five to two of the respondents were able to articulate a clearpositive influence on their lives by being a surrogate mother -- for example,increased marital communication, being inspired to pursue further educationand increased individuation from extended family. They also reported thattheir immediate family had adjusted better than their extended family. When the surrogates thought of the child they reported thinking mostlyof the adoptive couple's happiness. They also expressed curiosity at howthe child looks and how he or she has developed. Of the 20 surrogates whoresponded, six to one perceived the child clearly as the couple's child.Only 3 of the surrogates perceived the child as still shared by the coupleand by themselves. Overall, of the 20 who responded, there was a minimalamount of emotional discomfort reported by the surrogate mothers in relationto themselves and their children. The adoptive couples similarly reported very little emotional discomfortdue to their having worked with a surrogate mother. Of the 16 couples, threereported stress and discomfort concerning the artificial insemination processand anxiety regarding achieving a conception and three others reported thatthey had wished they had been more involved in the pregnancy. The adoptivecouple consistently reported that the child's genetic connection to onlyone parent had very little influence on how they related to the child ingeneral. Of the fathers, three reported feeling a greater sense of closenessand understanding because of their genetic relation to the child. All ofthe couples reported that they perceived the child as their child, not asthe surrogate's child or as a child they feel is shared with the surrogate.It could be hypothesized that the surrogates' and couples' shared perceptionthat the child is the couple's child demonstrates denial which helps to minimizediscomfort. Both surrogates and couples reported that they felt they had sufficientcontact with the other party. The twenty surrogates who responded all hadpost-partum contact through the child's first birthday. Of the nine surrogatesfor whom over two years or more had passed, all but one had contact throughthe second year. Typically, the adoptive parents sent cards and photos atChristmas and/or the child's birthday.

Within this group of adoptive parents, 15 couples stated that theyplan to tell the child of its adoption, and one couple was uncertain as towhat they would do. The adoptive couples and the surrogate mothers seemed to agree on severalpoints in this follow-up survey. None of the adoptive couples or the surrogatemothers regretted their decision to participate in the program. Additionally,they both reported that knowing each other was beneficial to their experience.In the surrogates' reports, as well as in the couples' reports, the appreciation,warmth, sharing, and knowledge of each other were helpful in making theexperience meaningful and enable the surrogate to more easily relinquishthe child. They also predicted that knowing each other benefitted the childreninvolved. The couples and the surrogates both want surrogate parenting legalizedso there will be appropriate restrictions and regulations on the process.For instance, both sample groups felt that surrogate mothers should havea psychological evaluation prior to participation in such a program. These studies are a beginning of necessary longitudinal studies on surrogates,their families, and the children. the data presented agrees with the minimalliterature to date suggesting that surrogate mothers do not exhibit pathologicalpersonalities and appear to function well both before and after the birth.It further suggests that contact between the individual and the familieswho have come together to create this child should be open. The contact appearsto provide a positive and communicative environment for all participants.Furthermore, the open relationship helps to minimize secrecy and denial whichare detrimental to the children. New reproductive alternatives are now established, but it is mandatorythat we proceed with caution. Mental health professionals can assume asignificant role in evaluating, monitoring, and counseling within the newprograms. Psychologists can be helpful in preventing exploitation. The psychologyprofessional must assess for each individual where surrogacy constitutesa constructive life step or where it is a collusion with pathology. However, in order to assist attorneys, physicians, and families, we needto reassess the values, beliefs and assumptions of our culture and of ourprofession regarding acceptable ways to create families. History suggeststhat forms of surrogacy have provided acceptable alternatives in differentcultures and at different times in our history. Perhaps surrogacy will becomeanother behavior that we will come to understand as not pathological, butas one that broadens the continuum and definition of what humans can thinkand feel. Specifically, surrogacy may expand our knowledge about varyingdegrees of attachment behavior between biological mother an child. We maynow have to question what is commonly perceived in our society as an absoluteattachment that every woman feels to every child she carries. The road aheadis indeed a challenging one. Above all else, we must proceed with the children'sbest interest as our primary concern.

Success Rate of Surrogate Gestational Pregnancies using in Vitro Fertilizing Donor Oocytes William Handel, J.D. Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D. Center for Surrogate Parenting,Inc. Beverly Hills, California USA Presented at VI World Congress on IVF, Jerusalem, Israel April6, 1989. Introduction This paper presents a review of a new procedure involving gestationalsurrogate mothers. The dramatic increase in vitro clinics and procedureshas logically extended to the transferring of embryos from an infertile coupleto a gestational surrogate mother. The first such gestational surrogate birthwas reported in 1987. Since that time there have been approximately 30 birthsworldwide. Due tot he fact that the surrogates are implanted during unstimulatedcycles and are young women with successful pregnancy histories, it washypothesized that the success of in vitro fertilization will be greater whenworking with gestational surrogates. The legal, psychological, and medical dynamics ofsuch a solution to childlessness are indeed complex. There are few or nolaws that address legal issues of working with a surrogate mother and thereare few studies that outline the psychological risks and considerations.This paper will outline the procedures of one center which specializes inproviding legal, psychological, and administrative services to all patients.It outlines issues that any medical team should consider prior to becominginvolved in gestational surrogacy. Furthermore, the most current findingson the pregnancies using in vitro fertilization donor findings on the pregnanciesusing in vitro fertilization donor oocytes will bepresented.1 Return to CSP Home Page Sample The sample consisted of 22 infertile couples who came to the "Centerfor Surrogate Parenting" in Los Angeles, California. These couples were ofchildbearing age, but unable to conceive due to hysterectomy, malformed uterus,extreme health risk of pregnancy, or unexplained infertility. Of the women,17 ranged in age from 33 to 41 and 4 ranged in age from 42 through 47 yearsold. All were medically determined to still be ovulatory. The gestational surrogate mothers consisted of 17 women who had met thepsychological and medical requirements of the Center. They all had historiesof uncomplicated pregnancies. Within this sample, 16 were under 32 yearsof age and 1 was 36. All were medically determined to be fertile, healthy,and with regular cycles. Procedures A. Psychological Surrogate mother applicants and their spouses underwent an orientationand psychological screening process. Only women who had successful, uncomplicatedpregnancies and who had children of their own were interviewed. Each candidatewas told of the risks and demands of such a program. The orientation emphasizedinformed consent regarding legal, medical, and psychological challenges.The psychological screening process involved assessing their intelligence,ability to keep commitments, social support systems, self-esteem, copingmechanisms, sensitivity toward others, and stability. Furthermore, theirmotivations and their expectations were fully explored. Candidates were onlyaccepted if they were motivated by factors other than money, and if theyforesaw being a surrogate as a personally rewarding experience. After initial interviews, selected candidates were given psychologicaltesting. They were required to attend the mandatory support group meetingswith other gestational surrogates. They were then medically evaluated forfertility and general health (including social disease testing). The Center also provided a similar orientation for infertile couples,with each couple meeting with the staff psychologist to assess appropriatenessfor the program. Alternative solutions to childlessness, marital issues,expectations, informed consent and stability were discussed. Accepted surrogate mother candidates and infertile couples were subsequentlymatched and introduced to each other under the guidance of a staff psychologist.Both sets of clients received psychological consultation throughout theirparticipation. B. Legal The surrogate and the Intended Parents have a legal relationshipbecause she is carrying a child pursuant to a comprehensive and sophisticatedcontract that has been entered into. Prior to entering into this legalrelationship, both the surrogate and the Intended Parents must undergo afull and comprehensive legal consultation with independent counsel. Thisconsultation includes a full description of the surrogate contract as wellas the possible liabilities, duties and responsibilities of each party. Theconsultation includes an explanation of the ambiguous status of the contractin the United States. Very few jurisdictions have ever passed laws on thelegality of surrogate parenting, and in particular, gestational surrogacyhas never been addressed by any legislative or judicial body. Because therehas never been a situation where a gestational surrogate attempted to renegeon her contract or a couple was not willing to go forth under the terms ofa gestational surrogacy agreement, the contract has never been tested. Once the surrogate and the perspective parents had been legally informedof their rights and duties under the contract, a match was made and the partiesonce again went through the process of reading the contract together. Thiswas done with the assistance of a video tape in which an experienced attorneyagain explained in full the legal aspects of he relationship. Prior to the implantation, medical insurance was purchased on behalf ofthe surrogate and life insurance policies were set into place on behalf ofthe parties. The entire anticipated expense of the procedure, including medicalexpenses, payment to the surrogate, legal, administrative and psychologicalfees and all other anticipated miscellaneous expenses were placed in a trustaccount. At approximately the sixth month of pregnancy, alegal petition was filed with the court of appropriate jurisdiction requestinga judgment for maternity and paternity on behalf of the biological parents.This legal action was initiated to establish the legal relationship betweenthe prospective biological parents and the child. With the granting of thepetition of maternity and paternity, the surrogate was deemed to have noparental rights to the child and the biological parents were legally deemedthe natural parents of thee child (while in utero). This petition eliminatedthe necessity of any adoption proceedings and legally recognized the intendedrelationship that the parties had created. The legal document contains thedeclaration of parentage and also orders the birth certificate be issuedwith the names of the biological parents as the natural parents of thechild.2 C. Medical The doctor and patient decided whether the in vitro, ZIFT, of GIFTprocedure was to be utilized. In the first embryo transfer attempt, estrogenand progesterone, along with HCC were used to synchronize the donor mother'scycle with the cycle of the specified surrogate mother. For all subsequenttransfers, the donor mother took Lupron to help synchronize her cycle withher surrogate's cycle. Typically, up to three embryos were implanted withthe ZIFT procedures and up to five embryos were implanted with the IVF procedure. Return to CSP Home Page Results A. Medical Of the 22 infertile couples, 21 of them underwent embryo transferprocedures. One couple was unable to produce the necessary oocytes. 31 embryotransfers into surrogate mothers were conducted. There were a total of 5dropped cycles due to problems with synchronization of the two women's cyclesand 4 dropped cycles due to lack of proper oocyte development. Of the 31 transfers performed, 22 utilized the IVF procedure, 5 utilizedZIFT, and 4 utilized GIFT procedure. (The GIFT and ZIFT procedures have onlybeen offered in the last year.) Of the 31 transfer attempts, 10 resulted in pregnancy. Of these pregnancies,1 resulted from GIFT, 2 resulted from ZIFT, and 7 resulted from IVF. Noneof the 5 transfers conducted on behalf of donor mothers who were over 41years have been successful to date. Of the pregnancies achieved, 7 occurred on the patients first embryo transferattempt, 1 was achieved on the patient's second trial, and 1 occurred onthe patient's fourth trial. Currently, the status of the pregnancies is as follows: 4 have delivered(one twin pregnancy); 2 are in the third trimester; 1 is in the second trimester;1 is in the first trimester; and 2 of the pregnancies ended in miscarriageat 9 weeks. The pregnancy rate for this sample group is 32% per transfer. The "take-homebaby rate" per transfer is 25.8%. Overall, of the 22 couples attempting toend their childlessness thus far 8 of them will take home a baby, resultingin a 27.5% of the patients. B. Legal All of the gestational pregnancies in the program resulted in successfullegal outcomes. These legal actions for maternity and paternity were filedin four different counties in California. The courts have been inclined toallow these as a matter of course. All have been granted with no oppositionand extreme ease. Therefore, the biological parents names were on the birthcertificates immediately with the gestational surrogate having no parentalrights. C. Psychological Of the four surrogate mothers who have delivered, all were able torelinquish the child without grief reactions or ambivalence. All of the pregnantsurrogates appear to see themselves as clearly a gestational mother and havenot expressed a need or desire to keep the child. Furthermore, the surrogates,pregnant experience and exhibited no regrets. being able to have contactwith the parents and with other gestational surrogates appear to be importantvaluables in their psychological resolution. Return to CSP Home Page Discussion Although gestational surrogacy is in its infancy as an alternativeto infertile couples, it appears that with the proper protections and safeguardsit is an extremely successful method of creating a family. Obviously, manyinfertile couples prefer a biologically related child, and the possibilityof gestational surrogacy allows the chance for these couples to fulfill thisimportant need in their lives. It is important to note that the success of gestational surrogacy is basedon a comprehensive program of protections for all parties. These involvea very thorough legal grounding, as well as independent legal representation.It is critical that the attorneys who are involved are well versed in thearea of reproductive technology law. The Center for Surrogate Parenting hasbeen successful in its petitioning of the California Courts to recognizethat gestational surrogacy needs to be viewed differently than other thirdparty solutions to childlessness. The need for thorough psychological screeningis essential for any successful program. It is impossible to underestimatethe need for a strong psychological base and well qualified psychologicalexperts in the field of surrogacy. It is this involvement of experienced professionals that minimizes themedical team's responsibility and liability regarding the non-medical aspectsof surrogacy. It is important that the medical community be protected byputting into place a comprehensive contract, appropriate insurance policiesand a mutual understanding between the parties. With all the professionalin place (the legal, the psychological and the medical), the risks involvedin gestational surrogacy are few and the potential is enormous. It is clear that placing embryos in young women with unstimulated cyclesresults in a most favorable situation for pregnancy. The number of gestationalsurrogate procedures is increasing dramatically.

Raising a child is one of the special joys of life. Unfortunately, nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession. The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) is a world renown surrogate parenting and egg donation program located in Beverly Hills, California. CSP was established because we strongly believe that couples who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity. Having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to meet that need. Unlike some alternative methods of creating a family, the surrogacy process allows a child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of In-Vitro Fertilization) both parents. It also gives the couple the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself. And finally, since their child is conceived only because of their own existence, the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the couple.

How is our program different? The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), is very different from other programs because we rely so heavily on psychological screening. On average, a potential surrogate is screened for 3-5 months before she is presented to couples. During that time they are continually being monitored by the counselors and CSP staff members. We want to make sure that a Surrogate Mother fully understands what she is entering into, so that each party (the surrogate, her family, and the couple) is protected. During the screening process, the potential surrogate mother is given every opportunity to exit the program and break contract with the Center, without incurring costs to herself. Additionally, we meet with the Surrogate Mother's husband/partner, to ensure he is supportive of her decision to assist a couple. We consider the decision to become a surrogate mother to be a family decision. Her husband/partner will also be asked to undergo full social disease testing. We are also unique in the comprehensive manner in which we approach a surrogacy arrangement. We combine each of the aspects (legal, psychological, financial, screening, and medical coordination) into a complete program, and then take it one step further. Each week, we have a staff meeting in which all of CSP staff members, as well as the counseling team, and the attorney meet and discuss every active client, one by one, to ensure that everyone is kept updated, and that nothing is overlooked. The ability to unite all of these aspects is what makes us such a strong team. All members of our team have a long term working relationship together. Per a client who did extensive research of the surrogacy programs in the U.S., and then chose CSP, "None of the other programs placed the emphasis your Center does on caring about and protecting each person involved in the surrogacy relationship."

A Surrogacy Program Tailored for Your Needs There are three surrogate programs, and deciding which is right for youis an individual, and usually medical, pyschological, and financial decision. Artificial Insemination Program The Surrogate mother's egg is used and she is artificially inseminated at an infertility clinic. Following the successful insemination, pregnancy and birth, the Surrogate releases the baby to the couple for stepparent adoption by the husband's wife. The husband is already the biological (natural) father. Couples who generally choose this program have usually undergone a full hysterectomy; or have a genetic condition making the use of their own eggs not a viable option; or have an immunilogical condition (i.e. are allergic to one another); or wife's eggs are no longer viable and will not create a viable pregnancy; or they cannot afford in vitro fertilization. Estimated Costs of Artificial Insemination Program In-Vitro Fertilization Program The couple will create embryos using their own eggs and semen, then transfer the embryos to the Host Surrogate Mother. Typically, the Couple and Surrogate's cycles are synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus optimize the chance of a conception. When there are more embryos than necessary for a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle, thus making the procedure more cost effective. Following a successful implantation, pregnancy and birth, the Surrogate releases the baby to the biological parents, whose names appear on the original birth certificate, if the birth occurs in the state of California. There is no need for adoption procedures. Couples who generally choose this program have, or can create viable embryos, but experienced problems with implantation; or had a partial hysterectomy but have viable ovaries; or she was born without a uterus but has ovaries; or is a DES exposed woman; or has an incompetent uterus. Estimated Costs of In-Vitro Fertilization Program In-Vitro Fertilization/Egg Donation Program An Egg Donor provides an ovum for fertilization by the spermof the couple. The resulting embryos belong to the couple and are transferredto a Host Surrogate Mother. The Surrogate releases the baby to the IntendedParents, and parental rights are established.

PHASE 1: TO BEGIN THE PROCESS: Contact the Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), if you would like our information booklet, or review the information we have on the Internet. Call CSP to make an appointment for a consultation. This is a 4-6 hour consultation during which you meet one on one with a counselor, the attorney, and each member of our staff. There is a $400.00 flat fee for this consultation. ($200 for CSP and $200 for the counselor's consultation). No documents are signed and no commitments made by either party. This consultation gives CSP the opportunity to teach you about the reality of surrogacy and ensures you understand surrogacy prior to your committing to signing retainers with our program. After the consult, we will provide you with our Retainer Agreements . We request you do not retain us the same day, but take these retainers home to review the documents. Once you are comfortable with all the legal issues, and you wish to retain CSP, the next step would be to sign and mail the Retainer Agreements along with the retainer fees. PHASE 2: THE MATCHING PROCESS: There is usually a waiting period between the time a couple retains CSP and when a couple selects their surrogate mother. (although it varies, 3-8 months is average, depending upon which program you enter, and your criteria. We will keep you informed of the current wait period). During this waiting period, CSP is processing surrogate mothers through the program (psychological and medical screening, etc.,), as well as ensuring the couples file is complete. Preparation for matching Couple writes profile for presentation to surrogate mothers, along with photographs. HIV testing for Intended Parents and Surrogate and her husband Semen analysis Genetic analysis STD lab results when close to matching. Your surrogate mother is completing our screening process (psychological, medical, background, etc) and her cycles are being monitored with the use of ovulation kits. The Match with your surrogate Couple and surrogate receive profiles of each other Once you have selected one another, a meeting is arranged with your counselor present Contracts are drafted, Surrogate has independent legal counsel, and contracts are signed. Financial - Trust account held by CSP must be established before any medical procedures take place. Detailed ledgers are sent to couples every month showing the status of the trust account. Couples are always welcome to visit our offices to review their file and at any time can request a copy of their file. PHASE 3: MEDICAL PROCEDURES: Artificial Insemination Program Surrogate monitors ovulation to plan for inseminations In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program Begin medications for synchronization of cycles and preparation forembryo transfer PHASE 4: THE PREGNANCY & BEYOND: During the pregnancy, couples remain in contact with their surrogateabout every two weeks. Couples usually visit their Surrogate several times during pregnancyand attend the ultrasound to get their first pictures of their baby. The process of establishing your legal parental rights begin during secondtrimester of pregnancy. Couples are almost always present at the birth, & begin parentingimmediately. Contact after birth should include pictures and letters, cards at theholidays and birthdays are also appropriate. Â©1995 Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation,Inc.

How to Compare Programs How long have you been in business? The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP) has been in business since 1980. How many births have you had? CSP is proud of our over 428 births as of December 1995, and we currently have 36 ongoing pregnancies (41 babies due). In 1994 we celebrated 67 births! What programs do you offer? Traditional Surrogacy (AI) Gestational Surrogacy (IVF) Egg Donation (ED) Egg Donation & Gestational Surrogacy (IVF/ED) What are the advantages of a fully comprehensive program? CSP approaches surrogacy as a team effort. The professionalsinvolved have worked together for many years, and with many hundreds of clients.Each person is able to voice their opinions, brainstorm with the otherprofessionals, and decide what will be in the best interest of the couplesinvolved. In our program, it is not just one persons opinion that counts. Every week the entire staff meets to discuss activity on every clients'file. We feel this time spent together sets us apart from other programs.This is a strength and indicative of our commitment to our couples. Eachprofessional brings a different perspective, allowing more in-depth coverageof cases and preventing details and issues from being missed. Have you ever had a surrogate mother change her mind and keep the baby? No, in our over 428 births, we have never had a surrogate mother change her mind. The actual number of cases gone to court are less than 17 inthe entire country, but none of these have come from our program. How do I finalize my parental rights? Couples are represented by independent legal counsel. We hold yourhand throughout the process, and no couple in our program has ever failedto finalize their parental rights, regardless of the State the couples residesin. In the Artificial Insemination program, the surrogate mother's name and the Natural/Intended Father's name appears on the birth certificate. The couples then returns to their state of residence and competes the step-parent adoption needed to finalize the Intended Mother's legal parental rights. In the In Vitro Fertilization program, the names of the natural father and natural mother (the couple who donates their egg and sperm), will appear on the original birth certificate. Are surrogates and donors medically and psychologically screened? Both couples and surrogate mothers and their husbands, or egg donors and their husbands, are medically and psychologically screened In our program. How am I matched? and Will I meet my surrogate? Once a surrogate mother has been psychologically and medically screened, completed her criminal background search and has medical insurance in effect, she is ready to be presented with couple's profiles to begin the selection process.Generally a surrogate mother will receive 2-3 profiles of couples.If she selects a couple, her profile is mailed to that couple for their consideration.A couple could therefore receive one, or two or more profiles, depending on whether they were selected by a surrogate mother.Couples then have the opportunity to review the profile(s), knowing they have already been selected by the surrogate mother(s).The counselors are on hand to assist couples in the selection process.If none of the profiles are acceptable to the couple, their information is sent to other surrogate mothers and the process continues.Through our selection process you are only presented with candidates that meet our requirements and are finished with their screening process.Most of the applicants do not pass the screening process, and their profiles are NOT presented to couples.Basically, we do not believe in presenting a couple with a hypothetical candidate.CSP recognizes that couples have been through a lot, and we are cautious to protect couples. CSP is an "open" program. This means that couples will meet their surrogate mother prior to any medical procedures being undertaken.Our selection process allows surrogates to select her couple and couples to select their surrogate mother.The final choice regarding selection is the couples!We consider it to be our responsibility to your child to ensure that he/she fits in with the "look" of your family and that you feel very positively about your surrogate mother.By giving you the final say as to whom you are matched with, gives you the power to decide what is in your best interests. Couples participate in the pregnancy as much as is comfortable for them. Most couples try to attend some doctor appointments and all couples are present for the birth of their baby. Is a trust account established? What if my surrogate mother asks foradditional funds? CSP is the administrator of the contract and deals with all the financial issues, taking the burden away from the couple. This allows the couple and the surrogate mother to concentrate on the pregnancy, and prevent any awkward conversations regarding finances or reimbursements. CSP is very concerned about protecting our couples and surrogate mothers. We hold full trust funds sufficient to cover expenses throughout the pregnancy. Physicians and surrogate mothers are therefore guaranteed their fees. Should a couple file for bankruptcy, divorce or both die, while their surrogate mother is pregnant, she will not be left with any bills. All payments are guaranteed for the trust account. Compensation is very clearly dictated by the contract which is signed by both the couple and the surrogate mother and her husband. All parties are represented by independent legal counsel and therefore all Parties have a clear understanding of the financial considerations and have expressly agreed to abide to these considerations in writing. Each month the Intended Parents will receive a ledger detailing the financial activity in their account. CSP has a Trust Administrator whose responsibility it is to administer clients trust funds, verify and process surrogate mother's expenses and doctor's bills. How many staff members do you have? CSP has eight staff members and we work closely with four full-time independent counselors, and couple's independent legal counsel. All staff members are cross-trained, therefore if one staff member is ill, or takes a vacation, the other staff members can take over the case. Our weekly staff meetings enables each staff member to keep abreast of the status of each client. What is your screening process for surrogate mothers? Potential surrogate mothers go through a three to five month evaluation, including psychological testing, interviews, genetic evaluation, criminal background and driver license search, social disease testing including HIV, and a medical evaluation by a fertility specialist. Surrogate mother does not incur any costs whatsoever throughout the process. Therefore at any time, if a surrogate mother decides not to continue in our program, she can walk away without incurring a financial burden. If a surrogate mother decides to stay with our program, it is because she wants to continue and is dedicated to assisting her couple. Do you offer counseling? Yes, CSP is associated with four full time independent counselors who have each had over 8 years experience in counseling surrogate mothers and infertile couples. We provide full counseling before, during and after the birth. Counseling is available to couples and surrogate mothers for as long as you need the counseling. CSP offers group support meeting for surrogate mothers. These meetings are held once a month. During support group your surrogate will get the opportunity to meet other women who are in various stages of participation in our program. How much will surrogacy cost? Generally, traditional surrogacy will cost $42,000-$46,000.Gestational surrogacy costs about $45,000 depending onthe number of retrievals and transfers attempted. The above figures reflect all anticipated expenses including compensationto the surrogate, all medical and laboratory fees, psychologist fees, legalretainers, advertising costs for surrogate mothers, life insurance, medical insurance, etc. The figures above reflect accurate costs from the time you enter our program to the time you are at home with your child, and parental rights are finalized. How much will Egg Donation cost? To get started in our Egg Donation program, a fee of $500 is paid to the counselor. ONLY if you select an egg donor and agree to work with her and she agrees to assist you, are additional fees due. Non-medical costs for egg donation include: $1,500.00 Administration & advertising fees - payable to CSP $1,000.00 Psychologist ($500 to begin process, $500 once matching has occurred) $2,500.00 Egg Donor compensation $ 750.00 Attorney fees for Intended Parent's legal counsel, includes contracts $ 250.00 Egg donor attorney fees, includes review of contracts What if I have my own surrogate? CSP recommends a legal and psychological clearance consultation that is offered by independent legal counsel and independent counselors. For a $500.00 fee, Intended Parents and their potential surrogate mother and her partner, can meet with an attorney and counselor for education and an evaluation. CSP does offer to coordinate private arrangements and offers full case management. Are you too far away? No, on average 20% of our clients live in Australia, Japan, England & Europe. A large number of our clients live on the East Coast. Distance to a program should not be as important as the skill level of the people who work for the program, and their yeas of experience. The majority of our surrogate mothers live in the State of California. CSP is located in California because of the positive political and legal climate California offers. We are located in Beverly Hills because this location allows us to be ideally geographically located with regards to the infertility doctors, counselors and attorneys.

June 3, 1994 Dear Karen, Being an egg donor has been a very special experience. Since I wasa teenager I wanted to do something that would make a difference in someoneelse's life. Helping a mature\responsible couple have a baby who are unableto conceive seemed an excellent way to fulfill my desire. The process requires time, involvement, perseverance, and personal dedication.I was very fortunate because my family was completely supportive. At timesI questioned my involvement in the procedure because I had to devote myselfto helping a couple (that I didn't know) have a baby. As a mother of two beautiful children I understand the longing to be parentsand I hope that my personal involvement will help the recipient couple realizetheir dream to have a family. Personally I feel happy with the decision Ihave made and which that each one of us would do something positive to makea difference in this world. Sincerely, S.

Housed onthe second floor of Lorch Hall, the Foster Library's primary purpose isto serve the faculty and graduate students in the two units. The FosterLibrary's collection focuses on materials in the field of internationaldevelopment, public policy, and economics. While the majority of thecollection is comprised of journals and working papers collected fromthe U.S. and abroad, it also contains books, dissertations, referenceworks, and foreign and U.S. government documents. In addition toproviding access to library materials and maintaining its collection,the Foster Library offers reference and information services, casualreading and study areas, and course reserve materials. Research Seminar in Quantitative EconomicsThe Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE) is an integralcomponent of the econometrics program in the Department of Economics. The Seminar provides the student with an opportunity to combine thestudy of econometric theory with the practice available from an ongoingresearch project in econometric analysis. The RSQE sponsors twoprincipal activities in which qualified students are welcomed asparticipants and through which Research Assistant appointments areavailable. One activity is centered around the RSQE's econometricmodels of the U. S. economy and the economy of the State of Michigan andincludes 1) a forecasting program which produces quarterly forecasts ofthe economy, 2) a program of structural and policy studies concernedwith the dynamics of the economy as represented by the econometricmodel, and 3) continual research aimed at improving the specification ofthe models. The other principal activity involves basic research oneconometric technique and its application to substantive economicproblems. General supervision of seminar projects is provided by thefaculty associated with the RSQE. Doctoral dissertations are frequentlygenerated by the research carried out under RSQE auspices. Center for Research on Economic and Social Theory The Center for Research on Economic and Social Theory (CREST) serves asthe central forum for those faculty and students whose primary interestis in economic theory. CREST holds weekly seminars in which originalresearch of resident faculty and students or innovative work in economictheory which has recently appeared in the economic literature isdiscussed. Many of the papers discussed in the seminar are subsequentlyduplicated and distributed as CREST discussion papers to members ofEconomics departments at other universities. The Center also brings toMichigan a number of guest lecturers from other universities. Althoughit is located in the Economics Department, membership in CREST is notlimited to economists, but includes members of the Mathematics,Political Science, and Philosophy departments as well. Research Seminar in International Economics The seminar is a research and training facility located in the Departmentof Economics. The seminar program includes the formulation of internationaleconomic theory, the empirical testing of hypotheses implied by the theory, themeasurement of quantitative international economic relations, and the analysis ofevaluation of significant problems of policy and the operation of internationaleconomic institutions. The seminar meets weekly under the direction ofProfessors Stern, Deardorff, and Levinsohn. Research results usually arepublished in journals or edited volumes. Area Centers The University engages actively in certain Area Studies, with specialemphasis on China, Japan, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, WesternEurope, South and Southeast Asia, and the Near East and North Africa. Avariety of programs and courses is offered covering economic, political,historical, and cultural studies of these areas. In the Department ofEconomics, Prof. Li has worked on issues relevant to both Chinese andEastern European economic issues, and Prof. Adams specializes in WesternEurope, especially France. Prof. Porter has done field work inColombia, Pakistan, Kenya, Indonesia, and India. Prof. Saxonhousespecializes in the Japanese economy. In addition, many other facultyhave worked in particular countries at one time or another. Interdepartmental seminars are carried on in several of these areas. Japan Economy Program The Department of Economics maintains the national headquarters of theCommittee on Japanese Economic Studies which is chaired by ProfessorSaxonhouse and which has received extensive funding from foundations andcorporations in both Japan and the United States. At Michigan, theCommittee sponsors the Japan Economy Program. Graduate studentparticipation in the research and training activities of the JapanEconomy Program is encouraged through special seminars and researchassistantships. For students with fluency in Japanese or the aptitudeand inclination to undergo further language training, a limited numberof multi-year fellowships are available. During the past few years, theDepartment of Economics has received a number of grants designed tofacilitate the training of specialists on the Japanese economy. Forfurther details, contact Professor Saxonhouse (313-764-3296). Center for Russian and East European Studies and Center for ChineseStudies The Center for Russian and East European Studies and the Center forChinese Studies provide a comprehensive multi-disciplinary program ofcourses in area studies and language training. They award graduatefellowships, some of which have been held by economics students inrecent years. The Centers' research projects sometimes provide researchassistantships for graduate students. In addition, the Centers maintainreading rooms with current publications on the area and sponsor manylectures and seminars by leading scholars from various countries. Forfurther details, contact Professor Li (313-763-9561). Committee for Comparative and Historical Research in the MarketEconomies The Committee for Comparative and Historical Research onthe Market Economies (CCHROME) is a unit within the Department ofEconomics. CCHROME serves as an institutional locus within theUniversity for comparative and historical economic research on Japan,Western Europe, the United States, and other market economies. Graduatestudent participation in the research and training activities of CCHROMEis encouraged through seminars and research assistantships. Forstudents with research interests related to CCHROME activities, somefellowship support is available. In addition, special multi-yearfellowships are available from the Committee on Japanese EconomicStudies for which CCHROME maintains the national headquarters. Forfurther information, contact Professors Adams, Saxonhouse, or Whatley(313-764-5567). Survey Research CenterThe Survey Research Center of the Institute for Social Research engagesin extensive economic research, especially in the field of consumerbehavior. A number of advanced graduate students in the Department ofEconomics participate in the research program of the Center on apart-time basis. Through this work many students receive first-handexperience and training in the increasingly important application ofsurvey research methods to economic problems. There are also full-timepositions as Assistant in Research for those who need to take time outfrom classes to accumulate funds while learning research methods. TheCenter's archives of survey data can provide a useful source ofmaterials for doctoral dissertations. For further information, contactthe Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research(313-763-5186). Population StudiesThe Populations Studies Center is an interdisciplinary center thatconducts research and training activities in demography, with anemphasis on the interrelations between population studies and othersocial sciences. An economic demography graduate training program hasbeen run jointly by the Population Studies Center and the EconomicsDepartment since the 1960s, providing fellowship support to economicsPh.D. students interested in the connection between economics anddemography. The program supports 6-8 economics Ph.D. students per year. Students may combine economic demography with any other fields ineconomics, with many students choosing labor economics, public finance,or economic development. Students in the program are given office spaceat the Populations Studies Center and have access to the computing andother research support facilities at the Center. Economics faculty withappointments at the Center are John Bound and David Lam. Students whowish to obtain further information should contact Professor David Lam,coordinator of the Training Program in Economic Demography(313-998-7275) School of Public PolicyPrograms of study leading to a master's or doctoral degree in PublicPolicy are offered by the School of Public Policy. For the master'sdegree, the student normally completes the required course work in twoacademic years and satisfies a practicum requirement during theintervening summer. In addition to economics, required courses in theprogram deal with political science, organization theory andquantitative methods. Several of these courses are open to interestedeconomics students. Interested students should contact the School ofPublic Policy, 440 Lorch Hall (313-764-3490). The Office of Tax Policy ResearchThe Office of Tax Policy Research is housed in the School of BusinessAdministration and is directed by Professor Slemrod, who has a jointappointment in Economics and the Business School. Faculty associates ofthe Office come from the Economics Department, the Business School, andthe Law School. It sponsors several tax-related activities, including atax policy lecture series, conferences on issues of current interest,joint research projects, research seminars, a tax database and adissertation fellowship. Several graduate students hold researchassistantships with the Office each year. For further information,contact Professor Slemrod (313-936-3914). Joint Program in Law and Economics A small number of exceptionally well-qualified applicants are admittedjointly to the Graduate School and the Law School and permitted topursue a program leading to both the Ph.D. degree in economics and theJ.D. degree. The program can be completed in five calendar years butmost students take longer. The program requires simultaneousapplication to both the Law School and the Economics Department. To beeligible for consideration for this program, the applications must besubmitted no later than January 15. Interested students should write tothe Admissions Office, University of Michigan Law School, for furtherdetails (313-764-0537). Financial aid is available on an equal basiswith continuing Ph.D. economics students. Other aid is occasionallyavailable from the Law School. Joint Program in Social Work and Economics A program of study leading to the doctoral degree in Social Work andEconomics is available. Course requirements will be planned for eachstudent to include economic theory, statistics, and public finance orlabor economics. The student must pass preliminary examinations ineconomic theory and in public finance or labor. For other requirementsand additional information, students may write to the SupervisingCommittee for the Doctoral Program in Social Work and Social Science,School of Social Work (313-763-5768). Joint Program in Statistics and Economics A joint program is available with the Department of Statistics leadingto a Master's in Statistics and a Ph.D. in Economics. A doctoralstudent specializing in econometrics may obtain a Master's in Statisticsby completing Statistics 501, 510, 511, 531 or Stat 526 with Economics775, 776 and two other approved statistics courses at the 500 level orabove. For further information on this program, contact theChairperson, Department of Statistics (313-763-3519). Graduate Economics Society The Economics Society plays two roles in the graduate program. First, itserves as the vehicle for student participation in the decision-makingprocesses relating to the graduate program itself. Second, it sponsorsvarious activities designed to broaden the outlook and perspective ofstudents as prospective economists. The Society also helps new studentsacquaint themselves with the Department and with life in Ann Arbor. The Society is an informal organization and all graduate students areautomatically members. In recent years, student representatives haveplayed a significant role in the development and reorganization of thegraduate program. The faculty has shown its interest in securing theopinions of students and the Society has contributed to student-facultycommunications. The President of the Society and a second elected representativeattend departmental meetings and the President attends meetings of theDepartmental Executive Committee. Other student representatives aremembers of the Departmental Graduate Program Committee, the Admissionsand Fellowships Committee, and the Committee on Speakers. The Economics Society sponsors an orientation program for newstudents and assists them in familiarizing themselves with Ann Arbor,the University, and the Department. Other social affairs are sponsoredby the Society during the year. Conference on the Economic Outlook The Department of Economics and the Institute for Social Researchjointly sponsor the annual Conference on the Economic Outlook. ThisConference takes place each November and is attended by a large numberof business, academic, and government economists. The program consistsof formal lectures and round-table discussions dealing both with theshort-term economic outlook for the coming year and the economic andsocial setting over the longer run. A continuing feature of thisConference is a forecast for the U.S. economy in the year to come, madeon the basis of the econometric model developed by the Research Seminarin Quantitative Economics.

Requirements to Reach Candidacy The following courses and exams are required of all students inorder to reach candidacy: Mathematics and statistics courses: All students must receiveat least a B- in each of Econ 653, 654, 673, and 674. A student can placeout of any of these course requirements, however, by passing a placementexam at the beginning of the relevant course during the student's firstyear in the program. Core theory courses: Normally, each student will take Econ601, 602, 603, and 604 during the first year in the program. Studentswith additional time commitments, e.g. due to English language courses orGSI responsibilities, may be allowed by the Director of Graduate Studies topostpone Econ 602 and Econ 604 until their second year in the program. Students are required to pass a prelim in each area of theory by May oneyear after the relevant coursework is completed. If a student has stillnot passed a theory prelim by this May, but has passed the other theoryprelim by that date, then that student will be allowed one more chanceduring the following September. However, if a student's GPA at the end of the first year is below 5.0, then in order to remain in the program that student must pass by September starting the second year all theory prelims for which the relevant coursework was completed during the first year. Students are required to take Econ 601-604 for credit and cannotregister for a theory prelim until the associated course work has beencompleted. The only time a student can take a theory prelim withouthaving taken for credit the two associated theory courses is in May of thefirst year or September of the second year. If a student does so, thenthe prelim must be passed by September of the second year to remain in theprogram. If the prelim is passed, then the requirement to take theassociate courses for credit is waived. Major fields: Each student is required to pass a prelim ineach of two major fields. Prelims can be taken each May and September. Normal preparation for each prelim is a two-course sequence in that field. Both prelims must be passed by May of the student's fourth year in theprogram. Other course requirements: Each student must receive at least a B- in a course in a third "minor" field. Each student must take two "cognate" courses, which are courses (approved for graduate credit) in another department of the University. These courses can be cross-listed in the Economics department. One of the student's three fields (the two major and one minor) must be either Advanced Theory or Econometrics. Available Fields: The current list of approved fields consists of: Advanced Theory, Economic History, Econometric Theory, IndustrialOrganization, International Economics, Labor Economics, Monetary Theory,Population Studies, Public Finance, and Transition Economics. If theDepartment, due to staffing limitations, is able to offer only one coursein a field, then that field can only be used to satisfy the "minor" fieldrequirement. If no courses are offered, then that field cannot be used tosatisfy Departmental requirements. However, when a course in one of thesefields is not offered, the Director of Graduate Studies, in consultationwith members of the relevant field, has the power to approve analternative course, taught outside the Department, or approve a readingcourse with one of the members of the Department. While the Department discourages use of other fields, a studentmay petition the Director of Graduate Studies to substitute a field notincluded in the above list. To do so, the following procedure must befollowed for a major field: Two faculty members in the Economics Department must be found to sponsor the field. These faculty members should, together with the student, draw up a reading list appropriate for a two-course sequence in the proposed field. In some cases, these courses may be based on regular courses offered outside the Department, supplemented where appropriate. These faculty members should agree to supervise these two courses, and agree to write and grade a preliminary exam in the field. The student should submit the reading list to the Director of Graduate Studies, along with a one-page petition describing why this alternative field is important for the student's education. This material will be circulated to all members of the Graduate Program Committee. Unless objections are received from a majority of the members within a month, the petition will be approved. Otherwise, the student can meet with the committee to try to convince a majority to approve it. For a proposed minor field, the same rules should be followed,except that only one faculty member is needed, and there would be noprelim. Teaching and research experience: Each student is required tospend the equivalent of one year in a half-time teaching or researchassistant position. II. Requirements after Reaching Candidacy Third year paper: All Ph.D. students are required to enrollin Econ 695-696 during their third year. In these courses, each studentis expected to complete a research paper of "publishable quality" with theassistance of an assigned faculty supervisor. The paper should be no morethan twenty-five pages long. Each paper must be approved by two facultysupervisors, on a pass/fail basis. If the supervisors disagree on thegrading as of September of the student's fourth year or later, then thestudent can ask the Director of Graduate Studies to appoint a third readerwhose word is final. A failed paper can be revised and resubmitted, butonly three separate submissions of a paper will be considered. Seminar registration: All 4+ year students are required to enroll for one of the field seminars are are encouraged to enroll at the earliest possible time when their schedules permit. Students registered in a seminar should participate actively in the seminar to merit course credit and are urged to present their own research to the seminar. The specific requirements for each seminar will be chosen by the faculty running that seminar. When students in 4+ find it difficult to register due to financial constraints or conflicts with other course commitments, they must seek a waiver from the Director of Graduate Studies. Proposal defense: Each student must successfully defend athesis proposal before a committee approved by the thesis chairman,preferably including four faculty members. A student must havesuccessfully defended a proposal to be ranked in Group 1 for GSIeligibility in a student's fifth year, to be ranked in Group 2 in thestudent's sixth year, and to be ranked in Group 3 in later years. Final thesis defense: If the final thesis defense occurs morethan seven years after the student first enrolled in the Department, thenthe Director of Graduate Studies must approve the awarding of a degree. III. Rules for Assignment of Graduate Student Instructors Eligibility for a GSI assignment: All students must enroll for the required GSI training course during the first term of employment or become ineligible for a GSI assignment during the subsequent term until the training has been completed. Students who have taken the CRLT International GSI workshop are not exempted from this requirement. Foreign-born students who currently have a score on the ELI exam of 4- on the grading scale of 1-5 are ineligible for a GSI assignment. Foreign-born students scoring 4- on the ELI exam must obtain a 4P rating from CRLT's IGSI workshop to be eligible for a GSI assignment. All that is promised is that among students with a 4P rating, we will attempt to assign in priority order. Students must have passed the theory prelim for any courses taken in their first year by May of their second year in order to be eligible to teach in the fall of their third year. Students must have passed all theory prelims by May of their third year in order to teach in the fall of their fourth year. Students who are required to pass a theory prelim in September of their 2nd or 3rd year in order to remain in the Ph.D. program are ineligible for GSI assignments in the fall semester of that year. Students who did not submit an acceptable third-year paper by May of their fourth year are ineligible for a GSI assignment. Students who have received from LSA at least tuition plus a quarter-time stipend for a teaching or research assistant position during at least ten semesters, not including spring or summer, are no longer eligible for a GSI assignment. If a student has taught at least twice and the student's latest average teaching evaluation score on question 298 ("Overall, my [graduate student] instructor is an excellent teacher") is below 2.75, he or she cannot teach the next semester, and can teach after that only if they have participated in some approved CRLT training. (First-time GSIs are exempt from this rule during their first semester teaching.) If a student has any evaluation score lower than 3.00 in any section in the previous semester, the GSI must accept the supervision of CRLT personnel to continue teaching in the subsequent semester. The most recent TA rankings will be used to determine any term's GSI assignment. GSIs with an average ranking below 3.00 who do not accept CRLT supervision will not be assigned a GSI position. Students whose latest TA evaluation is below 3.00, or who have not taught before, are ineligible to teach during the spring or summer semesters. In response to severe complaints about a GSI from the faculty member in the course, a GSI may be disallowed from teaching the following semester, or allowed to teach only with the assistance of CRLT personnel. When a faculty member is unhappy about the performance of a TA, the first step will be to inform the GSI of the nature of the problem in writing, so that the GSI has a chance to rectify the problem. The faculty member should also inform the Graduate Chair and the instructors in the Department's GSI training course. If the problem is severe enough, current GEO rules provide for remedies during the semester. In any case, if the faculty member recommends that the GSI not be allowed to teach the following semester, the case will go to an ad hoc committee composed of the Graduate Chair, the Associate Chair, and the instructors in the Department's GSI training course. Students with a GPA below 5.00 are ineligible to be GSIs. GSIs assigned to Economics 101 and 102 are required to attend all staff meetings and lab training sessions in addition to meeting scheduled sections, lecture section, and office hours. The GSI will be warned only once and if these obligations are not met and problems continue, as determined by the faculty in charge of the course, the student will be ineligible to be hired for a term. All other applicants are eligible. Division of applicants into six priority groups: All applicants for teaching assistant positions, who have maintained adequate teaching records, will be assigned to one of six groups based on the following rules. Here, GPA refers to GPA in the Ph.D. program. First-year students: Group 0, if awarded a GSI position by the admissions committee Second-year students: Group 1, if passed all appropriate theory prelims by May, or if GPA at least 6.0 Group 2, if not Group 1, but GPA at least 5.0 Third-year students: For Fall Term: Group 1, if passed both theory prelims by May, or if GPA at least 6.0 Group 2, if not Group 1, but GPA at least 5.0 Group 4, if not passed theory prelim for which courses were taken during 1st year For Winter Term: Group 1, if in addition passed one field prelim by September Group 2, if not Group 1, but GPA at least 5.0 Fourth-year students: For Fall Term: Group 1 if passed all prelims Group 2 if passed all but one field prelim For Winter Term: Group 1 if passed all prelims and third-year paper approved by Sept. of fourth year Group 2 if passed all but one field prelim and third year paper approved by Sept. of fourth year Group 2 if passed all prelims and third-year paper not approved by Sept. of fourth year Group 3 otherwise Fifth-year students: Group 1 if thesis proposal approved Group 2 if not Group 1 Sixth-year students: Group 2 if thesis proposal approved Group 4 otherwise Later-year students: Group 3 if thesis approved Group 4 otherwise Other applicants: Group 5 Students who received their Ph.D. after January of the previous academic year are assigned groups ignoring their graduation. Within group ranking The ranking within groups will be based on the following rules: Groups 1-4: Let TAR_i= the student's average TA rating in the most recent term, except for first semester teaching Let avg(TAR) = the average of the TAR_i among these applicants Let sd(TAR) = the standard deviation of the TAR_i Let sd(GPA) = the standard deviation of GPA If a student has not taught twice, let TAR_i = avg(TAR) Rank of students based on: [2*GPA_i+TAR_i*sd(GPA)/sd(TAR)]/3 Group 5: At the discretion of the Director of Graduate Studies Priority rules for assignment of GSIs All qualified applicants in the Group i will be assignedbefore any applicants in Group (i+1). While, in practice, every attempt will be made to assign applicantsto their preferred courses, nothing is promised. In making GSI offers to entering students, the intent is to tryto assure that continuing students in Group 1 who will wish GSI jobsthe following year will be able to get them, and also to assure thatall GSI positions can get filled appropriately with Ph.D. students inGroups 3 or better.

(The contents of this document were last modified on July 31, 1996.) This guide presents a variety of information about requirementsand bureaucratic matters relating to the Ph.D. program in economics. Itis important to remember that a number of funding possibilities outsidethe University require students to be advanced to candidacy and/or tohave successfully defended a proposal and/or completed a Master'sdegree. Any questions in regards to the graduate program, particularlymaterial not covered in this guide but which should have been, should beaddressed to Mary Braun in Room 250 Lorch. Also ask those questions thatremain about the material covered. Now just sit back, relax, anddiscover the wonderful world of bureaucracy. Contents Prelims Cognates Master's Degree Registration between course work and candidacy Faculty Section Numbers Independent reading course Visiting a course Incompletes Travel Grants Research Assistantships Graduate Student Instructors Graders and Hourly Employees Candidacy Proposal Defense Dissertation Committee Membership Commonly Used Acronyms ABD--a student who has completed All But Dissertation in the Ph.D. program CV--curriculum vitae, an academic job resume GEO--Graduate Employees Organization (the GSI union) GSI--Graduate Student Instructor (formerly a "teaching assistant") II-- International Institute (3rd floor Lorch) SPP--School of Public Policy (4th floor Lorch) LS&A--College of Literature, Science, and Arts. The Economics Department is in this College. Prelims Prelims are given twice a year, May and September. All students mustregister if they are going to take either a field or theory prelim by thedeadline, which is typically a month or so before the exam. Theregistration and deadline are announced via e-mail and posted on flyersoutside the Graduate Student Lounge and Room 250. It is necessary forstudents to register in order to be assigned a number (the prelims aregraded blindly) and in the case of field prelims, to determine which fieldcommittees need to be formed. There is no penalty for registering andthen not taking the exam. It is best to inform Mary Braun if you will notbe taking the exam so that no one is kept waiting for you to show up, buteven that is not required. Prelims must be passed on the scheduleoutlined in the "Rules and Regulations of theGraduate Program". You are encouraged to take advantage of everyopportunity you have to take a prelim. The number under which you registered will be on the copy of the examthat is given to you. You use that number on your bluebook (you'reresponsible for bringing the bluebook, not the department) instead of yourname as well as the name of the field and the date. In the case of themacro and micro prelims, you are asked to answer each question in aseparate bluebook. This is not necessary for the field prelims. Theprelims are often photocopied to be read by faculty outside of Ann Arbor(particularly during May) so you are encouraged NOT to write on both sidesof the page, to use ink, and to write clearly. Prelim results are announced in a letter from the Director of GraduateStudies or the Chair. This letter is held in Room 250 to be picked up forabout two days (announcement that the letter is available goes out one-mail). Any letters not picked up in that time are mailed out to theaddress left with Mary Braun. You can also call or e-mail her for resultsif you wish. Students who know they will be out of Ann Arbor before theresults are available can have their letter mailed immediately. You canalso request your letter be picked up by whomever you designate. Prelim grading timelines vary considerably across fields and acrossindividual committee members. Results have been announced in as soon as aday and as long as four weeks. Individual results are not posted. Pass/fail rates are posted. Students can pick up copies of past prelims for review at any time inRoom 250. The micro and macro theory prelim answers are also available. Written answers to the field prelims are not prepared and therefore notavailable. Cognates Every student advanced to candidacy and/or awarded a Master'sdegree in Economics must complete two cognate courses. This is aRackham requirement. Econ 673 counts as one cognate since it iscross-listed as Stat 505. You do not need to register the course asStat 505 to get cognate credit. Most LS&A departments give graduatecredit for any 400-level course they offer to students outside their owndiscipline. You may need to register for that course for graduatecredit, however, to have it count as a cognate. Sometimes, taking a400-level course for graduate credit involves additional work. Studentsshould check with the department that is offering the course to confirmthat the course 1) is approved for graduate credit and 2) if there isadditional work required of students taking it for graduate credit. Any undergraduate course that has been approved for graduatecredit, any graduate course in another department, or a cross-listedgraduate-level economics course will fulfill this requirement. Therequirement is to complete 4 hours of cognate work. Master's Degree Students have finished a Master's degree in Economics if theyhave taken two theory courses (601-604); Econ 653, 654, 673, and 674 orthe equivalency exam in those courses; two cognate courses; and twofield courses. The field courses can be either a sequence or twodistinct fields. You must have 30 credit hours on your transcript to beawarded a Master's and have at least a B (5.00) GPA. Students are encouraged to apply for a Master's as soon as theappropriate course work is complete. Many fellowships offered outside thedepartment and summer internships require applicants to have completed aMaster's degree. In addition, you will want to note on your CV (resume),that you have completed a Master's degree. You can only do this if it isposted on your transcript. It is only posted on your transcript ifyou applied and received it. If you do not apply for it when youfirst complete the coursework, you can still apply any term after that. However, the date you apply for the degree is the one posted on yourtranscript; it will not be back-dated to the date you actually finishedthe Master's degree course requirement. Application forms are available by the bulletin board outsideRoom 250 Lorch and should be turned into that office. If theapplication is turned in less than two months before the degree isgranted, you will still receive the Master's, but your name will not beprinted in the Convocation program. Degrees are awarded for April,August, and December. Registration after you've completed the required coursework butbefore candidacy All students working as a Graduate Student Research Assistant,Graduate Student Instructor, or Staff Assistant must be registered for at leastsix hours during the term of their appointment, regardless of thefraction of that appointment. If you have completed all the requiredcoursework but are not a candidate, you can register for Econ 990 with aselection from 1 to 8 hours. If you don't want to enroll for anythingbut Econ 990, you would register for 6 hours. If you have one course totake, you can register for 3 hours of Econ 990 which brings yourregistration for that term to 6 hours. Again, you have to fill in thesection number of the faculty you will be working on yourpre-dissertation research. You should both have the same understandingof just what this pre-dissertation research will encompass during theterm since the faculty will be turning in a grade sheet at the end ofthe term for this course. Faculty Section Numbers Every faculty has a section number assigned and a list of those numbers is posted on the bulletin board across from room 250 Lorch. Independent reading course Any student who has worked out an independent reading coursewith an appropriate faculty member registers for Econ 700, the section number of the faculty, and a selection of 1 to 8 credit hours (typically 3 credit hours). Visiting a course You can enroll in any graduate economics course as a visitinstead of credit. Each faculty determines the parameters of the visitstatus for their own course and it is important that you talk to thefaculty prior to enrolling. Your transcript will list the course gradeas VI. The VI never turns into a grade or figures into your grade pointaverage. The same tuition charge is assessed for a visit as it is forcourses taken for credit. Incompletes Individual faculty are responsible for setting the incompletepolicy for their own course. You must talk to the faculty to come to anunderstanding that an incomplete will be given for any particular courseand just what remains to be completed. There is no time limit forcompleting the work unless imposed by the faculty. The faculty turns inan I on the grade sheet and that I appears as the grade on yourtranscript. Once the work has been completed, that I is crossed out onthe transcript and the grade you received is posted beside it. Travel Grants Rackham provides some travel grant money for students who aredelivering a paper at a conference. The money for this program is in the process of being transferred to the department and details about the program will be publicized when they become available. The Department will award $150 plus 1/2 of the remaining travel expenses up to $300 if a student is presenting a paper at the meeting of a recognized economic organization. The department travel award is available only once tostudents over the course of their program and can't be used to give orattend seminars at other universities. Research Assistantships Research assistants are hired on an ad hoc basis by individualfaculty using whatever criteria they feel are appropriate. Researchassistants at .25 fraction and above receive a full tuition waiver,GradCare health insurance, and a stipend based on their fraction. Mostresearch assistants are hired by word of mouth among the faculty andthey are the best source of information about who among them have such aposition available. Occasionally, a research assistant position will beposted on e-mail, outside Room 250 Lorch, or outside the office of the faculty advertising the position. Graduate Student Instructors Graduate Student Instructors are hired by the graduate program in theprocedure outlined in the "Rules and Regulations of the Graduate Program". GSIs are hired by term. Applications are typically available outside ofRoom 250 Lorch early in April for the following fall term. If you areinterested in teaching only in the winter term, check with the graduateprogram office in October. There are only a few GSI positions available inthe Spring or Summer term and only those with prior teaching experienceare eligible. Graders and Hourly Employees Faculty often advertise for Ph.D. students to work as hourlyemployees or graders. Graders differ from GSIs because they are notworking the same set of hours every week of the term. Many times anadvertised research assistant position is really a temporary hourlyposition. Although the duties fall under a research assistant title, theposition is only funded to allow a student to be paid X number ofdollars per hour and the student turns in the number of hours worked ona bi-weekly basis. If you are offered either of these positions, youmust complete the necessary paperwork in the Main Office, Room 238 Lorchbefore you can be paid. Candidacy To be advanced to candidacy, Ph.D. students in economics musthave the following requirements completed: Passed the micro theory prelim Passed the macro theory prelim Passed two field prelims Completed Econ 653, 654, 673, 674 with a grade of B- or above or passed the equivalency exam Completed two cognate courses with a grade of B- or above. If you have taken Econ 673, this counts as a cognate since it is cross-listed as Stat 505. You do not have to be registered in Stat 505 to get credit for this as a cognate. Completed a course in either Econ 675, 677, 775, 776, or 75X with a grade of B- or above The graduate program office prepares the paperwork for Rackhamfor students to be advanced to candidacy. It is a good idea to let theoffice know when you have completed the requirements (or within a termof completing) just to make sure that the paperwork is being done. The term you get advanced to candidacy, you register for 8 hoursof Econ 995. The section number should be the faculty member who is the chair of your committee. (The list of faculty and their numbers is posted on the bulletin board across from Room 250 Lorch.) Since few folks know who this is the first term they are advanced to candidacy,you should enroll with a faculty member in your major research field.Always check with the faculty you have chosen before you register. Eachfaculty has their own expectation of what dissertation research involvesin any given term. Since the faculty turn in a grade sheet (markedS-satisfactory or U-unsatisfactory) at the end of the term, it is veryimportant that both of you understand just what constitutes satisfactoryprogress during the term. If you are registering before your candidacy paperwork has beenprocessed through Rackham, you must register for 8 hours of Econ 990with the same section number procedure outlined above. Once theregistrar gets notice via the computer from Rackham's database, yourelection will automatically be changed to the correct Econ 995registration. Why get advanced to candidacy as soon as you can: to savemoney. Candidacy fees are substantially less than out-state tuition.Even if you are not picking up the tab, graduate students who arecandidates are much more attractive hires for faculty recruitingresearch assistants since the tuition charge is less. In addition,several fellowship programs and internships require applicants to becandidates. The department encourages students to become candidates assoon as possible in their academic careers. Candidates can enroll for one free course every term. You cantake this free course for credit or as a visit. Candidates areencouraged to enroll for the field seminar that is most appropriate fortheir research interest each term. If there is a term in which thecandidate enrolls only for dissertation research, you can enroll for twofree courses in any subsequent term. You can not register for two freecourses the first time you become a candidate with the expectation thatyou will not take any courses in the next term. If a student enrollsfor Econ 995 and two courses in the first term of candidacy or when theyhave not "banked" a course from a previous term, the studentwill be charged full-time out-state tuition. Proposal Defense All students must defend a proposal by September 30 of the yearthey go on the job market. What is a proposal? It is whatever yourcommittee, and particularly your committee chairperson, says it is. Theproposal defense is entirely within the province of the department.Therefore, you do not need to be registered for the term in which youdefend your proposal. There is, however, a proposal defense form thatyour committee completes and returns to the graduate program office. Thestudent must also turn in a copy of the proposal to the graduate programoffice. The graduate program recommends that all members of thedissertation committee attend the proposal defense. However, this isoften not the case. Many proposal defenses do not include one or moremembers of the committee due to scheduling difficulties or uncertaintyover the cognate member. The dissertation chair determines whatconstitutes appropriate attendance at the proposal defense. The adviceof the graduate program office would be to caution the student that itis important that all members of the dissertation committee be clearabout the topic and the direction of your research. A proposal defense can be graded as a Pass; Pass II, subject toapproval of suggested minor changes; Provisional Pass, subject toapproval of major changes; and Rejection. A student expecting to go onthe job market must have obtained either a Pass or Pass II at theirproposal defense. In order to remain in Group 1 for a graduate student instructorposition, a student must successfully defend his or her proposal by thebeginning of the fifth year. Dissertation Committee Membership All dissertation committees must have at least four members. Atleast two of those must be faculty in the economics department. You canhave as many committee members (over the four required) that you thinkappropriate. However, you should be aware that the more committeemembers, the greater the likelihood of encountering scheduling difficulties.You must have one cognate member on your committee. The cognate membermust have a regular appointment in a Rackham department. You can havemembers of your committee that are not associated with the University orwith a Rackham department, but they can not be the sole chair of thecommittee or the cognate member. Every member of your dissertationcommittee must have a Ph.D. Your dissertation committee must be approved by Rackham.Typically, the graduate program office completes the paperwork once youhave defended your proposal using the names listed on the proposal form.However, if you defended your proposal without a complete committee,this can't be done. There is no notification to your dissertationcommittee members that they have been nominated or approved for thisservice. A dissertation committee can be changed at any time. Rackhamrequires all students to have their dissertation committee approvalforms completed prior to a format check. Back to the previous page.... Comments or questions on this server?

TheDepartment's faculty and graduates have long been involved in leadingdevelopments in research and teaching and in governmental economicpolicies. The graduate programs are designed to continue this tradition,by providing their students with rigorous analytical and practicaltraining. The Department offers two major programs, one leading to the Ph.D.degree in Economics, the other leading to the Master of Arts degree inApplied Economics (MAE). The Ph.D. program in Economics at Michigan has a long history andmany distinguished alumnae and alumni. Designed primarily to trainprofessional economists, its emphasis is on the theoretical core of thediscipline, and its applications together with the essential researchskills. In order to ensure that the quality of students is high and thatthey have close contact with the faculty, new enrollment each year islimited to about twenty-five entrants. Most elective classes are smalland permit extensive class participation. The sequence of core coursesprovides an intensive basic preparation in the discipline, while advancedcourses, seminars, and research opportunities are offered in a widevariety of specialized fields. The doctoral student will ordinarily devote the first two years tocoursework, independent reading, and preparation for the preliminaryexaminations. The theory exams are normally completed by the end of thefirst year or at the beginning of the second, and the applied field examsby the end of the second year or at the beginning of the third. Theremaining years are devoted primarily to the dissertation. The timerequired to write a dissertation varies so widely that it is difficult togeneralize about it. For those who work part-time as teaching assistants,it normally takes three to four years. The Master's program in Applied Economics, as the name implies, is apolicy-oriented program, with emphasis on the application of economictools and concepts to practical problems arising in a variety of fields. Enrollment is limited to about twenty new entrants each year. Students inthis program ordinarily require one year to complete their work. The integrated programs of study and research described in thisbrochure are designed to bring students into the mainstream of moderneconomics by offering them the opportunity to work with leading scholars. The programs are also designed so as to provide substantial flexibility insetting up a course of study fitted to the student's interests. Theyoffer the student distinguished--in some cases, unique--resources in eachof many specialized fields and techniques. The Department also participates in a rich variety ofinter-departmental programs, including survey research, populationstudies, natural resources, health economics, urban studies, law andeconomics, social work and economics, and regional studies. All these programs naturally endeavor to develop high skills inanalysis, research, and expression. But they aim also to encourage thestudent's originality and independence of mind in seeking out andcontributing to economic issues of genuine significance. (Back to Table of Contents...) THE PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN ECONOMICS Admission is limited to students whose undergraduate record showsgenuine capacity for advanced work in the field of economics. A fulleconomics major is not a prerequisite, but some previous training ineconomics is essential (the intermediate level micro- and macroeconomictheory courses are the most important). Training in calculus, linearalgebra, and probability and statistics is also essential and gradesreceived in these courses are important factors in the admission decision. When appraising an applicant's scholarly promise, however, the facultylooks not merely at the academic record but also at letters ofrecommendation and the results of the Graduate Record Examination. Successful applicants will be those who appear strong by all thesecriteria. The student can best prepare for graduate work in economics by takinga broadly-based undergraduate program that includes liberal arts,mathematics, and the natural and social sciences, rather than simplyaccumulating credits in a large number of economics courses. Inparticular, prior work in advanced mathematics (especially calculus,linear algebra, and mathematical statistics) can dramatically ease thestudent's program during the first year and eliminate some requiredcourses. Because modern economics is highly quantitative, students withoutsufficient mathematical preparation often have great difficulty completingthe program. In addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School,students are expected to meet various departmental requirements. Theseare always under review and subject to revision. The following paragraphssummarize the present requirements. The First Year A student's first year in the program is devoted to the corecurriculum. A full course load would be:   Fall Term                     Winter Term  Econ 601 (micro theory)       Econ 603 (micro theory)  Econ 602 (macro theory)       Econ 604 (macro theory)   Econ 653 (mathematics)        Econ 654 (mathematics)   Econ 673 (statistics)         Econ 674 (econometrics) Thosewho are well prepared in mathematics or statistics may satisfy some or allof the math and statistics requirements by passing equivalency exams. Some students may be advised to postpone one of these courses, typicallymacroeconomics or statistics, until the second year. For example,first-year students holding teaching assistant positions normally takethree courses, as do foreign students who are required by the EnglishLanguage Institute to take supplementary courses in English. Preliminary exams are given each May and September in bothmicroeconomics and macroeconomics. All students are required to pass eachexam within a year of completing the respective course. In addition,students who do not place out of the math and statistics courses mustreceive a least a B- in each of these courses. The Second Year During the second year, since most students are teaching assistants,the normal course load is three courses. Most students complete anyremaining courses from the core curriculum during the second year, andthen take a two-course sequence in each of two "major" fields. Thecurrent list of available fields includes: Advanced Theory, EconometricTheory, Industrial Organization, International Economics, Labor Economics,Monetary Theory and Economic Stabilization, Population Studies, PublicFinance, and Transition Economics. Other fields can be arranged on a caseby case basis. Recent examples have been Health Economics, Finance, andNatural Resource Economics. Students must pass preliminary examinationsin their two major fields. These exams are normally taken in May of astudent's second year or in September of a student's third year. Bothexams must be passed by May of the fourth year. In addition to completing two "major" fields, each student must alsotake one course in a "minor" field, chosen from the above list. One ofthe three fields chosen, the two "major" fields and the one "minor" field,must be either Advanced Theory or Econometrics. This requirement isintended to insure that students are well versed in the particularresearch techniques that they will use in writing their dissertations. Finally, students are required to take two "cognate" courses, which areany courses (approved for graduate credit) in another department of theUniversity. A wide variety of courses can be used to satisfy thisrequirement. Economics 673 counts as a cognate, satisfying one of the twocourses required. Many students satisfy the requirement with a financecourse in the Graduate School of Business or a course in mathematics orstatistics. Econ 775 (Stat 575) and Econ 776 (Stat 576) may be used tosatisfy this cognate requirement. The "minor" field requirement and the cognate requirement wouldnormally be completed by the end of the second year or the middle of thethird year, depending on a student's previous course load. Courses usedto satisfy these requirements must be passed with grades of B- or better. There is no general foreign language requirement for graduatestudents in economics. However, in individual cases where a student'sarea of specialization or dissertation subject demands knowledge ofanother language, the Department will encourage the student to acquire theneeded language skills. Candidacy Once these course requirements and exams are completed, the studenthas reached "candidacy," and is ready to begin work full time on economicresearch for the dissertation. To help students make the transition from course work to research,the Department requires that students complete a relatively short researchpaper of "publishable" quality during the third year, under thesupervision of an appointed faculty member. This paper normally startsout as a paper written for a second-year course, and is then revised andstrengthened with the help of the faculty member. Third-year studentsmeet regularly in a seminar with one of two faculty supervisors to discussresearch technique and to present results of their own research. Before receiving a Ph.D., each student is required to complete asignificant research project in order to satisfy the thesis requirement. Through writing a thesis, the student develops the capacity to conceiveand formulate a research topic, to bring knowledge and techniques from therelevant fields to bear upon it, and to develop conclusions which advancescholarly understanding. Work on the dissertation also lays thefoundation for the student's own future research and professionalpublications. In many cases, the thesis will grow out of the third yearpaper. Each student will be helped on the thesis by a research advisor, andeventually by a committee of at least four faculty members. As soon as isfeasible after the thesis committee has been selected, the student writesand defends a formal dissertation proposal which describes the researchtopic and the methods to be used in the analysis. Once the committee hasaccepted the proposal, the student proceeds with the planned research. Throughout this period the student is expected to attend and take anactive part in the advanced seminar in the appropriate special field. When the dissertation is complete the student defends it in an oralexamination before the dissertation committee. Teaching and Research Assistantships Given the value of teaching and research in a student's training, theDepartment requires the equivalent of one year of half-time experience ina teaching or research assistant position. Virtually all students woulddo this even if it were not required. In order to insure that teachingand research assistant positions are available to as many students aspossible, the University also allows any one student to receivecollege-funded teaching or research assistant positions for no more thanten semesters. Most of the available teaching assistant positions are in theprinciples courses and involve three hours in class per week. The classtime is spent answering questions about the more difficult points coveredby the faculty in lecture that week and going over problem sets. Thereare also a few teaching assistant positions available in the upper-levelundergraduate and core graduate courses. Some summer teaching assistantpositions are also available. The Department also normally finances overa dozen summer RA jobs for students following their first or second yearin the program. These positions provide students substantial researchexperience early in their program and help them establish a close workingrelationship with some faculty member. Individual faculty members financeother RA positions, as do various research organizations on campusincluding the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, and the Office of Tax Policy Research. Financial Support The Department provides several types of financial aid to its Ph.D.students. Entering students are automatically considered for financialaid unless they indicate they have support from elsewhere. Teaching assistant positions: All continuing students makingsatisfactory progress should be able to obtain a teaching assistantposition. In addition, about a quarter of the students in the first-yearclass are offered teaching assistant positions, generally in theprinciples courses. All students are required to take the Department's TA training course before becoming a TA for the first time. In addition, all international students must demonstrate proficiency in the English language in an oral examination, and must successfully complete a three-week course in teaching techniques offered each May and August, to qualify for a teaching assistant position. Teaching assistantships entitle the student to a tuition waiver, and asalary which depends on the time commitment required for the position. During 1995-96, a teaching assistant position in the principles courserequired seventeen hours per week and paid a salary of $4041 per semester, plus health insurance. Fellowships: Entering American students with a strongundergraduate grade point average and high GRE scores are eligible for theUniversity's Regents Fellowship. This fellowship provides a tuitionwaiver and a generous stipend for the first two years of the student'sgraduate program, plus a guarantee of a teaching assistant position duringthe following two years, subject to the usual stipulation that the studentbe making satisfactory progress towards the degree. In addition, there are a variety of other fellowships available withthe Department and the University. Qualified minority students areeligible for generous support. A number of fellowships exist for studentsinterested in area studies (Chinese, Russian and East European, NearEastern and North African, South and Southeast Asian studies). To beeligible for these fellowships, a separate application must be submittedto the relevant Area Center before February 1 for the coming academicyear. Information and application forms may be obtained by writing to theappropriate Area Center at Lane Hall, University of Michigan. Inaddition, the Department maintains a number of attractive fellowships forthe study of the Japanese economy. Students seeking support for graduatestudy of the Japanese economy should contact the Department's JapanEconomy Program directly. Students expressing an interest in demographymay be eligible for multi-year traineeships which are offered through thePopulation Studies Center. Each year about half a dozen of our students who have reachedcandidacy receive University fellowships, allowing them to work full timeon their dissertation. Further information about these fellowships isavailable from the Department. Finally, the Department has limited funds to provide tuition waiversor small fellowships to entering students in appropriate circumstances. Of course, financial aid is also available outside the University,through the National Science Foundation, the CIC minority fellowshipsprogram, the Sloan Foundation, and through other sources. Loans: Loan funds may be available through the University to aid students who are otherwise unable to continue their graduate work.Students may also participate in the loan program of the National DefenseEducation Act of 1958. For information, contact the Office of FinancialAid, Student Activities Building, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,48109. Prizes: The John E. Parker Prize (currently $500) is awardedfor an outstanding written contribution in the area of labor economics orhuman resources. This prize is usually awarded annually. In addition,the Robert Roosa Fellowship is awarded every few years to supportdissertation research in the area of monetary economics. Professional Placement The Department actively assists its graduating doctoral students toobtain professional positions with universities and colleges, researchinstitutions, government and international agencies, and business firms. This assistance is provided routinely by those faculty members who haveworked most closely with the students, as well as by a single facultymember who, as Placement Officer of the Department, assists all doctoralstudents seeking jobs. Administrative costs of placement assistance arecovered in part by a charge to those using the service. The demand forwell-trained graduates in economics continues to be strong in the privateand government sectors. About two-thirds of our graduates end up inacademic positions. The rest find attractive jobs in internationalorganizations, the government sector, consulting firms, or occasionallyelsewhere in the private sector. Unlike graduates of many traditionalPh.D. disciplines, trained graduate economists continue to be in highdemand. The placement of doctoral students over the past five years(1990-1994) is summarized below:     Type of Institution                      Number      Nationally ranked universities 1-20        10    Other research universities                19    Liberal arts colleges                       9    Government and nonprofit organizations     13    Private industry and consulting firms       3 The Master of Arts (MA) Degree in Economics Except in special circumstances, applicants who seek only a Master'sDegree will be considered solely for the Master's Degree in AppliedEconomics (MAE), which is described below. The MA Degree in Economics isinstead ordinarily earned by students in the Ph.D. program upon successfulcompletion of a portion of their course work. Some students who areinitially admitted to the Ph.D. program may eventually choose to completeonly the requirements for the MA degree, while successful doctoralstudents earn the degree as a matter of course. Specific course requirements for the MA degree include two coretheory courses, usually Economics 601 and 602 (with an average grade of Bor better), plus appropriate training in statistics and mathematics, twoapplied field courses, and two cognate courses. Alternative courses canbe substituted with the approval of the Graduate Director. Procedures for Application APPLICATIONS FOR FALL ADMISSION MUST BE RECEIVEDBY JANUARY 15 OF THAT YEAR. There is no separate application form forfinancial aid. Entrance in the Winter or Spring-Summer Terms is approvedonly in highly unusual cases. All applicants must take the general aptitude Graduate RecordExamination and must provide three letters of recommendation fromundergraduate teachers or others in a position to evaluate the applicants'potential for graduate study. Admission and fellowship awards are usually announced by March 15,and students are asked to indicate their acceptance of fellowship offersby April 15. An enrollment deposit of $200 (non-refundable) applicable tofirst-term fees is made at this point by students who choose to enter theprogram. International Students The Department welcomes applications from talented, fully-preparedinernational students. Applicants whose native language is not English are required to take an English Language Test in their country as part of the process of admission. The Graduate School will supply informationregarding the arrangements for taking the test. Fluency in English isessential to success in the graduate program. Applicants will be admittedto the Graduate School only if their scores in the test are sufficientlyhigh. Those with clear fluency in English, as confirmed by an oralpresentation, will be eligible for teaching assistant positions. Courseson English as a foreign language are available on campus for students whodo need further training in English. International applicants face a special difficulty in gaining admission inthat members of the Department are rarely well-qualified to judge theacademic credentials of students from foreign universities. Accordingly,applicants from universities outside the United States are reminded of thenecessity of taking, through a U.S. embassy or consulate, the GraduateRecord Examination (of verbal, mathematical, and analytical achievement)offered by the Educational Testing Service. Further, it is particularlyuseful to include information about rank in class and to have letters of recommendation are written by professors whounderstand U.S. graduate schools and their requirements. All international students who come to the University of Michigan onstudent visas must certify sufficient funds to support themselves andtheir dependents, if any, while here. The International Admissions Officeof the Graduate School will provide each foreign applicant with a precisestatement of the amount of support that must be certified. International students wanting to study in the United States have at timesbeen able to secure financial aid through programs administered by theOffice of Cultural Affairs of the American Embassy. Students who wantmore information should contact that office, stating their need forfinancial assistance. (Back to Table of Contents...) THE PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS IN APPLIED ECONOMICS (MAE) This degree program is designed for students who wish to apply thetheory and techniques of economics to the analysis of practical problemsin a variety of fields. Unlike the Master of Arts Degree in Economics,the MAE is NOT an intermediate step to the Ph.D. (However, students in the program may, of course, apply to the Ph.D. program.) The MAE program addresses itself to the needs of three kinds ofstudents: (1) those who want advanced training in economics in order toqualify for jobs in government or private organizations that requiregreater expertise than is provided by an undergraduate degree, (2) thosewho wish to study economics as a complement to their work in anotherfield, and (3) those who need further background in economics, math, orstatistics, or who need to certify their ability to do graduate work ineconomics, in order to gain admission to a Ph.D. program. For the secondgroup, dual programs, including in some cases dual degrees, can combineeconomics with public health, social work, law, natural resources,demography, industrial relations, statistics, business administration, andother fields. Applicants to this program should have completed intermediate micro-and macroeconomic theory courses as well as courses in calculus andintroductory statistics. The degree is earned in a minimum of three terms and requires 33hours of graduate course work. The course sequence for the degreenormally includes two core theory courses, usually Economics 501 and 502, three courses covering some aspect of quantitative methods used ineconomics, usually including Economics 553 and 571, three courses in two different applied fields in economics, and three courses in related fields of the student's choosing. The student's overall program is chosen in consultation with the Director of the MAE program. No thesis is required and there are no examinations other than thecourse examinations. APPLICATIONS FOR SPRING ADMISSION TO THE MAE PROGRAM MUST BE RECEIVED BY MARCH 1 OF THAT YEAR. Funds for direct support of MAE students are severely limited. All applicants must take the general aptitude Graduate RecordExamination and provide three letters of recommendation from undergraduateteachers or others in a position to evaluate the applicant's potential forgraduate study. Foreign applicants should consult the previous section ofthis brochure for additional information. (Back to Table of Contents...) EXPENSES For 1995-96, tuition was $4,519 per term for Michigan residents and$9,099 for non-residents. See the Regulations of Horace H. Rackham Schoolof Graduate Studies for more information regarding fees, as well as adescription of the rules concerning residency. After the doctoral studentcompletes all necessary coursework and examinations and is advanced tocandidacy, tuition is reduced to $2,866 per term (1995-96 rates) for bothresidents and non-residents. Living costs are comparable to those atother ranking universities. A variety of university and other housing isavailable to single and married students.

Cross. A course designed for students in the MAE program. Basic models in theprincipal areas of microeconomic theory are covered: consumer demand,production and costs, product markets, factor markets, allocativeefficiency, and corrections for market failure. Most of the course isspent studying the use of these tools in the analysis of specificmicroeconomic policy problems. Application of theory to current policyproblems is stressed, and a substantial amount of class time is devoted toexercises based on such problems. Prerequisite: Intermediatemicroeconomic theory. Econ 502 Applied Macroeconomic Theory. Hymans, Johnson. A course designed for students in the MAE program. Approximatelyone-third of the course is spent reviewing and elaborating on standardmacro theory of the sort covered in an advanced undergraduate course. The remainder of the time is spent on applications of this theory to problems of stabilizing aggregate demand, unemployment and inflation, economic growth, and macroeconomics of open economies. Students will normally do a computer project involving hypothesis testing or model simulation. Prerequisite: Intermediate macroeconomic theory. Econ 555 Microeconomics. Courant, Levinsohn. A course designed for students in the SPP program. This course begins atwo-term sequence designed to provide students with an understanding ofthe economic implications of public policies and with analytic toolsuseful in system design and policy planning. Major topics includeproduction, costs, prices, resource allocation, governmental involvementin economic activity, and the operation of market systems. Prerequisite: Permission of instructor. Econ 601 Price System I. Bergstrom, Sonmez, Stacchetti. The first required microeconomic theory course for doctoral students.Topics include review of optimization theory, theory of the firm, theoryof the single market and theory of the consumer. Use of mathematicaltechniques involving calculus, paralleling those taught in Economics 653. Prerequisite: Permission of graduate director. Econ 602 Macroeconomic Theory I. Laitner. The first required macroeconomic theory course for doctoral students. Begins with an overview of aggregate income determination. Continues with an in-depth treatment of economic growth: the Solow, neoclassical, and new growth models. Proceeds with introduction of rational expectations models and techniques with application to output determination and price adjustment in closed and open economies.

Prerequisite: Econ 501 andpermission of the instructor. NATURAL RESOURCES ECONOMICS Econ 668/NR 668 Advanced Natural Resources Economics. Salant. This course reviews the literature on the pricing of natural resources(agricultural goods, renewable and nonrenewable resources and durables)overtime. The first half of the course considers resources which areprivately owned; the second half considers resources that are commonproperty. To provide a point of reference, the behavior of resourcemarkets in the absence of government intervention is studied first. Thereis then an extensive treatment of the dynamic effects on market equilibriaof widespread government policies (unanticipated, partially anticipated orfully anticipated). Policies analyzed include: bufferstocks used toaffect prices (ceilings, floors, bands, and pegs); bans, embargoes, pricecontrols and whatever else is timely or of interest to participants. Tosimplify the mathematics, discrete-time methods are used predominately. The Kuhn-Tucker theorem is utilized when studying competitive equilibrium under certainty. Dynamic-programming is used to study single-agent (planning or monopoly) problems under uncertainty (with or without learning). Multi-stage game theory is used to investigate dynamiccommon-property problems. A working understanding of these methods is developed during the course. Prerequisites: Econ 501 or 601, 653 and 654or permission of the instructor. NR 669 Advanced Environmental Economics. Salant. In the presence of pollution externalities, market allocations aretypically inefficient and corrective government regulation may bedesirable. This course first reviews Pigouvian taxes, pollution permitsand other traditional "remedies" but then points out various real-worldinformational, technological, and political constraints which make such"solutions" infeasible. The course then focuses on optimal regulatorypolicies in the presence of these real world constraints. Topicsdiscussed are likely to include 1) optimal regulation when firms possessmore information about compliance costs than regulators; 2) the law andeconomics of monitoring and enforcing compliance when monitoring iscostly; 3) collective choice of pollution control strategies (e.g. votingin pollution control organizations such as the Genossenschaften); 4) theimplementation of systems for trading pollution rights and/orsophisticated pricing schemes for controlling pollution; and 5) theinclusion of "stock effects" and other more realistic technologicalassumptions into economic models of pollution control. Prerequisites: Econ 501 or 601, 653 and 654 or permission of the instructor. Comments or questions on this server? Please see theFeedback Page.

Typically, thisstudent is in her second or third year of study. This student'sapplication is reviewed by a Rackham committee for the award. GRADER POSITION These positions may be filled by any graduate student not restrictedfrom working by a currently-held fellowship. Faculty are required toapply for grading money. Once the request has been approved, you fill outthe paperwork to be hired. You are paid a set fee per hour and turn inyour hours as they worked. Graders are not eligible for health insuranceor a partial or full tuition waiver GRADER GRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUCTOR These positions are awarded by the individual faculty who are teachingin the courses that have been assigned a position by the LS&A Dean'sOffice. Grader GSI appointments are always less than .25 and come with nohealth insurance and only a partial tuition waiver. You must be enrolledfor at least 6 credit hours for the term you hold the appointment. In thepast, they have been picked up as an addition to an existing GSI or GSRAappointment. GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP GSRAs are hired on an ad-hoc basis by individual faculty members usingwhatever criteria they feel are appropriate. Jobs may be posted any placewithin the department as well on e-mail. In most cases, positions arefilled by students who have been studying in a particular field with thefaculty who has grant money to fund a position. The GSRA works at least.25 appointment (10-12 hours weekly), has a tuition waiver and GradCarehealth insurance. GRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUCTOR POSITION GSIs are hired by the Department of Economics using a set of rulesoutlined in the "Rules and Regulations of theGraduate Program" that is distributed to first-year students andavailable in Room 250 Lorch. Typically, the deadline for applying for aFall or Winter termposition is the end of April and for applying for theSpring/Summer term the end of January. The most common GSI position is a.40 appointment (17 to 19 hours weekly) that includes a tuition waiver,health insurance, and a stipend of $4040 per term. MARY MALCOMSON RAPHAEL FELLOWSHIP The Department nominates one woman for this award on the basis ofacademic merit within the program who meets the criteria. This woman istypically in the third or fourth year of study. MOORE DISSERTATION RESEARCH PRIZE The Moore Dissertation Prize is a $1,000 award presented annually tosupport the research phase of the dissertation process. To be eligible,the student must be a candidate and have a written dissertation planapproved by at least two members of his/her committee. The student'stopic must belong to the general area of Applied Microeconomics and mustinvolve both empirical analysis and issues of public policy as anessential part of the research agenda. The deadline varies but hastypically been near the end of the Winter term. PARKER MEMORIAL PRIZE An annual competition for the John Elliot Parker Memorial Prize inLabor Economics and Human Resources with an award of $500. The prize isgiven for an outstanding written contribution in the area of laboreconomics or human resources. If no paper reaches this threshold ofexcellence, no award is given. The deadline varies but has typically beennear the end of the Winter term. RACKHAM ONE-TERM DISSERTATION FELLOWSHIP In past years, we have been able to award four one-term fellowshipsyearly. One of the awards has gone to the author of the best third-yearpaper for the Fall term of their fourth year. Otherwise, the FellowshipsCommittee has the option of dividing the awards between Fall and Winterterms as they wish. The fellowship consists of a tuition waiver, GradCarehealth insurance, and a stipend of $3600. You can only be awarded thisfellowship once and you must have a dissertation committee approved byRackham. You may not be employed during the tenure of this award. Applicants are required to submit a copy of everything they have writtenrelating to their dissertation, an outline of what remains to be written,and two letters of recommendation from faculty working on yourdissertation committee. The deadline is June 25 for the Fall Term andNovember 1 for the Winter Term. In the past, most of the awards have goneto students who are on the market for the Fall term and those likely to beon the market the following year for the Winter term. RACKHAM PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP We can nominate up to five students for the Rackham PredoctoralFellowship. These students' applications are then reviewed by a Rackhamcommittee. In the past, we have had one or two students be awarded aRackham Predoctoral Fellowship. The fellowship includes three terms of atuition waiver, GradCare health insurance, and a $12,000 stipend. You maynot be employed during the tenure of this award. Before we nominate the five students, we hold an internal competition. Students must be all completed work relating to their dissertation, anoutline of whatever remains to be completed, and two letters ofrecommendation. Typically the deadline has been at the end of November. The five students are chosen both on the strength of their academic recordand their dissertation research. The Rackham Predoctoral Award isintended to finance students during the final year of their Ph.D. work soyou m ust have support from your dissertation committee that you arewithin a year of completing your dissertation. SLOAN FOUNDATION FELLOWSHIP The Sloan Foundation Fellowship follows the guidelines for the RackhamPredoctoral Fellowship closely. However, we are limited to nominatingonly three students. Since the deadline is shortly after that for theRackham Predoctoral Fellowship, the committee recommends that the topthree students nominated for the Predoctoral are also nominated for theSloan Fellowship. All students competing for the Rackham PredoctoralFellowship are therefore also competing for the Sloan FoundationFellowship without havin g to complete any additional paperwork. SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP Funding varies but typically we have supported 20-25 students asSummer Research Fellows. Applicants are in their first or second year ofthe program. The intent is to give students first-hand experience inworking on a research project under the close supervision of a facultymember in the Department. The stipend is around $2000. To apply, the student finds a faculty member interested in workingwith them on a mutually agreeable topics. Often faculty have advertisedtopics where they are looking for assistance but you may also propose atopic to them. Once you and the faculty have agreed on a topic, write atwo-page description of the project and submit it to Room 250 Lorch byFebruary 10. The Fellowship Committee makes the funding decisions based on whichprojects appear to work best for the student. This include not only thequality of the project but also by the role the student will have in it. Where there is limited funding, preference will be given those with ahigher GPA, those who have not had a Summer RF previou sly, and tosecond-year students who will be ineligible for an award the followingsummer. TRAVEL GRANTS Travel grants up to $150 plus 1/2 of the remaining travel expenses upto a maximum of $300 are available to students who are presenting a paperat some recognized economic organization. A student can be awarded aTravel Grant only once during the length of the program and can't be usedto give or attend seminars at other institutions. FELLOWSHIPS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS There are a number of fellowships that are offered for doctoralstudents in economics that are available from outside the department. Alist of those that were advertised during the previous year is availableto be picked up in Room 250 Lorch. In addition, there is a notebook ofthe previous year's advertisements of these awards for more detailedinformation about them. This notebook and list also includes thosefellowships available through the International Institute and Rackham Graduate School. Comments or questions on this server? Please see theFeedback Page.
