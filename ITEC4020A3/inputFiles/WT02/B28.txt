He is especially concerned with religious issues and current affairs. Though I am from a Jewish background, my late father's experiences as a naval commander during the war persuaded him that if there was a great fairy in the sky he, she or it was a damned fool. He therefore became a born again evangelical atheist and raised me as a secular Jew, i.e. one who though made aware of his ethnic origins and identity was not smothered in religious gobbledegook. Accordingly, I grew up without the hindrance of undue pressure to accept irrational mythological philosophies and was therefore in a position from a fairly early age, as soon in fact as I became aware of wider social and moral issues, to appraise the respective arguments for myself without any preconceptions to cloud my judgement and colour my conclusions. Consequently, while still in my teens, I had formulated a rational personal philosophy about many matters, among them issues relating to death and dying. It seemed to me that if the consensus in society was that it was humane and appropriate to put a seriously injured or terminally ill dog painlessly out of its misery, them there could not possibly be any objection to applying the same principle to a human animal. The vast difference of course is that whereas the dog would have the decision taken for it as it would be capable neither of considering the implication of such a decision nor voicing an opinion, the human animal, being possessed of reason, intellect and communication skills, would ideally prefer to be personally involved in any such decision, particularly as there might always be the possibility that any one making such a decision for another person might not always be giving selfless consideration to the genuine needs of that individual. My father died almost twenty years ago and for the last three years of his life he existed in mental anguish. The ravages of Alzheimer's disease reduced this once strong and dignified character to a pathetic shell. His memory became so erratic that if he managed to leave the house unaccompanied he could never find his way back. Frequently he failed to recognize me and spent hours looking for Rusty, his long dead cocker spaniel. He was always very helpful about the house and usually assisted Mum by preparing the vegetables for the evening meal. However his sense of time disappeared and one night we found him downstairs around 3.00AM peeling potatoes. As if that was not bad enough, the sink was full of blood where he was quite obviously peeling as much skin off his fingers as off the potatoes. During another night I nearly flattened him. My wife and I were lying in bed sound asleep when we both awoke with a start and realised there was a prowler in the bedroom. I jumped out of bed and was just about to administer a general anaesthetic with my fist when a feeble little voice said "It's only me - I'm taking the watch tonight". Dad was back in the Navy and we started sleeping with the door locked. I am a musician and used to spend a great deal of time at home, especially in the mornings, practising, arranging scores and meeting pupils or other musicians. Dad would come into my studio when I was working to ask me to fasten his shoes or to put a knot in his tie. He would then sit on, rendering work virtually impossible. He kindly produced a cup of tea on one occasion. Unfortunately he neglected to first boil the water. One day I had to go into town to pick up some music. On returning shortly after 11.00 AM I was greeted with a rather pungent odour. Facing me on the stairs was a trail of excrement culminating in a pair of none too wholesome trousers on the landing outside the bathroom. The lavatory and walls were plastered with the stuff and dear old Dad was nowhere to be seen. I went downstairs and found him in the kitchen attempting to wash his underpants in the sink which was clogged and overflowing. "Oh, hello Son - I've had a little accident", with a smile. I wept. That was the last straw. I rang our GP and arranged for Dad to go into hospital. Two days later he was admitted to a geriatric unit where he was to remain until he died about eighteen months later. While he was in hospital he suffered a series of minor strokes. We were summoned by staff with such frequency that we began to think he would never die. After three nocturnal calls in as many weeks we told the staff that in future if we received a call during the night we would not come out until the morning. It was following such a call that he eventually died, just under an hour before we arrived at the hospital. On the many frequent occasions when we visited him we frequently thought that if ever there was an undeniable argument in favour of euthanasia, or assisted suicide, this was it. Sometimes he was lying in bed weak, helpless and uncomprehending. At other times he was conscious and moving about, but clearly confused and frankly, not my Dad. But worst of all were the few occasions on which we briefly got a glimpse of the man he once was. One such occurrence took place on Christmas Day, the year before he died. I offered to play the organ in the hospital chapel for their carol service and afterwards I visited Dad in his villa. He looked straight at me and said "Son, I hate this place. I wish I was dead." Our eyes filled up and we both began to sob. Long after Dad's death I used to ponder the question "What if the doctors caring for my father had been able to assist him to die with dignity?" I found this question often led to other questions, such as "What if his doctors had suggested to me that it might be timely to end Dad's suffering?", or "What if I had found the courage to assist him to commit suicide?" But, another question which I found a little frightening was "Do I want Dad to be released from his suffering or from mine?" You see, some times there is a danger of looking at some one you love, who is slowly dying and in great distress, and to feel such personal pain at their condition that you want them to die because you just cannot bear another minute of it. This unfortunately is only a small step away from desiring some one's death because they have become objectionable or a nuisance to look after, or costly to maintain and perhaps eating into possible legacies. It is to protect against this extra step and to minimise the possibility of any one being coerced either actively or inactively into agreeing to euthanasia that any possible legislation must be very carefully worded. Not only should the right to die in dignity be recognized and upheld by law, but the individual consciences of those persons who may be called upon to assist in acts of euthanasia, either by authorising, supplying, prescribing or procuring the means, advising on methodology, counselling or administering, must be honoured and protected. We must also recognize that for some people dying in dignity may mean seeing it through to the end. Their consciences too must be honoured and protected, and if that means providing hospices and extreme medical care then that is as it must be. Those of us who believe that we have a right to determine when our own lives are no longer worth living due to unbearable physical or mental suffering, have a right to do so, but if we are to be taken seriously and not to be labelled as dangerous cranks we must rely upon the voice of gentle persuasion and afford alternative viewpoints the same respect we seek. Once when I was visiting Dad he said "Hello Nathan, I haven't seen you for a while" (I visited him twice a week); "I'm just waiting for the liberty boat". That was the name given to the boat which took officers and crew from ship to shore and leave. I do not know if he really recognized me as his second officer, after whom I was named, was also called Nathan, but I thought "Dad, I hope your liberty boat comes in soon". It did, about three years too late.

Smith Cheryl K Smith is Legal Services Director, Oregon Rehabilitation Association and was a primary drafter of the Oregon Death With Dignity Act. She has written extensively on death and dying and has been an Honorary Research Associate to VESS since working as Interim Director and Staff Attorney for Hemlock. Here she examines the historic U.S. Judgement that has rocked the movement around the world. How did it reach its conclusions? Delighting right to die advocates and shocking opponents, on 7 March 1996, the 9th Circuit Federal Court ruled 8-3 that Washington state's law which prohibits "aiding" in suicide violates the US Constitution. This was the first ruling by a federal appeals court in support of physician-assisted suicide. It opens the door for doctors to begin responding to requests from dying patients to help end their suffering. It also may accelerate removal of the injunction that has held up the implementation of Oregon's Death with Dignity Act for the past year and a half. Although technically confined to the nine states within the 9th Circuit's jurisdiction, the detailed analysis of the arguments at such a high level is sure to reverberate in courts around the world. Judge Stephen Reinhardt noted in the ruling that the decision applies only to "the prescription of life-ending medication for use by terminally ill, competent adult patients who wish to hasten their deaths." The opinion did not reach the issue of whether physicians may administer such drugs. Despite that, anti-euthanasia campaigners immediately began painting pictures of the involuntary euthanasia of innocents they claim will occur if we allow dying people to "determine the time and manner" of their death. US District Judge Barbara Rothstein, in 1994, had previously ruled the Washington law unconstitutional, but a three-judge panel of the appeals court had overrruled that decision a year ago in a 2-1 decision. In an unusual turn of events, a majority of the entire appeals court then voted to refer the case to the 11-judge panel for a rehearing, and this ultimately generated the affirmation of Judge Rothstein's original decision. The well-reasoned and comprehensive majority opinion ( Compassion in Dying v. State of Washington, No. 94-35534), is morethan 100 pages in length. While the decision is significant in itself and is expected to be widely cited throughout the United States, it applies directly only to those states and territories in the 9th Circuit - Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam and the Northern Marianas. As a result the decision had no effect on the concurrent trial of Dr. Kevorkian.(1) In arriving at its holding, the court first had to determine whether a liberty interest in choosing the time and manner of one's death exists, and then to balance that against any state interests. It relied heavily on previous abortion cases to make out a liberty interest, in particular Planned Parenthood v. Casey.(2) Casey characterized the type of liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment as a matter "involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime," a choice that is "central to personal dignity and autonomy".(3) This writer believes that to be a very apt description of the right to choose to end one's life when suffering a terminal illness. Finding a liberty interest Here we need to examine the technical methods which the court used to navigate through the ethical and legal minefields. In order to determine whether a liberty interest exists, the court relied on a "substantive due process test", first used in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), a famous contraceptives case.(4) Under such an analysis, interests are seen on a continuum, where "the more important a right or interest, the more persuasive the justifications for infringement" must be. This is in contrast to what may be referred to as a multi-tiered scrutiny approach, in which interests are first determined to be "fundamental" or "nonfundamental" and then the standard for review is applied. If a right is considered fundamental, the level of review - called "strict scrutiny" - requires that an overriding state interest be "compelling" and "necessary" to achieve the end. In other cases only a rational relationship between the statute and legitimate state interest is required to find the statute constitutional.(5) The court noted, however, that whether the substantive due process test or the multi-tiered approach is used, the interest in this case clearly rises beyond the level at which the lesser rational basis review is appropriate. The court goes on to note that previous failure to recognize the existence of a certain liberty interest, or even previous prohibition of its exercise, does not preempt recognitionof its existence. They cite laws previously overturned, including those against interracial marriage and abortion. This parallels the situation with laws against assisted suicide, which currently exist in over half of the states. Clearly, acceptance or prohibition of practices in the past alone is not enough to preempt recognition of a liberty interest relating to those practices in the present. As part of the inquiry regarding whether the right to assisted suicide is an important liberty interest, the court provides an extensive review of the history of suicide and how it was viewed in various cultures. Rather than being totally prohibited throughout history, suicide has been considered acceptable, if not honorable, at times. Even when disapproved of, exceptions existed. The most notable exception appears over and over throughout this review - in cases where an individual is suffering from illness. Even while it may have been considered wrong, or resulting from a mental disorder, in most states neither suicide nor attempted suicide has been criminalized since the turn of the century; and no state currently prohibits either by means of statute. After discussing recent polls that indicate societal approval of suicide or assisted suicide in cases of terminal illness, and comparing the refusal of treatment to assisted suicide, the majority moves its analysis to prior relevant court decisions which were decided between 1925 and the present. All these cases involved "decisions that are highly personal and intimate, as well of great importance to the individual", and the court correctly noted that "few decisions are more personal, intimate or important than the decision to end one's life, especially when the reason for doing so is to avoid excessive and protracted pain." They rest their conclusion that "a liberty interest in controlling the time and manner of one's death is a protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment", citing two major cases - Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992) and Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. Of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990) (this latter was the historic case that lead to the introduction of living will legislation and concerned a woman in persistent vegetative state after a car crash). The language of Casey, which reasserted the liberty interest of women in obtaining an abortion, is most persuasive in making the case that such decisions are protected by the Due Process Clause: "These matters, involving the intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heartof liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State." Although that case was referring to abortion, the language could have easily have been about the right to choose to die. In fact, an arguably stronger case exists in this context, because only the individual whose life it is, not a fetus, is implicated in the decision. Further supporting the court's contention that such decisions are protected was the Nancy Cruzan case, which dealt with the refusal of unwanted medical treatment. The court concluded that "Cruzan, by recognizing a liberty interest that includes the refusal of artificial provision of life-sustaining food and water, necessarily recognizes a liberty interest in hastening one's own death." Because the intent in both cases is death, with the only difference being that one patient is being maintained by artificial life support and the other not, it logically follows that both would be encompassed by such a liberty interest. Balancing interests The court goes on to identify six state interests that must be balanced against an individual's liberty interest in controlling the time and manner of his or her death. These include: A general interest in preserving life An interest in preventing suicide An interest in avoiding the involvement of third parties and in precluding the use of arbitrary, unfair, or undue influence An interest in protecting family members and loved ones An interest in protecting the integrity of the medical profession An interest in avoiding adverse consequences that might ensue if the statutory provision at issue is declared unconstitutional.I will touch on the court's response to some of these issues below. Preserving life According to the majority, the state's general interest in preserving life is not always the most important factor, and may vary in strength according to the particular case. The individual's medical condition and his or her wishes are particularly important. The court harkened back to the "living will" statute, which determined that the state's interest in preserving life should give way to the wishes of a competent, terminally ill adult who refuses medical treatment. As they so aptly put it, "When patients are no longer able to pursue liberty or happiness and do not wish to pursue life, the state's interest in forcing them to remain alive is clearly less compelling." They did not, however, rule out the imposition of safeguards on decision making. Preventing suicide In justifying its statute, the state of Washington relied primarily on the argument that its interest in preventing suicide outweighs the interest of a competent, terminally ill individual to commit suicide. The court found this interest a relatively easy obstacle to overcome, by reasoning that "not only is the state's interest in preventing such individuals from hastening their deaths of comparatively little weight, but its insistence on frustrating their wishes seems cruel indeed." In analyzing the issue of whether physicians should be allowed to assist patients, the court carefully elaborated on the evolving ethical and legal line-drawing that has taken place over the years, and concluded that just as "ordinary" versus "extraordinary" treatment are not valid distinctions, neither is the distinction between "double effect" and physician assisted suicide. In a similar vein, they reasoned (disingenuously perhaps) that just as termination of tube feeding is not to be considered "suicide", neither should "terminally ill patients taking medication prescribed by their doctors" be so labelled.(6) They also gave credence to the phenomenon well-known to those of us in the right to die movement of dying individuals choosing not to end their lives when they are secure in the knowledge that they have the means to do so if desired. Avoiding involvement of 3rd parties and undue influence In discussing these two areas of concern, the court focused mainly on i)the various slippery slope arguments that the dissenting judges found so enticing, ii)the argument that we must first have universal health care, and iii)the claim that physicians will become hardened to death, rejecting them all. Protecting Families The court rightly noted that "witnessing a loved one suffer a slow and agonizing death as a result of state compulsion is more likely to harm than further the interests of innocent third parties." Although not mentioned, I would add that knowing your dying loved one is planning to end his or her life with a doctor's assistance is also likely to be much lessshocking and painful than finding the results of a failed or violent suicide. Protecting the integrity of the medical profession The court concluded that the integrity of the medical profession is not at risk with lawful physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill. They noted that the current situation criminalizes attending to the needs of patients and so creates conflict with professionalism, or making criminals of compassionate doctors whom we know are now helping their patients. Recognizing the right to assisted-suicide would not mandate that doctors do anything contrary to their ethics either, according to the court. Balancing In balancing these interests against the liberty interest, the court first considered the strength of the liberty interest in this case. They found that "when a mentally competent adult is terminally ill, and wishes, free of any coercion, to hasten his death because his remaining days are an unmitigated torture, that person's liberty interest is at its height." Conversely, the court found that the state interests were "for the most part at a low point" in this case. They also noted that the interests in preventing assisted suicide were "different only in degree and not in kind from its interests in prohibiting a number of other medical practices that lead directly to a terminally ill patient's death." In applying the balancing test, the judges were convinced, in part, by "specific testimony involving individual patients" (see sidebar), as well as various publicized accounts of individuals who were unable to obtain a doctor's assistance, that the statute was unconstitutionally burdensome. A state may make reasonable regulations to promote the state interests but not make a blanket prohibition. While not prescribing specific regulations that would pass scrutiny under the Constitution, the majority did refer to the Oregon Death with Dignity Act and other model acts, as well as mentioning a number of procedural safeguards that might be appropriate. These include witnessing, a waiting period, second medical opinion, psychological examinations, and reporting requirements to prevent abuse. Finally, the court considered the decision in the case of Lee v. State of Oregon, 891 F.Supp. 11429 (D. Or. 1995), which held the Oregon Death with Dignity Act to be unconstitutional. They felt that the reasoning of Judge Hogan was incorrect, noting that it was antithetical to their own reasoning. Specifically, they stated: "The Oregon District Court's reasoning conflicts squarely with the reasoning of this opinion and the legal conclusions we have reached. Here, we determine that a statute that prohibits doctors from aiding terminally ill persons to hasten their deaths by providing them with prescription medications unconstitutionally burdens the liberty interests of the terminally ill. The benefit we conclude the terminally ill are entitled to receive in this case--the right to physician-assisted suicide--is precisely what Judge Hogan determined to be a burden and thus unlawful. In short, Lee treats a burden as a benefit and a benefit as a burden. In doing so, Judge Hogan clearly erred. Lee not only does not aid us in reaching our decision, it is directly contrary to our holding." Dissents and other problems In addition to procedural issues, which I will not discuss here, the three dissenting judges in the case gave a variety of reasons why the Washington state law should not be considered unconstitutional. These include usurpation of the rights of states to regulate the practice of medicine, a version of the slippery slope argument, a claim that the public disapproves of suicide as evidenced by current laws, and most worrisome, that no fundamental right is implicated, and the abortion cases cited by the majority to justify its use of substantive due process analysis actually reflected the Supreme Court's attempt to abide by previous decisions. At least one commentator has expresssed concern over the court's use of the substantive due process standard in this case, because it is vague, appears to be based on the values of the judges that made the decision, and is related to an historical abuse of judicial power.(7) While such fears may be valid, another equally valid concern is that if the decision is appealed, the Supreme Court will characterize the right at issue here in such a way as to deem it not fundamental. In fact, in his dissent Judge Beezer suggests that inquiry in this case should be whether we have a "fundamental right to commit physician-assisted suicide" rather than the right to control the time and manner of one's death identified by the majority. He also mentions a notoriously wrong-headed opinion by a severely divided Supreme Court in 1986, Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, as a basis for his conclusions.8 In that case, the court indicated a reluctance to expand the rights that are considered fundamental. In order to be recognized as fundamental, an interest would have to be essential to ordered liberty and be "deeply rooted in history and tradition." Clearly, physician assisted suicide for people with terminal illness would fail the latter test, just as the right to abortion would have failed had the same requirements been applied when Roe v. Wade (the abortion case at the root of current American law on termination) was decided. Where are we now? We undoubtedly have not heard the end of the debate on the law of physician-assisted suicide in the United States, despite this historic ruling. A similar appeal of a negative ruling has been made to the 2nd Circuit District Court in New York and on a similar statute. If that Circuit's ruling conflicts with this one, we can expect the U.S. Supreme Court to settle the issue. In addition, if the Washington Attorney General decides to appeal this case to the Supreme Court, we could potentially see a temporary injunction against physician-assisted suicide as well as a different ruling. As to Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, it has been sent back to Judge Hogan by the 9th Circuit for a rehearing. It, too, may end up with the U.S. Supreme Court. Two of the nine states covered by the 9th Circuit Court, Nevada and Idaho, have no law against assisted suicide on the books; all the others do. Only one of the states - Oregon - has a statute that regulates physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, and it is enjoined from implementation. Both right to die advocates and opponents now have an opportunity, and even a sense of urgency, to work together to assure that physician-assisted suicide legislation with reasonable regulations and adequate safeguards is passed. References 1. Kevorkian's recent acquittal of assisting in the suicides of two people was determined by a jury, rather than a judge, who most likely had no knowledge of the specifics of the 9th circuit decision. Their decision hinged on the fact that the current law in Michigan is confusing, and citizens of that state see Kevorkian as a hero, not a criminal. (The technical term for acquitting a person who is otherwise guilty of a crime is jury nullification.) 2. 112 S.Ct. 2791(1992). 3. Id at 2807. 4. The court noted that recent cases suggest that "the Court may be heading towards the formal adoption of the continuum approach, along with a balancing test, in substantive due process cases generally." 5. The practical effect of rational review is that virtually any statute will be found constitutional; any state interest will justify the statute. Conversely, characterization of a right as "fundamental" tips the scales in the other direction. 6. This argument is clearly specious, considering the literal meaning of the word "suicide"--the intentional ending of one's own life. If the intent and the act are present it is suicide, albeit rational suicide, regardless of what we choose to call it and regardless of our discomfort with the implications. 7. Prof Charles Baron, private communication, by email.8. In a 5-4 decision, the court found that there was no "fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy." Dissenters in that case noted that the right under consideration was actually a "right to be let alone." They believed that neither the fact that religious groups were opposed to the practice nor the fact that laws against it had been in place for a long time were adequate grounds to allow a state to ban it. ADDENDA: The Attorney-General of Washington State lodged an appeal to the US Supreme Court on 25th March against the March 6, l996, decision of the 9th Circuit Appeal Court that the Washington state law forbidding physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill is unconstitional. (Whether the Supreme Court chooses to take the case remains to be seen, but given its controversial nature it is most likely to.) Judge Michael Hogan has denied the motion to immediately dismiss his injunction blocking Measure 16 (The Oregon Death With Dignity Act, permitting physician-assisted suicide, approved by voters in l994). Instead he has scheduled a full hearing for April 24 to hear arguments for and against dismissal of the injunction in the Eugene Federal District Court. (The 9th Circuit said on March 6 that his ruling was wrong in law.)

Relying on the document alone is not enough. Taken into hospital on Christmas Day, the husband of one of this country's greatest living will campaigners, died two days later. We are privileged to tell his story. Albert Goodheir, former minister, Esperanto expert and author, died at age 83 "in accordance with his living will." The phrase was picked up by newspapers around the country. To his devoted wife Phyllis, the moment was wonderful, even though doctors had pleaded to give him surgery: "I told the doctors, `I want to let him go.' I repeated it a second time, `Let him go.' He didn't suffer and I didn't suffer because we knew that was what he wanted. It was wonderful because he died in peace. His death was a joyous occasion." "As his quality of life disappeared, he was sustained by a deep belief in the emptiness of all things of the world, compared with the eternal - those things which endure despite all, a sentiment that often appears in his poetry... Albert was born at Utrecht in the Netherlands in 1912, and obtained a Ph.D in history at the University. During the war he suffered greatly under the Nazi occupation, suffering near-starvation and witnessing horrors that were to have a profound effect on his later life and outlook. He was very sure of what he believed, yet it was more an inner sense than a great sprouting of words. Following the war, he took a degree in philosophy and trained to become a minister, afterwards working for lowly pay in small parishes. Reading the living will and seeing his handwriting was like him talking to me... Later he became a Quaker and author, often inscribing his thoughts on toilet paper as he worked as an orderly in a mental hospital. His published works include much poetry and a book on the Dutch philosopher Spinoza, which he wrote in Esperanto. He met his second wife, Phyllis, whom he married in 1970, through his interest in Esperanto. Settling in Coatbridge, he became Secretary of the Glasgow Esperanto Society for 20 years, and published a journal, Esperanto in Scotland, which was circulated internationally. He became a life member of VESS in 1984. In February 1995, Albert suffered a stroke and his health gradually declined. His sight became too poor to study seriously, he could no longer enjoy hill walking or gardening, attend musical concerts or visit his family (five children, 11 grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and three step-children). As his quality of life disappeared, he was sustained by a deep belief in the emptiness of all things of the world, compared with the eternal - those things which endure despite all, a sentiment that often appears in his poetry and shared by his wife Phyllis, also a Quaker. Phyllis has distributed more than 8,000 living wills in the last eight years. Their motto was "Enjoy life, die in peace." Yet, when Albert was hospitalised and in severe pain from a twisted colon, the piece of paper alone was not enough to see that his wishes were respected. Again and again, the doctors remonstrated with Phyllis to allow them to perfom surgery, saying that if they weren't successful they would just "stitch him up again." She had to be quite forceful with them before they finally agreed to respect his living will, which he had updated only six days earlier. "Reading the living will and seeing his handwriting was like him talking to me." The document was on the front of Albert's notes at Monklands Hospital in Lanarkshire. It was the key that provided convincing evidence of his wishes. All Phyllis had to do was to communicate it effectively, but it took a lot of perseverance before the doctors finally listened to her. When she repeated that Albert was not to have the proposed operation, in front of witnesses, the doctors finally felt they had no choice, and allowed Albert to die in peace. Notes: In the UK, a relative has no legal authority to make treatment decisions for an incompetent adult, but it is not uncommon for hospitals to act as if this was not the case. A validly executed living will has legal force if it applies exactly to the circumstances, but often medical scenarios are not sufficiently clear cut. The whole effectiveness of the living will, in practice, relies on communication, not on laws or on the piece of paper itself. Close communication between the doctor and patient, while competent, with the strong active support of relatives when the patient becomes incompetent, are the most reliable options. A living will or values history is a valuable, perhaps even critical, part of this communication process. - Ed Â© 1996 Chris Docker You are the 45th person to browse through here since 26th May 1996 using the above URL WT02-B28-5IA007-000076-B034-137http://www.euthanasia.org:80/clare.html 194.88.132.128 19970222055558 text/html 6700HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 22 Feb 1997 06:04:05 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Interview with Clare Penny Newsletter Opening the safety net Interview with Clare Penny In many countries - New Zealand, Australia, Canada - AIDS support organisations work hand in hand with right to die societies (who, in turn, have learnt not to be HIV-phobic!). Not so in Britain. The needs and demands of people living with the HIV virus include trying to choose the time of one's own death. Conservative to the core, such needs are ignored by the politically correct organisations set up with government money to "help" people with AIDS. There is this myth that people don't die in pain... So it came as a pleasant surprise when a reporter from Positive Times rang the VESS Office. Unlike many mainstream groups, the people behind Positive Times get no government funding: the only source of income is from advertising in the paper itself. Clare Penny, the editor, spoke not of patients she had known but of friends. Her involvement is grass-roots; her commitment is tangible. She can be in her office from ten in the morning till the following midnight. She believes in getting results that make a difference, and the paper is notable for its head-on approach to tackling difficult issues with candour and a zest for living. "There is this myth that people don't die in pain. My stepmother died of cancer - very painfully. I was close to her and nursed her through, but it made a deep impression on me. But with AIDS there is more capacity to die in pain - there are so many diseases that a person with AIDS might succumb to. I've seen a person where the bones were actually pushing through the skin." Positive Times ran a general article on euthanasia and followed it swiftly in the next issue with a second one, Dying to Live, which focussed more acutely on suicide and the work of VESS. It featured a picture from the Pepsi advert and a caption: Life to the max: a right which should not be exclusive to Pepsi-drinkers and skydivers. The article explained that the option of suicide can serve as a safety net to those living with the virus, that planning your exit had more to do with living than with dying. "I know several people who have attempted suicide with paracetamol," said Clare. "One friend took 60 and survived." Paracetamol is not only very unreliable, but often causes terrible internal damage. Clare was full of praise for the work of VESS with Departing Drugs. "There is a great reassurance in knowing how to commit suicide. Often, of course, when the time comes, the person is physically incapable, and so friends make suicide pacts. They talk in the pub about assisting suicides, but they worry over the legalities." Without a change in the law, everything has to be very secret. No safeguards, dignity lessened, and the danger of failure through inadequate knowledge and backup and/or prosecution if caught. "The law failed Dr Cox big time. People like that shouldn't be prosecuted!" Many "voluntary" organisations are plagued by power struggles for key positions. Not so Positive Times and its companion The Pink Paper. Clare is about to step down as Editor and carry on as a medical science / health correspondent. Some people find that planning their suicide as a contingency plan can actually be a very life-enhancing experience, even if most people who consider it don't actually carry it out. Why? "Because I feel strongly that the editor should be an HIV positive man - after all, that's what Positive Times is about." Nice one, Clare! We salute your integrity. Hopefully AIDS/HIV support groups and right-to-die societies will learn how to learn from each other more as the campaign continues. The testimony of a man suffering from AIDS was instrumental in the recent Ninth Circuit decision (see cover story), and in Australia, where the first ever law on euthanasia seems set to come into force this year, AIDS support groups lobbied parliament and referred members to VESS to obtain drugs information. Some people find that planning their suicide as a contingency plan can actually be a very life-enhancing experience, even if most people who consider it don't actually carry it out. In the words of Positive Times: "Somebody once said that the thought of committing suicide had helped them through many a bad night. For most people with HIV or AIDS considering it, it will remain just that - a thought. Planning a suicide may have a lot more to do with living than with dying." Interview by Chris Docker.

Chris Docker "Euthanasia means a good and easy death" - how many times do we here this recited like some mantra meant to convince our opponents? Okay, so that would be the translation if we followed the Greek roots of the word but it is not what the word means today in general usage. People generally think of one of two things when we say euthanasia: the active termination of life at the patient's request as it occurs in the Netherlands (or similar proposals in other countries); or the Nazi extermination program of murder. Some people take an extreme view, while many fall somewhere between the two camps. Dictionary definitions avail us little, as there will always be large groups of people that claim it means something else. (We see the unfortunate tendency to use dictionaries to define words rather than attempting to arrive at an understanding of what we truly mean.) The apparent derivation (from the Greek, eu - thanatos) hardly describes what we mean. Even extending the definition to include "bringing about of this, especially in the case of incurable and painful disease" hardly covers it - hospices often succeed in bringing about a peaceful death, but they don't perform euthanasia! Proponents often go on to stress the importance of the word "voluntary" and we end up with a sort of mini mission statement without getting any closer to defining what we mean. In fact, our "definition" is so poor that, rather than helping our cause, it provides easy meat for opponents. We complain that words like "killing" and "murder" are emotive, and then commit the same error. Emotive buzzwords will mean different things to different people and are often a stumbling block to civilised discourse. At a recent gathering of "pro-life" and "pro-choice" people of widely differing views (but sincerely committed to exploring them) we looked first at what terminology we could use to communicate. Case examples were useful for discussion, but phrases such as those used in the Netherlands proved the least troublesome, such as "Decisions that result in the ending of life with/without the request of the patient." Voluntary cannot be objectively determined, and opponents will always be concerned over whether the "request" was truly voluntary. The request itself, however, can be objectively observed as an event. It either existed or it didn't, and safeguards such as avoiding undue influence are ancilliary. A "decision that results in the ending of life" avoids needless divisions, for instance, over whether double-effect was involved. It avoids the moral opprobrium that some people connect with the "e" word. They are important decisions even when no request was involved, such as in the case of Tony Bland. A slightly broader heading might be "treatment decisions at the end of life." Conceptual terms vs popular language If the above holds true, then why retain such words in the name of the Society? There are many reasons. Changing the name would involve a lack of continuity, but there are also deeper reasons that have a sound historical, social reform basis. The history of reform shows the need for strong campaigning alongside clear reasoning. In analysing a situation we need clear conceptual arguments, but in conducting a campaign we need words that generate feeling and with which broad sections of the public can identify. Headlines are not made up of long sentences with words of many syllables - accuracy is sacrificed for attention-grab. We should be aware of the difference, and the different uses. Similarly, in part perhaps because of its very vagueness, voluntary euthanasia provides a focal point for all interest in that subject - from the public, the media, researchers - they all know to come to us. The same point applies to the word "living will" - vague, but the most popular term in the public's eye (we leave it to serious analysis to consider whether we mean, by that, an advance directive, an advance statement, an advance declaration, all of which have different shades of meaning.) The language of rights A similar and very serious problem occurs with the language of rights. Talk of "rights" produces a rapid public response, polarisation of feeling, public debate, an airing of the basic issues. The division is perhaps more problematic, as the use of the word "right" in the phrase "right-to-die" is, generally speaking, an abuse of the terminology. The ethicists and the courts will usually examine the issue in terms of an "interest" in dying. So when should we shout about "rights" and when should we be less confrontational in our choice of language? Sometimes, cultural differences may be important factors. The Australian euthanasia law is called "The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act" - and is in the Northern Territory where the issue of rights is a politically important subject in an area where there is a large Aboribinal population. The USA, with its written constitution, can analyse rights in terms of that constitution. Elsewhere, the logical flaws in the use of such language are more apparent and may serve to perpetuate conflict with "pro-life" groups. It is a difficult balancing act, and can only be accomplished if protagonists understand the difference rather than believing that the "buzz-words" are the language of serious discourse. There's no need to shoot the piano player - simply to realise that the rendering is hardly a symphony.

Chris Docker suggests it is need ofoverhaul... (Note: this article has been slightly shortened from its originalformats. Comments are welcomed to the author at vess@euthanasia.org.) Introduction What I shall attempt to argue in this paper is that negligence has developedan overloaded framework that disguises bad law, and I will suggest that,if the evolution of the common law fails to mutate the tort of negligenceto accommodate changing needs within modern society, then statutory adjustmentmay be desirable. Would that statutory embodiment should prove unnecessarybut, unless the necessary reform can be achieved within the current system,some such shake up may be necessary. Antiquated law[1] is attempting to deal with the technology explosionof the last fifty years and the attendant need for information and ethicalawareness. Non-medical problems, that are more a question of ethics orresources, are being treated as if they were medical. The tests which thelaw attempts to apply (e.g. "Bolam"[2], best interests[3]) arecontroversial and in need of overhaul. I will argue that one of the bestways to tackle an accessible part of this problem would be to separateout ethical from purely medical concerns. Medical negligence occasions vast expenditure from the public purse,yet there is low confidence that it attains the degree of justice thatit should.[4] It is estimated that the sorely pressed NHS[5] spent upwardof Â£45m on medical negligence claims in 1990.[6] There is no doubtthat most of these claims were time-consuming, expensive and potentiallydestructive, many of them bettering neither patient or doctor.[7] The figurehad risen to Â£150m by 1995[8] and looks set for further increase.[9]These costs are a considerable drain on healthcare and, even though thereis still much debate over whether costs can be sensibly reduced, it isimportant that we also look at how those costs are distributed and whethersuch distribution can be achieved more fairly. Negligence does not simplycover applying medical technique badly, it includes failing to give appropriateinformation to a patient before obtaining consent,[10] and it is to thislatter category[11] that I particularly wish to turn.[12] It is differentfrom medical diagnosis and treatment inasmuch as it a more distinctly ethical,rather than medical, issue. With increasing technology[13], it is an areathat will assume increased importance, not less, as we approach the nextcentury. There may be little reason to suggest that a patient should notbenefit from more appropriate expertise in these matters, simply becauseit is not readily available under the present system. There have, of course been many proposals and attempts to overhaulingthe whole of the tort of medical negligence,[14] adopting a "no-fault"system, or implementing many less drastic changes across the board, suchus with the very recent paper of Lord Woolf.[15] Unfortunately, althougha tort of negligence may be an imperfect means of compensating for wrong,[16]other options may be even less desirable,[17] and some of the supposedadvantages of alternate systems have not been borne out by practice.[18]The debate is clouded by popular beliefs: although some claims are undoubtedlyill-advised[19] and patients are becoming more inclined to go to court,there is evidence, for instance, that too few, rather than too many, claimsresult in a successful action.[20] What needs to be done is to separateout the groups of wrongs currently handled as negligence and build moreappropriate procedures and standards to assess them. Recent steps to promotemediation,[21] for instance, or augment the powers of the General MedicalCouncil,[22] or modifying judicial procedures,[23] tackle specific aspectsin relative isolation and can be thought of as improvements to the presentsystem[24] that may reap lesser or greater rewards (and may themselvesalso need further refinement). These smaller, specific measures have thegreat advantage of being implementable rather than major, sweeping alterations,that not only might fail from using too large a brush but from the lackof parliamentary time needed for proper debate of such extensive bills.[25] It is one thing to acknowledge that doctors may lack ethical expertise,even if they are, with beneficent intentions, often capable of disguisingmoral decisions as clinical judgements; (this need not infer moral culpabilityon the doctor: someone whose training is overwhelmingly concerned withthe diagnosis and treatment of organic illness cannot easily acquire ordisplay the conceptual and interpersonal skills that a truly informed consent[26]demands.[27]) it is then quite another thing to demand that they suddenlyacquire that expertise,[28] and perhaps not even entirely reasonable: weencourage nurses to acquire proficiency in many areas of medicine for instance,but we don't expect them to double up as doctors. There are times whena doctor will practice better medicine from an awareness of medical ethics,but that does not make her an ethicist - in fact there might even be aconflict of interests between the two roles. I am thinking of a nurse orethicist particularly as a patient advocate[29], concentrating on patientvalues that may seem at odds with priorities of diagnosis, treatment andresource allocation. Of course, often the courts will encompass this role,but it could be argued that this could, in some instances, merely be exchangingmedical paternalism for legal paternalism. As these areas are non-medical ones, strictly speaking, we might arguethat in some instances, such as information-giving and withdrawal of treatmentdecisions, the tort of negligence should be patient-centred rather thanmedical team -centred. It is perhaps the point made by Lord Mustill when he ventured: ...I venture to feel some reservations about the application of theprinciple of civil liability in negligence laid down in Bolam v. FriernHospital Management Committee... I accept without difficulty that thisprinciple applies to the ascertainment of the medical raw material suchas diagnosis, prognosis and appraisal of the patient's cognitive functions.[30]Beyond this point, however, it may be said that the decision is ethical,not medical, and that there is no reason in logic why on such a decisionthe opinions of doctors should be decisive.[31] Yet the British courts have long retained the emphasis on doctors' dutyin questions of information disclosure, as Professor McLean pointed outin her seminal work on the subject,[32] and they have done so possiblyat the expense of emphasising what Lord Scarman in Sidaway[33] called"a basic human right" relating to the right to make one's owndecisions - and the fact that "the doctor's duty arises from his patient'srights" not vice versa. The courts' protection of human rights ismore basic and far-reaching than the handling of medical scenarios andso its significance is not to be underestimated.[34] A danger of medicalisation of the law becomes apparent, for instance,in the inconsistencies of judgements such as that of Lord Browne-Wilkinson,who, whilst advocating a prudent patient position in Sidaway[35] makesthe error of calling information "advice" when he lumps together"diagnosis, advice and treatment."[36] The typical bias is thusintroduced: doctors presenting information in the way that they would persuadethe patient. This further tips the scales in what is already an unevenbalance; as Freidson observed: It is my impression that clients are more often bullied than informedinto consent, their resistance weakened in part by their desire for thegeneral service if not the specific procedure, in part by the oppressivesetting they find themselves in, and in part by the calculated intimidation,restriction of information, and covert threats of rejection by the professionalstaff itself.[39] Bias, if any,[40] should actually, be that of the patient. Some attemptsto enhance this have met with little success against a backdrop of medicalpaternalism or bureaucratic lethargy. Much is talked about informed consent,but it remains, in practice, little more than a quasi-ethical platitude.[41]Not only is informed consent a concept that has no formal standing in Britishlaw,[42] but consent is frequently obtained, quite legally, without thedisclosure of information that is ethically required for such consent tobe valid. Lord Donaldson, in his historic judgement in Re T, suggestedthat forms[43] used for patient refusal and consent could enhance patientawareness[44] of possible consequences by "different and larger typeface,by underlining, the employment of colour print or otherwise.[45] Yet theDepartment of Health came up with little improvement other than windowdressing and "added verbiage".[46] In a more constructive vein,the Law Society in conjunction with the BMA more recently came up witharguments about 'enhancing capacity': "Doctors should be aware boththat medical disabilities can fluctuate and that there are many factorsextraneous to a person's medical disorder which may adversely influencecapacity. It is the duty of the assessing doctor to maximise capacity"[47]They suggest that capacity can be enhanced as much as possible by treatingsecondary symptoms, by carefully considering the time and place for vitalcommunication, third party considerations, and a suitable time scale andsupportive framework for digesting the information before a decision isrequired.[48] Competence to consent is as important as the informationon which to make a decision about consent or refusal. Some of these simple,very human approaches[49] can be seen in the better pre-natal clinics,particularly for pregnant women contemplating the possibility of a childwith Downs syndrome; but even in this area facilities vary widely acrossthe country and are sometimes non-existent.[50] The notion of informed consent probably grew out of the concern forresearch subjects and a perceived need to minimize the potential for harm,[51]but as it became reinforced with the growth of, and demand for, patients'"rights",[52] it may have taken on a mantle which it can ill-support. Without much exaggeration it can be said that all of medical ethicsis but a footnote to informed consent. It is the concept that first calledmedicine out of its paternalistic slumber and into the open light of publicscrutiny. Informed consent serves as the foundation upon which answersto new questions and problems are constructed. Informed consent is a kindof doctrine, that is, an amalgam of legal and philosophical reasoning witha conceptual framework and a number of specific prescriptions. This frameworkentails a few basic actions and presupposes certain conditions. At theheart of the doctrine is the legal principle that "the right of acompetent person to refuse medical treatment is virtually absolute."The exercise of this right presupposes that the patient must receive allinformation relevant to the decision to undergo or forgo a proposed treatmentand that he or she must comprehend the information. The legal principleindicates that the patient needs to be competent and it is relatively freelymade. Although influence is acceptable, all forms of coercion are beyondthe pale.[53] We can go on to look at the limitations of the doctrine with a viewto refining it, but that process cannot effectively start until we addressthe basic anomaly of the law in Bolam, that makes one person (the patient)the apparent decisionmaker, and another person (the doctor acting in accordancewith an accepted body of medical opinion) the ultimate arbiter of thatvery information needed to make the decision.[54] In other words, developmentalprogress for patient advocacy, or reconceiving the contextual basis ofautonomy (as examined by Hardwig[55] and Kuczewski[56] and others) willbe wasted effort until the fundamental loophole is corrected. One cannotimprove on, or enhance patient autonomy, if the very basis for that autonomyis effectively denied by simplistic application of common law. There has been some hope that the common law would gradually come torefine its use of the Bolam test, using it, quite reasonably it might beargued, as a benchmark for assessing negligence in matters of medical technique,and avoiding it for cases of information disclosure. Sadly the practicehas been dilatory to say the least. Bolam was cited, for instance to justify an action against asurgeon who failed to warn a patient that an operation to treat rectalprolapse might mean that the 28 year old man would be unable to have sexualintercourse. The fact that the case was won for the plaintiff, arguablyby such misappropriated case law, did little to establish patients' rightson a more secure footing.[57] One might suggest that emphasis on rights rather than duties is hair-splitting,but the practical implementation demonstrates a more marked difference.In many cases, effective assertion of patients' rights requires advocacy- someone to be there in the patient's corner. Many patients entering hospitalwill seem to be "capable", but the reality is that their effectiveassertiveness may be limited by disease or injury and the attendant stressand worry, not to mention the business-like atmosphere encouraging himto "do as he's told" as he lies helpless in a hospital bed. Psychologically,the dice are weighted against the patient. It seems no small coincidencethat in the currently popular vogue for "living wills" or "advancemedical directives" the only well known instances where these documentshave been or would have been followed are where there was a patient advocate- either in the form of a determined relative[58 ]or in the form of thecourts.[59] It would be too easy to say that the role of patient advocate shouldbe taken on more formally by nurses. Although there is a place for this,greater formalisation could lead to greater conflict between nursing andmedical professions, possibly within the same healthcare team.[61] Ad hocarrangements might work - we are generally looking at the careful applicationof basic human qualities of communication that may be overlooked or overstretchedin a professional setting. But the importance of informed consent is sogreat that more secure provision should perhaps be made. A statutory dutyon health care facilities to provide a surrogate patient advocate[62] wherenone was available would better serve this end. The level of skill requiredshould be commensurate with the dilemmas likely to be faced, but theremight be an increased role for a hospital ethicist, perhaps even with professionalliability.[63] Such a system, particularly in the current arrangement ofNHS trusts, might also go some way to standardising negligence claims,reducing costs both by easing the identification of liability and by reducingthe incidence of information-disclosure negligence. NHS Trusts might makesavings on the latter count, but even if ease of access to litigation resultedin the savings being absorbed, a more equitable system would have at leastseen national resources better spent. The basics of negligence should be retained - duty of care - breachof that duty - resultant damage. Merely the reliance on the Bolam testshould be changed. So, in Goorkani v. Tayside Health Board (O.H.) [1991]SLT 94, the result would probably be the same, as it seems Mr Goorkaniwould have chosen the same treatment, even if he had been informed aboutthe risk of infertility, in order to preserve his eyesight. However, inGold v. Haringey Health Authority [1987] 2 All ER,64 the resultwould probably have been the opposite, as the appeal court, relying heavilyon Bolam, overturned the lower court's decision to award damagesin negligence to a woman who had undergone a sterilisation to avoid furtherpregnancy, without sufficient warning from the physician of the failurerate of the operation, and without being given information about the alternativeof a vasectomy for her husband. In allowing the appeal, Brown LJ also drewselectively on Sidaway, agreeing with Lord Dipcock's rather simplisticview that the general duty of a doctor is "not subject to dissectioninto a number of component parts to which different criteria of what satisfythe duty of care apply." This decision is cognate with similar reasoningsin Blyth v. Bloomsbury Health Authority [1993] 4 Med LR 151 (CA) and,in Scotland, in Moyes v Lothian Health Board [1990] SLT 444 1 Med LR463. The legal change should be supported by social and other measures toenhance capacity and increase patient advocacy. Social changes that arenot supported by a fundamental shift in the law relating to standards ofinformation giving could result in forms, promises and guidelines thatare not worth the paper they are written on. As West expressed it: The entire process will be for naught if all we accomplish is to changethe old saw from "The operation was a success, but the patient died,"to "The patient died, but his physician stayed within the practiceguideline."65 Summary If there is not a reversal of common law trends to follow the Bolamprinciple in deciding claims for medical negligence where information disclosureis at issue, then statutory or declaratory guidance should be devised.When patient autonomy has been thus enabled by adequate information, itshould be enhanced and protected by such measures as availability of patientadvocates of various types to give varying categories of support, independentof the medical staff if necessary. References 1."Negligence derives from trespass by way of theaction of the case, and like all derivatives of case, it is actionableonly on proof of damage, i.e. not per se. However, the modern tort of negligence,arising from breach by the defendant of a legal duty of care owed by himto the plaintiff, takes its origin from the early nineteenth century. Sincethen it has developed in "disconnected slabs" - Candler v CraneChristmas & Co (1951) - so that even today it exhibits little generality."Tyas J.G.M., Law of Torts, 2nd edition, Macdonald and Evans 1973:58. Ibid:"It has also been said that negligence 'properly connotes the complexconcept of duty, breach and damage thereby suffered by the person to whomthe duty was owing': Lochgelly Iron Works & Coal Co. v. M'Mullan (1934),per Lord Wright. This is the modern definition." 2.The so-called "Bolam" test, based on the caseof Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582, indicatesthat a doctor is not negligent if he or she acts in accordance with a schoolof thought accepted at the time as reasonable by a responsible body ofmedical opinion, even though other doctors adopt a different practice.This has been the subject of common law debates in many jurisdictions (someof which have rejected it altogether) and also within the UK, for instance,when the judges in Sidaway v. Governers of the Bethlem Royal Hospital andMaudsley Hospital and Others [1985] 1 All ER 643 (HL) had considerabledifferences of opinion on it. A detailed discussion occurs in McLean S.,A Patient's Right to Know - Information Disclosure, the Doctor and theLaw. Hants: Dartmouth 1989:104-122. Classic alternative doctrine to theBolam test is presented in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appealscase of Canterbury v. Spence 464 F 2d 772 (DC, 1972); and the Canadiancase of Haughian v Paine [1987] 37 DLR (4th) 624 (Sask CA), for instance,illustrates that the doctor's duty should extend not only to disclosingall relevant risks but also, in principle, to alternative forms of treatment. 3.The concept of "best interests" was subjectto some overhaul by the Law Commission, but their proposals have not beenpassed into law (Law Com No 231, Mental Incapacity, London:HMSO 1995:44-48).Problems with the standard are discussed in Docker C., "Limitationsof the 'Best Interests' and 'Substituted Judgement' standards" DyingIn Dignity Mensa Sig News Journal 1996;3(1):9-15 (previously submittedin the Ethics Module for M.Phil 1996). A glimpse of the problem can beseen in Veatch: "For a clinician to guess at what is the best coursefor the patient, three assumptions must be true regarding a theory of thegood.

It means approval or agreementwith the actions or opinions of another, and elicits synonyms such as "acquiesce"and "condone".

Law QuarterlyReview 1985;101:432-453,p.451-452, and p.441. 28.This is not to say that medical ethics is not beingincreasingly taught. "We wish, however, to correct the impressiongiven by Mary Kearns that doctors who pass through Edinburgh UniversityMedical School have not studied medical ethics. ... In the pre-clinicalyears, students are introduced to the principles underlying medical ethicsand these are related to issues of confidentiality and informed consent.The application of medical ethics then features formally as part of atleast four clinical attachments, and involves particular considerationof issues surrounding dying and euthanasia, human genetics, fertility,abortion and decision-making." - Boyd K., Thomson D., Porter M., WatsonG., Fleming S., "Medical ethics" The Scotsman (letters) 25 May1996. Yet in the history of medicine there can be observed, for instance,a bias against truth-telling both in the disclosure of information andin admitting fault, and that this is inconsistent with public moralityand that of other professions is apparent. Solicitors, for instance, are"obliged by the rules of professional conduct to inform a client ifthey have acted negligently or improperly in the performance of their work.This is not incumbent on ... the surgeon or physician who tends you inill health..." - Napley D., "The ethics of the professions"Law Society Gazette 1985;82:818-825, quoted in Gillon R., PhilosophicalMedical Ethics, Chichester: John Wiley & Sons 1995;pp.168-169. Sometimesthe law does not seem overly tolerant at this lack: "How much andwhat sort of information should be given to the patient? Where there hasbeen a mishap the patient must be told. Where in giving treatment by injectiona needle was broken, without negligence, and left in the patient's body,it was held to be negligent not to tell the patient of the presence ofthe broken needle (Gerber v Pines, 1933, 79 S.J.13...)" - CarrierJ., Kendall I., Medical Negligence: Complaints and Compensation, Gower1990. Truth-telling, as a basic principle (even one requiring exceptions),has generally been absent from medical codes even from the time of Hippocrates. 29."Suppose a nurse ... discovers that a patienthas been prescribed twice the normal dose of a drug. Although he is dubioushe gives it anyway, claiming that his only responsibility is to administerdrugs as prescribed by the doctor. If the dose is incorrect, this nurseconsiders that it is the doctor's fault and not his. this stance conflictswith the idea of a nurse as an autonomous practitioner and patient advocate.The UKCC encourages nurses to act as advocates for patients and definesadvocacy as being 'concerned with promoting the well-being and interestsof patients and clients'. ... The nurse remains morally and legally accountablefor his own actions and if he fails to clarify the situation, then it mustbe assumed that he has good reasons for giving the drug or has chosen todisregard the fact that he is accountable. He will have difficulty justifyingeither option." Fletcher N., Holt J., Brazier M., Harris J., Ethics,Law and Nursing, Manchester: Manchester University Press 1995;p.113. 30.The patient's "cognitive functions" shouldperhaps be left out of this list. See Re C [1994] 1 FLR 31, infra. 31.Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland [1993] A.C. 835,898. 32."In sum, therefore, British courts have made noreal pretence at setting anything other than a professional test for disclosure.The emphasis is on the doctor's duty and not on the patient's rights, thusmaking the evidence of fellow professionals of similar significance indisclosure cases as it is in cases involving the application of technicalskills."

Governers of the Bethlem Royal Hospitaland Maudsley Hospital and Others [1984] 1 All ER 1018, 1033 (Court of Appeal). 36.It has been observed that Dunn LJ, in Sidaway, seemednot unreasonably led astray by this. "Thus, Dunn LJ's conclusion,that the standards of the medical profession are to be applied, begs thequestion by assuming that information giving is the same as advice giving.This mis-analysis is clear when Dunn LJ goes on to argue that 'in givingadvice the professional man will normally refer to the advantages and disadvantagesof the course which he recommends.' But this is precisely to misstate whatpatient self-determination is all about. Advantages and disadvantages areevaluations which only patients can make. What doctors must give is informationabout alternatives and consequences, including risks, thereby enablingthe patient to judge for him- or herself." Kennedy I. op. cit., supra,p.183. 37.This is not easily dismissed as speculatively taintedview of beneficent medical practice. For a concrete and graphical exampleof subtle coercion, "particularly common in surgery that will resultin ostomy of the bowel", see: Battin M., The Least Worse Death, NewYork: Oxford University Press 1994;pp.37-38. 38."...physicians are very well aware of their powerto influence patient choices - even while preserving the appearance ofobtaining informed consent. The Latinate obscurity of medical diagnosisand the overwhelming nature of too much medical information often contributeto this possibility. Thus, many physicians claim they can get patientsto agree to nearly anything they propose; it is simply a matter of howthe choice is framed." Battin M., op. cit., supra, p.169. 39.Beauchamp T., Childress J., Principles of BiomedicalEthics 4th Edition, Oxford: OUP 1994;p.165. [quoting Eliot Freidson, TheProfession of Medicine, New York:Dodd, Mead & Co 1970;376.] 40.Even arguments limiting such bias will mostly attemptto respect someone's "autonomy" other than that of the doctorinfringing the autonomy of someone else, as for instance, in the controversialcase of Re S (adult refusal of treatment) [1992] 4 All ER 671, (1992) 9BMLR 69, when the patient's autonomy in refusing a Caesarian was overruledin favour of respecting the hypothetical autonomy or will-to-live of theunborn foetus (referred to in the judgement as the "unborn child"). 41.The BMA, for instance, says: "Patients can onlymake valid choices on the basis of shared information about diagnoses,prognoses and realistic treatment options." (British Medical Association,Medical Ethics Today, London: BMA 1993;p.177) yet give little or no guidanceon how such information is to be shared. Some practical suggestions aremade in McNulty C., "Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Decision-making:a psychological perspective" Medicine, Science & the Law 1995;35(2):159-164,viz: "The phrases 'simple language' and 'broad terms' are ambiguous.To be of assistance, these phrases need to be operationalized in a waythat leaves no room for uncertainty." (p.161), and: "Other practicaltechniques for assisting a person to engage in decision-making includethe presentation of information in non-verbal formats: for example, Carson(1993) suggests breaking information down into discrete units and perhapsemploying flow charts and diagrams."(p.162). 42.For an overview of how an attempt to introduce thedoctrine into English law was rejected, see: Thomson J., Delictual Liability,Edinburgh: Butterworths 1994, p.13. 43. Consent forms are only one means of obtaining consent,but have their place if designed with consideration of the ethical dynamicsinvolved. They cannot, of themselves, be a substitute for interactive givingof information, no matter how much information is contained on them. Aconsent form does not take into account what facts might be most importantto that particular patient. Neither does it explain facts in the way thatthat patient might have reasonably have desired. "Truthfulness isnot the bald communication of facts: it is the kind of sensitivity to individualneed which knows that there is a time to speak and a time to remain silent."- Campbell A., Gillett G., Jones G. Practical Medical Ethics, Oxford UniversityPress 1992;p.27. 44.Why is "enhancing awareness" important ifa patient is presumed competent? One reason might be that: "An autonomousperson who signs a consent form without reading or understanding the formis qualified to act autonomously by giving an informed consent, but hasfailed to do so."

In the UK, these instances have largely been casesof when a living will would - or could - have worked, had one been written.E.g. Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland [1993] A.C. 789,894 per Lord Mustill (Obiter). 60. The need is for greater communication, not for whistleblowing,as seen, for instance in R. v. Cox [1994] 12 BMLR 38,45. (Staff Nurse recognisedthat a doctor had administered "a lethal dose of potassium chloride"to a woman dying in unrelievable pain and reported the fact, regrettablyif quite correctly, to her superiors.) 61.For an example of how life and death differences becomeapparent in decision-making from different information bases, see: WalkerR., Schonwetter R., Kramer D., Robinson B., "Living Wills and ResuscitationPreferences in an Elderly Population" Archives of Internal Medicine1995;155:171-175:- "The group with living wills desired less CPR inscenarios involving functional impairment and cognitive impairment, butnot in scenarios involving current health, severe illness, and terminalillness. After receiving CPR information, both groups changed their preferencessuch that intergroup differences were no longer seen. ... Cardiopulmonaryresuscitation information can influence preferences even among personswith living wills, implying that preferences are neither fixed nor alwaysbased on adequate information." 62."To make decisions with your doctor you need toknow as much as possible about your health care. Ask your doctor aboutwhat you don't understand. Your other health care providers, such as yournurses, social workers, therapists, and chaplains, are also very good sourcesof information." VA Medical Center, "Advance Directives - MakingDecisions About Your Health Care" 1993 VA Medical Center, Seattle,p.1. 63.Another possibility might be a person trained in law:"As people with AIDS lie dying, they do not only need physicians,medical technicians, nurses, and social workers. They often also need theservices of professionals who provide legal care." - Herb A., "TheHospital-Based Attorney as Patient Advocate" Hastings Center Report1995;25(2):13-19,p.13. The Times points out that "an increasing numberof nurses and other health workers are retraining to become lawyers"and the UK now has a Nurses in the Law Association (Nila), one of whosemain aims is to recognise and promote the additional skills which formernurses bring to the law (Bawdon F., "Lawyers with a bedside manner"The Times 12 Dec. 1995) 64.An excellent discussion of the lamentable decisionin this case can be found in Kennedy I., Treat Me Right, Oxford: ClarendonPress 1988, p210-211. 65.West J., "Risk Management and Medical PracticeGuidelines: What Is Risk Management's Proper Role?"

Today,the advocates of euthanasia, who speak of death with dignity, also meana good death. And of c ourse we all want a good death or a death with dignity. Yet, differentpeople would seem to mean very different things when they speak of a gooddeath or of a death with dignity. If I propose legislation to give old people, or severely ill people,approaching the end of their earthly journey, the right to a good deathor a death with dignity, most people would probably not object. But ifI suggest that old people or severely ill people who are approaching theirend should be killed, then my suggestion would probably meet with lessapproval. The word 'kill' has a negative and threatening ring. What thisshows is how important it is to be clear about how we use different terms,especially when we discuss serious matters such as euthanasia. By euthanasia one might mean the intentional killing by a doctor ofa patient by an act or omission. However, this was not the definition offeredby the Walton Committee, the House of Lords' Select Committee on MedicalEthics, which was set up in 1993 after the famous Tony Bland case. Whenthe Committee reported in February 1994, it described euthanasia as a 'deliberateintervention' rather than as a 'deliberate omission intended to terminatelife'. This is noteworthy, for it is also possible for a doctor or a nurseto intentionally kill a patient in his or her care by means of an omission,such as a deliberate failure to give insulin to a diabetic patient. I shall discuss omissions later, but first let us talk about euthanasiain the sense of active euthanasia, that is giving a drug such as potassiumchloride to end a patient's life. Now, the Voluntary Euthanasia Societyand the World Federation of Right to Die Societies are asking for activeeuthanasia and assisted suicide by patient request. But they are carefulto point out that they do not wish to introduce anything like the Nazieuthanasia programme. That is to say, they insist that they do not wishto see non-voluntary euthanasia introduced; they do not wish to see patientsbeing 'helped to die' unless they have asked for it. However, they arguethat autonomous moral agents should be free to make end-of life decisionsfor themselves, including euthanasia. Patient autonomy and patient self-determinationis what they are asking for. And one reason why they think it is so importantfor people today to be able to choose to have help to die is that theyfear over-interventionist medicine and a prolonged death attached to tubesand gadgets. They fear pain and they fear being reduced to a state of utterdependence. And, of course, we can all sympathise with this fear. But atthe same time, it is important to consider carefully whether the reasonsthe advocates of euthanasia give for legalising voluntary euthanasia reallyare good reasons. First, as concerns the fear of pain, with modern pain-relief and palliativecare, it would seem that most - though not all - pain can be successfullyrelieved. Secondly, as regards the fear of dependence, even if nobody wantsto be dependent on others for the most intimate of tasks, and even if manyof us might consider such a situation undignified, is it not true thateach one of us, every human being, possesses an inherent dignity whichcan never be taken away however undignified his or her situation is? Wemust distinguish between undignified human beings and undignified or embarrassingcircumstances. A person does not become undignified because his or hercircumstances are. To take an extreme example, it is very undignified tobe raped, but the rape victim does not therefore lose her human dignity. We must also ask ourselves the question: What are the risks attachedto introducing voluntary euthanasia? One of the dangers in introducingvoluntary euthanasia lies in the fact that in some situations it mightbe hard to distinguish between voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia.The elderly or disabled may come under pressure from society or from theirown relatives to ask for 'help to die'. They may be made to feel that theyought to die because they are a burden. And so they may ask for 'help todie'. But should a request made under such pressure be considered voluntary? And this is not the only problem; voluntary euthanasia may lead to whatis without a doubt nonvoluntary euthanasia. The advocates for euthanasiasay that there is no reason why this should happen. But there is. No doctorwould grant a patient's request for euthanasia, unless he or she believedthat the patient's life was of poor quality and not worth living. For ifthe doctor helps a cancer patient who asks for it to die because he thinksthe patient's quality of life is so poor that he would be better off dead,would it not then also be reasonable for the doctor to help another cancerpatient in a similar state to die, even if that patient has not asked forit? If the doctor feels that he is acting out of mercy in the case of thepatient who asks for euthanasia, why should he not also wish to be mercifulto the other patient who has not asked for it? You can see the problem. If you allow mercy killing on request, it mayseem cruel not to allow mercy killing which has not been requested. Andyet would it not be rather dangerous if doctors and nurses were allowedto kill patients because they felt pity for them? In other words, it wouldsurely be wrong to allow some members of society, say doctors, to killother members of society, say patients, out of pity or because they thoughtsome patients had lives not worth living. Surely, if we allowed this tohappen, we would end up with a situation not unlike Nazi Germany. And,do you not think that many people would stop using the health servicesor refuse going to hospital, if doctors were allowed to end the lives ofpatients whose lives they considered to be of a poor quality? Is it nottrue that, if we allowed doctors to kill, doctors might no longer be trusted? The fact that voluntary euthanasia seems to lead to non-voluntary euthanasiabecomes even clearer if one looks at the situation in the Netherlands,where the law for a number of years has allowed voluntary euthanasia, evenif strictly speaking the practice is not legal. That is to say, providedcertain conditions are fulfilled, a Dutch doctor who performs euthanasiawill not be prosecuted and penalised. One requirement, at least until recently,was that the patient must be terminally ill and dying. Another requirement- at least until recently - has been the free, explicit and repeated requestthe patient. But let us look at the famous Remmelink Report, published in September1990. This report on end-of-life decisions in the Netherlands, definedeuthanasia as an active intervention to terminate another person's life,performed upon the latter's request. However, as the Report showed, thelives of thousands of patients were actively ended without their request.Should we be surprised? No, for, as I explained, once you introduce voluntarymercy killing, it will seem natural to administer mercy killing even ifpatients have not asked for it. Of course, doctors should do what they can to alleviate suffering. Andit is a well-known and widely accepted practice to provide high doses ofpain-killers to, for example, cancer patients. In some cases, this mayapparently shorten the patient's life. But if this happened, would it beeuthanasia? The answer is that it depends upon the doctor's intention.It depends on the intention with which the doctor gives or prescribes thepain-killer. If the intention is simply to relieve pain and if no othermeans exist, then it can be argued that it is not death but pain-reliefthat is intended and that the death, if it follows, as to be regarded asan unintended side-effect of giving pain relief. Arguing against this distinction, advocates of euthanasia might saythat the doctor's intention could be mixed. However, to meet this objection,it should be pointed out that there is a difference between providing adequatepain-relief with drugs such as opiates which are analgesics, and givingdrugs such as potassium chloride which are not analgesics. If the doctorgives analgesics, then this is an indication that his intention is notto kill. If, on the other hand, he uses potassium chloride, it would beobvious that his intention was to kill. In other words, it seems good sensiblepractice to distinguish between pain-relieving and life-relieving drugs,when discussing euthanasia. To return to the Dutch law, which allows euthanasia with life-relievingdrugs, it is in fact becoming more and more elastic. Patients used to haveto be terminally ill, before being granted a request to receive 'help todie'. But a couple of years ago a doctor was cleared of legal charges afterhaving helped a depressed, but not otherwise ill, woman to die. The womanwas a widow who had lost her two sons one after the other, and who feltshe no longer had anything to live for. Of course, we can all sympathisewith her plight. Yet we also know that people can live through grief andcome out of depression and again be grateful for living, despite theirpast. A law which allows euthanasia on request in the case of depressionrisks depriving lots of people of worthwhile futures. To turn to withholding and withdrawing treatment, as opposed to activeprovision of drugs to endlife. Let us start with 'living wills' or advancedirectives as they are also called. Such directives concern non-treatment.They state that under certain specified conditions, the patient does notwish to be resuscitated, and wishes to forego treatment aimed at prolongingor sustaining life. That is to say, they state that the patient declaresnow, while of sound mind, that if he were to become mentally incapacitatedand unable to express his wishes, he would not wish to be resuscitatedor to receive life-sustaining treatment under such and such conditions.Are such documents helpful and would it be a good idea to make them legallybinding? It is partly because people might change their minds that many peopleargue that such advance directives would not be a good idea. Earlier thisyear the Government decided not to introduce the Law Commission's Billon Mental Incapacity, which would have made advance directives legallybinding. The decision went against the recommendations stated in the BritishMedical Association's Code of Practice of April 1995, which suggested thatadvance directives are legally binding according to common law. That isto say, the BMA pointed out that patients of sixteen years or over andof sound mind have a common law right to refuse treatment. And so theyargued that, if people refused certain future treatment options while ofsound mind, then their request should be respected when they were no longercapable of making an informed decision about their treatment. However,as the law stands today, it seems unclear whether advance directives arelegally binding. Leaving the legal status of advance directives to the side, let us discusstheir advantages and disadvantages. Those who argue for advance directivesargue for patient autonomy and against medical paternalism. Moreover, itis often pointed out that such documents might be helpful for doctors andnurses when a mentally incapacitated patient is suffering from malignantdisease or AIDS or from an advanced degenerative disease of the nervoussystem, or severe and lasting brain damage, or severe senile or pre-seniledementia. If he or she has made an advance statement, it might make iteasier for the doctor to decide how to treat the patient. Against these arguments, others point out that individuals who drawup advance directives are not making informed decisions, because they cannotknow in advance precisely what situations they may face. Hence, they argue,an advance directive could actually amount to a blank cheque for the doctor,which would be contrary to what would have been intended by signing anadvance directive. That is, some people hold that advance statements couldprotect doctors from legal suits and make it easier for them to decideon non-treatment. In other words, there are those that argue that advancedirectives would actually protect the doctor rather than the patient. As I also said, people's attitudes may change. The thought of a lingeringdeath or a few months of slowly dying might seem futile to a healthy person.And so many a healthy person might think it is a good idea to sign an advancedirective to the effect that in the case of a degenerative illness suchas senile dementia, he or she would not want to receive even, for example,antibiotics. Yet, it is probably true to say that many people with suchconditions are quite happy to be living. Another objection to advance directives is that the put the onus onthe patient to demand a certain type of care. But are doctors and nursesnot under a professional obligation to provide the most intelligent andcompassionate care they can give? And if so, surely doctors and nursesought to seek to avoid administering futile treatment or prolonging sufferingwhen there is no real hope of recovery. However, this does of course raise the question of where to draw theline between euthanasia by omission and other omissions, as well as thequestion of whether tube-feeding should be regarded as medical treatmentor as basic nursing care which can never be withheld. In the famous case of Tony Bland, who had been in a persistent vegetativestate for three years, the High Court and the Law Lords seemed to arguethat artificial nutrition and hydration is to be regarded as treatmentrather than as nursing care, and ruled that it was in the patient's bestintereststhat fluid and nutrition be withdrawn in order not to prolong his life.The case was not intended to set a precedent. And some of the judges whohad been involved in the case were worried about the fact that matterssuch as these were decided in the courts and recommended that it was forParliament to debate and decide these issues. The establishment of theHouse of Lords' Select Committee was a move in this direction. As you know,the Select Committee opposed the legalisation of active euthanasia andassisted suicide, but did not pronounce on deliberate death-causing omissions. So we are still left with the problem of drawing a line between euthanasiaomissions and non-euthanasia omissions. Well, it seems reasonable to suggest- and it seems to be the practice in hospices - not to provide medicaltreatment which no longer corresponds to the real situation of the patient,either because it is disproportionate to any expected results or becauseit imposes an excessive burden on the patient. For example, when deathis clearly imminent and inevitable, it seems reasonable to forego treatmentthat would only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life. Indeed, if the patient is dying, even food and fluids could be justifiablywithheld if giving such sustenance was futile and burdensome. That is tosay, according to hospice ethics, it is justifiable to forego medical procedureswhich are disproportionate to any expected results, and it is justifiableto forego medical treatment and even food and fluids to avoid imposingan excessive burden on the patient. Take the example of a terminally ill cancer patient whose painful deathis being prolonged by artificial feeding. The patient's life might be prolongedby weeks. If the patient expresses the wish no longer to be artificiallyfed, then his request would be granted. For the feeding will not prolonghis life for very long anyway, and what would be the point in prolongingthe process of dying? In this situation, provision of food and fluids couldbe described as both futile and too burdensome. Of course, in some situations it may be difficult to say whether a treatmentis too burdensome. In this respect the suicidal person poses a specialproblem. For he or she might describe just about any treatment as too burdensome.Here I think that wisdom, experience and compassion are required to decidewhether a certain treatment is or is not too burdensome. What is requiredis care based on shared understanding of the sick person's suffering -and this understanding only comes with experience. In November 1995, my centre, the Centre for Bioethics and Public Policy,organised a conference in Brussels. The theme was euthanasia and therewere a number of British experts on palliative care in attendance. Interestingly,they all testified to the fact that good palliative care is the best answerto a demand for euthanasia. The request for euthanasia is usually a requestfor help,they said. When receiving good palliative care, even depressedterminally ill patients seem to regain a taste for life. However, if the patient cannot speak for himself, the situation is quitedifferent. How is one to decide what constitutes disproportionate treatmentin those circumstances? Here there is no question of the treatment beingtoo burdensome. What matters here is whether it is proportional to expectedresults. If a certain treatment gives hope of recovery, it should obviouslybe given, but otherwise their is little point in it. In other words, ifa dying patient gets pneumonia, there is clearly no point in giving himantibiotics. And to take the difficult situation of a PVS patient, if onecan be sure that there is no misdiagnosis, then even in this case it mightbe argued that giving antibiotics to overcome pneumonia would be pointless,for it would not help the patient to get over the main irreversible andsevere condition from which ne is suffering. But could the same argument be applied to food and fluids? Is the provisionof food and fluids more basic than the proivision of antibiotics and indeedso basic that we cannot deprive a person of food and fluids unless he isdying and has asked for it? If the food and fluid were to make the patientmore comfortable there would certainly be a point in it. But if it obviousthat feeding him is futile and will only prolong the process of dying,then it cannot be in the patient's best interest to pump food or fluidsinto him only to prolong the inevitable. A PVS patient, however, is not actually dying, though he will foreverremain in a state of unawareness of the world around him. So the questionis whether in this situation tube-feeding should be regarded as obligatorycare. The answer is that the kind or level of care that should be providedmust be decided by considering a number of circumstances. Those who arein the caring professions know that experience is the only teacher of goodjudgement in the concrete situation. And to argue that withholding or withdrawalof food and fluid from PVS patients might in some circumstances be justified,would not be the same as advocating euthanasia by omission. Take the case of a patient who has been in a PVS for five years. Isit right to keep him in such a state of suspended animation for years andyears to come? Is it right towards the patient, and is it right towardsthe relatives? And is it right to provide nursing care indefinitely fora person in that state if there is a shortage of staff or other resources?These are big questions - and it is not for me to provide all the answers. But let me repeat, what matters here is experience coupled with a caringattitude. Without experience, which can only be gained by practice, itis impossible to understand what treatment might improve or ease a patient'scondition and what is futile treatment, or to understand what is medicallypossible and what is not. As to the attitude required in caring for thegravely ill and those who suffer, it is that of the Good Samaritan. TheGood Samaritan was moved by compassion and recognized the injured man bythe wayside as his neighbour, as a fellow human being, and treated himas he would have wanted to be treated himself.

Professor Sheila McLean, who is Professor of Law & Ethics in Medicine at Glasgow University, has conducted Britain's first ever research into the issue, the aim of which, she says, is to draft a bill which would legalise physician-assisted suicide. The controversial step would require the support of the medical profession. Her survey results indicate that she has the majority of the medical profession on her side. Under the law in Britain at the moment, prescribing lethal drugs to help someone to die can be punished as culpable homicide in Scotland or as assted suicide/manslaughter in England. 54% of the doctors who responded to the confidential questionnaire said they would support a change in the law that would allow them to help patients to die. 16% said they would help in terminal cases, 11% in cases of physical suffering, and 7% simply if the patient wished it. A considerable proportion said they been asked by a patient to assist in suicide, and 3% admitted that they had in the past helped patients to die, and privately the figure is thought to be higher. The Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society commented: This ground-breaking research is most encouraging - it seems to confirm what we suspected, that a majority of doctors are caring people who want to respect their patients' wishes - even when doing so would mean prescribing drugs that would enable a suffering patient to choose quality over quantity of life. Until now, patients have not had the support of the medical profession or the law when taking these difficult decisions - this is one of the reasons why the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society issues, under certain conditions, literature on "self-deliverance." We hope now that parliament will recognise the wishes of the public, the medical profession, and the humaneness of allowing death with dignity at a time of a patient's own choosing. We know there will be problems with any such legislation, but such problems are not insurmoutable - by doing nothing we would simply allow a heartless sentence to run its course for individuals whose indignity and suffering cannot be relieved - people deserve the key to the door marked "Exit" if that is what they want. VESS made a grant of ï¿½42,000 available to Glasgow University to perform the research.

When he was about toenter to thebusiness of selling individual insurance, he thought of himself as "a hayseed, a hick fromthe sticks -how could I sell life insurance? They told me I didn't look the part ..." Knocking on the door of a New York Life manager in Youngstown, Ben sat down and took anaptitudetest. He failed to fit the formula. A vice president emphatically said, "This ordinarybusiness isn't foryou. You'll fall flat on your face." Ben kept returning, the essence of persistence. "Youtoss me out thisdoor," he would say to the people in Youngstown, "and I'll come back in that one." When hefinallyjoined the company, on February 15, 1942, he was 29. He quietly made people conscious that his company controlled more money than many of theflashier establishments and that it had paid dividends and kept all its promises forgenerations. Withthose credentials out of the way, he presented himself as a high-level specialist who stoodoutside thetraditional business hierarchy. If he needed to get a skeptic's attention, he wrapped five$100 bills in anote reading, "I'll swap these for five minutes." Every sales agent has a unique sales strategy, but none were as successful as BenFeldman. Benwas Top Club president in 1955 and led the company in sales every year thereafter until thelate 1970s,when he asked that his name be removed from all sales results lists. During the 1970s, Benannuallyoutsold 1,500 of the industry's 1,800 companies. In 1992, New York Life ran a sales contesttocommemorate Ben's 50th year with the company. The winner? Eighty-year-old Ben Feldman.

It was time, they felt, for a bold experiment. Their mission was tofocus theenergies of the young company on the mutual life insurance business so it could capitalize ontheopportunities they saw ahead. The benefits of membership in a mutual society were spelled out in one of new YorkLife's firstadvertisements. "One of the peculiar advantages attending insurance with this company isthat all theassureds share annually in its profits and are interested in its success." The trustees ofthe companypledged that company funds would "be invested for the benefit and security of all the partiesinvolved." Underwriting American lives in the perilous mid-nineteenth century was a new game thathad to beinvented. By today's standards, it was an era of unusual risks and uncertainties. Thehazards ofpioneer life took a heavy toll, as did wars on the frontier, outbreaks of disease, poor waterand sewagesystems, and cities and towns made of wood that often burned to the ground, causing largelosses of life. Life insurance companies and agents in the nineteenth century faced a challenging task: creatingconsumer demand for a product that was largely unknown. Assigning a dollar value to humanlifeseemed irreligious to some. Others associated life insurance with gambling. Despite thepublic's lackof awareness regarding the need for life insurance and the difficulties of estimating thehazards ofhuman life, New York Life accumulated assets of $1 million during its first decade. Buildingandmaintaining a strong financial foundation allowed it to pay out another $1 million to policyholders andbeneficiaries during that decade.

The broader the coverage of thepopulation, the morefavorable the averages. In an age of primitive medicine and harsh everyday risks rangingfromcontaminated food to unsafe buildings, New York Life managed the risks by cultivating anin-houseability to assess risks that was second to none. In 1892, the era of "scientific" management was just beginning, and the trio of GeorgePerkins,Darwin Kingsley, and Thomas A. Buckner would lead the company in it. Perkins was given the daunting job of reorganizing the entire sales operation. Heupgraded thecompany's sales force and replaced the general agency system with a new marketing structure. Of all Perkins' innovations, creating a corps of professionally trained, full-time agents didthe most toadvance the reputation of the life insurance industry as a business on the same footing asbanking. Toimprove the quality of service to policy owners, to stem the widespread turnover in thebusiness and toeliminate the erratic sales performance of the less-dedicated agents, the company created anewmethod of compensation called "Nylic for Agents." Under this plan, an agent received a guaranteed lifetime monthly income after twentyyears ofservice, provided he did not enter the service of another life insurance company. Hislifetime monthlyincome was based on his sales production during those twenty years. The plan's deferredcompensation and old-age security elements were rare for any industry in 1895. With Chairman McCall's full encouragement, Perkins proceeded to select thebranchmanagers, who in turn recruited and supervised the activities of individual agents whosecontracts weremade directly with the company rather than with the intermediary general agent. McCall and Perkins took their inventiveness to other departments as well. In 1892, thecompanyastonished the industry by offering a policy that swept away all restrictions except theinsured'sobligation to pay the premium on time. Standard policies were then riddled with restrictiveclauses andexceptions, often to the dismay of hard-selling agents. The policy introduced by New York Life in 1892 removed all previous restrictions withrespect tooccupation, residence, travel lifestyles or manner of death. Also for the first time in1892, a lifeinsurance policy included a policy loan feature. To cement New York Life's intention toprovidecoverage, regardless of the circumstances, the company determined that after one year thepolicy wasincontestable. " . . . What may be called the Life Insurance Era began about 1845; what may be calledthe'Crusades' began about 1890." The results, said Kingsley, dwarfed any other businessundertaking. In1898, "The Great International Life Insurance Company" appeared on the company's letterheadand onits policies. New York Life had by then extended operations far beyond U.S. boundaries toeighty-threecountries, and on May 23, 1899, it reached $1 billion in policies in force. For almost halfa century, thecompany worked hard to create and broaden a global market for life insurance until war on anunprecedented scale in 1914 brought the crusade to an end.

New and faster equipment was designed to handle payroll,accounting,billing, sales analysis and other areas. By World War II, the leap was made into electronic equipment. ENIAC (ElectronicNumericalIntegrator and Calculator) was developed at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School ofElectricalEngineering by J. Presper Eckert and physicist Dr. John W. Mauchly. They eliminated the needformoving parts by adapting electronic circuits and using electronic pulses to flip vacuum tubeson and offlike switches, with the "on" and "off" states representing zeroes and ones, the roots ofcomputers'binary language. New York Life took delivery of its first modern computers in the 1950s - one from RCA andone fromIBM. Paternal management made everyone feel like a member of a big extended family. As aperquisite,the company acquired two employee vacation properties, located in the rural Bear Mountainregion ofNew York State about an hour's drive north of New York City. Camp Nylic, for male employeesandtheir families, offered cabins named after company officers. Women employees were housedseparately at Elm Valley Farm, twenty-five miles away. The rate charged for full room andboard was $1a day. Anyone sent to the camps for convalescence by the medical department got in free. One of the most conspicuous results of the company's prudent management was unveiled in1928 when the company moved into its new Manhattan Home Office at 51 Madison Avenue. In 1889, the first Madison Square Garden occupied the site. New Yorkers for the nextthirty yearsturned to the Garden for championship fights, operatic recitals, six-day bicycle races, horseshows anda potpourri of live entertainment. The cornerstone of New York Life's new Home Office was laid with appropriate ceremony onJune17, 1927. Architect Cass Gilbert, famous at the time for many structures - including theWoolworthBuilding, once New York's tallest and the U.S. Supreme Court Building - had prepared plans tobuild "aCathedral of Life Insurance," using the Salisbury Cathedral in England as the inspiration. In November1928, the entire office force from 346 Broadway moved into the new quarters, requiringpractically everypiece of moving equipment in the city for all the files and furniture. An opening-day speech by New York Life President Darwin P. Kingsley was broadcastnationwideover NBC. President Calvin Coolidge pressed a button in the White House that unfurled theUnitedStates flag in the lobby of the new building. For the life insurance industry, the downward plunge in the thirties was just asspectacular as theboom of the twenties. Yet New York Life, without taking elaborate preventive measures,preserved theassets of its policy owners. With no equities in its portfolio, it was able to exercisetight control over itsown destiny. Unlike many other life insurers, New York Life's receipts continued to exceeddisbursements. In 1933, the deepest year of the depression, the company met obligations of$366million and still managed to increase assets to over $2 billion.

By 1946, the company was readytoproceed with a long-range program of investing in owned and managed housing developments. In October 1949, the last of 3,000 families moved into Fresh Meadows, a 173-acre,self-containedcommunity of 10,000 people in Queens, New York. Built on a former golf course, Fresh Meadowscontained a department store, banks, a theater, doctors' offices, restaurants, fiftyspecialty shops, abowling center, a post office, and a school. All told, the housing effort was enormous. The company estimated that it had provided,in the fiveyears between 1946 and 1950, enough apartments and small homes for 300,000 people. Besidesproviding owned and managed housing in New York, New Jersey, and housing on a former slum siteinChicago, some $778 million was invested in more than 79,000 residential mortgage loans aroundthecountry, most of them for less than $10,000 each. New York Life also led the way in recognizing the need for new methods to financethousands ofmiles of superhighways, parkways, thruways, turnpikes, bridges, and tunnels as auto and trucktrafficincreased. The company proposed revenue bonds as an alternative to government borrowing,whichwould increase federal, state, and local taxes. For over a century, New York Life had confined its business to "ordinary" whole lifeinsurance for theindividual. In 1951, it was the world's largest in this category, with over 4 millionpolicies in force. During World War II, however, the inclusion of fringe benefits in labor contracts stimulatedthe growth ofgroup insurance. After the war, management-labor bargaining led to an almost universal useof grouplife and health insurance in multi-year contract packages. In the mid-1950s, the company positioned itself to become more of a financial servicescompanythan a life insurer. The notion of cradle to grave private insurance was revolutionary, andNew York Lifeprepared to meet the ever-growing needs of the expanding nation. While new products and services were being developed, the Home Office decided itstraditionalbusiness needed a thorough shaking-up as well. Assumptions, policy language, and premiumswerenot keeping pace with the rapid changes of the national economy and demographics; thecontractscustomers were signing as the company entered the 1950s were nearly the same as those theirgrandfathers had signed decades ago. When President Devereaux C. Josephs implemented a new product line, every other biginsurer triedto follow New York Life's lead. But New York Life agents had the pioneering advantage. Theywere firstin the market with products specifically designed for an insurance-buying public that wasbecomingmore value and cost-conscious. Everyone seemed to be going up a notch or two on the economicladder in one of the swiftest and most thoroughgoing changes in history.

Yet thepoint isworth making that the series of episodes recounted here, the people, the product developmentand theevolution of sales, management and electronic systems, took place in an environment ofunalloyedAmerican optimism. While the United States had diverse view points on almost everything fromeducation to entertainment, practically everyone felt that the unique American democraticsystem wouldprovide a better and better standard of living for all. The great American boom became astandard partof life, no more surprising than Detroit's ads plugging the two-car family, or each family'sdream of thethree-bedroom suburban home. The Keogh plan, named after a U.S. congressman from Brooklyn, was enacted in 1962,makingtax-free private pension funding almost universal in the United States. In the expandingworld ofsavings, "investing for growth" had become as legitimate and desirable as "investing forincome." Thenew mindset created increased competition between different sectors of the financial servicesindustry. In the midst of an increasingly competitive climate, the life insurance industry seemedto be thriving. The number of life insurance companies grew by the hundreds in the 1960s and 1970s. TheInstituteof Life Insurance's surveys showed that 85 percent of American families had some sort of lifeinsurance coverage; in more than half the families, all members of the household wereinsured. Butthe percentage of disposable income spent on life insurance was declining every year, andthereseemed to no way to stop it. A strategic move into an expanding market like equities seemedinevitable. The exciting actuarial breakthrough made by Charles Sternhell, John Fraser, and WalterMiller in 1969opened the door to the move into equities. Their discovery that the premium basis for avariable policycould be the same as for a fixed-dollar policy brought them industry-wide acclaim. The rest of the industry created products from the New York Life formula, but thecompany did notenter the business until 1983, when it became possible to pay regular commissions on variablelife. Inretrospect, it was the best possible decision, and not just for the protection of the agencyforce. Equities- and the new variable life policies - did not perform well in the seventies.

In 1982, thecompanysmoothly completed a $1.6 billion restructuring of its pension fund portfolio, whichmeasurablyincreased the quality of its security holdings. This immense transaction, achieved with thehelp oftrading experts at Salomon Brothers, involved the sale of 104 issues and the purchase of 57others. Computer simulation prior to the actual event made the transaction go through without aglitch. The stock market crash of 1987 prompted another major shift in investment strategy. InOctober1987, the stock market lost twenty-two percent of its value in a day after five fat yearsduring which theDow Jones industrial average roared from below 1000 to 2700. New York Life saw the value ofits bondportfolio rise sharply as the stock market tumbled. Competition for consumers' dollars brought intense challenges to New York Life'sindividualinsurance operations. More and more Americans were making a distinction between theprotectionafforded by insurance and the investment potential of permanent, cash value insurance, whichtheyviewed as inferior to CDs and other investments. The logic of this comparison seemed todictate "buyterm and invest the difference." Anyone combing through the $8 trillion financial-services world in the late 1980s for ablue-chip firmwith the ability to tailor products to the needs of all sorts of individuals and groups wouldfind the searchdaunting. Credit ratings systems were so lax, by design or otherwise, the resultinginformation couldreally turn out to be misinformation. Some straight talk was needed about the value of safety, security and conservatism inthe investmentfield. "The Company You Keep" slogan was first seen by American consumers September 17,1989, ina New York Life TV commercial. Plenty of investors had been burned in the biggest stock market crash of all time justtwo yearsearlier. In a culture of seemingly permanent change, when beliefs as well as institutionswerecrumbling everywhere, a simple message had appeal: good, old, reliable New York Life was assoundas ever.

The official demographic measurement of household income in 1990 provided by the U.S.government was a bit shocking. Not all boats had risen in the 1980s. In 1990, according tothe IRS,some ten percent of U.S. households had incomes over $75,000. That was the good news. Buttheremaining 90 percent were hardly awash in wealth. The majority of households, three-quartersof thetotal, had incomes under $50,000. And a remarkable forty-two percent were living by the skinof theirteeth. Just as the government had plunged into deficit financing, so had individuals. In a drive to find new avenues of distribution, New York Life created the BrokerageDepartment in1992. Its focus is and has been independent producers who serve customers in the top one totwopercent of the wealthiest households in the United States and large corporate clients. The experience with the brokerage business encouraged New York Life to seek otherdistributionopportunities. In a departure from the way it traditionally sells products, the companyannounced aunique 10-year direct marketing opportunity in April 1994. The American Association ofRetiredPersons (AARP), a 33-million-member organization dedicated to addressing the needs of personsaged 50 and older, selected New York Life Insurance Company from numerous competitors tounderwrite, market and administer a newly designed life insurance program for its members. In 1984, New York Life expanded its investments focus to include the independent activemanagement of stocks and bonds by purchasing MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, ablue-chip, active moneymanagerbased in Manhattan. In 1987, Monitor Capital Advisors was created as an independentsubsidiary ofNew York Life focusing on the passive, quantitative strategies of stocks and bonds. In 1988,GreystoneRealty Corporation, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, was founded to provide independentprofessional management of equity real estate. In order to compete effectively in the ever-expanding defined contribution market, thecompany madea major acquisition that year, buying a Boston-based benefits consulting and administrativefirm, nowrenamed New York Life Benefit Services. New York Life now has the capabilities to compete as a"full-service"provider in the 401(k) market. The company had reentered the international life insurance market in 1988 with theacquisition of alife insurance company in Hong Kong. That year, it formed New York Life Worldwide. Theinternationalre-entry continued in 1989 with the acquisition of Windsor Group, a life insurance firm basedinEngland. Three years later, the Gresham Group, another British life insurer, was acquired. Ever since its founding, New York Life managers and agents have been conscious that theactions ofthe company are often far reaching. The character, and perhaps the stability, of Americansociety havebeen affected by organizations that try to look beyond the statistics to act as goodcorporate citizens. "[I describe] life insurance using the Latin sui generis." Hohn continues, "Sui generismeans 'uniqueunto itself.' And life insurance is unique unto itself. It's the only way that you can havea person whojust gets married and has the first baby or two and provide for them right then and there bypaying apremium on a life insurance policy. That's invaluable. That's unique. And that's one ofthe reasonswhy we are in business - to provide those benefits. "Suppose there weren't life insurance - how would you arrange for your own family? Weprovide avery basic tenet that we all rely upon. We do a lot of other things but that's our corecompetency, and wedo it, I think, very well. And so we're going to be around for another 150 years - and more. You can count on it." New York Life Benefit Services Click here to go to the New York Life Benefit Services web site.

Stagnating consumer spending, along with sharp declines in housing, government purchases, and net exports were offset by a surge in business investment and inventory accumulation. In the fourth quarter, growth should remain sluggish due to a slower rate of inventory accumulation, but final demand is set to pick up again. With real disposable income up about 3.0 percent from a year ago and the unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent from 5.6 percent, consumer confidence is near a seven-year high. Under these conditions, the recent decline in bond yields and the surging stock market should encourage a revival in housing as well as a good Christmas shopping season. For the second half of the year, real GDP growth is expected to average about 2.1 percent -- well below the first half average of 3.3 percent and slightly below the economy's long-term non-inflationary growth potential. Once the inventory correction is over, however, the economy should have the momentum to maintain above trend growth until it is slowed by the Federal Reserve. For the year as a whole, economic activity should be up a moderate 2.3 percent, and 1997 is expected to show a stronger 2.9 percent increase, with help from strengthening economies in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Mexico. Inflation still subdued, but set for upward creep After six years of economic expansion, there are still few signs of accelerating inflation. However, the unemployment rate has fallen well below levels previously associated with rising inflation, and wage rates have begun to accelerate again. So far, decelerating benefit costs have offset most of the wage acceleration, but this cannot continue indefinitely. The current slowdown has been just in time to relieve these emerging inflationary pressures, but as the economy picks up speed again next year, they are likely to reemerge. Any slack created by the slowdown will be quickly eliminated as growth picks up again, and more definitive inflationary pressures will emerge. After rising 2.8 percent in 1995, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) should be up 3.0 percent this year and 3.2 percent in 1997. Fed tightening postponed Following three easing moves, the Federal Reserve has left monetary policy unchanged since February and is not likely to begin tightening credit conditions again until some time next year. There appears to be increasing political pressure to wait and see how long the economic slowdown lasts or how low unemployment can fall before inflation picks up again. It may be that the rate of unemployment that sparks inflation has indeed shifted downward somewhat in recent years due to demographics and other factors, but as it becomes clear that the unemployment rate has resumed its downward movement, the Fed is likely to begin a series of tightening moves. Bond yield up-trend to resume Long-term bond yields have declined from their recent highs in response to the Federal Reserve's decisions not to tighten monetary policy at its September and November FOMC meetings and economic statistics that appear to have justified these decisions. Post-election promises to continue budget deficit reduction efforts also have helped. As the economy picks up again next year, however, the up-trend in interest rates, both short- and long-term, should resume and continue until the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy again. This is likely to require a flattening of the yield curve, with short-term interest rates rising faster than long-term rates. Ideal equity market conditions not likely to continue When the economy is near full employment, too much growth is just as bad for the stock market as too little. So far this year, the economy has been just right. The bull market for equities has been driven by the continuation of moderate growth, strong earnings gains, and low inflation. These ideal conditions are likely to change next year. While earnings should remain relatively good, economic growth may look a little too strong, inflation will be creeping up again, bond yields will be rising, and the Federal Reserve will be tightening. As the economic expansion continues into its seventh year, there will be increasing concerns about the emergence of late business cycle pressures on profitability and the arrival of the next recession.

Your goal may be to fund your children's college educations, to protect your family during your working years, or to guarantee your own retirement security. These things won't happen by accident. You must plan. You need to know what you want to achieve and then map out a strategy that will help you achieve it. The good news: You don't have to do it alone. Your New York Life insurance agent does more than just sell insurance policies. He or she is a professional problem solver who can help you identify the most cost-effective products to help you meet your financial objectives. Your New York Life agent provides a full range of services. These include working with you to: Review your individual situation and personal objectives. Perhaps your needs are so clear that life and health insurance can be determined after a few minutes of conversation. Or it may quickly become apparent that nothing short of a full-blown, detailed "fact finding" session is required, going beyond such basic vital statistics as birth dates, income assets, etc. Why is it important to probe and ask questions? Three reasons: First, your situation and needs are different from those of your neighbors. Your agent needs to understand those differences. Second, money is not a goal in and of itself; it is merely the means to an end. (Your goal may be a comfortable, secure retirement. However, the means to achieve that, for example, might be a retirement nest egg of $600,000.) Finally, the more your agent knows about you, the more precise and on-target will be the recommendations you receive. As a result, your agent may take some time to discuss - and even appear to be a bit nosy about - your hopes, dreams and objectives ... the things that really matter to you. By the way, all information will remain strictly confidential. Analyze and review your needs. As needed, your agent will work with you to identify and prioritize your objectives, then help establish benchmark goals. This is important because we live in a world in which there are unlimited resources. People often fail to achieve objectives because they try to accomplish too much at once, or they don't attach specific deadlines to their goals. For instance, you may have a desire to retire in comfort, make sure your children are able to graduate from college debt-free, plus vacation in the Caribbean every winter. But your resources may say that you cannot do it all. Your New York Life agent can work with you and help you focus on what's most important to you. Together, you may find it helpful to break down these goals into quantifiable objectives: accumulate $600,000 by age 65; have a college fund of $40,000 in 15 years; set aside $10,000 each year for vacationing. Then you can look at available resources and decide which goals are realistic, which need to be adjusted and scaled down, and which simply must be abandoned. Develop and implement a strategy to help you achieve your goals. Based on the information you share and the goals and means you establish, you'll receive specific recommendations on where life and health insurance products can help. Coordinate your financial activities. If desired by you, your agent can also serve as a quarterback for you and the other members of your team of advisors. Monitor progress, provide ongoing service as your needs and situation change over time. This is crucial. Planning is not a one-shot deal. Strategies need to be adjusted periodically. Your agent will work with you over the years to help keep your program on track with your changing needs. By the way, there is no charge for advice, planning or ongoing service provided by your New York Life agent. Your Role: It's a crucial one. Your agent cannot do it alone. It's a two-way street. The key to getting maximum value from your relationship with your agent is communication and candor. Do the following: Get acquainted. It's recommended that you contact your agent and arrange a meeting to discuss the full extent of available services, and to review your situation. Educate your agent. Don't expect a mind reader. Your agent may anticipate many of your needs, but will not assume anything. That's why it's so important that you be candid in providing information. Educate yourself. At the same time, you too should be sure to ask a lot of questions. Be nosy. Ask for details and explanations about recommendations and how certain plans may work. Remember, the only dumb question is the one that isn't asked. Make it a team effort. Work together. Listen carefully to the recommendations, but remember - all decisions are yours. Make sure you're comfortable with the outcome. Recommendation: Contact your New York Life insurance agent today. Arrange an appointment. There's no cost or obligation.

One such incentiveis an ExecutiveBonus Plan.An Executive Bonus Plan, also known as a Section 162 plan, is a tax deductible wayfor you, theemployer, toselectively provide life insurance and supplemental retirement benefits to yourvalued executives. Benefits to the Employer An Executive Bonus Plan offers an employer the following features and benefits: Tax deductible. Covers select executives. Does not require IRS approval. Simple to create.

The amount of life insurance coverage on select executives can vary. Benefits to the Owner/Employee As owner, you also have the right to apply for and own a life insurance policy onyour life. You own the policy. If the corporation's tax bracket is higher than the owner/employee, moreafter-tax dollars will beavailable topay the premium. Death benefit proceeds provide a source of income to your family upon death.

But, have you considered whatwouldhappento your business and family should you unexpectedly die or become disabled? Do your heirs have experience operating the business on a day-to-day basis? Would your heirs be forced to sell the business? Would your heirs receive a fair price? Would the IRS seek a higher valuation for your business? These are difficult questions to answer. You owe it to yourself and your family toprotectyour years ofhard work. At New York Life, we are dedicated to meeting your personal andfinancial goals.Throughproper planning, you can secure the continuation of your business and the financialsecurityof yourheirs. How Can You Protect Your Business and Family? The Buy-Sell Agreement When examining different strategies, it is important to select one that insures asmoothtransition ofownership and protects your family's financial future. A buy-sell agreement canhelp youaccomplishthis goal. A buy-sell agreement is a contract among business owners. At the loss of an owner,thebusinessinterest is transferred according to the terms of this contract. The other owner(s)areobligated topurchase the deceased's business interest and the deceased's heirs are obligated tosell. Just lookat what a buy-sell agreement can do: Your Heirs: Are free of business worries and guaranteed to receive a fair price for thesale of thebusinessinterest. May help avoid some of the delays associated with probate. Surviving Owners: Will not have to worry about new and possibly unwanted partners. Know the purchase price of the business beforehand. Remain in good standing with clients and creditors through a smooth transitionofownership.Simply put, a properly funded buy-sell agreement will benefit your family,surviving ownersandcreditors. Methods of Funding Available Option 1: Wait and Pay Cash In this option, surviving owner(s) use cash at the death of a co-owner to fund thebuy-sellagreement.But, several drawbacks to this method exist. At death, funds may not be readily available for payment. A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow? Will a savings plan be depleted to pay for unforeseen expenses? Accumulation of cash may cause an accumulated earnings tax problem. Option 2: Wait and Borrow Funds In this option, surviving owner(s) borrow funds, usually bank loans, at the deathof aco-owner to fundthe buy-sell agreement. But, much like the first option, this method has drawbacks. Future growth may be slowed due to an increase in expenses (repayment of loan). Death of an owner may cause sales to decline, compounding the problem. Death of an owner may make it difficult to receive a loan. A surviving owner may have to sign for funds, exposing personal assets. Surviving owners pay dollar for dollar plus interest for the deceased'soutstanding shareof thebusiness. Option 3: Insurance: The Smart Choice Purchasing insurance can be the most cost effective funding option for a buy-sellagreement.Usinginsurance as a funding vehicle will provide the following benefits: Immediate availability of proceeds when death or disability occurs. The funds used to buy the deceased's share are purchased for pennies on thedollar. Death benefit proceeds are generally income tax free. Premiums may be significantly lower than the cost of repaying the loaninterest. The Types of Buy-Sell Plans Available What Will A Buy-Sell Agreement Accomplish? Creates a market for the stock. Sets a predetermined price at which owners agree to buy and sell their shares. Provides money to fund the plan. Cross Purchase Plan In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with one another. To fund this plan,each ownerappliesfor, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on the other owners. When an owner dies: Life insurance proceeds are paid to the surviving owner(s) income tax free. Proceeds are used to purchase the heirs' business interest. Heirs receive an agreed-upon payment for their business interest. Surviving owner(s) receive an increased cost basis for the acquired businessinterest. Entity Plan In this plan, owners enter into an agreement with the business. The businessapplies for,owns, andpays the life insurance premiums on each owner. When an owner dies: The business will receive the life insurance proceeds. The business uses the proceeds to purchase the deceased's business interest. Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for their business interest. Stock Redemption Plan A stock redemption plan is an agreement between the business and its shareholders.Thecorporationapplies for, owns, and pays the life insurance premiums on each shareholder. When a shareholder dies: The corporation will receive the life insurance proceeds. The corporation will use the proceeds to purchase the shareholder's outstandingstock. Heirs receive an agreed-upon price for the shareholder's outstanding stock. Wait and See Plan This buy-sell agreement provides an added level of flexibility, providing theadvantages ofthe crosspurchase and entity plans. The owner and the company form an agreement. The surviving owners/company have the option to purchase the deceased'sbusinessinterest. If the option is not exercised, the other party is obligated to purchase theinterest. Funding the agreement is usually the obligation of the party who has the firstoption. If necessary, loans between the two can be used to help a party who isunderfunded.

But have you considered whatwouldhappen ifyour key employees died unexpectedlyor became disabled? Key employees are the foundation of a successful business. They are businessowners, salesdirectors, CFOs or any other individuals who are sources of leadership,profitability, andwould beextremely difficult to replace. Unless the proper steps are taken, the death ordisability ofyour keyemployees can be devastating to the financial well-being of your company. The Solution: Key Employee Protection New York Life can provide you with strategies that will help continue your businessin theevent of a keyemployee's death or disability. Funding a plan to protect key employees will giveyourbusiness theadditional funds it needs at a difficult time to: Hire and train replacements. Replace an employee's contribution to profits. Maintain the confidence of clients and creditors. Funding Options Option 1: Cash or Sinking Fund In this option, a business establishes a savings plan, much like a bank account, toprotectitself fromthe death or disability of its key employees. At death, the cash in the savingsplan is usedas a sourceof funding. Unfortunately, this method has several drawbacks: A savings plan accumulates funds over time. What if funds are needed tomorrow? A savings plan may be depleted to pay for other expenses. Accumulated cash could cause an accumulated earnings problem. The business owner(s) will pay dollar for dollar, thus depleting the amount ofcash thatcould be used elsewhere. Option 2: Borrowing Funds In this option, funds are borrowed, usually a bank loan, to replace the financialloss causedby a keyemployee's death or disability.

"We recognized that young families often have limited resources but stillrequire protection," said Mike Gallo, senior vice president of the Company'sIndividual Life Department. "Spectra Life will provide flexible, neededinsurance protection at a reasonable cost to a segment of the populationthat studies show is often underinsured." Indeed, New York Life believes Spectra Life is the ideal insurance packagefor growing families headed by individuals between the ages of 20 and 45with an income between $30,000 and $75,000 - a market that representsapproximately 14.4 million households in the United States. 1 Spectra Life offers growing families three different options of lifeinsurance protection designed to provide insurance coverage at a premiumcost that can be, in some cases, up to 60 percent less than a traditionalwhole life policy. The options are as follows: Spectra 1 - offers families a 25 percent whole life and 75 percent term insurance mix that maintains a level of cost for a five-year period. In addition, customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance portion of the coverage into cash value whole life. Spectra 2 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life and term life insurance that maintains a level cost for a five-year period. In addition, customers have the privilege of converting the term insurance portion of the coverage into cash value whole life. Spectra 3 - offers families a 50/50 mix of whole life insurance with a Dividend Option Term rider and the Option to Purchase Paid-Up Additions rider. This blend maximizes insurance coverage and eventually replaces the term insurance with paid-up additional insurance. "We believe New York Life's Spectra Life plans will give young families theability to purchase insurance when their needs are greatest - at a loweconomical cost - and to allow them to increase their coverage as theirneeds mature," added Gallo.

Ours is a history notable for consistentfinancialstrength as well as dynamic innovation. For a century and a half, New YorkLife's firstpriority has been our policyowners' financial well-being. To keep pace withpolicyowners'needs, the Company has launched new products, enhanced product features,expanded qualityservice, and pioneered new technologies. Breaking new ground is part of theNew York Lifetradition. That's what makes us "A Company of Firsts." Unsurpassed Financial Strength 1845 - New York Life declares the first cash dividendeverpaid topolicyowners in America As a mutual insurer, New York Life is owned by its policyowners. Andvirtually everyyear since its inception, New York Life has declared dividends to those policyowners - nearly$23 billion in total. In 1995, New York Life made the highest totaldividendsdistribution in our history -- approximately $1.19 billion. 1899 - New York Life becomes the first American lifeinsurance companyto publish a detailed financial report for its policyowners Early financial reports showed a Company with a strong foundation and apromising future. Starting modestly with assets of $17,000 in 1845, the Company has grown to over $74 billion in consolidated assets, with over $449 billion of life insurance inforce.1 Those first financial reportsshowed acompany with a sound, conservative investment philosophy. Today, we remaintrue to thatprudent approach to investing. Three-quarters of our assets are invested inbonds, with 94%of that bond portfolio held in investment grade bonds. 1 Consolidated figures ofNewYork Life InsuranceCompany, including its direct, wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries, NewYork LifeInsurance and Annuity Corporation, New York Life and Health Insurance Company,and NYLIFEInsurance Company of Arizona. Our Commitment to Our Customers 1894 - New York Life becomes the first United Statescompany to issuelife insurance to women at the same rates as men Susan B. Anthony, the 19th-century American social reformer, believedstrongly that ifwomen were to achieve political equality, they had to be financiallyindependent. She wasone of the first women to own an insurance policy, and her insurer was New YorkLife. 1896 - New York Life becomes the first company toinsurepeople withphysical impairments or hazardous occupations Using a scientific basis to evaluate people with substandard risks, NewYork Life wasable to issue policies to people previously considered uninsurable. Thisinnovation --praised by experts at the time as the single greatest advancement in lifeinsurance -- enabled millions of people (who in the past would have been declined) to qualifyfor lifeinsurance and protect their families' financial future. Adding Value and Flexibility to Life Insurance 1860 - New York Life becomes the first company to issuepoliciescontaining a "non-forfeiture option" Before any state law required it, New York Life developed thenon-forfeiture option,which formed the foundation of guaranteed cash values found in policies today. This featureenables a policy to remain in force even when a premium payment isinadvertently missed. Today, policyowners have various ways to apply cash values to prevent theirpolicies fromlapsing. Typically, the options include automatic premium loan, extended terminsurance, andreduced paid-up insurance. 1892 - New York Life becomes the first major company toissue policieswith an incontestable clause To give policyowners even more peace of mind, New York Life sets a timelimit on theinsurer's right to dispute a policy's validity based on material misstatementsmade in theapplication. 1920 - New York Life becomes the first company to issueapolicy with adisability benefit that presumes total disability to be permanent after apredeterminednumber of months New York Life has long been a leader in liberal insurance concepts. TheCompany providesa benefit that waives premiums when the insured is disabled for a predeterminedperiod oftime. 1948 - New York Life becomes the first non-industrialcompany to offerfamily insurance The Company helps families by introducing a family insurance plan offeringcoverage onall members of a family under one policy. 1956 - New York Life becomes the first company to offerthe convenienceof Check-O-Matic premium payments This innovation relieves policyowners of the burdensome task of writing acheck to makepremium payments. Policyowners can now authorize New York Life to draw fundsdirectly fromtheir bank accounts to pay premiums each month. 1992 - New York Life becomes the first major insurer tooffer policieswith an Unemployment Rider To help aid policyowners through hard times, this no-cost rider offers towaive premiumsif policyowners become unemployed for a predetermined period of time. Earlier, the Companyintroduced the Living Benefits Rider. Should an insured become terminally ill,this riderprovides for a benefit payment that can be used to pay medical expenses duringthisdifficult time. Our Focus on Quality Service 1892 - New York Life becomes the first insurer toorganizea BranchOffice System To provide the highest possible level of service to our expanding customerbase, theCompany established an integrated network of General Offices across thecountry. Today, these"G.O.s" serve our nearly 11,000 agents. We believe this highly trainedteam ofdedicated professionals is our most valuable asset. Our agents have beenhonored by theindustry for outstanding service to their clients, and New York Life hasconsistently led theindustry in membership in the Million Dollar Round Table, an organizationdevoted to promoting exemplary ethical standards of the insurance industry. 1989 - New York Life becomes the first insurer to requirecontinuingeducation for its agents To provide agents with the knowledge they require to keep pace with therapidly changingfinancial services marketplace, the Company launched NYLIC University inJanuary 1995.

Establishing asoundfinancial plan can be a key to easing that burden and allow your children the education theydeserve. Putting a Foundation Beneath Your Children's Dreams All parents have big dreams for their children. They hope one day they'll grow up to becomesomeonetruly great - the President of the U.S., a doctor who finds a miracle cure, a concertpianist. Thesedreams can be obtained with the help of a college education. How Much Does College Cost? Most people look back on their college years with great fondness - and many look ahead totheirchildren's education with some anxiety. With costs so high, how can I afford to send my kidsto college?According to 1995-1996 College Board statistics, a college education currently averages about$37,000 for a four-year degree at a public college, and over $79,000 at a four-year privateschool.Looking at the Ivy League? Four years of tuition, fees, room and board now costs about$100,000 atelite schools such as Harvard and Yale. And costs keep rising. The College Board says thattheaverage annual increase in tuition at private universities during the 1980s was about 11%.Thesenumbers can strike fear into the hearts of parents of college-bound children. Sure, the everrising costsof college can be a challenge, but it is one that can be met. Early preparation can help makeit easierfor everyone concerned. How Much Will You Need To Save? If your child is age 1: It will take a $434 invested each month for 17 years to pay for a college education at aprivateuniversity. If your child is age 10: It will take a $876 invested each month for 8 years to pay for a college education at aprivateuniversity.

No consideration ismade fortaxes, sales charges, or any other fees and expenses. Here Are Some Tips on Getting a Handle on College Funding: Pre-Pay Tuition - Some state universities have set up innovative programswhere college expensesmay be paid in installments over many years, prior to attending the school. This may be aconvenientway to meet expenses, but it takes the choice of school away from your child. What if yourchild doesnotwant to attend the state university? This could pose a problem. Borrowing - These days, most people borrow at least a portion of the moneyneeded to cover collegeexpenses. You may want your children to look for student loans with special lower rates andrepaymentterms for college. However, repaying a large loan for many years after graduation can be a burden for some recent graduates. Tapping into your401(k)plan may be an option, but you may want to take a loan rather than a withdrawal to avoid taxconsequences. Of course, a loan will impede the potential growth of your retirement nest egg. Financial Aid - There are billions of dollars available each year inscholarships, grants, and work studyprograms. Financial aid to middle income families may be tough to come by, but with theshrunkencollege age population, some student-hungry universities are more willing to offer generousfinancialaid packages. It's certainly worth contacting your child's high school and prospectivecollege financialaid office to see if you're eligible. The Team Approach - With the seemingly overwhelming cost, it may be mostpractical to financeschool through many sources such as your personal savings, student loans, financial aid, even apart-time jobfor your child. Once in school, your child might want to look into paid internships thatprovide valuableexperience and help pay the bills. Every bit will help, but the bulk may still have to comefrom moneyyouput away over the years - so it's essential to make the most of your savings and investments. The Key to College Funding Start saving now! There's no better time than the present to begin accumulating funds forfuture collegecosts. Below are some tips: Put time on your side - If your children are young, or you don't havechildrenyet, you can put the powerof time to work for you. The sooner you start, the better, letting the wonder of compoundinterest helpbuild a nice college fund. Pay yourself first - Systematically set aside a fixed amount at a regularintervalthat you can comfortablyafford. You may be able to have this done automatically through bank drafting and payrolldeduction.Speak to your financial institution and payroll department to set up these convenient savingsmethods. Use tax advantages - You can try to maximize earnings and minimize taxesthrough severaltax-advantaged strategies. Investing in tax-free municipal bonds or bond funds, setting up atrust, andmaking a gift under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act are three ways to possibly lower the taxbite. Consultyour tax advisor and attorney regarding these approaches. Don't put all your eggs in one basket - Diversification is a key to reducingpotential risk. Dividing yourmoney among different financial vehicles may help protect against loss and increase thepotential forcompetitive returns. If your children are still in diapers and you have a long time horizon,you may wantto consider financial products that may offer the potential for greater returns to complementtraditionalbank products. The Financial Vehicles to Take Your Kids to College Before your child asks you for a spiffy new sports car to take to school, you may want totake a look atsome financial vehicles. Permanent life insurance products, such as whole life and universallife, offercash value accumulation in addition to their essential financial protection. Over the longterm, the cashvalue accumulation may be significant enough to help fund a portion of college expenses.Annuitiesmay also be an option.

Are Pension Plans Too Complicated For SmallBusinesses? Simplified Employee Pension Plan Ideas From The Company You Keep Owners of small businesses agree that a retirement plan can do a lot for a growing company.Findingone with features that your business needs, such as tax advantages, low cost, and minimalpaperwork,can be challenging. Look no further than a Simplified Employee Pension plan (SEP). A SEP plan is an easy way to make contributions toward youremployees' retirement income - and your own. Through a SEP, you take a tax deduction for contributions you make directly to youremployees' IRAs.Meanwhile, these contributions are excluded from employees' gross incomes. Since employeeshandle their own IRAs, you pay benefits directly into their accounts instead of operating apension planof your own. Your contributions are also completely discretionary, and you can change themfrom year toyear. Even if you've missed the year-end deadline that applies to most qualified plans, you canstill establisha SEP for last year - and get the tax deduction. Thanks to the tax deductibility of contributions, the net cost of installing and running aSEP can be zeroor may even create a positive cash flow for many business owners. The Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP): Tax-Free, Form-Free, Hassle-Free...Completely Stress-Free You may find a SEP most attractive for what it doesn't have: No annual IRS or Department of Labor filings; No funding until your company's tax filing date; No income taxes on contributions; No required contributions from year to year; No complicated plan documentation; No complex record keeping or expensive administration. A SEP means no longer trying to accommodate an expensive, labor-intensive pension plan designed for a large company. A SEP is a cost-effective and flexible program, packed with employeeadvantagesand the flexibility a small company needs. You can: Choose from a wide variety of investment options; Offer a companion plan (a Salary Reduction SEP [SARSEP]) that enables employeesto makepre-tax contributions, just like a 401(k); Design eligibility criteria that make the most sense for your company.

Review the list of objectivesandidentify those whichare most important to you. This will help determine which of these two products -CD ordeferredannuity - is best suited for your needs at this time. Objectives Safety of Principal: Both CDs and deferred annuities areconsidered low-riskinvestments. CDs aregenerally issued by banks and, in most cases, are insured by the Federal DepositInsuranceCorporation (FDIC) for up to $100,000 per depositor. Should the bank fail, theFDICguarantees CDs upto this amount. Deferred annuities, on the other hand, are issued by insurance companies and arenot insuredby theU.S. government. They are backed in their entirety by the financial strength of theissuinginsurancecompany, regardless of the amount. Before purchasing an annuity however, you shouldmake suretheissuing insurance company is financially sound. You can determine financialstability byrequesting thefindings of independent rating companies such as Moody's, A.M. Best, Standard &Poor's andDuff & Phelps. Short-Term Accumulation: When deciding between a CD and adeferredannuity, your investmenthorizon should be a key factor. Your investment horizon is the amount of time youneed tosave for aspecific goal. For short-term goals, such as a down payment on a home, a new car oravacation, a CDmay prove to be a better choice for you. In most instances, you can select amaturity datefor your CDthat corresponds to your time horizon. Maturity periods can be as short as onemonth or aslong asseveral years. Long-Term Accumulation: On the other hand, a deferred annuity isgenerallythe product of choice forthe long haul. Deferred annuities are designed to help accumulate money forretirement or toprotectfunds already saved up once you've reached retirement. They can even be used toprovide alegacy foryour heirs. In later years, a deferred annuity also provides more flexibility foraccessingyour money. Interest Return: CDs offer a guaranteed rate of return for aspecifiedperiod oftime. Interest rates willvary depending on current market conditions and the length of time to maturity.Generally,the shorterthe period of time to maturity, the lower the rate. There is no guaranteed minimumforrenewal rates.With a deferred annuity, a guaranteed interest rate is locked in for an initialperiod,usually one to threeyears. After that, interest rates may be adjusted periodically, generally eachyear. Becauseannuities arelong-term vehicles, their interest rates tend to be higher than comparable CDs. Deferred annuities also offer a guaranteed minimum interest rate. Regardless ofmarketconditions, theannuity will pay at least the minimum guaranteed rate established at the time ofpurchase. Inaddition,some companies offer a "bailout" rate to protect against excessive year-to-yearratefluctuations. Tax Savings: If taxes are a concern, a deferred annuity may be abetteroptionfor several reasons: Earnings on CDs are taxable in the year the interest is earned even if you don'ttake themoney out. Withdeferred annuities, on the other hand, earnings accumulate free of currenttaxation. Earningsinside anannuity are not treated as taxable income until they are withdrawn. This allowsmore of yourmoney towork harder towards achieving your long-term goals and gives you a measure ofcontrol overwhen youpay taxes and how much you pay. This tax deferral feature is one of the greatestadvantagesof deferredannuities. As you can see from the chart below, when saving for the long term it makes goodinvestmentsense tohave the power of tax deferral on your side. Keep in mind that withdrawals from theearningsportion of adeferred annuity are taxable and, if you're under age 59 1/2, these earnings may besubjectto a 10% taxpenalty. *Hypothetical rate used for illustrative purposes only. Not intended to predictnor guarantee any actual product results. This amount does not reflect the effect of applicable feesand/or charges. Deferred annuities may also help reduce or eliminate the taxes on your SocialSecuritybenefits. Byleaving your money in a deferred annuity you can reduce your taxable income,keeping it belowthe levelwhere you would begin to owe taxes on your Social Security benefits. But with CDs,yourinterestearnings count in the calculation to determine how much of your Social Securitybenefits willbe taxed -even if you don't withdraw the earnings. As much as 85% of your Social Securitybenefitscould end upsubject to taxation. At death, the annuity's account value will be paid directly to your namedbeneficiary(ies),avoiding thecosts and delays associated with the probate process. This is not the case with aCD, whichisincluded in your estate. When purchasing a deferred annuity, look for one thatdistributesthe fullaccount value to beneficiaries. Some companies apply surrender charges on deathbenefitproceeds. Liquidity: If you need access to the funds in a CD prior to thematuritydate, youmay pay an interestpenalty ranging from 30 days' to six months' interest. Of course, you can limityour exposuretosurrender penalties by investing in several CDs with staggered maturity dates. A deferred annuity also provides you with access to funds should the need arise.Mostcompanies willgive you the flexibility to withdraw a portion of your deferred annuity's accountvalue,usually 10% eachyear, without a company-imposed surrender charge. Withdrawals from deferredannuities can bemadein response to a one time cash need or set up systematically to respond to acontinuous need.In fact,most deferred annuities offer the opportunity to systematically withdraw funds on amonthly,quarterly,semi-annual or annual basis. Keep in mind that deferred annuities are designed to build your retirement nestegg.Withdrawals ofearnings prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% penalty tax.

It'simportant that thefuturefinancial strength of these nonprofit organizations is secure. They face thedilemma ofincreased demandfor services in the wake of reduced government support and overflowing operationalcosts. New York Life offers hope. Charitable Adjustable Life (CAL), a specially designedlifeinsurance plan,underwritten by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), can helpsecureendowment funds for the future.

As theowner and beneficiary of the policy, individual nonprofit organizations have accessto anycash values thataccrue - areal plus if they need liquidity. CAL makes it possible to plan now for a brightfuture. CAL - The Best of Both Worlds In the past, it was common to rely heavily on a handful of wealthy donors. BecauseCAL isaffordable,those limited to making smaller donations may now be able to fund sizable gifts fortomorrow. CALneed not interfere with present solicitation efforts - it's meant to supplement,not replace,currentdonations. Donors to a nonprofit organization that participates will also find CAL attractive.Sincedonors can fund CAL from current income,rather thanaccumulated wealth, they don't have to utilize assets that were intended for theirfamilies.

We're Here to Support Nonprofit Organizations CAL is simple, effective and makes perfect sense for nonprofit organizations. NewYorkLife'soutstandingreputation for customer service makes establishing a CAL arrangement easy. Aftera nonprofit organization has secured agroup of interested donors, the donors fill out a simple medical form, and a NewYork Liferepresentative provides a letter of intent to the organization. When theorganizationreceives all premiums/donations,they simply send acheck for the total amount to New York Life.

If youalready own aterm policy, should you convert it to a permanent plan, such as whole life? Or is a flexibleplan, such asuniversal life, the way to go? There are no easy answers to these questions. And that is not because thethree kinds ofinsurance are so complex and difficult to understand - actually, the differences between themare basicand easily comprehensible. What makes these questions difficultis that theanswers depend on you, your budget, and your needs. One kind of insurance is notnecessarily"better" than the other; and they are certainly not mutually exclusive. More than likely, yourchoice willnotbe "either/or" but "the best mix." Term, Whole Life, Universal Term insurance provides economic protection for a specified period (or "term") at aspecified rate. Itis "no frills" coverage that is very inexpensive at younger ages and becomes increasinglymoreexpensive as you get older. Its "premium" (what you're required to pay to keep the policy inforce)increases each term (since you can also buy this kind of insurance for periods of one,five, or eventen years). It is designed to lock-in insurability for conversion to permanent insurance in thefuture. Permanent insurance, on the other hand, provides permanent protection, coverage foryour wholelife. "Whole life" insurance offers a level or fixed premium that is guaranteed never to go up,because itaverages insurance costs over your lifetime. In the early years, therefore, premiums arehigher than theamount required to pay only for pure death benefit protection. If it were that simple, the choice between term and permanent insurance would bestraightforward: Whatever your age, buy the cheaper product. However, the premium you pay in the earlyyears of awhole life policy helps build a guaranteed tax-deferred "cash value," which is availableduring yourlifetime, in the form of policy loans that can be used to meet emergencies, fund educationexpenses, orprovide income for retirement. Moreover, whole life policies from mutual insurancecompanies aregenerally "participating," which means that they earn dividends. What about universal life? Like whole life, this kind of insurance is permanent, offeringlifetimeprotection and cash value accumulation. Unlike whole life, however, universal-type policiesfeature anadjustable death benefit and flexible premiums. After making an initial minimum premiumpayment,policy owners may pay whatever they desire, subject to IRS and companyminimum/maximum rules;they may even skip premium payments for a year or longer. The policy's death benefit mayfluctuateaccordingly. With a universal policy, you have added flexibility to adjust your death benefitand premiumpayments according to your current needs. Which is Best for You? Term insurance is normally the better buy for the younger age groups and for the shortrun. Itmakesthe ideal choice when you're young, just starting out, and on a strict budget, since it allowsyou to buythe full amount of coverage you need at an affordable price. After all, there is no point tobuying apermanent policy if you simply can't afford it; you'll either buy less coverage than you needor, evenworse, lose your money as well as your coverage if you allow the policy to lapse because ofnonpayment. Term insurance is perfect when your needs are temporary and when you needprotection until adebt,such as a mortgage or a business or education loan is paid off. Generally speaking, if yourneed forprotection lasts ten years or less, or will cease entirely before age 50, term insurance is anintelligentbuy. If you don't need protection after a certain point in your life, for instance once the children have left home, your spouse is self-supporting, Additional income is not needed for retirement years, or you have no desire to leave an inheritance or need to protect an estate orbusiness, terminsurance is right for you. However, if you need insurance for an extended period - for ten or more years - and ifyou do havethekinds of needs listed above, you should consider permanent plans, such as whole life anduniversallife. Some Things to Consider "Baby Boomers" who are having children in their thirties and forties are often financinga mortgage,paying and saving for the education of their children, building a retirement nest egg, andperhaps evenhelping to fund long-term care for their parents. They are the first generation of Americans tobehandling these responsibilities simultaneously. Permanent insurance provides not onlynecessaryeconomic protection, but also the kind of asset accumulation opportunity they need to meetconvergingdemands. Over time, it is much more cost-efficient than term insurance. After the age of fifty, permanent insurance is almost certainly the better buy, since termpremiumsincrease considerably thereafter and are not recoverable in the form of cash value ordividends. Permanent insurance, however, allows you to leave your options open with respect toeconomicprotection, retirement and education funding, and estate planning. It can be used to boostmonthlyretirement income through a technique known as "pension maximization." It can also be amajor estateplanning tool, enabling you to minimize estate taxes and provide liquidity for your heirs. What about the retirement years? The cash value in a permanent policy can be used tosupplementSocial Security, pension benefits, and investment income. You can borrow from it or eventurn it into anannuity generating monthly income for life. Choosing the Best Mix What if you're sold on the value of permanent insurance but can't afford all thecoverage you need? You have some options. You can buy the term insurance you need and gradually convert it,piece bypiece, into permanent insurance. (Most term policies have a "conversion" privilege thatallows you toturn your term insurance into permanent insurance without proving good health.) Let's sayyou need$200,000 worth of insurance: you can buy a term policy for that amount and later convert$50,000 of itinto a permanent plan, keeping the rest of the term in force to convert in the future. Whetheryou chooseto convert to whole life or universal life will depend on your specific needs for an adjustabledeathbenefit and flexible premium payments. Another option is to buy a permanent plan with term insurance added to it. If, again,you need$200,000 of insurance but can only afford to pay for little more than $100,000 of permanentcoverage,you may be able to buy a base plan with $100,000 of cash value insurance and, for only alittle moremoney, a $100,000 "term rider." Or, you might buy a $200,000 universal life policy, startingoff with theminimum premium and gradually increasing those payments as circumstances allow. When all is said and done, you needn't be thinking in terms of "term versuspermanent." Rather,youshould be thinking of what is the best mix of term and permanent insurance that will meetyour needs. With the help of your New York Life agent, you can design an insurance plan that is flexibleandaffordable - a customized plan that will meet your needs and help you reach your goals.

They allow people to accumulate moneywithoutpaying current income tax on their earnings. This means that the amount can grow faster,dueto the tremendous power of compound interest. For example, if you have $10,000 to invest in a deferred annuity that is earning 5% ayear, at the end of the first year your annuity will be worth $10,500. That full amount willbe available to earn interest the following year. If, instead, you invest in a currentlytaxable investment that is also earning 5%, and your marginal tax rate is 28%, at the endofthe year only $10,360 will be available for reinvestment. The remaining $140 will be paid tothe government for income tax on the $500 you earn. This may seem like a small sum ofmoney,but if this continues for ten years, the difference between the values of the tax-deferredannuity and the currently taxable investment will be $2,046! (Of course, taxes must still bepaid when the earnings inside the annuity contract are distributed. If the annuity werecashed in after ten years, the income tax would be $1,761, assuming a 28% rate and nopenaltytaxes). There are two types of deferred annuities - fixed and variable. Fixed annuities pay afixed rate of interest similar to CDs. Unlike annuities, CDs are FDIC insured. Variable annuities offer the choice of severalinvestment divisions such as stocks, bonds, and money market funds, which can cause therate ofreturn to fluctuate with market conditions.

Choosing an investment strategy that suits you is never easy. You face a myriad oftoughquestions,including: How much money should I invest? How often should I invest? Where should I invest my money? Fortunately, there's a venerable investment strategy that could be the answer tomany of yourconcerns.It's called Dollar Cost Averaging, and it can simplify your investment planning. The name may sound complicated but, simply put, Dollar Cost Averaging is nothingmore thanthesystematic investment of a fixed dollar amount at regular time intervals. Forexample, youcould invest$100 every week. Or $500 every month. Or $1,000 every three months. The amountandfrequencyofyour investments depends upon your financial means and long-term goals. However,once youinitiatethe plan, the key to success is sticking with it and ignoring market fluctuations. How Does Dollar Cost Averaging Work? Basically, Dollar Cost Averaging attempts to take the ups and downs of the marketand "smooththemout." Instead of trying to time the highs and lows (a daunting task, even forprofessionals),you'reinvesting the same amount of money at regular intervals. Dollar Cost Averagingencourages asystematic approach to investing that frees you from trying to time the market.Let's take alook at how aDollar Cost Averaging program would work under three hypothetical marketenvironments:fluctuating,rising, and declining. Dollar Cost Averaging in Turbulent Times Let's assume you decide to put $100 every month in an investment that is currentlysellingfor $10 pershare. (For this hypothetical example, let's assume that there are no additionalcharges).The firstmonth you invest $100 and receive 10 shares. Then, in an extreme but easy tofollowexample,themarket falls and the price drops to $5 per share. In the second month your $100buys you 20shares.The market rebounds in the following month, the price jumps to $10 per share, andfor your$100investment you receive 10 shares. Let's see where you would stand: Fluctuating Market Regular Investment Share Price # of Shares Acquired $100 $10 10 $100 $5 20 $100 $10 10 Total: $300 $25 40 Average Share Cost To You: $7.50 ($300Ã·40) Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $8.33 ($25Ã·3) As you can see, you now own 40 shares after a total investment of $300. Theaverageprice is$8.33,but the average cost to you was $7.50. Being disciplined and remaining with theprogram isthe key tothe long-term success of Dollar Cost Averaging. In Good Times... Let's say you continue with your investment program, and the market rallies. Yourinvestmentrises to$20, then $25, and eventually $50 per share. Let's see where you stand. Rising Market Regular Investment Share Price # of Shares Acquired $100 $20 5 $100 $25 4 $100 $50 2 Total: $300 $95 11 Average Share Cost To You: $27.27 ($300Ã·411) Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $31.67 ($95Ã·3) When the market rises, you benefit in two ways: the value of your total investmentincreases(obviously),and the average cost you paid is lower than the average share price (not soobvious, buttrue). Whenyou compare the average share price ($31.67) to what you actually paid ($27.27),you canappreciatethe benefits of Dollar Cost Averaging. ...And In Bad It's tough to find a silver lining in the dark cloud of a declining market, butthrough theconsistency ofDollar Cost Averaging, you can take some consolation. Let's assume the marketbegins to slideandthe price drops to $25, then $20 and eventually $10 per share. Declining Market Regular Investment Share Price # of Shares Acquired $100 $25 4 $100 $20 5 $100 $10 10 Total: $300 $55 19 Average Share Cost To You: $15.79 ($300Ã·19) Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $18.33 ($55Ã·3) Here, when the share price fell from $25 to $10 you were able to purchase thegreatest numberofshares. In addition, your average share cost ($15.79) was less than the averageshare price.Becauseyou invested a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals, ignoring the pricefluctuations, youwere able topurchase a larger number of shares when the price was low and a smaller number ofshareswhenthe price was high. In effect, you are buying a lot at bargain prices, andrelatively littleat what might beconsidered exorbitantly high prices. No Guarantees in Life As illustrated in the "declining market" example, Dollar Cost Averaging does notguarantee aprofit norprotect against loss. If you have to "sell low," no system is going to give you again. It'severy investorsdream to "beat the market," but unfortunately there are no magic methods that canguaranteethat.However, a Dollar Cost Averaging plan can offer a disciplined, systematic approachtoinvesting, thatcould be the cornerstone of your long-term planning. Since such plans involvecontinuousinvestment insecurities regardless of fluctuating price levels, you should consider yourfinancial abilityto continuemaking purchases during periods of low price levels. Setting Up a Dollar Cost Averaging Plan While Dollar Cost Averaging may simplify the questions "How much?" and "How often?"youshouldinvest, before you can enjoy the benefits of this program you must first answer thequestion,"Whereshould I invest?" Investing in variable products is a popular way to utilize DollarCostAveraging.Vehicles such as mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal lifeinsuranceofferinvestment flexibility and convenience. You can set up a customized program whereyou investa fixedamount at regular time intervals into a variable product. Your regular investmentscan bemade bysimply writing checks, or you can take advantage of the convenience of bankdrafting. Withthis method,automatic payments are withdrawn from your bank savings or checking account topurchaseshares ona regular basis.

Your kids are buckled up and ready to go. You remembered theswimfins,the beach umbrella, and the gift for your friends in Florida. This is going to be a terrificvacation! But asyou pull onto the highway, you get the strange feeling that there's something you forgot todo. Even the most relaxed traveler can be preoccupied with the thought of starting aninvestment planfora child's college tuition. You should know that there's no reason to procrastinate. You canjust pick upyour car phone - or pull over at the next phone booth - and call your registeredrepresentative todiscuss opening an UTMA account as soon as you return home. What is UTMA? The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) - and in certain states, the Uniform Gift toMinors Act(UGMA)-may be a way for you to save on taxes as you save for your children's education. As statelaws mayvary, investors should consult their personal legal/tax professional for additionalinformation. (ThisWeb page discusses UTMA since it has been adopted in the majority of states.) By setting up an account in the child's name under the UTMA, you can make a transfer ofup to$10,000 per year per child, without affecting your lifetime unified gift/estate tax credit. Since yourspousecan do the same, together you can give each of your children up to $20,000 per year,shiftingall or partof the investment earnings to the child's tax rate, which may be lower than your own. Evenif yourtransfer is less than $10,000, the strategy may offer potential tax benefits. Here's howearnings arecurrently taxed in an UTMA account: Until your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year iscovered by thechild's standard deduction and is not taxed. The next $650 in unearned income may be taxedat thechild's rate. Unearned income above $1,300 per year is taxed at the parent's rate. After your child turns age fourteen, the first $650 in unearned income each year iscovered by thechild's standard deduction and is not taxed. Remaining income may be taxed at the child'srate. Help Make Saving for College Less Taxing The table shows how an UTMA transfer may help reduce taxes and build a larger fund forfutureexpenses. It assumes a systematic investment of $150 per month in an UTMA account for achild,starting at age seven. The account earns a hypothetical eight percent annual return, beforetaxes. If thechild's tax rate is fifteen percent (after the first $650 on interest, which is not taxed)and the parent's taxrate is twenty-eight percent, the table shows the potential tax advantages of the UTMAinvestment. $1,119$4,281 An UTMA May Help Reduce Taxes UTMA Account Account inParent's Name Child's Age at year end Annual Tax Balance Annual Tax Balance 8 $0 $1,871 $20 $1,851 9 0 3,891 61 3,808 10 0 6,073 105 5,878 11 0 8,429 151 8,068 12 0 10,974 200 10,383 13 30 13,693 252 12,832 14 55 16,604 307 15,422 15 82 19,721 365 18,162 16 120 23,049 427 21,059 17 152 26,612 491 24,122 18 187 30,424 560 27,363 19 226 34,502 633 30,790 20 267 38,866 709 34,414 Total Tax Thischart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to predict or guarantee theresults of any investment, which will vary with market conditions and fluctuations.

The account will involve acustodian; yourregistered representative can guide you in completing the application. Separate accounts arerequiredfor transfers to each child. Be sure to provide the child's Social Security number (not thatof the personmaking the gift or of the custodian). The custodian will have full authority to makedecisions, includingcontrol over investments. Since transfers must be permanent, parents can't gain access to the money for their ownuse. Also,all assets in the UTMA account will belong to the child when he or she reaches the age ofmajority. Youmay also want to consider the possibility that assets held in your children's names couldaffect thelevel of financial aid they'll be eligible to receive when they apply to schools.

In other words, the IRS, not your heirs, could be the singlelargest beneficiary of your estate. Some people think estate planning is only necessary for those select individuals who appearin episodes of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Unfortunately, this misconception couldcost your heirs. Federal estate taxes begin at 37% for estates valued over $600,000 and canclimb as high as 60% for estates over $10,000,000 and under $21,040,000. In reality, if youown assets, you need to plan for their future disposition. Do you need to worry about estate taxes? All too often, people underestimate the value oftheir estate. Did you know that your estate includes your home, cash, investments, pensionbenefits, personal property, trusts you own, alter, amend or revoke, certain life insuranceproceeds, and any other assets you and your spouse may own jointly or as community property?The fact is, you are generally worth more than you think. Fortunately, there are a number of strategies designed to minimize the impact of estatetaxes. The following illustrates some of the most fundamental estate planningtechniques. Unlimited Marital Deduction The unlimited marital deduction is one of the most powerful estate planning tools available.The Internal Revenue Code allows an unlimited amount of property to be transferred to thesurviving spouse who is a U.S. citizen tax free when the first spouse dies. Therefore, if youare willing to pass all of your assets to your surviving spouse, there will be no federalestate tax exposure at that time. This is an effective strategy but it is not a completesolution to your estate planning needs. Yes, a surviving spouse will receive the assetsestate tax free, but when he or she dies the entire estate will be subject to estate taxes.Using the unlimited marital deduction does not eliminate estate taxes, it merely defers them- leaving your heirs, in most cases your children, with the responsibility of paying theestate tax bill. (Different rules apply to resident alien surviving spouses.) Unified Tax Credit The unified estate and gift tax credit of $192,800 allows you to give away up to $600,000while you are alive to anyone you want, whenever you want, gift tax free. If married, you andyour spouse can combine your credits. By properly utilizing the unified tax credit you candecrease the value of your estate by $1.2 million and save your heirs close to $400,000 inestate taxes. By gifting money or property while alive, the income and appreciation on the gifted assets isnot part of your estate when you die and is not subject to federal estate taxes. Tax-Effective Will A tax-effective will utilizes a combination of the unlimited marital deduction and theunified tax credit to reduce your estate tax exposure. Here's how it works: You and yourspouse establish a special account that allows the first-to-die spouse the right to leave upto $600,000 of assets to heirs. This special account is a credit bypass trust. The estate taxattributed to this trust is offset by the unified credit. If properly structured, anyremaining estate balance should qualify for the unlimited marital deduction. The survivingspouse can be an income beneficiary of the credit bypass trust, and have the right to incomefrom the trust for life. At the death of the second spouse, the assets in the trust can pass to your beneficiarieswithout being subject to estate taxes in the surviving spouse's estate. In addition, anyappreciation of the assets in the trust will pass to your heirs tax free. Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust There are basically two life insurance categories: traditional and second-to-die. Traditionalinsurance is term, whole life, and universal life coverage that pays a death benefit afterthe insured dies. Survivorship Whole Life insurance, or second-to-die insurance, insures twoindividuals in one insurance plan and pays the death benefit after the death of the secondinsured. Life insurance is a cost-effective funding vehicle for an estate plan. You pay pennies on thedollar for life insurance protection, and your heirs may use the life insurance proceeds topay the estate tax bill, without depleting the estate's assets. However, if you own a lifeinsurance policy at death, the proceeds will be included in your gross estate. To avoid this,you need to make sure you do not own the policy when you die. Also, be sure your estate isnot the beneficiary of your life insurance proceeds. Instead, create an irrevocable life insurance trust. You would gift cash to the trust so thetrust can make the necessary premium payments. The trust applies for, owns the policy, andpays the premiums. At death, the insurance proceeds pass into the trust and escape estatetaxes. If properly structured, the trust can also provide benefits to a surviving spouseand/or any other beneficiaries. If you were to transfer an existing life insurance policy to an irrevocable life insurancetrust, you must live three years from the date of transfer or the value of existing policyproceeds will be brought back into your estate. To avoid this three-year rule, you must havean irrevocable trust or other third-party owner apply for and purchase a new policy on yourlife. Annual Exclusion Gifts By gifting a portion of money and property while alive, you can dramatically reduce the sizeof your taxable estate. The federal Annual Exclusion Gift Law permits you to give $10,000each year to as many individuals as you desire. Most people choose to give such gifts totheir children and grandchildren. If married, you and your spouse can give away up to $20,000per recipient annually. Your gifts are income tax free to your recipients and each gift maydecrease the amount your heirs will have to pay in estate taxes. $3,000,000(800,000) $2,200,000$735,000 The Annual Gift Tax Exclusion 5 Years Ago Today Estate Value (married couple) $3,000,000 Less gifts (0) Taxable estate $3,000,000 Estate tax $1,098,000 Tax Savings $363,000 Assumptions: A married couple begins a five-year gift program. Both spouses gift $20,000 per year to eight family members for a total of $160,000 peryear. Taxable estate is reduced by $800,000 after five years. Estate tax is reduced to $735,000 for a total estate tax savings of $363,000. As you can see, estate planning is a little like surgery. No one can expect you to understandit all, much less perform the operation yourself. But, wouldn't you rather plan today thanhave your heirs lose 37 to 60 cents on the dollar later?

Best -- have all given New York Life and NYLIAC(its annuity subsidiary) high ratings. Term vs. Whole Life - What's the difference, and which one should I buy? As with any insurance product, it depends on your needs. Generally, the difference betweenterm life insurance and whole life insurance is that whole life is a permanent product thatbuilds cash value. Policyowners can make loans against the cash value if needed. It has ahigher initial premium, which remains level throughout the life of the policy. Term is a temporary insurance product with a fairly low initial premium, which increases asyou get older. Beneficiaries will receive insurance proceeds only if death occurs within aspecified period - the "term" of the contract. A term policy offers protection only and doesnot build cash value.

Afterdecades of living in the comfort of family, you're suddenly faced with the harshrealities of life - bills,bills, bills. How does one deal with these new-found responsibilities? You canstart by building asound financial foundation. Acting discerningly on these matters could make thedifference betweenmaking it on your own, or moving back with the folks. Choose wisely... Banking - Shop around. You shouldn't necessarily stick with yourcurrent bankjust because you'vebeen with them a long time. You may want to open both a savings account forearning interest, and achecking account for paying the bills. It's important to compare interest rates,but you also should bewary of charges for services. Some banks allow you to "link" your accounts to reduce fees. Many local newspapersrun a "scorecard"of bank rates, which can be helpful. Although deposits up to $100,000 arefederally insured, you'll stillwant to choose a financially strong institution. If possible, have your employer"direct deposit" yourpaychecks into your bank. Health Insurance - With medical costs spiraling upward, havingsufficienthealth insurance is anecessity. If you're job hunting, you should take a serious look at the medicalbenefits offered byprospective employers. If you're fortunate, your employer will offer a grouphealth plan. If not, it'sessential to obtain some type of individual health insurance. Major Medical Plans typically offer a fee-for-coverage arrangement for a rangeof services includingphysicians' costs, medical tests, hospital fees, etc. With some plans, you may goto a doctor of yourown choice and your insurer reimburses you a predetermined percentage of cost. Most plans havedeductibles, which is the amount of money you must pay out-of-pocket before theinsurer begins payingthe expenses. Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) have become a popular option because oftheirminimal out-of-pocket cost. Generally, members must visit only doctors affiliatedwith the HMO;however your co-payment could be as low as $5-$10 per visit.When evaluating different plans it's important to consider what services arecovered, and theco-payments and deductibles that are involved. Life Insurance - If you think it's just for "older people," thinkagain. If you havestudent loans from yourcollege days, you may want to consider having some life insurance to cover them,and then some. It'sprobably a good idea to purchase a policy now, because generally the younger youare, the lower thepremium. Two of the basic types of life insurance are whole life and term life. Whole life is permanentinsurance - it's yours for as long as you continue to pay the premiums. Thepremiums are fixed andthe policy cannot be canceled by the insurer. Over the long-term, the policybuilds "cash value" that canbe tapped into for financial needs. Term insurance provides inexpensive coverageover apre-determined period of time - 5 years, 10 years, etc. It is pure protection anddoes not build cashvalue. One type is not necessarily "better" than the other, but you may find thata mixture of the two maybest suit your needs. Building Credit - If you plan on buying a home, starting abusiness, or doinganything in the future thatrequires borrowed money, you'll definitely want to start building a credit historynow. Getting a creditcard and paying it off faithfully is a good way to start. Many banks andorganizations offer VISA andMastercard with lots of bells and whistles attached - product discounts, airlinemileage, etc. - butdon't overlook the basics. You'll want to find a deal that offers worldwide acceptance, no annual fee, and alow interest rate. If youdon't have any credit history or if it's poor, there's still an alternative. Somebanks offer a "securedcredit card," which is an arrangement where you deposit funds in an account thatare then used as yourcredit limit. Of course, the key to building good credit is to spend within yourmeans. Looking to The Long-Term - Building a financial foundationmeansplanning for the long haul. If your employer offers a 401(k) or similar plan you'll certainly want to takeadvantage of this convenient,tax-deferred retirement plan. IRAs, CDs, annuities and mutual funds are options toconsider to helpbuild your nest egg. The key to realizing your financial dreams is starting nowwhile you have a longtime horizon.

If $10,000wereinvested andaccumulated tax-free for 15 years, it would grow to $27,590. However, if Federaland stateincome taxestook 35 percent of the interest every year, the initial $10,000 investment wouldgrow to just$19,492. Thedifference, $8,098, is significant. Even if the taxes on interest had to be paidwhen themoney waswithdrawn, after 15 years, the $27,590 would be reduced to $21,434, still $1,942ahead ofpaying thetaxes annually. The difference is due to interest earned on the tax dollars thatwere not paiduntillater. For many years, the tax laws provided numerous ways to defer income taxes oninvestmentearnings.(Deferred taxes are not paid immediately but are paid later, usually when funds arewithdrawn. Incometaxes cannot normally be avoided forever, except at death.) During the 1980s, mostof thosespecialrules were repealed. Three notable, but by no means the only, exceptions involvelifeinsurance, mutualfunds, and U.S. savings bonds. Life insurance proceeds paid at death have always been free of income taxes. Lesswell-known, butequally important, is the fact that the growth in cash value of insurance policiesis alsotax-free forindividuals as long as the funds remain in the policy and are not withdrawn. Thus,the cashvalueaccumulates without any tax reduction and can be borrowed when needed to pay foreducation (or forother reasons) without tax consequences in most cases. A special rule applies to so-called "modified endowment contracts," policies thatare stronglyinvestment-oriented. Check with your agent to see if your policy qualifies as aborrowedwhen needed topay for education (or for other reasons) without tax consequences in mostcases.modifiedendowmentcontract. Mutual funds can also provide tax advantages. Even if the mutual fund payscurrentlytaxable interest ordividends, income taxes can be reduced by putting assets in a child's name. Until1987, thistechnique,which relies on the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA), was very effective inreducingincome taxes,because all income was taxed at the child's rate, which normally is low. ThenCongresschanged thelaw, so that so-called "unearned" income (which includes interest and dividends)receivedby childrenunder age 14 is partly taxed at the rate applying to the child's parents. Even so,childrenunder 14 canreceive up to $550 in unearned income without paying any income tax. Thenext$550 is taxedat the child's own tax rate, typically 15 percent. Any unearned income exceeding$1,100 istaxed at theparents' rate. Another investment possibility with tax advantages is U.S. Savings bonds. Thesebonds arepurchasedfor half their face amount and pay variable market-based interest rates if held forfive yearsor longer.The interest rate is 85 percent of the rate on certain Treasury securities andvaries every sixmonths.Federal income tax is normally not paid until the bonds are redeemed, and they arecomplete exemptfrom state income taxes.

Today, they often offer interest rates that are comparable to (or higherthan) CDs, along with the added benefit of deferring taxes on the earnings until theyare withdrawn. Unlike annuities, CDs are FDIC insured. Fixed annuities, unlike many other fixed interest investments, contain guarantees ofminimum future interest rates. All fixed annuities have a minimum rate guarantee thatspecifies the lowest rate the insurer can offer. Some contracts also offer a "bailout"provision that allows the owner to withdraw money from the annuity without surrenderchargesif the crediting rate falls by more than a specific amount.

One could dismiss thismerely as the voice of a cynical generation but many financial experts have alsoexpressed reservationsregarding the future of the U.S. Social Security system. With working baby-boomerscomprising a largeportion of the U.S. population, the current Social Security system, funded by thenation's workforce, isfine. But what happens when today's boomers retire, and become tomorrow'srecipients of SocialSecurity benefits? What if there are more people receiving benefits, in the nextcentury, than there are inthe workforce funding those benefits? Many individuals in their twenties and thirties aren't wasting time speculating -they're planning for thefuture. According to the June 15, 1995 Wall Street Journal, 61% of"twenty-somethings" responding to asurvey sponsored by Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (a Chicago based moneymanagement firm)stated that they or their spouse had put money aside for retirement. The articlealso revealed that manyrespondents "were prepared to cut personal spending now in order to save forretirement." Even moreso than the boomers before them, today's under-35s are planning for the long-termfuture. With aresponsible mind focused on the future, it's also important to keep an eye ontoday, as well. Perhaps this is why one of the preferred long-term financial vehicles named by therespondents of theKemper poll was life insurance. It's wise to want to preserve future assets aslong as it does not turninto a situation of "putting the cart before the horse." While the baby boomergeneration may have beeninclined to ignore insurance in favor of financial products with potentiallyquicker and higher returns,more and more consumers under thirty-five have recognized the long-term advantagesof productssuch as whole life insurance. The first asset that younger consumers should seek toprotect -perhaps the most important asset - is themselves, and what they have today. Wholelife is a smartstep in that direction. Starting With Today The beauty of whole life insurance is that it not only offers the long-termbenefits of cash value andtax-deferred accumulation, but it also offers immediate coverage in the event of atragedy. For a marriedindividual, the need for life insurance is obvious; so much rides on an income thefamily is counting on:the mortgage payments, living expenses, child care costs - even the future plansfor a child'seducation. For young single individuals, the life insurance need is sometimes less obvious,but just as real. Acrucial step toward true independence lies in making sure that no one else will beforced to shoulderthe consequences of choices that we've made. Many people in their twenties have toborrow moneyfrom their families, or from financial institutions. Frequently, young singleswith student loans, carloans, or mortgages on a condo are only able to secure these funds by having aloved one co-sign theloan, as well. If something were to happen to the young single person, the personwho co-signed theloan would be fully responsible for the debt repayment. What if there were notenough liquid resourcesto pay off the debts and loans? Losing a loved one is difficult enough; combinedwith having to dealwith exorbitant financial debts and struggles, it quickly becomes a devastatingexperience. Whole life insurance protects against the financial consequences of these potentialtragedies, and italso gives the younger consumer a financial foundation to build on for the rest ofhis/her life. With cashvalue, tax deferred growth, and the accumulation potential of dividends2, whole lifeinsurance can easily evolve from today's protection plan to the beginning oftomorrow's retirement plan. What's more: the younger the insured, the more affordable insurance is. Sinceeveryone needs thiscoverage sooner or later, it'sa good idea to get it when it's more affordable - and when good health will usuallyassure coverage. Unfortunately, once health has declined, insurance is often no longer an option. Ironically, this could bewhen people need it the most. Whether anticipating the future or focusing on today, the under-35 consumer shouldalways keep this inmind: the ideal plan allows for today's protection as well as tomorrow'spossibilities. The financialchoices made today impact the rest of one's life. 1 Survey was conducted inSeptember of1994 byFrank Luntz forthe under-35 political advocacy group Third Millennium. 2 Dividends are based on the policy'sapplicabledividend scaleor interest crediting rate which is neither guaranteed nor an estimate of futureperformance.

Unfortunately, Social Securitywill provideonly a portion of thisincome. According to the Social Security Administration, the averagemonthly SocialSecurity check in1994 was just $674. Factor in that most Americans are living longerand it becomesclear that you willneed additional sources of income if you hope to live comfortably inretirement. A Simple and Effective Retirement Planning Tool One of the easiest ways to start building wealth and saving forretirement isthrough an IndividualRetirement Account (IRA). An IRA is a tax-deferred vehicle thatprovides you withthe opportunity toinvest in various instruments. These include: stocks, bonds,money-market funds,governmentsecurities, unit investment trusts, and mutual funds. Since the IRA is a tax-deferred account, all of your contributions andearningswill compound andaccumulate quicker than money placed in a similar taxable account. Overthe longhaul, this taxadvantage will significantly increase your retirement nest egg. Eligibility Requirements Anyone who receives compensation for working during the year (includingwages,salaries,commissions, and professional fees) can establish an IRA. The maximumamount youmay contributeper year is the lesser of $2,000 or 100% of your annualcompensation. If you have a non-working spouse, you may contribute an additional $250into theplan on your spouse'sbehalf. This would increase the maximum contribution for the year to$2,250. Thecontribution wouldhave to be made into two separate accounts and may be divided in anyfashion aslong as no morethan $2,000 is contributed to either IRA. The extra account is called aspousalIRA. IRA Deductibility Limits If both you and your spouse are employed, but are not considered activeparticipants in your employer'squalified retirement plans, your IRA contributions are fullydeductible. (Twoindividual IRAs must be setup.) If you and your spouse file a joint tax return, a maximumdeduction of $4,000would be allowed.This deduction will reduce your taxable income and your current incometax bill. If both you and your spouse participate in your employer's qualifiedretirementplans, your deduction foryour contribution may be reduced or eliminated depending on your annualadjustedgross income.Singles with adjusted gross incomes of $25,000 or less and marriedcouples withadjusted grossincomes of $40,000 or less can deduct their entire IRA contribution. Asyour annualincome increases,the amount you can deduct gradually decreases. Deductions are reducedby $200 forevery $1,000 ofincome over $40,000 ($25,000 for singles). The Power Of Tax Deferral Even if you cannot deduct your annual contribution, IRAs still offer apowerfuladvantage - tax-deferredgrowth. All of the earnings on amounts contributed to an IRA are nottaxed untilthey are withdrawn. Forexample, if you were to invest $2,000 annually, assuming an 8% returnand a 33%combined federal,state, and local income tax bracket, after 30 years, a tax-deferredaccount couldpotentially grow to$244,692. Under this same scenario, a taxable account would have grownto$148,971. That is$95,721, or 64%, more in the tax-deferred account than in the taxableaccount.1 Time Is Still Available An IRA should serve as the cornerstone for your retirement plan.Whether retirementis years away orjust around the corner, you owe it to yourself to prepare now for afuture that'sfree of financial worry.Implementing a disciplined approach to investing can put you on thepath towardyour retirementdreams. You have until April 15, 1996 to make the maximum 1995contribution of$2,000. And insteadof waiting another full year, you could invest $4,000 today (for 1996and 1997) andlet the power of taxdeferral start working toward your retirement dreams.

In 1849, the name was changed to New York Life InsuranceCompany. From the outset, Freeman knew the kind of individual who would be successful working with theCompany, and he conducted an aggressive recruiting campaign to find "capable, energeticagents" to work in all the settled territories. As pioneers moved west, New York Life agentswere there to greet them. Famous men like Lew Wallace, author of Ben Hur, and SchuylerColfax, who became Ulysses S. Grant's Vice President, represented the Company. At that time,selling and servicing insurance had not yet become a career in itself. Agents were localdoctors, lawyers, bankers, etc., who offered policies as an added service. In the twentieth century, despite war, the Great Depression, stock market upheavals andeconomic instability both at home and around the world, New York Life remained solid bystaying true to its guiding principles of prudent expansion, conservative growth,full-service and a strong Field Force. The Company's conservative approach hasenabled it to grow steadily and provide outstanding service. New York Life has neverfaltered on its obligations and has put the financial well-being of its policyholders aboveevery other concern. The Company's dedication to service has given our customers an unprecedented levelof security. As a result, our agents have earned a level of respect from our customers andthe insurance industry that is second to none.

The area performed well across all assetclasses, making significant contribution to New York Life's financial strength. Declining interest ratesand moderate economic growth led to a soaring stock market and a benign environment for bondinvestors. The strength of the stock market helped us realize substantial capital gains in our private equityportfolio. Our credit skills and knowledge of capital markets also enabled us to take advantage of newinvestment vehicles, including bank loans, equity-linked notes, and commercial mortgage-backedsecurities. Our London office, opened in late 1994, completed its first year by originating almost $250million of attractive fixed-income investments. In addition, our Private Finance Team launched asuccessful third-party money management and advisory business for institutional clients, includingpension plans and other insurance companies.

While a family-owned businesscan provide financial benefits - capital growth, salary, fringebenefits etc. - the realbenefits are oftenmore personal. A family-owned firm can provide a better workingenvironment than a largeimpersonalcompany. Family members can take pride in seeing the family nameon products and on the signoutside the door. A well run family firm not only stressespersonal service and customerloyalty, butalso provides benefits to the local community. Some business owners build a business with an eye to selling itto the highest bidder. Manyentrepreneurs, however, hope that the business they have builtwill remain within the family. Whenmembers of the founding generation retire, with proper businesscontinuation plans in place,they cantake pleasure in knowing that the firm is in good hands. Suchhappy endings, however, cannotbetaken for granted. According to a study by the Journal ofAccountancy, fewer than fiftypercent of familybusinesses survive past the second generation. Challenges to Retaining the Business in theFamily No Qualified or Interested Family Member:Some firms do have anemployeewho could run the business, but that person is not a familymember. Perhaps the children aretooyoung, have other interests, or lack the founder's drive, feelfor the market, or technicalskills. Limited Access to Capital: A child may nothave the same relationshipwiththe bankers, suppliers, bonding company, and customers as theprior generation. Death, Disability, or Retirement: Seniormanagement may leave, whetherthrough death, disability, or retirement, before the nextgeneration is prepared to assumecontrol. Disgruntled Second-Tier Management: Asenior employee who has givenhis or her life to a company may find it difficult to work for a"boss" young enough to behis or her child. First-rate salaried managers often leave to become the nextgeneration's most potentcompetitors. Current Income versus Growth of Firm: Theretired generation may beconcerned about income to meet living expenses. The children maywant to retain profits togrow thebusiness. That could spell trouble. Estate Taxes: A closely held corporation isan illiquid asset. Taxesareassessed based on "fair market value" at a date of death. Fairmarket value is what a"Willing sellerwould accept from a willing buyer." Often, however, there are nowilling buyers. Otherassets, or eventhe firm itself, may have to be liquidated to cover the estatetaxes due. Family Differences: The eldest daughter hasan aptitude for business,buther husband has transferred to another city. The son wants torun the business, and lives intown, but has much to learn. How are parents to do what is right for eachchild, when they have onlyone largeilliquid asset to divide? Obviously, business continuity planning is not simple. Some ofthe problems are reducibletomoney. Money can provide for estate taxes,purchase a retiring owner'sinterest, orprovide an equivalent asset for the children who will not enterthe business. Along with thefinancialconsiderations, appropriate legal agreements may need to bedrafted, and coordinated with thewill andestate plan. It is up to the business owner to set the planning wheels inmotion. Here's how to begin: Planning Steps Clarify Goals: What would you, as anowner, prefer? To work in thebusiness for as long as possible? To retire at a certain age? To provide for your childrenthe lifestyleand status you have enjoyed? To reward key employees who havehelped you build the business? Consider the Children: Who wants tocontinue the firm? What are thefeelings of the others? Who, if anyone, has the neededabilities? What training is takingplace now? Appoint a Project Manager: No person islikely to have all the skillsneeded to make your vision of the future a reality. Yourattorney, CPA, banker, andinsurance advisorare all essential members of your strategic planning team. Youmay want to give one theoverallresponsibility of researching the possible strategies andpresenting recommendations for yourapproval. As the owner of a family business, you made the company what itis today. Some simpleplanningcan help ensure that your business continues to thrive for manyyears.

The answer to thatquestion maynot be assimple as it seems. Retirement does not necessarily mean the end to your need forlifeinsurance. However, as with any other major life change, you should re-evaluate your lifeinsurancecoverage to besure it is adequate. If, as you near retirement, you still have dependents who would suffer financialhardship ifyou die, youshould consider having life insurance. On the other hand, if you no longer havedependents, you mayfind you have less of a need for life insurance. So, what are your options with your life insurance policy? One place to start isto talk withyour agent. He or she can help you determine what is appropriate for you in your situation. Here are some ideas that you might want to discuss with your agent if you have awhole lifepolicy: Keep the policy in force indefinitely by converting it to a paid-up policy. You pay nomorepremiums, but the amount of insurance is reduced. The accumulated cash valueremainsintact, andyou retain the option of borrowing against it. Use the policy's accumulated cash value to purchase an annuity, which canprovide aguaranteedlifetime income. Or, you might use the cash value for another investment. However,beaware thatincome taxes likely will be due. Taxes will be based on the sum of the cash valueplusdividends youreceive that exceed the premiums you have paid while the policy was in force(dividends arebased onthe policy's applicable dividend scale or interest crediting rate which is neitherguaranteednor anestimate of future performance). If you keep the policy in force as paid-up insurance until death, no income taxeswill bepayable. Regardless of the type of life insurance policy you have, it is a good idea toreview yourcoverage andoptions with your agent, as you approach retirement age to be sure that your policywill meetyourneeds.

Control Your Taxes Here's another advantage of tax deferral: since you aren't taxed on annuityproceeds untilyou withdrawthem, you can plan your withdrawals so you're not hit too hard by Uncle Sam.

And ifyou'renearingretirement or have already retired, a more conservative allocation may suit yourgoalsperfectly. LifeStagesSM allows you to change yourinvestmentstrategyas your needs change. Set a Course Some people track their investment accounts daily - others set a course and letitrunitself. LifeStagesSM gives you those options. Dollar Cost Averaging Option "Making money is easy," a wit said. "You simply buy low and sell high." Buthowcan youpredict whenprices will be "low" or "high?" You may not need to if you dollar cost average. With dollarcostaveraging, you set up a program of scheduled investments - given dollar amountsinvested atgivenpoints in time - and stick to it, regardless of the changes in the markets. Thisconsistent,disciplinedapproach allows you to take advantage of market volatility by buying moreinvestment unitswhen pricesare low and fewer when prices are high. Although dollar cost averaging does notensure aprofit norprotect against a loss in a declining market, over time a sustained dollar costaveragingstrategy canreduce your timing risk and optimize your return. Investors should considertheirfinancialability to continue purchases through periods of low and high price levels. Automatic Asset Reallocation Option Let's say you want to maintain a particular allocation of your assets in investmentdivisions, forexample, 40% in Bond, 40% in Capital Appreciation and 20% in Cash Management. Sinceportfoliovalues change at different rates, you may need to move money between investmentdivisions tokeepyour desired ratio. It's a popular investment strategy, but it requires a lotofmaintenance. Fortunately, LifeStagesSM offers anAutomaticAssetReallocation feature that allows you to specify when - quarterly,semi-annually,or annually- NYLIACwill review your accounts and automatically make any necessary transfers tobringyourdistributionback into the balance you selected. Payout at Retirement The goal of any annuity - including LifeStagesSM- is toprovide retirement income. And with LifeStagesSM, you canelect to receive an income that's guaranteed to last as long as you live. AndalthoughLifeStagesSM is designed as a longer-terminvestment, thereare otherways to access your money without incurring surrender charges.2 Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may besubject to a10% IRS tax penalty. Windows of Opportunity LifeStages' 10% Window allows immediate accessto10% of your policy's cash value each year (less any surrender-charge-freewithdrawals you'vemadeduring the year) without triggering a surrender charge. In addition, LifeStagesSM offers a Gain Windowfor policieswith $100,000 or more in accumulated premium payments. Without incurringsurrendercharges,youcan withdraw the greater of all of the gain in your policy or the 10% Windowamount. Loan Option for TSAs If you're investing through a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA) program only,LifeStages offers liquidity through a TSA loan provision. Loans mayequal thelesser of 50% of the value of your policy or $50,000. Guaranteed Refund of Initial Premium on Fixed Account If you surrender your policy during the first three years, you're guaranteed toreceive theportion of theinitial premium you allocated to, and that remained in, the Fixed Account. Thisrefund doesnot apply ifany partial withdrawals are taken from the policy, such as the 10% Window or the Gain Window. Guaranteed Advantages For Your Heirs To help you provide for your heirs, LifeStagesSMoffers adeath benefit equal to the greater of the cash value or the premiums paid lesswithdrawals. In otherwords, your heirs will receive at least the amount of money you've invested -evenif youraccounts havedeclined in value.3 There's even a three-year step-up4 feature that offers even more protection. Everythreeyears,yourdeath benefit "locks in" so your beneficiary is guaranteed the greater of thecurrent cashvalue orpremiums paid less withdrawals or the cash value at each third-year anniversary(plus anypremiumspaid less any withdrawals and surrender charges since the last third-yearanniversary). Thisenablesyou to lock in new, higher levels of guarantees in a growing market. Thisstep-upfeaturecontinues untilthe owner or annuitant reaches insurance age 85. 1 TransfersfromtheFixed Account to Investment Divisions are subject to some restrictions. See theprospectusfor details. Subject to contract limitations, you are permitted twelve free transfers peryear. NYLIACreserves theright to charge up to $30 for each transfer exceeding twelve per year. Thisoffermay bemodified orwithdrawn at any time. 2LifeStagesSM surrender charges are based onthedate ofeach premium payment as follows: 7% in years one through three; 6% in yearfour;5% in yearfive and4% in year six. For residents of Oregon - after ten years, surrender chargeswillnever bemore than 1%of the policy cash value. 3 Deathbenefitpayments are dependent upon the claims-paying ability of NYLIAC. 4 ForresidentsofTexas, the step-up death benefit is "stepped up" every six years.

Studies show that 60% of thepeople who reach age 65 will need long-term care services1 duringtheir lifetime, with 40% requiring a stay in a nursing home2. As people live longer, those odds will increase. Changing Times Bring New Concerns Most of us know at least one person who has stayed in a nursinghome or needed professional home health care. The financial consequencesof long-term health care can have a significant impact on a family'ssavings and lifestyle. According to the Health Care FinancingAdministration (Fall 1992), over 56% of long-term home healthcare expenses are paid, out-of-pocket, by the patients and theirfamilies. Those accumulated expenses can use up a major partof your savings. For people who enter a nursing home, the financialoutcome can be worse: according to the Congressional Subcommitteeon Aging, 70 to 80% of nursing home residents deplete theirassets within twelve months. To understand this increasing need to plan for the financial impactof long-term care services, it's necessary to understand basicchanges taking place in American society. According to the U.S.Census, there were 32 million people age 65 and older in 1990-butby the year 2030, this figure could double to 64.6 million. Moreover,people are living longer today than ever before. By the year2040, there may be more people over age 85 than there are over65 today. Not only are we getting older but, over the next 50years, working age population may increase only 2 to 18%, whilethe elderly population is expected to increase anywhere from 139to 169%. For years, it was tradition for adult children to take care oftheir parents during the "golden years". But changingtimes have brought an increase in dual-career families, job insecurity,family mobility, and divorce. Today, many adult children arenot able to stay home and look after their own children, let alonean aging parent. In addition, corporate downsizing has eliminatedthousands of mid-management jobs throughout the country; consequently,many adult children are not in a position to financially helptheir parents as they had planned. Add to this the increasinguncertainty of health care benefits for senior citizens, and agiant question mark looms on the horizon. Who Will Pay For Long-Term Care? Not Uncle Sam. Who will support this population and help pay its inevitable medicalbills? The writing is on the wall. According to Alice M. Rivlinand Joshua M. Weiner, authors of Caring for the Disabled Elderly(published by the Brookings Institution), the combination of agingBaby Boomers and an increase in the longevity of the aged willdramatically heighten the need for more public and private spending. But when it comes time to pay the bill, no federal programs-SocialSecurity, Medicare, or Medicaid will pay for all long-term careexpenses. How "Secure" Is Social Security? Social Security is not a savings account that builds up over time. It is a "pay as you go" system, paid for through payrolltaxes on present employees to support former workers. Today,according to the Social Security Administration, each retiredSocial Security beneficiary is supported by the payroll taxesof 3.3 workers. By 2020, it's estimated that each Social Securitybeneficiary will be supported by the payroll taxes of 1.9 workers. According to the Social Security system, payroll taxes wouldhave to increase by almost 60% for the system to remain solventand provide the same level of benefits in the future. Don't Bank On Medicare Or Medicaid Although Medicare provides health coverage for senior citizens,it is limited in the area of long-term care coverage. In 1992,Medicare paid a total of 4.3% of all nursing home care expensesin the country, and 9.5% of long-term home health care expenses3,primarily for nursing home and home health care services immediatelyfollowing a hospital stay. Medicare generally will not coverthe cost of nursing home or home health care services due to achronic condition. Medicaid, on the other hand, will cover thecost of long-term care, but there's one catch: to qualify, youmust become indigent ("spend down" your assets). Remember:once you have depleted your assets, you have also lost controlover where and when you receive care. Also, because of stateand federal budget cutbacks, the facilities close to your familyand friends might not have openings for Medicaid patients at thetime you need care. What are the options? If Medicare won't pay, and spending down your assets to qualifyfor Medicaid is not attractive, the cost of any required long-term care services may be paid for out of current income and savings,as by long-term care insurance. And, long-term care can be veryexpensive. In 1994, nursing home care averaged $36,000 per yearnationally4, but costs substantially more in some states. Home care usually is less expensive, but full-time home carecan cost as much as a nursing home stay. What Does Long-Term Care Insurance Cover? Long-term care insurance usually pays for skilled, intermediate,or custodial care in a nursing home. It can also cover professional"at-home" health care. This type of insurance can helppay for a variety of home and community-based care services, including:physical, speech, and occupational therapists; home health aidesand visiting nurses; adult day care, and hospice care. (Note:Generally, skilled care refers to round-the-clock treatmentby a registered nurse under a doctor's supervision. Intermediatecare refers to occasional nursing and rehabilitative careunder the supervision of skilled medical personnel. Custodialcare primarily meets personal care needs in activities ofdaily living such as help in eating or bathing.) Typically, long-termcare insurance policies pay up to a specific dollar amount day(which may be less than the total cost of the services provided). Few, if any, policies provide full coverage for all expenses. More Information is Available HIAA publishes a booklet, "The Consumer's Guide To Long-TermCare Insurance," which provides basic information on long-termcare and long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance maynot be for everybody, so it is important to research the subjectcarefully. Your agent can help you make an educated decision. 1Long-Term Care Group,October 1990 2"Lifetime UseOf Nursing Home Care."

But, wherever they go and whatever they dream, New York Life will be there -- just as it has been for the last seven generations. When we began in 1845, we were a small company located in New York City doing business intheeastern part of the United States. Today, 150 years later, we are a $74 billion financial servicesorganization with interests that span the globe. We have locations in thousands of towns and citiesacross the country and throughout the world. As a world leader in the financial services field, we touch the lives of millions of Americans -- andothers around the world -- through diversified investments and a wide range of services. Our clients include such large organizations as the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Minor League Baseball Insurance Trustfor players and umpires, as well as you, your family, your neighbors, and friends. Our greatest accomplishments during our sesquicentennial were a natural outgrowth of 150 yearsofdedicated, continuous service to our customers. We set ambitious financial goals -- and exceededthem, created new products to meet your changing needs, and enhanced our leadership position asa company that protects policyowners' interests. Through our financial products, managed health care, and invested assets, we help shape thefuturefor millions of men and women. Our size and diversity are part of what keeps us financially strong. Proof of this statement can be found in our 1995 financial results. Our sales -- generally annualizedinsurance premiums and new money from investment products -- increased 13 percent from 1994; ourconsolidated assets reached $74.3 billion; our net gain was $373 million; our surplus and investmentreserves totaled $5.2 billion; and the ratio of surplus to assets, a key measure of strength, was a solid6.95 percent -- one of the highest among major life insurers. Remaining strong enables us to help you reach your financial goals. It's a strategy we intend to keep for the next 150 years. And those years promise to be even more dynamic -- and successful -- than the last. Adding new products also helps us to meet your goals. While industry growth remained sluggish, the introductionof new products and plans helped our individual insurance and annuity sales climb 24 percent from 1994. We'repleased at this tremendous vote of consumer confidence in our agents, brokerage producers, products, and quality of service. One new product, our LifeStagesSM variable annuity, contributed to a record-breakingyear for the Individual Annuity line of business -- resulting in nearly $1.4 billion in sales. Ourrevitalized Agency Force alone sold 34 percent more annuity business in 1995 than the year before. And, ourFive-Year Term policy contributed significantly to our more than $70 million in new term premium -- one of ourbest years ever for this traditional product. Another important move was the reorganization of our managed care operations to form NYLCareHealth Plans, Inc. We merged our Group insurance operations with one of our most profitable andfastest-growing subsidiaries, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, an HMO and managed care organization. This enhanced the quality of our operations and service, and simplified the way theorganizations and individuals can purchase and manage their health care benefits. NYLCare, whichestimates its 1996 revenues will reach $2.5 billion, now offers a full spectrum of health careproducts and services, including group insurance, preferred provider organizations, and HMOproducts. In 1995, we also became a major direct marketer of life insurance as the provider for the AARP LifeInsurance Program. Chosen by the American Association of Retired Persons after a rigorous selectionprocess, we began offering the program to AARP members in the fall of 1994, and the response wasoverwhelming. In 1995, sales reached $53 million, exceeding our initial estimates by a widemargin. Our MainStayÂ® Funds set records for sales and surpassed the $6 billion asset mark in 1995. We cancredit this success to outstanding equity performance, as well as the efforts of both of our distributionchannels -- the New York Life Agency Force and Wall Street brokerage firms. On the pension side, ourtraditional Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) product continued to provide retirement security forour clients as we maintained our market leadership position. One of our strongest assets is integrity. It's been a hallmark of our Company for 150 years. Aprime example of our belief in the integrity of our people, our products, and our promises was the settlement in 1995 of a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of certain policyowners. It involved sales practiceissues and in particular, policyowners' understanding of dividends and interest crediting rates. The Company's financial strength and our confidence in our agents allowed us to work out an innovative settlement,approved by the Supreme Court of New York State in January 1996. It was high in benefits and aid to policyowners in the class, while doing nothing to disadvantage our other policyowners. In fact, over 99 percent of thepolicyowners in the class have elected to accept the settlement, attesting to its fairness. Our great financial strength, coupled with our leadership position on issues of integrity which affect our policyowners, is reflected on many levels. A Fortune 100 company overall, New York Life now ranks fourth in the insurance industry on the basis of assets and revenues, and in life insurance sales. And, onceagain, New York Life and its subsidiary, New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), have receivedhigh marks from the major ratings agencies. For claims-paying ability, both Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelpsassign us AAA, their highest ratings. For financial strength, A.M. Best gives us an A++, its second highest classification, and Moody's Investors Service gives us Aa1, its second highest of 19 possible ratings. Our consistently high ratings are further proof that we keep the needs of our policyowners at the forefront of every decision we make. Our financial strength will enable us to pay out $1.2 billion in dividendsin 1996, the highest amount in New York Life's history. 1995 was also a year of change for our Board. President George Bundschuh took a long-planned early retirement on October 1, 1995. George's New York Life career spanned 36 years, and he was a valued member of both our Board and our Company. He will be missed for his intellect and vision. As chairman, I will especially miss George. We worked closely on many issues and his advice was always invaluable. It was imperative that his replacement also be an innovative leader who believes in the New York Life commitment to provide quality sevice and sound financial management. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to have Sy Sternberg as my co-signer on this letter, having succeeded George as president. Sy joined New York Life in 1989 as head of Group operations. With his steady leadership and innovative thinking, this area became a major player in the health care arena, culminating in the creation of NYLCare. Now, as president and chief operating officer, Sy has all of the business operations of the Company reporting to him. He is the vice chairman of twoBoard committees: Executive & Insurance and Investment. We also welcomed three new Board members and were heartened by the recent return of a former Director. Our new membersare Robert Baylis, former vice chairman of CS First Boston, Inc., who is a member of the Investment Committee; Kent Foster, the president of GTE Corporation, who is a member of the Executive & Insurance Committee; and Leslie McCraw, the chairman and chief executive officer of Fluor Corporation, who also serves on the Investment Committee.Conrad Harper, a partner at the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, left the Board three years ago to serve asa legal adviser to the Department of State and as a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague. Herejoined the Board in 1996. Mr. Harper is a member of the Executive & Insurance Committee. We should benefit greatly from the insight and years of experience each man brings to the Company. We want to take the opportunity of this letter to reaffirm the Company's traditional promises to you: to remain strong; to take every opportunity for prudent, managed growth; and above all, to be here for you when you need us. Whenyou dream a world -- for yourself or your children -- you may not hear our name or see our buildings, but we are there. We always will be. NYLCare Click here to go to the NYLCare web site.

The Company's first formal contributions budget was established in 1951. Since then, theCompany and, subsequently, the New York Life Foundation -- which was created in 1979 and isnow the Company's main vehicle for charitable giving -- have contributed more than $63 millionto a variety of national and local organizations across the country. Today, the New YorkLife Foundation supports a wide range of health and human service agencies, educationalinstitutions, arts and cultural groups, as well as civic and community organizations. Periodically, the Foundation selects areas of special focus within one or more of thesecategories. Its current priority areas are AIDS and literacy. The Foundation makes annual grants to more than 150 United Ways across the country in citieswhere New York Life offices are located. In 1995, recipients of other major grants includedthe National AIDS Fund, Literacy Volunteers of America, the Life and Health Insurance MedicalResearch Fund, Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, and Literacy Volunteers of New YorkCity. New York Life doesn't view its contributions program as one that "gives away" money. Grantsare made as investments in organizations whose work enhances the quality of life of thepeople they serve, thus ensuring a better future for society as a whole. Frequently, the Foundation is able to combine its financial support with the Company'sgreatest asset -- the talent and expertise of its people. For example, the Foundation forIndependent Higher Education (FIHE), which represents 600 independent colleges across thecountry through its 38 state and regional associations, has received more than $5.2million in grants. In many instances, this support has been coupled with the involvement ofCompany officers, managing partners, and agents in both the national and local FIHEorganizations. Whether it's through the Foundation's matching gift program for colleges and universities, orits Local Volunteer Action Program, which makes grants to community groups where New YorkLife employees and agents volunteer their time, the New York Life family consistentlydemonstrates its commitment to community participation.

Thatextra moneycan help increase the cash value of your policy, so when a personal or business opportunitypresentsitself, you'll have access to those funds.3Or if you need to temporarily cut back on your payments, youmay be able to pay less premium than usual and let the policy's accumulated cash value coverthe rest. Flexible payments let you make the choices. Flexible Investment Features With Variable Universal Life, you control how your money works for you. You can choose amongseveralfundingoptions, including stock, bond, balanced, or money-market accounts. There's also a FixedAccount witha minimum guaranteed rate of 4%.

You can also secure any gains you may make bytransferring them into the Cash Management portfolio or, on a limited basis, the FixedAccount.5 Those earnings can thenremain there tax-deferred. Whatever options you select, you control the investment choice. Customized Policy Design You can customize Variable Universal Life to fit your lifestyle.

NYLIC and such subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to collectively as "the Company". Separate unconsolidated financial statements are shown for NYLIC and NYLIAC. All significant intercompany transactions, primarily the net equity of the insurance subsidiaries, have been eliminated in consolidation. Other subsidiaries are recorded at their underlying net equity, with the exception of NYLIC's investment in Express Scripts, Inc., a 69% owned subsidiary, which is carried at market value as allowed under New York State law. NYLIC is a diversified financial services company which offers a wide range of insurance and investment products and services, including life and health insurance, pension products, mutual funds (through its broker-dealer subsidiary), and other investments, to a large cross section of the total insurance market. NYLIAC offers a wide variety of interest sensitive insurance and annuity products. Effective January 1, 1996, NYLIC merged its Health Maintenance Organization subsidiary, Sanus Corp. Health Systems, and its Group life and health indemnity operations (which will be transferred to NYLHIC via a reinsurance agreement) into an integrated health care subsidiary, NYLCare Health Plans, Inc. (NYLCare), whereby NYLHIC will be a downstream subsidiary of NYLCare. NYLAZ expects to offer a Corporate Owned Life Insurance/Variable Universal Life product for sale in 1996. Note B: The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York and Delaware State Insurance Departments ("statutory accounting practices"). Presently, these statutory accounting practices are considered generally accepted accounting principles for mutual life insurance companies and their wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued an Interpretation, effective for 1996 financial statements, which establishes a different definition of generally accepted accounting principles. If the Company chooses to adopt the accounting changes required under this new definition, the effect of the changes would be reported retroactively through restatement of all previously issued financial statements presented for comparative purposes. The cumulative effect of adopting these changes would be included in the earliest year restated. Financial statements prepared in conformity with statutory accounting practices would continue to be required by insurance regulatory authorities. Under statutory accounting practices: (1) bonds and mortgage loans on real estate are stated principally at cost after amortization of premium and discount, preferred stocks are stated generally at cost, and common stocks are stated at market value; (2) the value of invested assets has been adjusted for impairments that are other than temporary; (3) an asset valuation reserve is reported as a liability; (4) an interest maintenance reserve is reported as a liability to capture interest-income over the estimated remaining lives of the investments sold; (5) premiums are taken into income over the premium-paying period of the policies; guaranteed investment contract funds are recorded as income when received; (6) matured guaranteed investment contracts are included in benefit payments; (7) commissions and other costs in connection with acquiring new business are charged to current operations as incurred; (8) pension costs are based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions"; (9) unfunded postretirement benefit costs other than pensions are based on National Association of Insurance Commissioners requirements, which include establishing a liability for retired and fully eligible active employees; (10) policy reserves are based on mortality tables and interest assumptions which are consistent with statutory requirements and are designed to be sufficient to provide for contractual benefits; (11) dividends to policyowners consist principally of dividends expected to be paid during the subsequent year; (12) provision is made for federal income taxes estimated to be payable; (13) certain assets designated as "non-admitted assets" are not included in the Statement of Financial Position; (14) in 1995, the Company changed its method of accounting for the equity base tax and as a result, federal income taxes were reduced by $46 million, $12 million and $58 million for NYLIC, NYLIAC and the Company, respectively. Note C: Bond investments in the Statement of Financial Position consist of the following (in millions): Chart for Note C: December 31, 1995 December 31, 1994 NYLIC NYLIAC Consolidated NYLIC NYLIAC Consolidated U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Corporations and Agencies $5,537 $1,840 $7,403 $4,990 $1,679 $6,682 U.S. Agencies, State and Municipal 9,980 3,563 13,544 9,024 2,965 11,992 Foreign Governments 1,353 324 1,676 1,400 298 1,699 Corporate 18,857 5,846 24,748 17,062 5,670 22,740 Other 1,867 689 2,556 1,658 529 2,187 Total $37,594 $12,262 $49,927 $34,134 $11,141 $45,300 Note D: In 1995, NYLIC and NYLIAC settled a class action suit related to the sale of whole life and universal life policies from 1982 through 1994. In connection with this and other litigation, after-tax provisions of $30 million and $45 million have been recorded in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Also in 1995, NYLIC's investment in NYLIFE Inc. was reduced by $90 million after tax to reflect the potential discontinuance of NYLIFE Inc.'s proprietary partnership operations and certain claims made in connection therewith. Note E: In December 1993, NYLIC issued Surplus Notes with a principal balance of $450,000,000: $150,000,000, 6.40% Surplus Note, due 2003 and $300,000,000, 7.50% Surplus Note, due 2023.

Living the "American Dream" has been a goal for generations. Thelovingfamily,thebeautiful home ... this is the stuff dreams are made of. But protecting yourdreamsandcaring for lovedones goes back a lot further than the "American Dream" - those intentionsareprobably asoldasmankind itself. Providing for your family's financial well-being meansputtingtogether acomprehensiveprogram that will take care of today's needs, as well as plan for tomorrow.Thiscustomizedplan mightinclude a mix of bank accounts, health insurance, life insurance, annuities,mutualfunds,and an IRA.When considering the need for life insurance, it's wise to take a close lookat theadvantages ofpermanent life insurance. This type of policy not only offers financialprotectiontosurvivors but can alsobenefit a family during the insured's lifetime. Why Permanent Life Insurance is Unique Whole life is the traditional form of permanent life insurance. It is justthat -permanent -you'reinsured for your entire life, provided, of course, that you continue to paypremiums. Yourcoverage cannever be canceled, and the premiums are fixed - they can never be increased.It isalso afeature-rich,customizable plan that can be tailored to suit you and your family's needs. How Permanent Life Insurance Helps Beneficiaries To many, the primary reason for having life insurance is to protect theirfamily'sfinancialfuture. Shouldthe insured die, life insurance helps pay off mortgages, fund collegeeducations,take careof finalexpenses, offset the loss of the insured's income and allows a family tocontinueitsstandard of living.In most cases, insurance proceeds pass to beneficiaries free of probatecosts,legal fees,localinheritance tax, and federal income tax. To the extent permitted by statelaw,insurancebenefits areprotected from claims of the insured's creditors. Benefits are generallypaidpromptly tobeneficiariesthrough a convenient, interest earning, no-fee checking account. Or if youprefer,you candesignate apayment method in advance, choosing from a variety of settlement optionsthat offerperiodicpaymentsuntil the proceeds are paid in full. Not only does permanent life insuranceoffer aguaranteed paymentto beneficiaries at the death of the insured, but it also provides importantbenefits duringyour lifetime. Benefits of Permanent Life Insurance During YourLifetime Unlike term life insurance, permanent life insurance is a value builder.Bothguaranteedvalues andnon-guaranteed values build up, tax deferred, over the years, and you canput themto workfor you in anumber of ways. Accumulation of cash values - A permanent life insurancepolicybuildsguaranteed cash value as youpay your premiums when due. These values are further enhanced since taxes onthemoney'sgrowthare deferred. This cash value can be accessed through a valuable loanprovision. Tapping into your cash values - You can borrow from yourpolicy'saccumulatedcash value by taking aloan at competitive interest rates. You can use these funds any way you wish- makea downpaymenton a home, finance a new car, or even start a business (the J.C. Penney andDisneyempireswerestarted with loans from life insurance policies). The loan privilege is avaluablefeature ofpermanent lifeinsurance, but keep in mind that borrowing against your policy's valuereduces yourinsuranceprotection. In addition, any time you take money out of an insurance policy,youmay besubject to stateand federal taxes. It may be advisable to borrow only with the intention ofrepaying yourloan in full.Insurance companies offer several convenient repayment methods to restoreyourpolicy'sfullvalue. Eligible for dividends - As "participating" insurance, apermanentpolicy iseligible for dividends if andwhen the company declares them. Each year, insurers determine how muchincomeneedsto beretained to build surplus. The remaining balance, if any, is returned topolicyowners in theform ofdividends. As they are considered returned premiums, dividends are nottaxable.Youcanuseyourdividends in a number of ways. Options include: leaving them on deposit withthe insurancecompanyto earn interest; using them to purchase additional insurance coverage;applyingthem topayall or partof your premium; or taking them as cash. Unlike cash value, dividends arenotguaranteed. The Flexibility of Permanent Life Insurance As needs change, a permanent policy can be modified to reflect thosechanges.Mostinsurancecompanies make a wide range of optional benefits and riders available thatyou mayadd toyour policyto enhance your existing coverage, extend coverage to family members, andhelpoutindifficult times.Additional underwriting may be required to add benefits or riders. Enhancing your coverage - Along with the additionalcoverageavailablethroughdividend options, youcan increase your protection by adding a low-cost term insurance rider toyourpolicy. Anaccidentaldeath benefit provision can also be added, which doubles the insuranceproceeds iftheinsured diesas a result of an accident. With an OPP (Option to Purchase Paid-upadditions)rider, youmayadd,within limits, extra money to your policy to provide additional deathbenefits andincreasecash value ona tax-deferred basis. Extending coverage to family members - You may add aspouseand children'sinsurance rider toprotect those loved ones with term insurance. With a children's insurancerider,they will becoveredwith term insurance, and be guaranteed the right to purchase permanent lifeinsurance, inspecifiedamounts at specified times, as they grow up. Help in difficult times - With a waiver of premium rider,premiumsare paidbythe company during aperiod of disability, as defined in the rider. Cash value, dividends, anddeathbenefit growas if you werestill paying premiums. An automatic premium loan feature prevents yourpolicy fromlapsingshould youmiss a premium payment. If cash value is sufficient, it uses those values topaythe premium.New YorkLife now offers a living benefits rider, which pays a benefit should theinsuredbecometerminally ill.New York Life also pioneered the unemployment rider1. This provision waives one annual premiumshould the policyowner become unemployed for a predetermined period of time.

Culprits such as inflation and illness can wipe out a nest egg and undermine thefinancialindependence of even the best-prepared retiree. Inflation and Illness Can Turn a Nest Egg into a Goose Egg Inflation can seriously erode money's purchasing power over time. Even with a lowinflationrate of 4%,retirees at age 60 with an income of $2,500/month will have the purchasing power of$1,388/month bythe time they're 75 years old. In other words, the standard of living will bevirtuallyhalved in just 15years. Many retirees today find themselves searching for part-time jobs, in orderto keep upwith therising cost of living. But no one can work forever. And, in mere months, majorillness canwipe out anest egg that took years to build. According to the Abstract of the United States, 45% of an individual's lifetimemedicalexpenses areincurred during a final illness. That's only half the story. Research figurespublished bythe NewEngland Journal Of Medicine indicate that 43% of those who turned age 65 in 1990will enter anursinghome at some time during their lifetime. As people get older, the probabilityincreases. With nursinghome costs averaging more than $30,000 a year, it's not uncommon for retirees to bereducedtopoverty. When retirees' savings are depleted, it adversely affects the next generation, too- usuallyat the worstpossible time. Frequently, adult children of senior citizens are working to providefor theirownhouseholds and futures. Too often, they become saddled with the cost of supportingtheirparentswhile still trying to meet their own household expenses. It's a tough balancingact. Plan in Advance As an adult son or daughter, you must get involved with your parents' financialaffairs, andthe soonerthe better. Start with a meeting of the generations to discuss everyone's plans,wishes, andconcerns. Here are some topics to tackle, and questions to ask: Will your parents' retirement funds be adequate? Inflation and longer lifeexpectancies maymake retirement costlier than they've anticipated. What supplemental funds areavailable? Who will manage your parents' finances if they cannot? Discuss long-termfinancialplans, thelocation of records, and the possibility of establishing a contingent power ofattorney tostep in and helpduring an emergency. What are your parents' estate plans? When and how will they distributetheir property,especiallyif they become incapacitated? Are there any charitable endeavors or causes theywish tocontribute to? Do they have updated wills and an executor who knows their wishes? Are your parents' risk management programs adequate? Without adequatehealth coverage,asingle illness could wipe out an otherwise ideal retirement plan. (Some childrencost-sharetheirparents' premiums for Medicare Supplemental or Long Term Care insurance. They seeit as awiseinvestment in their parents' future.) What about life insurance? Do your parents have special medical requests, such as living wills,trusts, lifetimegifts, etc.? Where would they want to live, if incapacitated? (You may wish to discuss nursinghome and homehealth careoptions.) Problem Generally, parents and children feel uncomfortable discussing these matters. It'simportantto do thisin a way that puts both generations at ease. One solution is to bring in theservices of aprofessional -such as an insurance agent - who knows about retirement and estate conservationissues andwhocan serve as an objective and knowledgeable source of information for thatdiscussion.

However, through careful planning for your financial future, you can help manage risk. Risk is something you encounter everyday. Even crossing a busy street involves somerisk.Withinvestments, balancing risk and return can be a tricky operation. All investorswant tomaximize theirreturn, while minimizing risk. Let's face it, putting your hard earned dollars onthe linecan be downrightfrightening. Some investments are certainly more "risky" than others, but no investment is riskfree.Trying to avoidrisk by not investing at all can be the riskiest move of all. That would be likestanding atthe curb, neversetting foot into the street. You'll never be able to get to your destination ifyou don'taccept some risk. Ininvesting, just like crossing that street, you carefully consider the situation,accept acomfortable level ofrisk, and proceed to where you're going. Risk can never be eliminated, but it canbe managed.Let'stake a look at the different types of risk, how different asset categories perform,and theways andmeans to help manage risk. Types of Risk When most people think of "risk" they translate it as loss of principal. However,there aremany kinds ofrisk. Let's take a look at some of them: Capital Risk - Losing your invested monies. Inflationary Risk - Investment's rate of return doesn't keeppace withinflation rate. Interest Rate Risk - A drop in an investment's interest rate. Market Risk - Selling an investment at an unfavorable price. Liquidity Risk - Limitations on the availability of funds fora specificperiodof time. Legislative Risk - Changes in tax laws may make certaininvestments less advantageous. Default Risk - The failure of the institution where aninvestment ismade. How Do Different Assets Perform? It may seem that there are countless types of investment products to choose frombut,basically, thereare three types of core investments: cash (or cash equivalents), bonds, and stocks. Cash - Investments such as bank savings and checking accounts,Certificatesof Deposit (CDs), andTreasury Bills. The prices generally don't fluctuate very much. To investorsconcerned withloss ofcapital risk, cash would appear to be the most secure choice, as principal isguaranteedand/orinsured. Savings and checking accounts are highly liquid, as they can be readilyconvertedinto cash.With CDs, you may face liquidity risk, as they must be held for a predeterminedperiod oftime or may besubject to penalties for premature withdrawal. Although risk to principal may beminimal,loss ofpurchasing power, or inflationary risk, must be taken into consideration. Wheninflation andtaxation aretaken into account, returns can be considerably lower. Hypothetically, let's say in1981 youearned 14%in an investment. It sounds astronomical; however, the inflation rate at one pointthat yearsoared to15%. That's a net loss of value of at least 1% - and that's before taxes takeanother bite. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures a representative sample ofgoods andservices purchasedby American consumers. It is generally considered a primary measure of inflation.T-Bills arerepresented by the Salomon 1-3 year Treasury Index. It is an unmanaged indexgenerallyconsideredrepresentative of the U.S. short-term bond market. Bonds are represented by theSalomon HighGradeLong-Term Corporate Bond Index. It is a bond market indicator comprised of about800 bondswithmaturities of 12 years or more rated AA or AAA. Stocks are represented by S&P 500StockIndex, aregistered trademark of Standard & Poor's Corp. The Salomon and S&P Indexes areunmanaged anddo not include any charges or expenses that you may incur as a direct investor ofthesesecurities. Pastperformance is no indication of future results. Bonds - Commonly called "fixed income investments," they arebasically loansor "IOUs." Interest isearned on the money you lend. The prices of bonds do move up and down, but normallynot asmuchas stocks. Many people think of bonds as conservative investments, but the returnscan have ahighdegree of volatility. The fluctuation of interest rates is called interest raterisk, and adownturn in thebond prices could significantly decrease the overall return of any particular bond. Stocks - Represent equity in, or partial ownership of, acompany.An easywayto remember thedifference between stocks and bonds is: "With stocks, you own. With bonds, youloan." Theprice of astock or share can move up or down, sometimes a lot. The returns of stocks fromyear to yearcan bequite volatile, but, as the graph illustrates, the returnsfrom stockshavesignificantly outpaced inflation, and topped the returns from cash and bonds aswell, overthis twenty-year period. Finding Your Comfort Zone It's possible to achieve higher returns through stocks rather than bonds, andthrough bondsrather thanthrough cash, but you can't expect to get higher returns without taking on somedegree ofunpredictability. If you seek higher returns, you have to be willing to live withhigherrisk. "How much riskis right for me?" The answer will affect your investment decisions. Although pastperformanceis not aguarantee of what will happen in the future, historical results over a long periodof timecan help youmake your investment decisions. The Ways to Manage Risk There are a number of strategies that can help limit risk while offering thepotential ofhigher returns. Diversification - Investing in a variety of investments, orsimplyfollowingthe oldadage "Don't put allyour eggs in one basket." With a portfolio spread among several differentinvestments, youbenefit wheneach type is doing well, and also limit exposure when one or more investment isperformingpoorly. Asset Allocation - Building upon the diversification concept,withassetallocation you create acustomized portfolio consisting of several asset categories (cash, stocks, bonds)rather thanindividualsecurities. Changing economic conditions affect various types of assetsdifferently;consequently, eachasset category's return may partially offset the others'. Dollar Cost Averaging - Systematically investing a fixeddollaramount atregular time intervals. Whenthis disciplined program is adhered to and market fluctuations are ignored, itattempts to"smooth out"the ups and downs of the market over the long haul. Dollar cost averaging, however,cannotguaranteea positive return in a declining market and you must consider your ability tocontinueinvesting on aregular basis under all market conditions. The Means to Manage Risk Most investors find it difficult to diversify effectively across the full spectrumof cashand individual stocksand bonds. That is why so many investors have chosen variable products to apply thestrategiespreviously mentioned. Mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal lifeinsuranceproducts offer the potential for maximizing investmentperformance,investment flexibility, and convenience. They allow you to allocate investmentsamong s WT02-B28-157IA046-000816-B018-189http://www.newyorklife.com:80/viewer/wsh-nyl.hts/nyl/new_book.html 207.121.184.160 19970119015233 text/html 4020HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Netscape-Commerce/1.12Date: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 01:51:39 GMTContent-type: text/html Save Page Confirmation You have saved the following page as a bookmark to your Personal Folder.

New York Life's SPIA is a product that cantake away these worries. Here's how it works: you give New York Life a one-time premiumpayment,and in return you'll receive a steady stream of income payments for the rest of your life, nomatter howlong you live - guaranteed. SPIA gives you more security than a typical savings account, which you continuously drawupon, hopingit will last your entire lifetime. SPIA doesn't have an account value you can access, but theincome youreceive from New York Life's SPIA is guaranteed never to run out. That's something asavings accountcan't offer you. And SPIA also offers you alternatives that can provide a lifetime income forboth you andyour spouse or provide income to your loved ones if you die prematurely. Your SPIA income is a fixed amount of money based on your age, your gender, the amountof yourpremium payment, and the frequency with which you receive your income payments:monthly, quarterly,semi-annually, or annually. We can send your payments directly to you or, if you'd like, wecan evenhave them deposited directly into your bank account. Best of all, SPIA is guaranteed by New York Life Insurance Company. Safe From Market Fluctuations In addition to providing a guaranteed lifetime income, SPIA can also take away some of theworry aboutmanaging your money. Unlike income from stocks and bonds, your SPIA payments won't beaffectedby market swings. No matter what happens in the financial markets, you'll keep receiving your money from NewYork Life. Tax-Qualified Money, Too1 If you have money tucked away in tax-qualified plans, such as an IRA or 401(k) plan, thatmoney willbecome taxable once you receive it. Not only could that extra money throw you into ahigher taxbracket,it could even subject up to 85% of your Social Security benefits to taxation. But by putting that money into New York Life's SPIA and spreading your receipt of it overseveral years,you may avoid having that extra income put you into a higher bracket. You may even beable to prevent(or limit) the taxation of your Social Security benefits. Furthermore, if you place tax-qualified money in SPIA, you might not have to worry abouthow to satisfythe Internal Revenue Services' Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) requirements -because yourSPIA could automatically satisfy them. This is important, because the IRS imposes severepenalties ifthese requirements aren't met. Maximize Your Income You can receive the highest income for your premium amount, gender, and age if you selectour "lifeonly" SPIA. It guarantees that New York Life will pay you regularly for the rest of your life. Upon yourdeath, payments will cease. Protect Your Spouse Sometimes, income for one life isn't enough. Many couples want to make sure that theyhave enoughincome to last for both of their lifetimes. If you select a Joint & Survivor SPIA, you will receivepaymentsfor as long as either one of you is alive. This way, both you and your spouse will beprotected againstoutliving the savings you've amassed together. Provide For Your Beneficiaries None of us like to think that if we were to die shortly after giving a lot of money to aninsurance company,that money would be completely lost. New York Life offers alternatives to prevent this: Guaranteed Period Certain SPIA: With this SPIA, you choose a minimum period of timeduringwhich you will receive payments: either 5, 10, 15, or 20 years from the date that youpurchased yourSPIA policy. If you die before this guaranteed number of years has passed, New York Lifewill continuesending your payments to your chosen beneficiary(ies) for the duration of the guaranteeperiod.2 Guaranteed Total Amount SPIA: With this SPIA, New York Life guarantees to pay you atleast theamount of your original SPIA premium payment. If you die before the total money you'vereceivedequals the amount of your original premium payment, New York Life will continue to payyour chosenbeneficiary(ies) until the total amount paid to you and your beneficiaries matches your initialpremium. This way, you and your beneficiaries will at least "get back what you paid in." Of course, no matter which type of SPIA you choose, New York Life will keep paying you aslong as youlive. But these additional alternatives enable you to make sure that your money will gotoward providingfor your needs or those of your loved ones. These alternative SPIAs can also help ease the burden on your beneficiaries if you diebefore all of theguaranteed payments have been made. That's because New York Life's payments godirectly to yourbeneficiaries, unlike many other assets that may get tied up in probate. Your SPIA paymentscould behelpful to your beneficiaries at a very difficult time. 1Please discuss all matters relating totaxationwith your ownprofessional tax advisor. 2 If you choose a Joint & SurvivorSPIA, you mayelect a 10-yearor 20-year Period Certain or a Guaranteed Total Amount. The 5-year and 15-year PeriodCertainoptions are not available with a Joint & Survivor SPIA.

SPL - A Unique Concept The Single Premium Life (SPL) Insurance concept is simple and straightforward: you pay asinglelump sum ($5,000 or more) for a paid-up, cash value life insurance policy. SPL can providethefinancial security that people seek from life insurance, along with an attractive means ofaccumulatingfunds for retirement or other long-term financial needs. SPL offers: A death benefit free from federal income tax (in some states it may also be freefrom statedeath tax, probate expense, and the claims of creditors). A competitive interest rate credited to the policy's cash value. Tax-deferred accumulation of the policy's cash value. The ability to access cash values through policy loans. The convenience of paying just one premium for a paid-up policy. "A Souped-Up Annuity"? No, SPL is not an annuity, even though many industry experts feel that it may be moreappropriate tocompare SPL to annuities than to traditional life insurance. SPL and single premiumdeferredannuities (SPDA) have many similarities: a single premium payment, tax-free accumulationof cashvalue, identical tax rules governing loans, and a guaranteed death benefit. But there arekeydifferences. The death benefit of SPL is usually a good deal larger than that of acomparable SPDA; infact, by tax law, the SPL death benefit must be considerably larger than its cash value. Also,in mostinstances, the death benefit of the SPL is free from federal income tax, while thebeneficiaries ofannuities incur taxable income on the gain in the contract. A Brief History of SPL In the mid-1980s, insurance companies introduced the innovative SPL policy designed tomaximizethree tax advantages of life insurance: generally no federal income tax on the death benefit,tax-deferredaccumulation of cash value, and tax-free borrowing from that cash value. Theseadvantages, along withcompetitive interest rates on the policy's cash value, made SPL a very popular product withsavvyconsumers. In 1988, Congress enacted legislation that affected the tax treatment of some life insurancepolicies,including SPL. It is now technically classified as a Modified Endowment Contract, whicheliminates thetax-free loan feature. Now, when you borrow from an SPL policy, it results in a taxabledistribution. Thelesser of the loan or gain is reported as a taxable gain. In addition, the IRS imposes a 10%penalty taxon the taxable gain distributed before the policy owner is age 59 1/2. To Whom is SPL Best Suited? While SPL is available to most ages (0 to 85), it can be a key part of the portfolio of mature,fairly affluentpre-retirees. It provides financial security and the potential for long-term capital growth. Under its current tax treatment, SPL may not be the mostappropriate productfor people with a need for current income. For those seeking tax-free policy loans as a toppriority in alife insurance product, a traditional permanent policy may be a better choice. With SPL, it isbest torestrict borrowing until after age 59 1/2, at which point the penalty tax would not apply. The Many Uses of SPL Providing a degree of financial security for yourself and your family remains a primaryadvantage of anSPL policy. SPL allows for only a single premium payment and generates an increasingdeath benefit. Beneficiaries of SPLproceedsreceive their funds free of federal income tax. Those funds can be used to pay off mortgagesand otherdebts, fund children's or grandchildren's educations, take care of final expenses, offset theloss of theinsured's income, and allow a family to continue its standard of living. To the extentpermitted by law,insurance proceeds are protected from the claims of the insured's creditors. Below areother benefitsand uses of an SPL policy: A Source of Retirement Income - Tax-deferred cash valueaccumulation can beconsiderable over the long-term. You can tap into that cash value through the valuable loanprovision tohelp fund a comfortable retirement. Since most policies will be classified as ModifiedEndowmentContracts, you would be taxed on these loans to the extent of gain in the policy, includingany unpaidloan interest. However, loans taken after age 59 1/2 would not be subject to the additional10% penaltyof the taxable amount. Outstanding loans are deducted from the death benefit. Gifts to Minors and Adults - A lasting legacy can be left to minorchildren andgrandchildren through the gifting of SPL. There is no gift tax due on SPL policies purchasedon achild'slife up to $10,000 of single premium. The children's parents should be made custodialowners of thepolicies. Parents can also make gifts to adult children. Using joint gifts or communityproperty gifts,parents can purchase SPL policies on each adult child for up to $20,000 with no gift taxconsequences. Withdrawals may be subject to a tax penalty if made before age 59 1/2. Charitable Giving Uses - Using an SPL policy, you can make alarger donationto your favorite charity. Over the long-term, SPL can multiply your single premium severaltimes over toprovide a generous donation to a worthwhile cause. Philanthropic bequests have becomeone of themost meaningful uses of life insurance. Lump-Sum Distribution Vehicle - If there's a substantial lump-sumdistributioncoming your way in the future, you might want to take a look at SPL. It can be a good placeto putinsurance proceeds, funds from the sale of a residence, an after tax distribution from aqualified plan,annual bonuses, or inherited funds. SPL is offered by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation. For more information on SPL and its suitability to your needs, contact your New York Lifeagent.

Or, ifyou'vealready savedenough for your retirement, do you need a place to maintain that money until you'reready touse it? Aplace where that money can grow, tax-deferred? Either way, your New York Life agentmayhave theproduct for you: SPRA-2 (Single Premium Retirement Annuity), a competitive deferredannuity designedto satisfy your retirement needs. A Secure Retirement How will you spend your retirement years -financially secure, or struggling to meetbasicneeds? Evenif you haven't reached retirement, the time to begin shaping your financial futureis now. Adeferredannuity could provide you with the money you need, down the road. Or perhaps you're already retired. Are you tired of watching taxes eat away at theinterestyou earn onyour CDs? Are your earnings from CDs or other investments triggering taxes on yourSocialSecuritybenefits? A deferred annuity could provide the solution. If you're looking for a savings alternative that can take care of your financialneeds andperhaps evenprovide a legacy for your children or grandchildren, SPRA-21 may be the right choice for you. SPRA-2 allows your money to grow tax-deferred at competitive interest rates. AndSPRA-2'sliberalwithdrawal provisions offer you the flexibility to control your financialsituation. Later on, youcan evenuse the money you've accumulated to generate a retirement income you can'toutlive. The Power of Tax Deferral With SPRA-2, your money grows tax deferred -which means you won't pay taxes on yourmoney whileit's growing, only as you withdraw it.2Your money grows faster in SPRA-2 than it would in acomparable, currently-taxable investment -because in SPRA-2, money that otherwisewouldbe usedto pay taxes remains in the policy and earns interest, too. This graph illustrates how SPRA-2 can help your money grow faster. It charts thegrowth of atax-deferred vehicle at 8%, compared to a similar, currently-taxablevehicle.3 With SPRA-2, you can get more mileage out of money that's currently sitting in a CDor othercurrently-taxable investment. You can also use it to consolidate several smallerIRAs. And ifyou'reretiring, changing jobs, or if your company's pension plan is terminating, you cantakeadvantage ofSPRA-2 and continue growing your pension money in an IRA rollover. Competitive Rates, Plus First Year Enhancement SPRA-2 offers a competitive base interest rate and it also has a 1% interestenhancement on that rate for the first policyyear.4 Each year thereafter,on yourpolicy anniversary, you'll receive NYLIAC's competitive base interestrate. Historically, NYLIAC's base interest rate has been consistently higher thanthe averageone-yearCD rate5 and is guaranteednever to beless than 3%. And with SPRA-2, higher amounts earn evenhigher interest rates.6 Also,unlike manyfinancial alternatives, SPRA-2 doesn't have up-front salescharges or annual maintenance fees that can hinder your money's growth. Access To Your Money SPRA-2 is a product for building money over the long term, and withdrawals duringthe firsteight policyyears may be subject to a surrender charge as follows: Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and later Surrender Charge7 7% 7% 7% 7% 6% 5% 4% 3% None However, emergencies do arise, so SPRA-2 has a 10% "window" that allows you to takeupto 10% ofyour money, each year, without any surrender charges. And after eight years, youcan takeout as muchmoney as you want, at any time, without any surrender charges.8 Compare this with a typical CD, where twenty yearsfromnow you'llstill face a penalty when you withdraw your money (except on the maturitydate).9 With SPRA-2, you can request withdrawals as often as you'd like. If you want steadypayments, we cansend your interest, your 10% window, or any other amount on a regular basis -monthly,quarterly,semi-annually, or annually.10 We caneven have it deposited directly into your bank account. Flexibility and Control Unlike many financial products, SPRA-2 offers you flexibility and control over whenyoureceive income-and when you pay taxes on it. You can wait until you're retired and in a lower taxbracketbefore youbegin to withdraw money. You can also spread your withdrawals over several years,to evenout yourtaxburden and avoid throwing yourself into a higher tax bracket or increasing thetaxation ofyour SocialSecurity benefits. With SPRA-2, you're in control. Of course, you should consultyourprofessional taxadvisor.

Even if you have been financially preparingand have amassed whatyou think is an adequate retirement income, think again. Often, people will basetheir retirementestimates on several mistaken, but commonly-held, assumptions regarding retirementand whatvariousresources will provide. In many cases, the reality of retirement turns out to bequite different from whatthese common "retirement myths" would lead one to believe. 1. Myth: I'll have Social Security to support me. Reality: Wrong. Social Security was never designed to cover income needs, butrather tosupplement your pension and personal savings. Here's an idea of what you canexpect from SocialSecurity: if your annual earnings are $25,000, $40,000, $60,000, Social Securitycan provide 50%,27%, 23% of your annual income, respectively. At least, that's what you can expect if you retire now. However, some experts haveestimated that by thetime today's working baby boomers are ready to retire next century, there may notbe enough people leftin the work force to fully fund Social Security benefits. That's all the morereason to look into building upyour retirement savings. 2. Myth: My living costs will be lower when I retire, so I'll need lessmoney. Reality: Many times, just the opposite is true. The only costs that may endare mortgage paymentsand the college tuition you may now be paying. Health care costs could rise,especially if you no longerhave employer-sponsored medical/dental coverage. Also, many retirees frequentlyeat out, which couldincrease food bills. And you'll probably want to pursue your favorite hobbies,recreational activities, and"dream" vacations. 3. Myth: I'll have my company pension to tide me over. Reality: Don't count on a pension as your main source of income. Most defined benefit plans are geared toward providing a replacement ratio of between 40% - 60%of your finalaverage salary. This amount generally will be paid only if the employee has 25 ormore years of servicewith the employer. Also, defined benefit pensions are often reduced for paymentsto Social Security. Under typical circumstances, the actual replacement ratio can drop to between 20%and 30% of thefinal average salary for a rank-and-file employee. Naturally, each situation is different for each person. But many retirees havemade the mistake ofcounting on their pension, only to have to find part-time jobs to pay the bills. With the right planning, thiswon't happen to you. 4. Myth: I'm too old to begin planning for retirement now. Reality: Not true. Maybe you can't make up for lost time and opportunity butit's never too late tostart saving. Someone who takes early retirement at age 55 may still be goingstrong after 30 years. So, while you'll have to contribute more to your retirement savings account than ifyou had startedearlier, you can still be ready for your retirement - if you start now, and do whatneeds to be done. 5. Myth: The equity in my home is my retirement fund. Reality: While a house may be your largest investment, residential real estatedoes not alwaysappreciate. Even when home prices do rise, they usually increase along with allother living expenses. Even if you sell and move to a smaller home, you may wind up with far less money,after paying capitalgains taxes, than you expected. And, when all your savings have been depleted, youcan't sell yourhouse, piece by piece, in order to eat. That's why it's important to have liquidassets that will be therewhen you need them. 6. Myth: My main goal should be to preserve my savings. Reality: Inflation is a money-killer, and it will deplete your principal. Tostay ahead of inflation, youshouldn't seek to preserve money, but to build on it. Did you know that aretirement income of $20,000in 1970 would have to increase to $67,000 in 1990 to have the same purchasingpower? A solidfinancial plan allows your assets to grow, so that you can keep up with the risingcost of living.

If you are 43 years old today and expect to begin receiving Social Security benefits atage 66,your"normal retirement age" under present law, you may be in for a surprise. In the year2016 theSocialSecurity program will begin running cash deficits. At first, the problem will be manageable: benefit payments and administrative costs willexceedincomeby only $13 billion. Within five years, however, the shortfall will be $200 billionannually. Tenyears later,it will be nearly $1 trillion. By the early 2020's, if not earlier, Social Securitybenefits will almostcertainlyhave to be reduced, if the program is to have any hope of meeting its obligations. Social Security's Board of Trustees, whose financial projections are the basis for thisanalysis,saysnot to worry, the system won't go broke until 2036. They estimate that the trust fundswill rise to ahealthy nest egg of $5.6 trillion in 2024, two and a half times the projected annualpayout at thattime. According to the trustees, benefits will then be assured for another 12 years, as theassets in thetrustfund are sold off. There is a major problem, however, with the trustees' projection of a40-yearmarginof safety: there may be no money in those trust funds when it is time to draw them down.Themoneymay have already been spent on other government programs. When Social Security's income exceeds its expenses, the surplus is retained by theTreasury andusedto meet the government's non-Social Security expenses. For example, the recent gradualrise inSocialSecurity payroll taxes, from 10.8 percent of wages and salaries in 1983 to 12.4 percenttoday, hasled toannual surpluses that went to finance B-2 bombers, farm subsidies, savings and loanbailouts,andother general federal expenditures. In return for using these funds, the Treasury issuesspecialbondsto the trust funds. When Social Security's expenses exceed its income, theoretically these bonds can beredeemedtomeet current obligations. Beginning in 2016, the Treasury will need to begin redeemingthesebonds.They will have to find the cash somewhere else. Unfortunately, the choices are limited,and nonearepolitically attractive. The Treasury has three options: Sell bonds to the public. Whether the public has sufficientappetite to buy additional bonds at an average rate of $500 billion per year, even in the inflated dollars of 2025-2035, remains to be seen. Raise taxes. Policymakers can raise taxes to provide theTreasury with the necessary money. More directly, they could raise Social Security taxes, reducing the need for bond redemptions. Print money. This would increase the inflation rate. BecauseSocial Security benefit increases are tied to changes in the Consumer Price Index, inflation would result ineven higher benefit costs and the need to redeem bonds more rapidly, not to mention otherdeleteriouseconomic effects. Rather than trying, probably unsuccessfully, to redeem the trillions of dollars in bondsaccumulatedover several decades, policymakers would likely enact a package of revenue increases andbenefitreductions that would bring Social Security's income and outgo into balance in 2016, orshortlyafter.The following big ticket items are likely to be included in such a package: Increased Social Security taxes. Tax increases are easy toexplain, and most workers pay the additional amounts through withholding from wages and salaries. Increased taxation of benefits. Since 1984, beneficiaries withmoderately high incomes ($25,000 for individuals, $32,000 for married couples filing joint returns)have paid federal income taxes on up to 50% of their Social Security benefits. The 50% figure can be raised easily. In fact, this has already been proposed so often that it is likelyto occur long before 2016. Reductions in COLAs. Social Security's cost-of-livingadjustments were delayed 6months by legislation in 1983. They could be delayed again, reduced, or frozen temporarily. Increase the Normal Retirement Age (NRA). The 1983 legislationraised the NRA gradually, from 65 for workers born before 1938, to 67 for those born after 1959. These changes are present law, not just proposals. Congress has already demonstrated that itcan raise the NRA, and there is no reason to believe that they will stop at age 67. It certainly appears that the Social Security program will not be as rich for tomorrow'sretirees as itis fortoday's. People who hoped to be enjoying their retirement after 2016 should start savingmorenow ifthey want to maintain a comfortable standard of living after retiring. The necessaryamountscannot besaved during the last few working years; they must be accumulated over a much longerperiod oftime.Even if the trustees are correct, Social Security will have serious problems beginningin 2036 andwillneed to change. Today's workers need to know that now, while they still have time tomodify theirretirement planning.

How Much Life Insurance Do You Need? The main purpose of life insurance is to provide financial security for yourfamily. It helps to ensure thatwhen you die your family will have the financial resources it needs to provide foryour spouse, children,an elderly parent or some other dependent. However, life insurance also may beused to meet a varietyof long-term financial goals. It can help provide educational funds for yourchildren or funds for yourown retirement. The question that most families and individuals have, then, is"How much lifeinsurance do I need?" The answer depends largely on your family's individualcircumstances. There are no hard and fast rules for determining how much life insurance is enough,because no twoindividuals have exactly the same needs. You may be single, supporting no one butyourself. Or, you maybe supporting an elderly mother or father. You may have several children, but alsotwo incomes andconsiderable net worth. Whatever your situation, if you are providing financial support for people who aredepending on you, youneed life insurance. However, there are several things to consider when you buylife insurance, sincethe proceeds can be used with several goals in mind. For example, proceeds can: Provide ready cash for final expenses: These could include funeral costs,medical expenses,probate fees, and estate taxes. Pay off outstanding debts: not only hospital bills, for example, but a mortgageor an auto loan. Provide replacement income in amounts necessary to cover: A readjustment period of two or three years after your death. If you are a two-income family, it takestime to adjust to one paycheck instead of two. If you are the sole wage earner,with young childrenathome, your spouse's need for a readjustment period is obvious. The period while children under age 18 still are at home and dependent. (Social Security benefits that may be available supply only part of your family's income needs.) The college years, when Social Security benefits for dependents come to an endjust as expensesgrow. The years between the time the youngest child becomes independent and thesurvivingspouse reaches retirement age. The period after the survivor retires and receives Social Security or apension. In general, determining how much life insurance you need means deducting the sumtotal of theincome that would be lost upon the insured's death from the sum total of yourfamily's ongoingfinancial need. It also means calculating the impact of inflation (usuallyassuming 5% per year) andbuilding in enough "extra" to counteract inflation's effects. It may seemcomplicated, but it is an exercisethat is well worth doing. It is also one that you do not have to tackle alone. A life insurance agent can help determine how muchlife insurance yourfamily will need over time, based on the extent of your financial responsibilitiesand the kinds andamounts of your other resources. It may be that the solution to your insurance needs entails using a combinationof several plans,and the combination may need to be changed as your situation changes. Fortunately, life insurance is flexible - with several types of plans available -and an agent can work withyou to determine what products will best fit your ongoing needs and future goals.

(Rev.Rule.64-328) How Split-Dollar Insurance Works In one typical arrangement, a corporation will purchase an insurance policy onthe lifeof an ownerorkey employee, and will pay 100 percent of the premiums. The insured can own thepolicyand name apersonal beneficiary. The cash value and a portion of the death benefit will beowned as"collateral" bythe corporation to the extent of the premiums paid. The terms of the corporation'sinterestare spelledout in a "collateral assignment form" and a separate legal agreement. If theinsured dieswhile thecollateral assignment is in effect, the corporation recovers premiums paid from thedeathbenefit. Theremainder goes to the insured's personal beneficiary. If the insured lives for anumber ofyears, theinsurance cash value may be sufficient to repay the corporation for its entireoutlay. Thepolicy may thenbe "rolled out" to the insured, who can continue the plan as a personal insurancepolicy. For tax treatment, the corporation cannot deduct its premiums, nor is theemployeetaxed on thosepremiums. Rather, the employee is taxed on what the IRS calls "the economicbenefit,"which is thecost of insurance benefit as defined by the IRS. A "tax wise" variation of split dollar works as outlined above, with oneadditionalwrinkle. Here theinsured pays a portion of the premium out of his or her own pocket; the corporationpays thebalance. Inthis variation, called "contributory split dollar," the insured is not taxed onthat part of theeconomicbenefit paid with personal funds. The employee's share of the premium can equalorexceed theeconomic benefit. Uses of Split-Dollar Insurance Business buyout: Al and Luiz are co-owners of Computer Works, Inc. Bothseethevirtue of abuy-and-sell agreement and the logic of funding that permanent need with permanentlifeinsurance. Neither Al nor Luiz, however, wants to pay permanent insurance premiums from hisownpocket. Hereis what they do. Al and Luiz apply for insurance, each on the life of the other,in an amountsufficient tofund the buy-and-sell agreement, and they name themselves beneficiary. The bulk ofthepremiums arepaid by the corporation on a split dollar basis. Al and Luiz contribute only anamount equalto theeconomic benefit, roughly the same amount that they would have spent on a standardtermpolicy. Eventually, Computer Works, Inc. will recover its premiums from either the cashvalue or thedeathbenefit in accordance with the split-dollar agreement and collateral assignmentform. Splitdollarenables Al and Luiz to achieve an important business continuation objective in away that isfair andeffective. Executive Benefits: Goodman, Inc. is wholly owned by an architect, EllenGoodman. Inaddition toseveral other employees, Ellen employs a skilled thirty-five year old designer,Karl Schmidt. Ellenwould like to retain Karl's services, but is not eager to install a benefitsprogram for allemployees. After considering a number of alternatives, Ellen, on the advice of her CPA,chooses asplit-dollar planfor Karl. Split dollar provides Karl with a significant death benefit. Equallyattractive are thecashvalues. Even after repaying Goodman, Inc. for its premium contribution, the policy maybuildsignificantcash values by the time Karl is sixty-five. The plan is just too good forKarl to walkaway. ForGoodman, Inc., split dollar is a cost-effective way to retain a valued employee. Split dollar can also be an estate planning tool. Properly structured, thepolicyproceeds from theplancan be kept out of the insured's estate. Those contemplating a split-dollar planshouldcontact theirNew York Life agent, as well as their own legal and financial advisors. Split dollar is not something for nothing, but for the insured it can be agreatdeal forvery little.

What It Can Do For You What it Can Do for You Let's face it - you work hard for your money, and that's why you need your money towork hardfor you. Of course, income tax is a fact of life - and it's not something you have a greatdeal ofcontrol over. However, there is a way to accumulate money without having to pay taxes on it - atleast notuntil youuse it. It's called tax deferral, and several types of insurance and financialproductsoffer it. What is Tax Deferral? With tax-deferred products, you don't pay taxes on accumulated funds, interest ordividendsuntil youactually withdraw the money. Since the gain in a tax-deferred product isn't taxeduntil it'swithdrawn, itusually accumulates at a faster rate. For this reason, tax-deferred accumulationcan providea powerfulfinancial edge. If you participate in a 401(k) plan offered by your employer or if you own anIndividualRetirementAccount (IRA), you're already enjoying the benefits of tax-deferred accumulation. Manyinsurance andannuity products also offer this advantage. Even the interest and dividendsgenerated bytheseproducts generally avoid current income taxes! The Power of Tax Deferral The following chart shows the tremendous difference tax deferral can make in therate atwhich yourmoney grows. If we assume that a single sum of $50,000 will be invested for 30years at ahypotheticalinterest rate of 8%, we see that the tax-deferred vehicle provides better long-termaccumulation. If youare in the 31% tax bracket, you may be able to accumulate about $250,620 in ataxableaccount. However, if you used a tax-deferred account for the same investment, you mayaccumulate over$503,100. (Please note that a 10% IRS tax penalty may be imposed on withdrawalsfromannuities,some insurance products, IRAs, or 401(k) plans, when these withdrawals are madebefore thepurchaser has reached age 59 1/2.) *Hypothetical rate used for illustrative purposes only. Not intended to predictnor guarantee any actual product results. This amount does not reflect the effect of applicable feesand/or charges. Let it Accumulate Tax-deferred products offer you control over your financial situation. Not onlydoes yourmoneyaccumulate but, if you are selective in your withdrawals and plan them accordingly,you canavoidgetting "hit" with too many tax consequences when you do withdraw the money. Here's why: Tax deferral strategies work best for long-term planning, usually retirementplanning.The idea is toleave the money where it is for a long time - to let it go and let it grow. Sureyou'll betaxed on the moneyyou start to withdraw after you've retired - but you may be in a lower tax bracketby then,which wouldserve to soften the tax blow. You can be selective in your withdrawals and plan them so that you do notsufferunnecessary taxconsequences. The tax system has "thresholds" (tax brackets) that will help youdetermine howmuchof these funds you can withdraw during a given year. If you are prudent with yourwithdrawals- and youdon't break into a higher tax threshold - then the effect of these withdrawals onyour taxeswill beminimal. Remember, you're only taxed on what you withdraw. Tax-Deferred Insurance Products The cash values in life insurance and annuities accumulate tax deferred. Anannuity offersyouprotection so you don't outlive your savings. It does this by generating a steadystream ofincome thatwill be taxed as you receive it - a little at a time. As for whole life insurance,the mainfeature is the deathbenefit protection it provides, but it also offers the additional benefit of cashaccumulation. (Note:Another major tax advantage of life insurance is that, in most instances, thepayout to yourbeneficiariesis income tax free!) For people who want to combine tax deferral with the potential growth from adiversified portfolio, there are variable universal life insurance and variableannuityplans. Both of theseoffer the opportunity to participate in investment accounts - and the associatedhigher levelof risk.However, like all tax-deferred products, they accumulate gradually over time. Thatis whyinsurance andannuity products - like most tax-deferred vehicles - may work best as long-termfundingvehicles. Only you can determine what your financial needs are - right now and later in your life. But it's important to remember that sooner or later, many of us canbenefit from tax-deferred products. Talk to your New York Life insurance agent oryour NYLIFE Securities registered representative, and examine your needs -- notjust your immediate goals but your long-term goals. You'll see whether tax-deferredproducts could be right for you. This discussion is not intended to portray the features of any particular product,but simply to illustrate the concept of tax deferral.

While a discussion about taxes may not be a topic of your nightly dinner conversation, it is an issue that concerns us all, and with good reason. In 1996, we spent over one-third of our time working for the government. Tax Freedom Day According to an annual report issued by the Tax Foundation, Americans worked the first 127 days of 1996, from January 1 to May 6, just to pay taxes. In theory, this means that on May 7 your job began toproduce spendable income and your taxable investments became profitable. Thisrepresents the latest Tax Freedom Day ever. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, took itsanalysis one step furtherand broke down the tax implications for each state. Connecticut was the unluckywinner, bearing the nation's largest tax burden in 1996 with a Tax Freedom Day of May 31. Alabama saton the opposite end of this spectrum with a Tax Freedom Day of April 23. The Eight Hour Work Day To put a different spin on the way Americans see their tax burden, the TaxFoundationexamined theportion of each eight hour working day necessary to pay federal, state, and localtaxes. In1996, theFoundation discovered that the average American spends 2 hours and 47 minutes eachworkingday topay the necessary federal, state, and local taxes. This is more time than it takesto pay forfood, shelter,and clothing combined. Most of this time, 1 hour and 50 minutes, covers the federaltaxportion. Theremainder, 57 minutes, covers state and local taxes. What Are Your Options? How can you reduce the time it takes to reach Tax Freedom Day next year? Askyourself threesimplequestions related to your financial situation in 1996: Did I receive 1099s from my bank accounts? Did I receive 1099s from other investments? Did I spend or reinvest the interest? If you earned taxable interest on investments that you expect to hold for the longterm, thenyou had topay current taxes on it. With taxable investments, the reality is that you don'talwaysliquidate yourholdings to pay taxes. In all likelihood, you pay the tax out of current income orout ofwithholding fromother income sources. This technique reduces your spendable income today, and mayreduce itin thefuture. Fortunately, there are sensible strategies that will help you maximizelong-termreturns whilepotentially reducing your tax bill. With investments like annuities, your earnings have the ability to accumulate on atax-deferred basis.Simply put, you don't have to pay current taxes on money that is ear-marked for thelongterm. Instead,all earnings are reinvested and continue to accumulate on a tax-deferred basisuntilwithdrawn. Ofcourse, withdrawals of earnings from annuities are taxable and, if you are underage 591/2, may besubject to a 10% tax penalty.

Sorry, it's just notthatsimple. Term life insurance has its place. If you're young or cash shy, term can be anideal stopgapsolution; itcan provide you and your family with maximum coverage for the lowest immediatepremiumoutlay. If thechoice is an adequate amount of term coverage versus no protection at all, terminsurance maywell bethe best choice. It is also very often the product of choice when protection needs may be high for aperiod oftime, thendrop back, such as when your family is growing. Term insurance can also be aneffective waytosupplement permanent insurance during high-need years, such as when family andotherfinancialresponsibilities are outpacing income. In these situations, term coverage allows you to obtain crucial death benefitprotectionwithout breakingyour budget. Also, if the coverage is convertible (the coverage can be "converted"to acomparable cashvalue policy, without the need to provide evidence of insurability), you can getthe coverageyou needtoday...with the ability to obtain permanent coverage in the future. In thisrespect, terminsurance meetsa valuable need. The True Cost of Term Life Insurance However, term insurance has its drawbacks. It certainly isn't right for all peopleor underallcircumstances. Among its weaknesses, be aware of the following: You do have to die to "win." As unpleasant as that sounds, it's true. Term lifeinsuranceprovides adeath benefit only, and only for a specific period of time. When the term ofcoverageexpires, so doesyour protection. Also, if you stop paying premiums, the coverage ends. Period. Let's say that you own $500,000 of term insurance. You've kept the coverage inforce forten years,andthe policy expires at midnight on December 31. If you die at 11:59 on New Year'sEve, yourfamilyreceives the full $500,000 in death benefit proceeds. However, if you die at 12:01on January1, yourfamily receives nothing under the policy, since the contract has expired. Purchasing term insurance has often been compared to renting a house. When yourent, yougetthefull and immediate use of the house and all that goes with it, but only for as longas youcontinue payingrent. As soon as your lease expires, you must leave. Even if you rented the housefor 30years, you haveno "equity" or value that belongs to you. There is the very real danger of becoming uninsurable when the term coverageexpires.Whilemanyterm policies are convertible to permanent coverage, others may not be. Most ofall, even ifthe coverageis convertible, there are time limits. If the policy is allowed to expire, you mayberequired to reapply. Ifyou are found to be uninsurable at that time, you will be without coverage. The long-term cost of term can become increasingly burdensome. Premiumsincrease at eachrenewal, with the price per thousand dollars of coverage becoming prohibitive formany peopleas theyget older. Many people buy term coverage when they're in their 20s because it seemsdownrightcheapcompared to a cash value policy with the same death benefit amount. By the timethey're intheir 40s,the coverage seems a bit pricey, as the rate goes up. In their 50s, the cost hasgenerallywelloutstripped the cost of permanent coverage. Finally, in their 60s, if not sooner,they dropthe policy - notbecause they no longer need the protection, but because they can't afford it.Meanwhile, theperson whomay have paid more for that permanent policy in his or her 20s may still be payingthe samepremium. The Value of Permanent Life Insurance Cash value life insurance is still the best long-term solution for many people. Thereasons: It always pays. Cash value life insurance provides life-long insuranceprotection. With fewexceptions,once you have been approved for the coverage, your policy cannot be canceled by thecarrier,providedyou pay all required premiums. Regardless of your health or other factors, theinsurance willremain inforce. Higher initial premiums can actually be less expensive than term in the longrun. Infact, the policymaybe able to "pay for itself." Most permanent policies are eligible for dividends,which arenot guaranteed,if and when they are declared by the insurance company. Many companies offer theoption toapplyaccumulated dividends towards payment of all or part of the premiums. If values aresufficient,out-of-pocket premium payments may end after several years, yet coverage cancontinue forlife. Solong-term net cost can be quite low compared to the total cost for a term policy. It can eliminate the problem of future insurability. Cash value life insurancedoes notexpire after acertain period of time. It does not need to be renewed. Also, some policies containguaranteedpurchase options, which allow you to buy additional coverage at specified times,regardlessof yourhealth. It builds cash value. These dollars - which, under many policies, areguaranteed - can beused inthefuture for any purpose you wish. If you like, you can borrow cash value for a downpayment ona home,to help pay for your children's education or to provide income for your retirement.(Note:Borrowing cashvalue from your policy will affect your total policy values.) Plus, if you decideto stoppaying premiumsand surrender your policy, the guaranteed policy values are yours.

It started out as a niceidea, butit has since grown into an administrative nightmare. If so, why not consider going from an"unbundled"to a "bundled" plan design? If yours is a classic "unbundled" plan, chances are you're quarterbacking a diverse team ofoutsidevendors: obtaining investment services from one vendor, recordkeeping from another, and plancommunications from yet a third, while your plan trustee involves yet still another contact. Or perhapsyou keep some services in-house, while outsourcing others. One problem: It can be confusing and inefficient. Your plan may have little, if any,systems integration. As a plan sponsor, you may have to make several contacts to conduct plan changes or obtaininformation. Plus, because noboby is responsible for the entire plan, there may be limitedaccountability among vendors. Not only are errors more likely, but the task of sorting themout will likelyfall back on your shoulders. A second problem: It can be unnecessarily expensive. Because you have hired separate"experts" foreach component of your plan, you should expect to pay more. Each "expert" comes with its ownprofitmargin requirements, which you will have to pay for. Additionally, since you have to managethedifferent players, your retirement plan can divert precious resources away from the businessofrunningthe business. An attractive alternative: "bundling" your pension plan. Bundling enables you toconsolidate, orbundle, as many aspects of your pension plan under one vendor as you deem necessary. As a result, you can offer your employees a quality 401(k) plan, for instance, that canreduce yourrecordkeeping costs by as much as 50%; provide enhanced benefit flexibility and service forparticipants and let your human resource people focus on human resource issues - not pensionplanmanagement.

Well, thetruth of the matter is, you can'tafford to delay. Early planning can help to maximize the power of time, and canhelp you reach yourfinancial goals. Time is on Your Side The concept of the power of time is a simple one: The sooner you begin to save foryour future financialneeds, the greater the wealth you can accumulate. Although the idea isstraightforward and logical,most people fail to recognize the enormous increase in value that can result frombeginning to saveearly. The best way to demonstrate the power of time is by way of example. Let'stake a look at thedifferent approaches to investing taken by twin brothers, Ken and Ray. Starting Early Ken, looking to build a large nest egg for his retirement, chose to invest $1,000per year in an IndividualRetirement Account (IRA), starting at age 30. He continued his payments for tenyears until age 40,earning an average of 8% per year on his investments 1. At age 40, he stoppedcontributing to the IRA,but left his $11,000 of contributions in the account, plus earnings, untilretirement at age 65. 1 8% interest is for illustrative purposes onlyand is not intended to predict nor guarantee the results of any security product. Starting Late Ray, the second twin, was a bright guy but a bit of a procrastinator. He too sawthe need to put moneyaway for his retirement but didn't begin his investment plan until age 41. At thatpoint he began investing$1,000 a year into an IRA. He also averaged an 8% annual return,1 but he continuedto make $1,000investments for 25 years until he retired at age 65. His contributions over theyears totaled $25,000. The Dramatic Difference Given the fact that Ken contributed $11,000 while Ray contributed $25,000, youmight expect that thesecond twin would have a significantly greater total for retirement at age 65.Surprisingly, just theopposite is true! Assuming the tax-deferred IRA of each twin earned 8% a year, at age 65 the accountbalance for thefirst twin would be $123,000, while the second twin would have $79,000. Thepreceding hypotheticalchart vividly illustrates the dramatic difference in the accumulated wealth for thetwo. The Cost of Waiting Ray was on the right track. He invested steadily and wisely, earning good returns -his only mistakewas getting a late start. Ray invested more than twice the amount his brother did,yet had less money toenjoy at retirement. By getting an earlier start, Ken benefited from more years ofcompounding. Left toaccumulate in his account, the earnings from his early years earned additionalreturns. In other words,"earnings earn earnings." The Impact of Time and Life Insurance Postponing the purchase of life insurance to a perceived "better time" can alsohave a definite cost ofwaiting. For example, let's take a look at Trish's quandary. She's identified theneed for $250,000 ofpermanent life insurance coverage. Trish is considering buying a $250,000 wholelife policy, whichwould provide immediate insurance protection, and offer guaranteed cash valueaccumulation thatcould, in the long term, be borrowed against to fund a child's college education orhelp supplementretirement income. At age 40, her annual premium would be $4,000, but she's debatingwhether or notto wait five years, at which point her premium would be $5,000. Looking at bothscenarios over the longterm, total premium paid would balance out by age 65 ($4,000 for 25 years, and$5,000 for 20 yearsboth equal $100,000). How Waiting Can Affect Cash Value, Death Benefit, andInsurability Waiting would have a negative effect on several key areas. A whole life policyoffers the benefit oftax-deferred accumulation of cash value. Generally speaking, the sooner you start,the faster your cashvalue will grow over the long term. These cash values can be accessed throughpolicy loans to helpmeet financial needs. In addition, a whole life policy is eligible to earn dividends, if and when theyare declared by thecompany. Unlike cash values, dividends are not guaranteed. Trish could use herdividends in a varietyof beneficial ways including using them to purchase additional insurance to enhanceher total deathbenefit. Waiting means missing five years of potential dividends and theopportunity to increase thebenefit paid to her beneficiaries. Waiting five years can also place Trish's insurability in jeopardy. She's insurableat age 40, but may beuninsurable due to a health condition at age 45. Perhaps the greatest risk inwaiting is if she were todie in the next five years. In that case, the cost would be the $250,000 deathbenefit her beneficiarieswould not be paid. Purchasing this policy now would cost no more than waiting five years. Cash valueand death benefit,however, should be higher. Most importantly, insurance protection would begin now.So why shouldTrish wait? It's Never Too Early to Start Although expenses like the kids' college tuition and your own retirement may seemlike distant images,it pays to face up to the future today. With college tuition rising at a rate of 6%to 8% a year (the CollegeBoard, September 1993), you'll need all the time you can muster to meet thosespiraling costs.

When you invest in a mutual fund, you join other investors, pooling your money to purchase securities and pursue a specific objective. If you don't have the time to follow the markets, the experience to manage a portfolio, or the resources to diversify on your own, mutual funds may offer you four important advantages. Diversification By pooling the resources of many investors, mutual funds are able to purchase a broader range of securities than most individuals can afford on their own. While the types of securities a fund may purchase will depend on its investment objective, diversification is widely recognized as a way that may help reduce investment risk. Flexibility Mutual fund "families" offer investors the ability to stick with their original investment or move some of their money among various funds when markets shift or their personal circumstances change. Professional management Mutual funds are managed by experienced investment professionals, who continually monitor the economy, the markets, and individual securities to free you from having to make complex day-to-day investment decisions. Convenience Mutual funds are a convenient and affordable way to invest. In many cases, the minimum investment may be less than the cost of a single security in the fund's portfolio. Depending on your needs, you can arrange to have any income or capital gains automatically reinvested or sent directly to you.

Whether you are retiring, accepting a job with another company, or leavingyour company forsomeother reason, the money you have "built up" in your company retirement planis yours to take.This lumpsum of money is called a distribution, and may be the single largest sum youwill everreceive. Whenyou become eligible to receive a distribution, you must make two veryimportant decisionsabout how tohandle it for your long-term best interest: How should you take your money from your employer? What should you do with it then? This section explains and explores the second question and the factors youshould considerwhen planning your financial future. What Are Your Sources of Income?

Some types of annuities can also continue the monthly payments for aspouse or anotherbeneficiary. An annuity is generally purchased by a lump sum premium that you pay once,before the annuity takeseffect. This premium entitles you to the income that you'll receive in the future.Once your annuity hasbeen purchased, the fixed payments will not change. The monthly payments areguaranteed, and theamount is based on the size of the premium, options and life expectancy. Annuities are sold mainly by insurance companies and are either "immediate"or "deferred." An"immediate annuity" begins paying monthly benefits shortly after the premium isreceived by theinsurance company. A "deferred annuity" starts paying benefits later, often manyyears after you payyour premium. Immediate GuaranteedAnnuity Why a New York Life Annuity?

Employersreceive a taxdeduction for the fullamount of each contribution. Because of its simplicity, the SEP is an excellent low-costalternative to apension or profit sharing plan,allowing small and medium-sized businesses to control the cost ofproviding aretirement plan. The IRS provides an approved document and there is no expensive,time consumingannual reportingto either the IRS or the Department of Labor. But what are thespecific benefitsto you? Your Benefits With A SEP All contributions you make to your employees' SEP, up to thelesser of 15% of eachemployee'scompensation or $30,0001, aretaxdeductible business expenses. As an employee of your company, you are also entitled to set up aSEP for yourbenefit. Each year, you determine the amount, if any, to be contributed tothe plan for thatyear. All earnings in a SEP accumulate tax-deferred and provide retirementincome in additionto Social Securitybenefits. A SEP is an excellent incentive for attracting qualifiedemployees, reducingturnover, and retainingthosewith proven ability and experience. A SEP is easy to establish and understand, with minimalrecordkeeping andgovernment reporting. 1 Only the first$150,000 of compensation is considered, limiting the maximumcontribution to $22,500. The SEP Advantage - Reduced Corporate Taxes A SEP can help you save money on your corporate taxes. Savingmoney on corporatetaxes can directlyimprove your bottom line, as the following chart shows: Reduce Corporate Taxes Company A Company B Corporate Income $250,000 $250,000 SEP Contribution 0 50,000 Taxable Income 250,000 200,000 Taxes at 34% 85,000 68,000 Tax Savings 0 17,000 Assumes $250,000 corporate income, 34% taxrate. Company Amakes no SEPcontribution. Company B makes a $50,000 SEP contribution. As you can see, with the $17,000 tax savings, a $50,000 SEPcontribution actuallycosts only $33,000. Fund Your SEP With Mutual Funds Mutual funds can be excellent investments for your SEP. Manymutual fund familiesoffer a widerange of investment opportunities, designed to meet the financialgoals ofvirtually every type of investor. Since a SEP allows employees to select their investments, thewell-definedinvestment objectivesand flexibility of mutual funds make them an ideal investmentoption for a SEP. Moreover, mutual fundsareprofessionally managed and provide you with diversifiedinvestments. SEP Highlights Employer Eligibility Incorporated or unincorporated businesses of self-employedindividuals can set up aSEP. Employee Eligibility Employees 21 years or older with any service in 3 of theimmediately preceding 5years and whoearnedat least $400 (indexed annually). Tax Deductible Contributions You can deduct up to the lesser of 15% of includible compensationor $30,0001 perparticipant. IRS Reporting Requirements There are none, providing you give all eligible employees certaininformation. Set Up, Initial Funding and ContributionDeadline The employer tax filing due date (or later if granted anextension for filing thetax return). 1 Only the first$150,000 of compensation is considered, limiting the maximumcontribution to $22,500.
