Online activists have been fighting to havethese provisions removed from the bill from Day 1.  Our latest thrusthas been to stall the passage of the bill, hoping to gather enoughsupport to have these provisions removed.As you also probably already know, Congress broke for the year withoutvoting on the Telecommunications Deregulation bill.  Although netactivists should not take too much credit for this nonevent, our loudobjections to the language being tossed around in the Conferencecommittee certainly helped slow things down a bit.We have bought ourselves some time, and now we must meet with ourlegislators and explain to them why the Telecommunications Deregulationbill will cripple the Internet as a medium for commerce, education, anddemocracy.We've done well so far in establishing ourselves and our concerns inWashington DC.  We need to transform ourselves, evolve into the nextstep in the political process and begin the face to face work that willconvince candidates that we vote, and our votes turn on the FirstAmendment.Make a New Year's resolution: vow to have a face to face meeting withthe staff of your local legislator.  Follow the directions below andhelp become a part of the growing Internet Voter block.1. Setup a meeting at the local office of your Congress-person.   Sample phone call (a bit long for a call, but use it as a guide)        Hi, I'm a constituent.        The pending Telecommunications Reform bill contains a provision        which, under the guise of protecting children from        objectionable material on the Internet, will destroy the        Internet as a viable medium for commerce, education, and        democracy.  I believe that there are other, less restrictive        ways to address this issue.        I am very concerned about this issue, and I would like to come        in and meet with someone in your office to talk about why this        bill must not be passed in its current form. How soon can I        schedule a meeting?   If you don't know who your local legislator is, try these methods:   League of Women Voters: In many cities you can call them and they will        look up your legislator for you.   Elections Board: Many cities allow you to look up your legislator by        calling the local Elections board.   The Zipper: Stardot Consulting has setup a Congressional lookup service        called the Zipper, which lets you look up your legislator by entering        your zipcode. URL:http://www.stardot.com/zipper/   You can call the capitol switchboard at: 202 224-3121   A list of phone numbers for Congress is available also at:        URL:http://www.vtw.org/congress/2. Tell us about your meeting, preferably before and after by sending us   mail to feedback@vtw.org.  We will be keeping track of feedback to help   coordinate lobbying efforts in DC if and when Congress votes on this issue.        $ Mail feedback@vtw.org        Subject: meeting setup with Rep. Snodgrass        I've got a meeting scheduled with Rep. Snodgrass' staff on Tues.        I'm taking the Internet Parental Control FAQ and will educate them        about why these laws are not only unnecessary, but will not help        control kids' access to the net!        ^D        $ Mail feedback@vtw.org        Subject: my meeting with Rep. Snodgrass        I just got back from my meeting with Snodgrass' staff.  It went well!        They didn't know anything about the Internet, but I helped explain        to them about parental control tools and the fact that current laws        are *already* being enforced there, and they seemed to understand!        ^D3. Relax!  You have really done a lot to help the cause.________________________________________________________________________HOW TO SETUP A REALLY GOOD MEETING WITH CONGRESSIONAL STAFFREMEMBER THE POINT OF THE MEETINGYou must have a clear theme in the meeting.  Even if you say it and youthink it sounds corny, you don't want to leave a staffer guessing at whatyou want.The theme should be:        The Telecom bill should not pass with the net censorship        provisions in its current form.  House Speaker Gingrich and        Senate Leader Dole have both expressed concern over these        provisions.  Please work with them to protect free speech and        the Internet.It will help if you bring a personal Internet success story, such asimportant medical information found on the net, children gets materialfor school reports, car-owners talking to one another, camping tips,consumer product information from companies, local library cardcatalog, government information from CDC, Census, USDA, NASA, etc.SCHEDULING THE MEETINGWhen you setup your meeting, do not overload the meeting.  It is betterto have a local office have three meetings with three people, ratherthan one meeting with nine people.A perfect meeting would include an Internet user, an Internet business(like an Internet provider or another company that uses the net), and alibrarian.  Pick someone to be the MC so things progress smoothly.If you're the only one going to the meeting, that is good too.  It'sbetter to go to the meeting alone, rather than have no meeting at all.PREPARING FOR THE MEETINGMake sure you're familiar with the issues before going into themeeting.  Take some time to read the Communications Decency Act FAQavailable from URL:http://www.vtw.org/pubs/cdafaq to get a sense of themyths you may have to dispel during the meeting.  Also, become familiarwith, and take a copy of the VTW Internet Parental Control FAQ to backup claims that there are many parental control devices out there thatallow parents to control what their children see on the Internet.  Itis available from URL:http://www.vtw.org/pubs/ipcfaq.Are you ready?  Ask yourself if you know why no new laws are necessaryto control information on the Internet.If the answer is that current laws about child porn and obscenematerial extend there already, which, combined with parental controltools, make such unconstitutional laws unnecessary, then you're ready.RUNNING THE MEETINGRemember that most staffers know nothing about the Internet.  You'll have tobring them up to speed on the net, as well as why the net needs no new laws.It's crucial you be polite.  This is the first time they've met InternetVoters, and first impressions count.Dress appropriately, a jacket and tie are not out of the question.  Be very polite and patient.  Never raise your voice or utter the following phrasesduring a meeting with a staffer:        "I pay my taxes" or "You work for me, I'm a taxpayer"         (We all pay taxes, this is moot)        "I'll make sure you're not re-elected"         (They haven't met that many Internet Voters yet to convince them          this might be true)Make sure everyone has a chance to speak, answer any questions they mighthave, and then thank the staffer for their time.  Leave your name and numberso they can call you and ask you any questions they might think of later.AFTER THE MEETINGSend a thank you letter (faxing it is appropriate).  Remember to let VTWknow that you had the meeting by sending email to feedback@vtw.org.________________________________________________________________________THE LATEST NEWSCongress has broken for the year without a vote on the Telecomm bill.We have been given the breathing room we sorely needed.  We must nowconvince legislators to vote against the censorship legislation.Just to refresh your memory, the House and Senate passed different piecesof legislation which addressed regulation of the Internet.  Some of thelegislation promoted a "parental control" approach, where parents, notthe government, were the most appropriate to control children's accessto speech on the Internet. (This approach was called Cox/Wyden and wasapproved 421-4 by the House)Other proposals advocated dumbing down the content of the Internet tothat which is acceptable to children, and holding providers responsiblefor the speech of their users.  These approaches were the CommunicationsDecency Act (S314 approved 84-16 by the Senate), and the Manager's Amendment(slipped into the House Telecomm bill at the last second).Although we are trying very hard to get an electronic copy of the conferencereport, it's not fast in coming.  As soon as we can get a copy into electronicform we'll put it up on several WWW pages.In the meantime, here's a summary of what the bill looks like.CRIMINALIZATION OF "INDECENT" MATERIALThe proposed legislation relies on the unconstitutional "indecency standard". Like the Exon Communications Decency Act, it seeks to regulate all indecentspeech online. Indecency is a broad category that may include everything from George Carlin's"seven dirty words" to such classic novels and "The Catcher in the Rye","Lady Chatterly's Lover", "The Scarlet Letter", "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn","Our Bodies, Our Selves", Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet", and "Catch-22". The Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions on indecent speech are Constitutional only if they rely on the "least restrictive means".  Broadindecency restrictions on interactive media do not satisfy the "leastrestrictive means" test, because interactive media allows users andparents tremendous control over the information they receive. The net effect of an indecency restriction would be to tone down everyconversation, web page, newsgroup, and mailing list on the Internetto the level of what is not offensive to children. Even the Department of Justice, who will have to enforce this law onceit becomes public, says that the indecency standard is "constitutionallyproblematic". (Letter from Andrew Fois of US DOJ to Rep. Howard Berman,12/20/95)CONTENT PROVIDERS, ONLINE SERVICES, AND LIBRARIES CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR EXPRESSION ONLINEAlthough the proposed legislation tries to hold harmless those who simplyfunction as "pipelines" for Internet access, there are many Internetbusinesses who act as more than just access providers.  Hosting discussiongroups, chat rooms, and other additional services, many Internet providersfunction as content providers as well as simple access providers.On top of this, the rest of us who provide content on the net (which includeseveryone who sends mail, posts to Usenet, puts up a WWW page, maintains anftp directory, or a gopher page) will fall under the indecency law, andbe forced to screen our material and "dumb it down" to the level of what isnot offensive to a child.This will include anything having to do with sexual abuse, abortion, or anystrong language."GOOD SAMARITAN" PROVISION REMAINS IN BILLThe original Cox/Wyden/White legislation included a "Good Samaritan"provision which said that a provider who takes some actions to policetheir content cannot be penalized for not taking action in other places.  UNPRECEDENTED CONTROL OVER ONLINE SPEECH FOR THE FCCThe original Cox/Wyden/White bill prohibited FCC jurisdiction over the Internet.  This provision has been removed from the proposed legislation,which now leaves the FCC open to make a case for regulating this newmedium.The Internet has developed from a government project to a market-driveneconomic boom for thousands of businesses.  Giving the FCC authority overthis medium would significantly hinder the growth of this new industry.________________________________________________________________________CHRONOLOGY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACTDec  7, '95     The House half of the Telecomm conference committee                votes the "indecency" standard for online speech into                the Telecomm Deregulation bill.Sep 26, '95     Sen.

Newt Gingrich (R-GA),                Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR).Jun 14, '95     The Senate passes the CDA as attached to the Telecomm                reform bill (S 652) by a vote of 84-16.

Maria Cantwell July 20, 1994 Letter from VP Gore to Rep. Maria Cantwell July 20, 1994The Honorable Maria CantwellHouse of RepresentativesWashington, D.C., 20515Dear Representative Cantwell:I write to express my sincere appreciation for your efforts to move the national debate forward on the issue of information security and export controls. I share your strong conviction for the need to develop a comprehensive policy regarding encryption, incorporating an export policy that does not disadvantage American software companies in world markets while preserving our law enforcement and national security goals. As you know, the Administration disagrees with you on the extent to which existing controls are harming U.S. industry in the short run and the extent to which their immediate relaxation would affect national security. For that reason we have supported a five-month Presidential study. In conducting this study, I want to assure you that the Administration will use the best available resources of the federal government. This will include the active participation of the National Economic Council and the Department of Commerce. In addition, consistent with the Senate-passed language, the first study will be completed within 150 days of passage of the Export Administration Act reauthorization bill, with the second study to be completed within one year after the completion of the first. I want to personally assure you that we will reassess our existing export controls based on the results of these studies. Moreover, all programs with encryption that can be exported today will continue to be exportable. On the other hand, we agree that we need to take action this year to assure that over time American companies are able to include information security features in their programs in order to maintain their admirable international competitiveness. We can achieve this by entering into an new phase of cooperation among government, industry representatives and privacy advocates with a goal of trying to develop a key escrow encryption system that will provide strong encryption, be acceptable to computer users worldwide, and address our national needs as well. Key escrow encryption offers a very effective way to accomplish our national goals, That is why the Administration adopted key escrow encryption in the "Clipper Chip" to provide very secure encryption for telephone communications while preserving the ability for law enforcement and national security. But the Clipper Chip is an approved federal standard for telephone communications and not for computer networks and video networks. For that reason, we are working with industry to investigate other technologies for those applications. The Administration understands the concerns that industry has regarding the Clipper Chip. We welcome the opportunity to work with industry to design a more versatile, less expensive system. Such a key escrow system would be implementable in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof, would not rely upon a classified algorithm, would be voluntary, and would be exportable. While there are many severe challenges to developing such a system, we are committed to a diligent effort with industry and academia to create such a system. We welcome your offer to assist us in furthering this effort. We also want to assure users of key escrow encryption products that they will not be subject to unauthorized electronic surveillance. As we have done with the Clipper Chip, future key escrow systems must contain safeguards to provide for key disclosure only under legal authorization and should have audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the system. Escrow holders should be strictly liable for releasing keys without legal authorization.We also recognize that a new key escrow encryption system must permit the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option. It is also possible that as key escrow encryption technology spreads, companies may established layered escrowing services for their own products. Having a number of escrow agents would give individuals and businesses more choices and flexibility in meeting their needs for secure communications. I assure you the President and I are acutely aware of the need to balance economic an privacy needs with law enforcement and national security. This is not an easy task, but I think that our approach offers the best opportunity to strike an appropriate balance. I am looking forward to working with you and others who share our interest in developing a comprehensive national policy on encryption. I am convinced that our cooperative endeavors will open new creative solutions to this critical problem.Sincerely,Al GoreAG/gcs Return to the CDT Crypto Page Return to the CDT Home PageWT02-B07-3IA095-001027-B017-141http://www.cdt.org:80/ciec/plant_def.html 205.177.10.31 19970215013658 text/html 3711HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:35:30 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html List of Plaintiffs and Defendants UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, INC., 50 East Huron Street, Chicago, IL 60611, on behalf of its members and their patrons, AMERICA ONLINE, INC., 8619 Westwood Center Drive, Vienna, VA 22182, on behalf of itself and its subscribers, AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION, INC., 828 South Broadway, Tarrytown, NY 10591, on behalf of its members, AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS FOUNDATION FOR FREE EXPRESSION, 828 South Broadway, Tarrytown, NY 10591, on behalf of its members, AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS, Post Office Box 4090, Reston, VA 22090, on behalf of its members, APPLE COMPUTER, INC., One Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014, on behalf of itself and its subscribers, ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PUBLISHERS, INC., 1718 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009, on behalf of its members, ASSOCIATION OF PUBLISHERS, EDITORS AND WRITERS, 1736 Franklin Street, 8th Floor, Oakland, CA 94612, on behalf of its members, CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT COALITION, 1634 Eye Street, Suite 1100, Washington, D.C. 20006, on behalf of its members, COMMERCIAL INTERNET EXCHANGE ASSOCIATION, 1039 Sterling Road, Suite 201, Herndon, VA 22070, on behalf of its members, COMPUSERVE INCORPORATED, 5000 Arlington Centre Blvd., Columbus, OH 43220, on behalf of itself and its subscribers, FAMILIES AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP, 2135 Wickes Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80919, on behalf of its members, FREEDOM TO READ FOUNDATION, INC., 50 East Huron Street, Chicago, IL 60611, on behalf of its members, HOTWIRED VENTURES LLC, 520 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, on behalf of itself and its readers, INTERACTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION, 8403 Colesville Road, Silver Spring, MD 20910, on behalf of its members, MICROSOFT CORPORATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, on behalf of itself, MICROSOFT NETWORK, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, on behalf of itself and its subscribers, NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, INC., 3031 Tisch Way, San Jose, CA 95128, on behalf of itself and its subscribers, NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, 1160 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 22091, on behalf of its members, OPNET, INC., 901 Glenbrook Avenue, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010, on behalf of itself and its subscribers, PRODIGY SERVICES COMPANY, a New York General Partnership, 445 Hamilton Avenue, White Plains, NY 10601, on behalf of itself and its subscribers, SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS, Post Office Box 77, Greencastle, IN 46135, on behalf of its members, WIRED VENTURES, LTD., 520 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, on behalf of itself and its readers, Plaintiffs, v.

Sanger, et al v.   Reno, Civ. No. 96-0526 (E.D.N.Y.). Yesterday, a second lawsuit was   filed, raising the same challenge to 1462 along with claims that   several other provisions of the Telecommunications Act are   unconstitutional. American Civil Liberties Union, et al v. Reno, Civ.   No. 96-963 (E.D. Pa,). This letter was relates solely to the claims   regarding 1462, as amended. Plaintiffs in both cases allege that 1462,   as amended, violates the First Amendment insofar as it prohibits the   interstate transmission of certain communications regarding abortion   via common carrier or via an interactive computer service.   This is to inform you that the Department of Justice will not defend   the constitutionality of the abortion-related speech provision of 1462   in those cases, in light of the Department's longstanding policy to   decline to enforce the abortion-related speech prohibitions in 1462   (and in related statutes, i.e., 18 U.S.C. 1461 and 39 U.S.C. 3001)   because they are unconstitutional under the First Amendment.   In 1981, Attorney General Civiletti informed the Speaker of the House   and the President of the Senate that it was the policy of the   Department of Justice to refrain from enforcing similar speech   prohibitions in two cognate statutes--39 U.S.C. 3001 and 18 U.S.C.   1461--with respect to "cases of truthful and non-deceptive documents   containing information on how to obtain a lawful abortion." Letter of   Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti to the Hon. Thomas P. O'Neill,   Jr., at 2 (Jan 13, 1981). According to the Attorney General, there was   "no doubt" that those statutes were unconstitutional as applied to   such speech. Id at 1. The Attorney General left open the possibility   that the two statutes might still be applied to certain   abortion-related commercial speech. Id at 3.   Two years later, the Supreme Court held that 3001 cannot   constitutionally be applied to commercial speech concerning   contraception at least not where the speech in question is truthful   and not misleading. Bolger v. Youngs Drug and Product Corp., 463 U.S.   60 (1983). The holding in Bolger would apply equally with respect to   abortion-related commercial speech. See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S.   809 (1975).   Section 1462 is subject to the same constitutional defect as 1461 and   3001 with respect to its application to abortion-related speech and   information. (1) As a result of the Department's conclusion that   prosecution of abortion-related speech under 1462 and related statutes   would violate the First Amendment, the Department's longstanding   policy has been to decline to enforce those statutes with respect to   that speech. What is more, we are not aware of any reported decision   reflecting a prosecution of abortion-related speech under 1462.   Nothing in the Telecommunications Act provides any reason to alter the   Department of Justice's nonenforcement policy. In his signing   statement yesterday, the President stated:   "I...object to the provision in the Act concerning the transmittal of   abortion-related speech and information. Current law, 18 U.S.C. 1462,   prohibits transmittal of this information by certain means, and the   Act would extend that law to cover transmittal by interactive computer   services. The Department of Justice had advised me of its longstanding   policy that this and related abortion provisions in current law are   unconstitutional and will not be enforced because they violate the   First   Amendment. The Department has reviewed this provision of S. 652 and   advised me that it provides no basis for altering that policy.   Therefore, the Department will continue to decline to enforce that   provision of current law, amended by this legislation, as applied to   abortion-related speech."   The principal function of 1462 is to prohibit the interstate carriage   of "obscene, lewd, lascivious...filthy...[and] indecent" materials.   See 1462(a). The Supreme Court has construed this prohibition to be   limited to materials that meet the test of "obscenity" announced in   Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). (2) Congress's express   purpose in enacting the amendment to 1462 in Telecommunications Act   507 was to "clarify[]" that obscene materials cannot be transmitted   interstate via interactive computer services. (3) In this respect,   1462 and its amendment in 507 are constitutionally unobjectionable,   and the Department will continue to enforce 1462 with respect to the   transmittal of obscenity.   However, 1462 also prohibits the interstate transmission of certain   communications regarding abortion. As amended by 507 of the   Telecommunications Act, 1462 provides, in pertinent part, that is   shall be a felony to   "knowingly use any express company or other common carrier or   interactive computer service..., for carriage in interstate or foreign   commerce (of)...   (c) any...written or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet,   advertisement, or notice of any kind giving information, directly or   indirectly, where, how, or of whom, or by what means any [drug,   medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for   producing abortion] may be obtained or made."   Thus, on its face, 1462 prohibits the use of an interactive computer   service for "carriage in interstate...commerce" of any information   concerning "any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted,   or intended for producing abortion." (4)   It plainly would be unconstitutional to enforce 1462 with respect to   speech or information concerning abortion, because the restriction on   abortion-related speech is impermissibly content based. This   conclusion is confirmed by the judicial and Executive Branch treatment   of similar prohibitions on speech concerning abortion and   contraception, contained in two cognate statutes, 39 U.S.C. 3001 and   18 U.S.C. 1461. Section 3001 provides that abortion- and   contraception-related speech is "nonmailable"; and 1461 makes such   mailings subject to criminal sanctions. In 1972, a district court   declared that 3001 was unconstitutional insofar as it rendered   abortion-related speech "nonmailable." Atlanta Coop. News Project v.   United States Postal Service, 350 F. Supp. 234, 238-39 (N.D. Ga. 1972)   The next year, another district court declared both 3001 and 1461   unconstitutional as applied to noncommercial speech concerning   abortion and contraception. Associated Students for Univ. of   California at Riverside v. Attorney General, 368 F. Supp. 11, 21-24   (C.D. Calif 1973). As the Attorney General later explained to the   Congress, the Solicitor General declined to appeal the decisions in   Atlanta Coop. News Project and Associated Students "on the grounds   that 18 U.S.C. 1461 and 39 U.S.C. 3001(e) were unconstitutionally   indefensible" as applied to abortion-related speech. See Letter of   Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti to the Hon. Thomas P. O'Neill,   Jr., at 2 (Jan 13, 1981). And, as explained above, in 1981 the   Attorney   General informed the Congress that the Department of Justice would   decline to enforce 1461 and 3001 in cases of truthful and   non-deceptive documents containing information on how to obtain a   lawful abortion.   Nothing in recent Supreme Court law respecting the First Amendment has   affected the conclusions reached by the district courts in Atlanta   Copp. News Project and Associated Students, the 1981 opinion of   Attorney General Civiletti, or the Supreme Court's decision in Bolger.   Indeed, the Supreme Court on several recent occasions has strongly   reaffirmed the principle that the First Amendment, subject only to   narrow and well-understood governmental control over the content of   messages expressed by private individuals." Turner Broadcasting   System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S.C. 2445, 2456-59 (1994) (citing R.A.V. v.   City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397   (1989)).   In the Ganger case, Judge Sifton yesterday denied plaintiffs' motions   for a temporary restraining order after the United States Attorney   represented that the Department's policy is to decline to enforce the   pertinent provisions of 1462. Judge Sifton further ruled that a   three-judge court hearing on any dispositive motions will be convened   next month, after briefing. In the ACLU case before Judge Buckwalter,   the Government is due to respond to a motion for a TRO on February 14,   1996. In accordance with the practice of the Department, I am   informing the Congress that in neither case will the Department of   Justice defend the constitutionality of the provision 1462 that   prohibits speech concerning abortion.   Sincerely,   Janet Reno     _________________________________________________________________   (1) The only material difference between 1462 and the cognate   prohibitions in 1461 and 3001 is that 1462 regulates interstate   "carriage" of information by common carrier, rather than dissemination   of the information through the mail. This distinction is not material   to the constitutional issue in this context.   (2) See Hamling v. United States 418 U.S. 87, 114 (1974): United   States v.

Date:  April 29, 1996                           INTRODUCTION          Now that the evidence has been submitted, it is clearthere are remarkably few disagreements regarding the factsmaterial to resolution of plaintiffs' motions for preliminaryrelief.  The essential facts regarding the nature of theInternet, the nature of plaintiffs' speech, and the capabilitiesof various parental control devices to block or filter speechthat might be inappropriate for minors, are largely undisputed.          Based on this record, plaintiffs are entitled topreliminary relief enjoining enforcement of the challengedprovisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 ("CDA" or"Act").[1]  As we argued in our pre-hearing memorandum,[2] and asthe evidence now confirms, the CDA effectively bans an enormousquantity of speech that is constitutionally protected for adults,because the "safe harbor" defenses provided in the Act do notprovide technologically or economically feasible means forplaintiffs, their members and patrons, or for most Internetspeakers, to shield themselves from liability.  Defendants, inresponse, have attempted to avoid consideration of the CDA'sactual impact on plaintiffs' speech, because they cannot justifythat actual impact in view of the long line of Supreme Courtprecedents holding that government is not permitted to reduce theadult population to reading and viewing only what is appropriatefor children.[3]   Yet that is precisely what Congress did here,and that is why the CDA must be enjoined.                        STATEMENT OF FACTS          The facts are set forth in the Combined ProposedFindings of Fact of the ACLU and ALA Plaintiffs (April 29,1996)("Pl. Pro. Find."), submitted herewith.  The "key" proposedfacts can be found at paragraphs 1 through 18.                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT          The evidence shows that the CDA effectively bans abroad range of speech by plaintiffs and their members and patronsthat might be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" forminors but is fully constitutionally protected for adults.  Forsome modes of online communication, e.g., newsgroups, there issimply no way to comply with the Act.  As to other methods ofcommunication, those who wish to make their speech available tothe world, and for free, cannot use the "verified credit card"defense specified in the CDA, and there is no other practical wayfor them to screen out potential listeners who are minors.  Pl.Pro. Find. Part IV.C.1.  Even if they could, the difficulties ofdetermining which material is actually subject to the Act, andsegregating that material, are virtually insurmountable.  Pl.Pro. Find. Part IV.C.1.b.(1), IV.D.  As a result, if they wish toengage in speech potentially covered by the Act, they riskprosecution under the Act, which makes it a felony to useinteractive computer services "to display" "patently offensive"speech "in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age." 47 U.S.C.  223 (d)(1)(B).  As a practical matter, the Act thusforces plaintiffs and their members and patrons to self-censorany non-obscene speech that might be deemed patently offensivefor minors, even though all of that speech is fullyconstitutionally protected for adults.          The evidence also shows that such a ban on "patentlyoffensive" speech between adults is not necessary to protectminors because parental control software, and other user-basedmethods, enable adults to block access to that speech by minors. Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F, IV.F.3.  The Government's expertwitness acknowledged, for example, that PICS technology enablesparents to block access by their children to all Internet speechthat has not been approved for minors by a third-party ratingbureau the parent trusts, without depriving the parent, or anyother adult, of access to that very same speech.  Olsen Test.,Tr. Vol. IV, at 221:19 to 222:24.  The parental control featuresoffered by the major online service providers and by privatesoftware companies also enable parents to block or filter thematerial available to their children, without depriving any adultof access to that same material.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F.2, 3.           The evidence also shows that the CDA will not protectminors from the substantial percentage of indecent or patentlyoffensive speech that is posted abroad, whereas the user-basedmethods plaintiffs advocate would block such speech regardless ofwhere it was posted.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.E.2.c, IV.F. Indeed, the Government's expert candidly volunteered that "wewould have to rely upon SurfWatch or Net Nanny technology forforeign speakers."  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 44:14-16.          In short, the CDA will not be effective in protectingminors from the significant percentage of indecent or patentlyoffensive speech posted abroad, and seeks to protect minors fromindecent or patently offensive speech posted domestically only bybanning that speech between adults as well.  In contrast, theparental control technology the free market has developed withoutgovernmental involvement would be more effective in protectingminors from indecent or patently offensive speech, withoutbanning any of that speech between adults.          Given these realities, defendants have not seriouslyattempted to defend the constitutionality of the CDA as written. Instead, they have labored to craft and urge judicial adoption ofa quite different statute, which bears no resemblance to thestatute Congress enacted, and is actually contrary to the policychoices reflected in the CDA.  Defendants argue, for example,that the CDA was only (or primarily) intended to prohibit speechby commercial entities distributing pornography that lacksserious value.  But those arguments flatly ignore the text of theCDA, its legislative history, and the Supreme Court precedent onwhich Congress expressly relied.            When all is said and done, the Court is confronted witha hastily drafted statute (the key provision of which -- "displayin a manner available" -- was added, without hearings, by theConference Committee) that fails to take account of the uniquenature of the Internet, and obviously sweeps far more broadlythan the First Amendment permits.  Defendants offer no plausibleconstruction that would narrow the statute's sweep in adefinitive and constitutionally permissible way.  Instead, theyessentially invite this Court to decide what can be doneconstitutionally and what should be done, as a policy matter, andthen to rewrite the statute accordingly.  The appropriateresponse, however, is to strike this statute down and giveCongress the opportunity to make those policy choices itself.          Even if the CDA could withstand the strict FirstAmendment scrutiny to which it must be subjected -- and it cannot-- the challenged provisions would have to be struck down becausethey are fatally vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Speakers cannot be forced to guess what constitutes prohibitedspeech and what actions they must take to afford themselves ofthe CDA's defenses.  But this is precisely the position in whichplaintiffs, their members and patrons find themselves.  Theevidence produced by defendants has only exacerbated theambiguity inherent in the CDA's use of the "indecency" and"patently offensive" standards, and its nebulous "good faith"defense.  The Fifth Amendment does not permit defendants to forcespeakers to rely upon the good intentions of prosecutors in orderto avoid criminal liability for engaging in constitutionallyprotected speech.                             ARGUMENTI.   THE CDA VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT EFFECTIVELY     BANS A SUBSTANTIAL CATEGORY OF PROTECTED SPEECH FROM MOST     PARTS OF THE INTERNET.          The CDA effectively bans a broad but vaguely definedcategory of protected speech from most parts of the Internet. Defendants have not demonstrated that this abridgment of theFirst Amendment rights of speakers and their audiences directlyand materially serves any compelling governmental interest in theleast restrictive way.  Nor has the Government shown that theAct's burdens on the rights of adults are outweighed by itsbenefits to minors.  The Act is therefore plainlyunconstitutional.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 25-42.     A.   The Government Has Failed To Prove There Is Any          Practical Way For Most Speakers To Transmit Speech That          Is Potentially Covered By The Act.          The key provision of the CDA challenged here, 47 U.S.C. 223(d)(1)(B), makes it a felony to use an "interactive computerservice to display in a manner available to . . . person[s] under18 years of age" any communication that "in context, depicts ordescribes, in terms patently offensive as measured bycontemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activitiesor organs."[4]  Defendants have never contended that thisprovision, standing alone, would be constitutional.  That is notsurprising, because subsection (d), by itself, would effectivelyeliminate constitutionally protected but "patently offensive"speech from the Internet.  With the possible exception of privatee-mail to a known recipient, no method of communicating over theInternet can be used with assurance that the message will not be"available" to persons under age 18.  Pl. Pro. Find. PartIV.C.1.a.            Instead, defendants' case hinges on the propositionthat the Act, taken as a whole, does not ban constitutionallyprotected speech between adults -- i.e., that the defenses setforth in section 223(e) make it feasible for would-be speakers touse the Internet to transmit "patently offensive" speech toadults.[5]  The key question, therefore, is whether the subsection(e) defenses eliminate the otherwise unconstitutional sweep ofsubsection (d).  In other words, it is undisputed that subsection(d), by itself, is not a narrowly tailored law.  The Governmentargues that subsection (e) narrows the sweep of subsection (d)sufficiently that the Act as a whole becomes constitutional.  Butthe Government has utterly failed to meet its burden of provingthat the subsection (e) defenses are in fact available to most Internet speakers.[6]  For that reason, the Government's defenseof the Act fails.       1.   Screening using credit cards and access codes is          impossible for many speakers and is not a practical          option for most other speakers.               Section 223(e)(5)(B) provides a defense to convictionfor speakers who can screen prospective recipients "by requiringuse of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code,or adult personal identification number."  All the parties'experts agreed, however, that this defense is not available forseveral important modes of online communication.  Scott Bradnertestified that a speaker posting to a newsgroup, mail exploder(e.g., listserv or Majordomo), or IRC chat channel (the mostpredominant form of Internet "real time" chat) has no controlover who receives the communication and, in normal usage, doesnot even know who the recipients will be.[7]  Accordingly, Bradnertestified that credit card and adult access code screening istechnologically infeasible for these modes of communication; itis impossible for the speaker to screen recipients to ensure theyare over 17 years of age.[8]  Dan Olsen, the Government's expertagreed.[9]  Thus, it is undisputed that requiring such screeningfor any messages that might be "indecent" or "patently offensive"for a minor would have the effect of banning such messages fromthese types of online communication.  Pl. Pro. Find. Part IV.B.          Even as to other modes of communication, including theWorld Wide Web, where the defense is arguably technologicallyfeasible, defendants implicitly concede that this screeningmethod is only practicable for speakers who operate "'commercial'adult sites that can take credit cards or devise access codes." US ALA Resp. at 17 (emphasis added).  For everyone elseattempting to communicate over the Internet -- includingindividuals or entities who have non-commercial Web sites and, ingeneral, all those who seek to communicate in cyberspace forreasons other than profit -- screening based on credit cards oraccess codes is a practical impossibility.  Pl. Pro. Find. PartIV.C.1.b.            This conclusion was confirmed by several trialwitnesses.  Scott Bradner testified, and defendants did notdispute, that effective online screening of recipients is notcurrently possible.  Bradner Test. Decl.  71.  Verification canbe accomplished only "offline."  However, the cost is sosubstantial that offline verification is practical only for acommercial entity that is charging for access to itscommunications.  Id.; Pl. Pro. Find. Part IV.C.1.b.2.  Indeed,credit card services do not presently verify non-commercialonline transactions.  Anker Test. Decl.  21; Croneberger Test.Decl.  27; Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 197:19-23, 198:6-9; Pl.Pro. Find. Part IV.C.1.b.2.          Thus, most World Wide Web speakers are left with theoption of adult access code screening.  But the administrativeburden of creating and maintaining the screening system, and theongoing costs for verification services, put this method beyondthe reach of most speakers.  Bradner Test. Decl.  71; AnkerTest. Decl.  13 (estimated cost of developing HotWired's memberregistration and recognition system, which is not able to screenfor age, is at least $40,000, with ongoing maintenance costs of$400 to $1000 a week).  Anker testified that the expense ofthird-party adult access code verification would threaten thefinancial viability even of a popular and well-established Website like HotWired.  Anker Test. Decl.  22-23 (estimating costsof age verification for its current 300,000 subscribers at$600,000, plus $2 for each new subscriber and $0.29 for everyindividual access to the site).  Croneberger testified that itwould require 65 additional staff members to pre-register andmaintain data files just for the county population that hasphysical access to The Carnegie Library, at an annual cost of$845,000.  Croneberger Test. Decl.  29.  Since the library's Website is available to anyone in the world, the library would needto maintain a 24-hour staff to adequately serve all users of itssite, at significant additional costs.  Id.  30.  Indeed,Croneberger indicated that the library's new state-of-the-arttechnology system, which cost $10 million, simply could nothandle the registration of all the individuals whom they knowvisit their site.  Id.  37.          HotWired's experience with a voluntary, unverifiedregistration system also shows that user resistance toregistration and verification requirements would substantiallyreduce the number of subscribers to an online publication,reducing in turn its value to advertisers.  Anker Test. Decl. 16; Anker Test., Tr. Vol. III, at 109:13 to 110:7.          Finally, a registration requirement would destroy aprincipal advantage of the Internet as a medium of communication: the ability of Internet users to research and communicateseamlessly and without interruption across its vast variety ofavailable resources.[10]          In any event, even if speakers such as HotWired or theCarnegie Library could use credit cards or access codes to screenrecipients of their speech, they would still face the moregeneral problem of deciding which speech falls within the scopeof subsection (d) and thus may only be displayed to a pre-screened audience of adults.  At the hearing, the testimony ofthe Government's own witnesses reflected the difficulty ofdeciding which speech is covered and which is not.  See Point IIinfra (demonstrating that this vagueness renders the Actunconstitutional in every application).            And even if speakers could determine which material iscovered by the Act, the burden of reviewing existing and futurematerial and categorizing it as either restricted or unrestrictedwould be overwhelming for any speaker who engages in asignificant amount of online speech, and insurmountable for manyof those speakers.  Croneberger testified, for example, that itwould cost $30,000 just to purchase or create software that couldsearch Carnegie Library's online materials for "key words" thatcould indicate material that might be deemed "indecent" or"patently offensive."  Croneberger Test. Decl.  31.  And, as theGovernment's expert agreed, such key word searches could notensure that all covered material was located; that task wouldrequire human review and judgment.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at35:24 to 36:19, 40:7-20.[11]  Croneberger estimated that it wouldrequire 180 staff members, at a cost of $3 million, to review theover 2 million items in the library's catalog.  Croneberger Test.Decl.  32.  And it would cost an additional $100,000 annually toreview the online information concerning the thousands of titlesthe library adds to its collection.  Id.  33.  Monitoring andreviewing the magazines and abstracts the library provides onlinewould cost an additional $625,000 annually.  Id.  35. Croneberger testified that there simply is no way for the libraryto allocate or raise these funds.  Id.  42.  If the cost is"economically infeasible for the Carnegie Library," asCroneberger testified, "the costs simply could not be borne bysmaller libraries with smaller budgets."  Id.  44.          2.   The Government has not demonstrated that there is               any other defense available to online speakers.          The only other defense for a content provider is setforth in section 223(e)(5)(A), which applies where a contentprovider "has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, andappropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict orprevent access by minors."[12]  Nothing in the statutory text orlegislative history lends meaning to this defense.  TheGovernment has identified no method by which a speaker can complywith subsection (e)(5)(A).  The most the Government has beenwilling to say, through the testimony of its expert witness, DanOlsen, is that some sort of "speaker tagging" system mightconstitute a safe-harbor defense at some point in the future. But it has pointedly refused to specify that speaker tagging willconstitute a defense, either now or in the future.[13]          That refusal is not surprising, because speaker taggingplainly is not a defense today, and, even down the road, speakertagging alone could not be viewed as a "reasonable, effective,and appropriate action" that would prevent the tagged speech frombeing "available" to minors.  For these reasons, the Government'stagging evidence is irrelevant, and does not rebut plaintiffs'showing that the CDA effectively bans covered speech on theInternet by all speakers who are unable to use the subsection(e)(5)(B) credit card or adult access code defense.             At the hearing, the Government's expert testified thatdifferent types of communications -- from Web sites to e-mail --could be labelled with the expression "-L18" if they containspeech covered by the Act.  But his testimony did not explain howsuch tagging could constitute a defense.  Tagging alone couldnever be a defense.  Indeed, Olsen acknowledged that a speaker'smere act of tagging or labeling expression -- with "-L18," or"xxx," or anything else -- does not restrict or prevent minorsfrom gaining access.  Olsen Testimony, Tr. Vol IV, at 211:8-11,234:19-25.[14]  Tagging could not even arguably constitute adefense under the Act unless it is effective in making the taggedcommunication unavailable to minors, and the Government's expertacknowledged that tagging cannot be effective without cooperativefiltering software on the receiving end.  Olsen Test., Tr. VolIV, at 209:25 to 210:6.  Since the Government's expertacknowledges that tagging will be ineffective without the"cooperation of entities down the communication pipeline," OlsenTest., Tr. Vol. 5, at 42:10-14, speakers surely cannot rely ontagging as a safe harbor defense unless and until those entitiescooperate.  And they are not required to cooperate.  To thecontrary, as Olsen acknowledged, "Congress made a considereddecision to impose no requirements on entities down thecommunications chain."  Id. at 43:1-4; see id. at 42:15-18; Conf.Rep. at 190 (no liability on access providers).          It is undisputed that, today, the necessary cooperationdoes not exist.  At present, there is not even commonunderstanding of what "tag" should be used to denominate indecentor patently offensive material, and in most computers there is nosoftware in place that is configured to read tags that indicate aparticular communication is for adults only.  Olsen Test., Tr.Vol. V, at 91:1-2; Bradner Test. Decl.  79.  Accordingly,speaker tagging cannot possibly be a safe-harbor defense today.          Moreover, even if, in the future, there is commonagreement on what tags to use, and most computers have softwarethat is capable of recognizing those tags, the plain terms of theAct would still preclude any potential speaker from relying withconfidence on speaker tagging as a defense.  Some "tagged"communications would still be "available" to minors, since it iscertain that some minors will have access to computers that donot have the screening software installed, and turned on.  SeeOlsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 17:14-22, 43:12-20 (acknowledgingthat not all Web browsers would be configured to read tags). Accordingly, speakers would still have to guess whether theirtagging would constitute a "reasonable, effective, andappropriate action[]" to prevent access by minors, within themeaning of subsection (e)(5)(A), and will be forced to self-censor based on well-grounded fears of prosecution.          Nor can the Court solve this problem by construing thestatute to mean that a speaker's tagging of indecent speech willbe a complete defense.  It would be strange indeed for a court toadopt a construction the Government steadfastly refuses to urge,and Congress could have stated expressly if that was what itwanted.  More importantly, such a construction would not save theAct, for several independent reasons.          First, for the reasons just stated, the Act cannot beconstrued as providing a speaker tagging defense today, becausethe necessary common understandings and software are not inplace.[15]  Second, a judicially recognized tagging defense wouldnot deal with the vagueness of subsection (d).  Speakers wouldstill be at a loss to know precisely when their speech crossesthe line and must be tagged.  Third, they would also face theburden, insurmountable for many speakers, of segregatingregulated from unregulated speech -- even assuming the linebetween the two could be discerned.  See Pl. Pro. Find. PartIV.C.1.b.(1).          In any event, a construction of the Act to the effectthat non-commercial speakers can engage in protected but"patently offensive" speech only by self-labeling that speechwould raise additional First Amendment problems.  Any de jure orde facto requirement that speakers label their own protectedspeech "patently offensive" would amount to a pernicious form ofgovernmentally compelled speech.  The Government generally cannotcompel citizens to speak, particularly if the speaker iscompelled to attach a pejorative label the speaker does notbelieve is warranted.  See Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs inSupport of Their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction ("ACLU Post-Trial Br.") at 54-58.  Cf. Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 483(1987) (upholding mandatory labelling scheme in part on groundthat label in question was not "pejorative").  See, e.g., Rileyv. National Federation of the Blind, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 797-800(1988) (striking down under compelled speech doctrine requirementthat professional fundraisers disclose to potential donorsproportion of proceeds actually passed through to charity; notingthat compelled disclosure, whether of fact or opinion, "burdensprotected speech"); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 715 (1977)(law requiring individuals to display patriotic message onlicense plates violated the First Amendment "right of individualsto hold a point of view different from the majority").  Suchcompelled speech is particularly unwarranted here, where the freemarket has developed a technology -- PICS -- that does notrequire speakers to label their speech, because their speech canbe rated by private third parties selected by parents.[16]            In any event, the CDA does not lend itself to aconstruction that it merely requires speaker tagging.  Althoughcourts can construe statutes to avoid or eliminate constitutionaldefects, the statute must be "readily susceptible" to a narrowingconstruction.  See Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484U.S. 383, 397 (1988); Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205,216 n.15 (1975).  The Supreme Court recently rejected aninvitation to "redraft" a statute to preserve possibly legitimateapplications.  See United States v. National Treasury EmployeesUnion, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1019 (1995)("NTEU").  That task, theCourt concluded, would involve complex policy judgments and mightraise distinct constitutional concerns, and was therefore"properly left to Congress."  Id.            If this Court were to attempt to rewrite the CDA as atagging law, it would have to make several quintessentiallylegislative judgments.  It would be required, for example, todetermine empirically when the availability and use of blockingsoftware was sufficiently widespread to justify the conclusionthat speaker tagging would effectively make the tagged speechunavailable to minors.[17]  And it would also have to determinewhat kind of tagging would qualify for the defense.  These arenot matters a court should be resolving in the guise ofinterpreting the general language of the CDA.  If Congress wantsto require, or approve as sufficient, tagging of a category ofprotected speech, it should say so specifically -- rather thanpassing a law that forces speakers to guess whether tagging wouldbe a "reasonable, effective, and appropriate" means of makingspeech unavailable to minors, or forces courts to legislate allthe critical details.           Thus, the Government's effort to defend the CDA bypointing to the mere possibility that speaker tagging "might"provide a defense is wholly unpersuasive.  It follows that theAct does operate -- today and for the foreseeable future -- as aban on a category of protected speech for most speakers.         B.   The Impact Of This Ban On Protected Speech Is Enormous.          Contrary to the Government's claims, the effects of theAct will extend far beyond "commercial" purveyors of"pornography."  See generally ALA P.I. Mem. at 10-16.  Unlike thedial-a-porn restrictions upon which the CDA is purportedlymodeled, the CDA is not expressly limited to commercial speakers-- those who charge listeners a fee to obtain their speech.[18] To the contrary, the Conference Report confirms that Congressintended "content regulation of both commercial and non-commercial providers."[19]          The Act also plainly applies to a far wider range ofspeech than "pornography."  It is expressly made applicable to"libraries and educational institutions."  47 U.S.C.  230(e)(2). As the evidence demonstrated, libraries are unlikely to carry (orpost online) even the illustrations from Playboy magazine, letalone the hard-core material the Government claims is theprincipal target of the Act.  See Croneberger Test., Tr. Vol. II,at 105:21 to 106:5, 108:14-19.           The breadth of the expression covered by the Act isapparent from the actual standard Congress chose to use insubsection (d).  The "patently offensive" standard is a term ofart, coined by the FCC in its regulation of broadcast "indecency"and discussed by the Supreme Court in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,438 U.S. 726 (1978).  Conf. Rep. at 188-89.[20]  ThisPacifica/patent offensiveness standard bars broadcast of a greatdeal of expression that by no stretch of the imagination wouldconstitute pornography.  For example, the FCC has suggested anindirect "rule of thumb" that R-rated movies are indecent.[21] And Pacifica itself involved crude language, not pornography.           Significantly, the "patently offensive" standard isalso broad enough to include not only graphic "depictions" buttextual "descriptions" of sexual or excretory activities.  Theinclusion of written text vastly expands the potential scope ofsubsection (d), and shows that Congress was interested in morethan conventional "pornography."  Indeed, Pacifica itselfinvolved only words, not images.  Under this standard, it isreasonable for speakers to fear that any communication containingsome or all of the "seven dirty words" that is "available" tominors on the Internet now constitutes a felony.[22]  And thedanger is just as great that a combination of seemingly innocuouswords will be deemed "patently offensive" "in context."  SeeOlsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 36:20 to 37:2 (acknowledging thatcombinations of words may render otherwise innocuous text"offensive").          Nothing in the "patently offensive" standard preventsits application to works with serious value.  The broad purposeof that standard when first adopted was to prohibit images ordescriptions of sexual or excretory activities or organs thatmight be deemed inappropriate for children in over-the-airbroadcasts, even if they had serious value.  Acknowledging thatbroad purpose, the FCC has ruled, in the broadcast context, thatmaterial may be found patently offensive even where theinformation is presented "in the news" and is presented "in aserious, newsworthy manner."  Letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCCRcd. 3689 (1990)(citation omitted).  It has expressly declined tohold that "if a work has merit, it is per se not indecent." Id.[23]  Moreover, that standard does not require consideration ofthe material as a whole.[24]  By adopting that standard, Congresshas now decreed it is a felony to offer comparable forms ofexpression on the Internet.          Not surprisingly, plaintiffs' trial witnesses expressedserious concern that the Act could be applied to criminalizetheir online posting of textual materials containing the sevendirty words or discussing sexual matters.  Croneberger Test.Decl.  16-18, 21-22; Anker Test. Decl.  4, 5, 8.  TheGovernment's witnesses confirmed the validity of those fears.    Howard Schmidt (who according to the Government was called todemonstrate that images subject to the Act could be accessed onthe Internet) utilized several images containing nothing morethan partial or total nudity.[25]  Schmidt testified that, in someparts of the country, the publisher of Vanity Fair would havepotential liability under the Act for posting online a coverpicture of a naked Demi Moore (even though the print publicationof that image was entirely lawful).  See Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol.IV, at 138:23 to 139:14.  Dan Olsen, in turn, acknowledged thatany use of "dirty words" might be covered -- stating that eachsuch use should be tagged just to be sure.  Olsen Test., Tr. VolV, at 53:16 to 54:10.  He added that if he were the relevant"community," a Playboy centerfold would be deemed indecent andpatently offensive.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 235:9 to236:14.          As with "tagging," the Government appears to beinviting this Court to rewrite the CDA to regulate only"pornography" that lacks serious value.  But that would requirethe Court to perform radical surgery on the statutory language,and would be contrary to the evident intent of Congress.[26] Courts have no "license to rewrite a statutory scheme and `createdistinctions where none were intended.'"  Consumer Party v.Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 146-47 (3d Cir. 1985) (quoting AmericanTobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 71 n.6 (1982)).[27] Moreover, such a judicial rewrite would not solve theconstitutional problem.  What the Government calls non-obscene"pornography" is just as constitutionally protected as otherforms of speech.  Congress's effective ban of a broad and vaguelydefined category of protected speech from most of the Internetcannot suddenly be made constitutional by narrowing its impact toa smaller category of equally protected speech.       C.   The CDA's Restrictions On "Patently Offensive"          Expression Fail The Strict Scrutiny Test.          The Government does not dispute that the CDA'sprohibition of "patently offensive" expression is a content-basedrestriction on speech.  It therefore triggers strict scrutiny. The Government must demonstrate that the CDA "directly andmaterially" serves a compelling governmental interest in the"least restrictive" way.  Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492U.S. 115, 126 (1989); Fabulous Assocs. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util.Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 784-85 (3d Cir. 1990); see TurnerBroadcasting System v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2470 (1994); ALAP.I. Mem. at 34-35.  The Government cannot meet that standard.           1.   The Government has failed to prove that the CDA               directly and materially advances a compelling               interest in protecting minors.          In the abstract, the Government has a compellinginterest in shielding some minors from at least some forms of"patently offensive" speech.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  But theCDA's effective ban of such speech from most of the Internet, farfrom advancing that interest "in a direct and material way,"Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2470, "provides only the most limitedincremental support for the interest asserted."  Bolger v. YoungsDrug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983).[28]          It is critical to focus on exactly what is at stakehere:  expression that falls within the statutory definition ofsubsection (d) but is not obscene or otherwise unprotected foradults.  All obscene expression and all child pornography isproperly banned under existing law because it lacks FirstAmendment protection even for adults.  To justify the restrictionon "patently offensive" expression at issue here, therefore, theGovernment must prove that extending the statutory prohibition toconstitutionally protected, non-obscene expression advances itsinterests in a direct and material way.[29]          Moreover, the Government cannot ignore the facts aboutexisting protections for minors that have been developed as aresult of market forces without governmental coercion.  Asplaintiffs have demonstrated, there is a rapidly growing marketfor user-based technologies that already provide a great deal ofprotection.  For over a year, readily available software, such asCyber Patrol, SurfWatch, CYBERsitter, and Net Nanny, has enabledparents and other adults to limit the access of children tomaterial on the Internet.[30]  Stip.  54; Pl. Pro. Find. PartIII.F.3.          These products place "responsibility for making suchchoices . . . where our society has traditionally placed it -- onthe shoulders of the parent."  Fabulous Assocs., 896 F.2d at 788. They are easy to install and use,[31] and have a variety offeatures.  And, if parents so choose, they can use the softwareto block access to all parts of the Internet that mightpotentially be deemed inappropriate for children.          Cyber Patrol, for example, is designed to enableparents to block access to online material in any or all of 12CyberNOT categories (including sexual content) with one simplestep.  Stip.  57.  In addition, parents can use Cyber Patrol toprevent access to particular sites they deem inappropriate fortheir children.  Burrington Test. Decl.  26.  See Pl. Pro. Find. 806.

The parental control optionsavailable to online service subscribers are steadily increasingin number and sophistication.  See generally Burrington Test.Decl.  13, 29;  see Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F.2.          The question, therefore, is whether the CDA'simposition of speaker-focused controls will add significantlygreater protection.  It clearly will not.  First, even assuming(as we have argued) that the Act operates to ban "patentlyoffensive" expression, it will have an impact only on domesticspeakers.  It will have little or no impact on the verysignificant percentage of sexually explicit material availableover the Internet that is posted abroad.  See Hoffman Test., Tr.Vol. II, at 68:1 to 69:14; Duvall Test. Decl.  41; Duvall Test.,Tr. Vol. I, at 161:17 to 162:18.  See also Schmidt Test., Tr.Vol. IV, at 68:1-4 (agreeing that a number of sites he accessedoriginated abroad).  That is because foreign content providers --certainly as a practical matter and possibly as a legal matter --are beyond the reach of United States prosecutors.[33]          For that reason, even the complete elimination of alldomestically posted sexually explicit material would make nodifference in the ability of a minor -- using a computer withoutfunctioning parental control software -- to gain access topotentially inappropriate material.  A simple computer search forsexually explicit material will list both domestic and foreignsites.  Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 124:21-25.  Even if thetotal number of sites were reduced by 60-70 percent (theapproximate percentage of sexually explicit sites currentlyposted in this country), there would still be ample "patentlyoffensive" expression available for any minor who is looking forit.[34]  Pl. Pro. Find.  1166-67.  This undisputed factundercuts any effort to protect minors through controllingspeakers on the Internet.           The Government, as we have noted, disavows anyintention to ban patently offensive speech, and does not agreethat the CDA will, in the long run, operate as a ban on suchspeech.  But if that is true, the argument that the statuteadvances a legitimate governmental interest unravels entirely. The Government's expert acknowledged that protecting minors fromindecent or patently offensive speech, while continuing to makethat speech available to adults, can be accomplished only throughthe cooperation of entities other than the speaker, and thoseentities will have to utilize screening software.  Olsen Test.,Tr. Vol. V, at 42:10-14.  Olsen acknowledged that tagging byspeakers is just a method to facilitate screening by the end-user.  Accordingly, tagging will not protect minors unlessparents or guardians exercise responsibility by using softwarethat responds to tags.          Yet with the advent of PICS technology, the Governmenthas made no showing that there is any advantage to requiringspeakers to tag their own speech -- as opposed to relying onthird parties to provide this service to parents.[35]  And PICSwould be more effective at dealing with the problem of foreignspeakers, because the software could screen out all speech thathas not been affirmatively identified as appropriate forchildren.[36]  Thus, under any reading of the CDA, the statute isa remarkably ineffective means of advancing the Government'sasserted interest in  protecting minors from "patently offensive"speech, in a direct and material way.          2.   The CDA is not the least restrictive means of               advancing the Government's interests.          The evidentiary record also confirms plaintiffs'argument that the CDA is not the least restrictive means ofadvancing the Government's asserted interest.  See ALA P.I. Mem.at 34-42; Pltfs Joint BOP Mem. at 6-11.[37]           As just noted, for example, the private market hasalready developed methods -- such as user blocking software andPICS -- that are far more effective than the CDA at restrictingminors' access to potentially inappropriate material.  Instead ofimposing the CDA's sweeping prohibition on speech, Congress couldsimply have allowed these private markets to develop, andintervened only if (contrary to current indications) thesemethods did not work in specific areas.  See Turner, 114 S. Ct.at 2470-72.  Congress could also have furthered these market-driven developments by educating parents and schooladministrators about the Internet and available screening options(compare 47 U.S.C.  551(a)(9)), by assisting parents or schoolsin acquiring screening technologies and information, or bysupporting additional research and development.  Indeed, hadCongress undertaken any meaningful inquiry into the nature ofcommunication on the Internet, it might have developed stillother, less restrictive means of protecting minors.             The Government's arguments in this case suggest otherless drastic alternatives Congress could have considered.  If, asthe Government contends, the CDA was principally aimed at"commercial providers of on-line pornography" (see US ALA Resp.at 3, 11, 17), Congress could have passed a statute aimedspecifically at that activity.  Cf. Zauderer v. Office ofDisciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. 626, 645-46 (1985) (government maynot enact a broad prophylactic rule "simply to spare itself thetrouble" of distinguishing speech that is the subject oflegitimate regulatory concern from speech that is not).[38]          3.   Even if the CDA directly advanced a compelling               Governmental interest, it would still violate the               First Amendment.               The Government does not argue that it canconstitutionally ban "patently offensive" expression betweenadults in order to prevent minors from gaining access to thatexpression, and any such argument would be foreclosed bygoverning Supreme Court precedent.  The First Amendment rights ofadults would have to be protected, even if the statute were theonly way to advance the Government's interest in protectingminors (and it is not).          The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear thatgovernment may not suppress indecent speech altogether in orderto advance its interest in protecting children.  To the contrary,"government may not `reduce the adult population . . . to . . .only what is fit for children.'"[39]  "The level of discoursereaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which wouldbe suitable for a sandbox," and this is so "regardless of thestrength of the government's interest" in protecting children. Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74-75 (emphasis added).  Government may notconstitutionally "quarantin[e] the general reading public againstbooks not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shieldjuvenile innocence . . . .  Surely this is to burn the house toroast the pig."  Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957). In Sable, the Court cited Butler to "reiterate" that point, andstressed that a federal statute is unconstitutional if it has the"effect of limiting the content of adult [communications] to thatwhich is suitable for children . . . ."  492 U.S. at 131.[40]          No court has ever held, in the context of any medium,that a ban on the transmission of indecent communications toadults satisfies this exacting standard.  This Court should notendorse such an unprecedented intrusion on First Amendmentrights.  Instead, it should recognize that the infringement ofFirst Amendment rights imposed by the Act far outweighs anyincremental advancement of the Government's legitimate interest. See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 363 (1976)("the benefit gainedmust outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights");Sable, 492 U.S. at 131; id. at 133 (Scalia, J., concurring);Fabulous Assocs., 896 F.2d at 787-88.  As in Bolger, "arestriction of this scope is more extensive than the Constitutionpermits."  463 U.S. at 73.          4.   Strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of               review.           The Government's prehearing memorandum devotes 25 pagesto strict scrutiny and then appends a half-hearted argument thatan "intermediate scrutiny" standard, drawn from FCC v. PacificaFoundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), might apply instead. Ultimately, however, the Government does not appear to be askingthe Court to apply any standard other than strict scrutiny atthis stage of the case.  See U.S. ALA Br. at 25-26.          If the Court nevertheless considers this issue, itshould reject defendants' Pacifica argument.  See ALA P.I. Mem.at 51-57.  The intermediate standard of review in broadcastingcases originated in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S.367 (1969).  Its primary rationale is spectrum scarcity.  Because"there are more would-be broadcasters than frequenciesavailable," the Supreme Court has allowed the Government "toplace limited content restraints, and impose certain affirmativeobligations, on broadcast licensees."  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at2456-57.  It was this unique treatment of broadcasters thatformed the basis of the Court's ruling in Pacifica.  438 U.S. at748.          The Court has since refused to extend the intermediate-scrutiny standard beyond broadcasting to cable television,Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2457, or to dial-a-porn services, Sable,492 U.S. at 127-28.  There is no reason to believe it wouldarrive at a different conclusion with respect to the Internet,where there are no limitations on the number of speakers. Indeed, the Internet's characteristics are the antithesis of the"scarcity" that underlies the Red Lion standard.  See Pl. Pro.Find. Part III.A.9.c.          Defendants contend that in Pacifica, the Court focusednot so much on scarcity as on broadcasting's "pervasiveness" andunique accessibility to children.  438 U.S. at 748-49.  Theysuggest that these characteristics are shared by the Internet. But Pacifica did not hold that the First Amendment can berelaxed, in any medium, whenever those two characteristics arepresent.  To the contrary, before mentioning thosecharacteristics, the Court made specific reference to Red Lion,with its scarcity rationale, as the leading case establishing auniquely lower First Amendment standard for broadcasting.          In any event, the Internet is not at all likebroadcasting, and is neither pervasive nor uniquely available tochildren.  The Court's central concern in Pacifica was the factthat broadcasts of "indecent" programming are likely to be turnedon accidentally, by unwilling adults and children alike.  See id.By contrast, as the evidence here showed, users seeking sexuallyexplicit material over the Internet must affirmatively seek itout.  See Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 103:7-12 ("odds areslim" that an online user would "come across a sexually explicitsite by accident").  See Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.E.2.d.  Beforechildren will confront such materials on the Internet, they mustbe able to perform tasks far more complex than turning on atelevision or radio.[41]            Thus, strict scrutiny applies here.II.  THE CDA IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE.          The Act also is unconstitutionally vague, in violationof the First and Fifth Amendments.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 62-78. The evidence at the hearing powerfully confirmed thisconclusion.[42]          The Act does not begin to supply the "definiteness,"Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983), the Constitutionrequires of criminal laws that regulate expression. See generallySmith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974); Bouie v. City of Columbia,378 U.S. 347 (1964).  It is exceptionally indefinite in twofundamental respects.  First, the key statutory terms "indecent"and "patently offensive," nowhere defined in the Act, arehopelessly amorphous, and nothing in the text of the Actclarifies their meaning.  To the contrary, the fact that the twooperative paragraphs of the Act use different terms wouldnaturally lead speakers to believe they have different meanings,and thus to wonder what those different meanings might be.[43] The ambiguity of these key operative terms is compounded by theAct's use of the entirely subjective concepts of "context" and"community standards."  ALA P.I. Mem. at 64-75.  Second, thestatutory defenses -- defenses the Government has effectivelyconceded must be truly practicable if the Act is to surviveconstitutional scrutiny -- are themselves extraordinarily vague. For non-commercial speakers, subsection (e)(5)(A) provides theonly possible defense, but those speakers are given no meaningfulguidance whatsoever -- either by the text of that subsection orby the Government's statements in this litigation -- regardingconcrete steps they can take to assure they qualify for thedefense.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 75-78.             Although the Government has been unwilling to specifythe CDA's exact scope, what little the Government has saidunderscores the Act's vagueness.  It has suggested, for example,that the Act's principal (though not exclusive) target is"pornographic materials."  US ALA Resp. at 11.  This term isitself fatally indefinite, drawn as it is from colloquial usagerather than any recognized legal source.  Moreover, even if"pornography" were further defined as images of sexually explicitconduct, the Government's suggestion is contradicted by the Act'sunquestioned applicability to textual as well as graphiccommunications, by Congress's specific rejection of a "harmful tominors" standard and its "prurient interest" element, and by theGovernment's own position that the "patent offensiveness"language is based on the FCC standard applied in Pacifica, a casethat did not involve "pornography."  See Point I.B. supra.  Andeven if the Government were correct that Congress's principaltarget was "pornography," that would not remedy the Act's failureto make clear what other speech is covered by the moreencompassing statutory language Congress actually used.          The Government has placed great weight on the statutoryterm "context" as a way to limit the scope of subsection (d) andto exempt from its prohibitions speech that has serious value. See US ALA Resp. at 10; US ACLU Resp. at 46-49.  In a civilenforcement regime administered by an administrative agency withexpertise regulating a particular medium, see, e.g., Pacifica,regulations or rulings regarding "context" could conceivably,over time, develop some guidelines.[44]  But as a standard forcriminal liability to be applied by hundreds of prosecutors andjudged by diverse communities across the country, "context" is anopen invitation to arbitrary enforcement.  Because speech on theInternet is communicated throughout the nation (and the world),speakers will have to decide whether to speak based on how themost aggressive prosecutor in the most censorious community mayview the "context" of their speech.[45]  The Act thus embodies theworst evil of vague criminal prohibitions on speech: individualswill "steer far wider of the unlawful zone," Speiser v. Randall,357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958), than if the boundaries were "clearlymarked," Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372 (1964).          The Government has pointedly declined to explain whatit understands "context" to mean.[46]  Moreover, when questionedby the Court, the Government's own witness (an expert on computercrime) demonstrated in the most compelling terms the totalindeterminacy of "context" as a limiting principle.  HowardSchmidt explained that in his opinion depictions of Indiansculptures of couples engaged in explicit sexual conduct wouldnot be proscribed because such communications would have an"educational" or "cultural" context, whereas a far less explicitnude photograph on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine would beproscribed because its context indicated it was "for fun morethan anything else."[47]  If, as the Government contends,particularized inquiry into a communication's "context" isnecessary to determine what is lawful and what is not, then theCDA starkly epitomizes the very perils of discriminatory,capricious, unpredictable enforcement the void-for-vaguenessdoctrine is designed to avoid.[48]          The evidence at the hearing also made clear that theAct's defenses are unconstitutionally vague.  The Government haseffectively conceded that most speakers (including allnoncommercial speakers) are unable to communicate "patentlyoffensive" material lawfully on the Internet unless they canqualify for the subsection (e)(5)(A) defense ("good faith,reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions").  Thus, it isjust as critical for speakers to know whether they qualify forthe (e)(5)(A) defense as it is for them to know whether theirspeech is covered by the Act at all.             But the Government has done nothing to cure thestatute's utter failure to specify what speakers such as theplaintiffs here can do to qualify for this defense.  As noted,the Government has devoted considerable effort to show that"tagging" is technically feasible in some circumstances, but itdoes not suggest tagging could be a defense under (e)(5)(A) untilcompatible end-user software is in widespread use, and it refusesto take a position on whether tagging would be a defense even ifevery end-user had compatible software in place today.  If theAct is not a complete ban of "patently offensive" speech frommost of the Internet, it can only be because there are, today,"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions" speakers cantake to restrict access by minors while allowing access byadults.  But the Government does not even hypothesize what thoseactions would be.  It is a violation of due process to compelspeakers to risk their liberty in order to test what thoseactions might be.  See Hynes, 425 U.S. at 620; Dombrowski v.Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 491 (1965).[49]          In the end, the Government's only response regardingthe vagueness of the "indecent" and "patently offensive"standards, and of the scope of the safe harbor and accessprovider defenses, is that prosecutors, judges and jurors can betrusted to construe these provisions reasonably.  But the void-for-vagueness doctrine specifically rules out that argument.  SeeKeyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 599 (1967)("It is noanswer" for government to defend a vague law by "say[ing] that[it] would not be applied in such a case."); Baggett v. Bullitt,377 U.S. at 373 ("[w]ell-intentioned prosecutors and judicialsafeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law").  Citizensare entitled to fair and reasonably specific warning of what acriminal law means before they are forced to risk prosecution,and they cannot be relegated simply to "trusting" the governmentto exercise lenity toward speech, particularly speech that maywell be unpopular, caustic, or intensely critical of thegovernors themselves.            The CDA is therefore unconstitutionally vague. III. THE CHALLENGED PROVISIONS OF THE CDA ARE INVALID ON THEIR     FACE AND AS APPLIED.            Because of the force of plaintiffs' constitutionalchallenge in this case, the Government's primary goal seems to beto avoid at all costs having to defend the actual, present impactof the CDA on protected speech.  To avoid review, the Government(1) argues that facial review of the Act is inappropriate andthen (2) assumes, without explanation, that the Court should notreview the provisions as applied to plaintiffs.  However,established First Amendment doctrines strongly support facialreview in this case.  In any event, at a minimum, the Courtshould invalidate the statute as applied to the current array ofplaintiffs.     A.   The Challenged Provisions Are Facially Invalid In All          Their Applications.          Although it is defending a law that, on its face,imposes content-based restrictions on fully protected speech, theGovernment argues that the law cannot be facially challengedbecause it contains a defense that renders its applicationconstitutional as to a narrow subset of speakers, i.e. "thosecommercial vendors of online pornography who use credit cardauthorization or similar means . . . to restrict access to theirmaterial" and thus are able to use the subsection (e)(5)(B)defense.  US ALA Resp. at 17.  See also id. at 19; Defendants'Response to the Court's Inquiry Concerning Burden of ProofIssues, at 3-4.          This argument is utterly meritless.  As we show in thenext section, a facial challenge to the CDA's restrictions on"patently offensive" communications is entirely appropriatebecause that restriction violates the First Amendment in theoverwhelming majority of its applications.          In any event, defendants' "commercial vendors" argumentignores the fact that plaintiffs have mounted a facial challengeto subsection (d) on vagueness grounds.  As the "void-for-vagueness" doctrine's name signals, courts have not hesitated tostrike down on their face laws that fail to "define the criminaloffense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people canunderstand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that doesnot encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. at 357.  See id. at 360-61; Smith v.Goguen, 415 U.S. at 582; Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451,458 (1939).  See also Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, 958 F.2d 1242,1266 (3d Cir. 1992) ("[A] meritorious First Amendment vaguenesschallenge will annul an unclear law that 'chills' protected FirstAmendment activities.")  The subsection (e)(5)(B) defense doesnothing to cure this vagueness problem.[50]            Furthermore, defendants also ignore the fact thatCongress authorized a facial challenge precisely because it didnot want to wait for years of as-applied challenges to beresolved before it would know whether it had enacted a statutethat could be applied in more than a handful of cases.[51]  Aholding that the CDA is not subject to facial review because itcan constitutionally be applied to a small segment of speakerswould produce precisely the result Congress wanted to avoid: years of as-applied challenges before the constitutional scope ofthe CDA would be known.[52]     B.   The Challenged Provisions Are Facially Invalid Because          They Are Overbroad.          Even if the Court were to agree with defendants thatthe Act is not invalid in all applications, it would still berequired to hold the Act facially invalid because it remainsinvalid in the overwhelming majority of applications.  TheGovernment certainly has not carried its burden of showing thatnon-commercial speakers or speakers utilizing newsgroups, mailexploders or IRC chat will be able to use the safe-harbordefenses.  Thus, in all of its applications to such speakers, theAct imposes an effective ban on "patently offensive" expressionand is, as a result, much broader than the First Amendmentpermits.  This means the Act should be struck down on its face onoverbreadth grounds.[53]          Although in most other areas of constitutional law alitigant challenging a law "on its face" must show that the lawis invalid in every application, see United States v. Salerno,481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987), in First Amendment cases the law is"nearly the opposite:  a statute is invalid in all itsapplications if it is invalid in any of them, or at least enoughto make it 'substantially' overbroad."[54]  This rule is "based onan appreciation that the very existence of some broadly writtenlaws has the potential to chill the expression of [persons] notbefore the court."  Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 112S. Ct. 2395, 2401 (1992).  See also Secretary of State ofMaryland v. J.H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 958 (1984); Broadrickv. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973).  Where, as here, a statutechills a substantial amount of protected speech, the overbreadthdoctrine ensures that affected speakers and listeners will nothave to self-censor their speech until each possible applicationof the statute is litigated on a case-by-case basis.          The Government has offered two responses to thisoverbreadth argument, neither of which is persuasive.  First, theGovernment has mischaracterized the argument -- claiming thatplaintiffs argue that the statute is "overbroad" only because itextends beyond pornography to cover speech on "education,scientific and/or literary issues."  US ALA Resp at 14.  Based onthis mischaracterization, the Government argues that the solutionis to construe the statute narrowly to exclude coverage of such"serious value" speech.  Id. at 15.  But see supra, I.B.(pointing out that this construction is not supported by thestatute's text or history).          This argument entirely misses plaintiffs' two basicpoints.  First, plaintiffs challenge the CDA as it applies to theentire spectrum of non-obscene communication, no part of whichmay be banned for adults.  The Act's suppression of material withserious value compounds, but does not exhaust, the Act'sunconstitutional effect.  The Act is no less unconstitutional formaterial the Government would characterize as "pornography" thanit is for material with "serious value."  See Sable, 492 U.S. at128-31 (striking down a "dial-a-porn" statute limited tocommercial sexually explicit telephone communications, withoutany suggestion that the speech at issue had "serious value"). Second, the overbreadth of the Act arises most palpably from itsapplication to noncommercial speakers and all speakers utilizingnewsgroups, mail exploders or IRC chat, who, regardless of thecontent or "value" of their protected expression, cannotprescreen their potential audience.  That overbreadth problemwould not be eliminated through a narrowing construction of thestatute to exempt "serious value" speech (even if such aconstruction were possible).           The Government's second response to the facialoverbreadth argument is its suggestion that plaintiffs lackstanding to maintain an overbreadth challenge because they allegethat their own speech is constitutionally protected.  US ALA Respat 14.  The Supreme Court's most recent ruling on this issue,however, flatly rejects the argument that overbreadth claims canbe brought only by parties to whom the statute mayconstitutionally be applied.  In Board of Trustees v. Fox, 492U.S. 469, 484 (1989), the Court stated that "while theoverbreadth doctrine was born as an expansion of the law ofstanding, it would produce absurd results to limit itsapplication strictly to that context."  The Court reasoned thatit would make no sense to grant the right to mount a facialchallenge to parties whose speech has validly been regulated andwho are personally unaffected by the statute's overbreadth, whiledenying that right to parties who claim to have been directlyaffected by the statute's overbreadth themselves.  Id.[55]          Thus, it is clear that plaintiffs may challenge the CDAas facially overbroad, even though plaintiffs also claim that thechallenged provisions infringe their own First Amendment rights. Plaintiffs' claims obviously implicate the core concern of theoverbreadth doctrine -- the danger "that the statute's veryexistence may cause others not before the court to refrain fromconstitutionally protected speech or expression."  Broadrick, 413U.S. at 612.            Accordingly, even if the Act does not unduly restrictspeech by a small class of commercial content providers who canprescreen, it does effectively ban a great deal of protectedspeech by everyone else.  Therefore, it is beyond reasonabledispute that the CDA operates unconstitutionally for "asubstantial category" of the speakers it covers, Village ofSchaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620,634 (1980), and that it "criminalizes a substantial amount ofconstitutionally protected speech," City of Houston v. Hill, 482U.S. 451, 466 (1987).          This substantial overbreadth requires invalidation ofSection (d) on its face.  The provision cannot be saved by anarrowing construction because it is not "easily susceptible" tosuch a construction.  Erznoznik, 422 U.S. at 216 n.15.  ThisCourt would have to limit the Act's application to "pornography,"despite Congress' clear intention that it apply far more broadly,and to commercial speakers who, as a practical matter, can availthemselves of credit card or adult access screening, despiteCongress' clear intention that the Act should govern all Internetusers.  This Court should not rewrite the Act in the face of suchclear indicia of contrary Congressional intent.  And without sucha rewrite, the Act will continue to suppress and deter vastamounts of protected expression.  Thus, this Court mustinvalidate Section (d) in toto.[56]     C.   The Challenged Provisions Are Unconstitutional As          Applied To Plaintiffs.          The Government (for understandable reasons) neverattempts to defend the constitutionality of the CDA as applied toplaintiffs.  However, even if the Government were correct thatthe CDA should not be invalidated "facially" (i.e., in allapplications), plaintiffs would nonetheless be entitled to reliefbecause the challenged provisions are unconstitutional as appliedto them.  See NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1018-19.          Plaintiffs have not limited their claims to "facial"claims, and they are not required to choose between a facialchallenge and an as-applied challenge.  Indeed, First Amendmentplaintiffs commonly combine the two.  E.g., Fox, 492 U.S. at 484;Board of Airport Comm'rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569(1987); Lind v. Grimmer, 30 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 1994), cert.denied, 115 S. Ct. 902 (1995).  And Congress specificallycontemplated that plaintiffs bringing a facial challenge to theCDA could also bring an as-applied challenge.  See Conf. Rep. at197 ("[T]he three-judge district court could hear both a facialchallenge and an 'as-applied' challenge if they were combined inthe same action and facial validity had not yet beendetermined.")          Thus, if the Court were to conclude that the CDA shouldnot be invalidated in all its applications, plaintiffs' as-applied challenge would have to be addressed.  Plaintiffs havemade a comprehensive (and largely unrebutted) showing that theAct directly infringes their own First Amendment rights.[57]  Noplaintiff falls within the small category of content providersthe Government contends can feasibly comply with the Act by meansshort of self-censorship -- "those commercial vendors of onlinepornography who use credit card authorization or similar means .. . to restrict access to their material."  US ALA Resp. at 17.          Moreover, plaintiffs' as-applied challenge is fullyripe even though no plaintiff has yet been prosecuted.  See,e.g., NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1011; American Library Ass'n v. Reno,33 F.3d 78, 83-84 (D.C. Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2610(1995).  The CDA imposes direct compliance burdens on all of theplaintiffs, and is suppressing their speech right now.  TheGovernment has given no assurance that it will not prosecute inthe future for current speech, and plaintiffs have "an actual andwell-founded fear that the law will be enforced against them." Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988). That continuing threat of criminal liability is pressuring eachof them to engage in "self-censorship; a harm that can berealized even without an actual prosecution."  Id.  A preliminaryinjunction would prevent that harm.  At a minimum, therefore,plaintiffs are entitled to a remedy sufficient to precludeenforcement of the challenged provisions against them.          If the Court concludes (as it should) that plaintiffs'facial and as-applied challenges are both valid, it will havediscretion whether to grant "facial" relief or instead limit itsinjunction to the CDA's application to the plaintiffs.[58]  Here,for strong reasons of practicality and substantive FirstAmendment policy, the Court should declare the challengedprovisions facially invalid.          First, because plaintiffs represent a vast array ofspeakers and listeners using all the modes of speech that existin cyberspace, the very judicial economy concerns that"ordinarily" favor deciding an as-applied challenge before afacial one, see Fox, 492 U.S. at 485, compel the oppositeconclusion here.  Second, Congress itself evinced a desire tohave the CDA's validity dispositively determined in an expeditedpreenforcement proceeding.  See Point III.A. supra.  An "as-applied" ruling, finding the CDA unconstitutional as applied toplaintiffs but leaving its provisions nominally in force as tonon-parties, would be inconsistent with that desire.  Third, andmost important, an "as-applied" remedy would not eliminate thechilling effect of the CDA's grossly overbroad and vagueprovisions.[59]  Although the Government might not prosecuteindividuals or entities whose situation is precisely the same asone or more of the plaintiffs sheltered by such an injunction, aremedy limited to the plaintiffs would inevitably leave many non-parties in a state of perilous uncertainty about the CDA'sapplicability to them.  Facial invalidation is appropriate where,as here, the speech rights of non-parties would otherwise hingeon the results of "a series of adjudications."  Jews for Jesus,482 U.S. at 576.  "[T]he chilling effect of the [statute] onprotected speech in the meantime would make such a case-by-caseadjudication intolerable."  Id. at 575-76.IV.  THE IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, THEIR MEMBERS, AND THEIR     SUBSCRIBERS, PATRONS, AND CUSTOMERS FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY HARM     TO THE GOVERNMENT IF AN INJUNCTION ISSUES, AND THE PUBLIC     INTEREST FAVORS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.            It is a bedrock legal principle that any deprivation ofFirst Amendment rights constitutes irreparable injury.  See ALAP.I. Mem. at 78-80.  Plaintiffs reasonably fear prosecution underthe Act, and their only alternative to prosecution is self-censorship.[60]          The public also has a substantial, constitutionallyprotected interest in having access to a robust, uninhibited flowof constitutionally protected speech.  See Turner, 114 S. Ct. at2458 ("At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principlethat each person should decide for him or herself the ideas andbeliefs deserving of expression, consideration and adherence. . . .  Government action that stifles speech . . . ,contravenes this essential right."); Virginia State Bd. ofPharmacy v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976).  Thisinterest is severely damaged by the Act.  Indeed, as shown above,in addition to its suppressive effect on plaintiffs' speech, theAct is currently having a widespread chilling effect on thousandsof speakers and listeners who are not before the Court.  Althoughthe public's interest in protecting minors from communicationsthat might be inappropriate for them is also substantial, thatinterest is -- at best -- only marginally advanced by theprovisions plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin.  Moreover, usersoftware will continue to block communications parents deeminappropriate for their children, even if the challengedprovisions of the Act are enjoined.          The damage to constitutionally protected expressionthat has already occurred, and the further damage that will occurif defendants are not enjoined, is incalculable.  Substantialquantities of constitutionally protected speech are being andwill continue to be suppressed across the Nation.  Theconcomitant negative impact on the burgeoning medium forinteractive computer services will be substantial.  Entry of therelief requested, pending final resolution of the merits, willcause defendants no significant harm, especially because thereare other criminal statutes (including this Act's application to"obscene" communications) that prohibit the communications theyclaim are the principal focus of the Act.  Any delay in entry ofrelief, however, perpetuates and compounds the damage toplaintiffs' First Amendment rights and the First Amendment rightsof millions of adults to send and receive communications that areindisputably constitutionally protected for them.                            CONCLUSION          Plaintiffs have shown they are likely to prevail on themerits of their constitutional challenge, and that they aresuffering irreparable injury.  Accordingly, preliminaryinjunctive relief against enforcement of the challengedprovisions of 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B)(ii), 223(a)(2) and 223(d)is essential and amply justified.

ALA Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Motionfor a Preliminary Injunction (March 1, 1996) ("ALA P.I. Mem."),at 16-21, and 25-42.  Plaintiffs respectfully refer the Court tothat Memorandum for a more comprehensive discussion of our Firstand Fifth Amendment arguments and other legal points.3. See ALA P.I. Mem. at 27-30, and Point I.C.3., infra.4. Section 223(a)(1)(B) bans use of a "telecommunicationsdevice" for any "obscene or indecent" communication with a personknown to be under age 18, and Section 223(a)(2) imposes liabilityon a person who "knowingly permits any telecommunicationsfacility under his control to be used for any activity prohibitedby [Section 223(a)(1)]."  47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B)(ii), (a)(2). The primary problem with these provisions is their overbreadth: for example, they would punish a university professor fortransmitting to 17-year-old freshmen sexually explicit coursematerials.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 45-48; Boiss� Supp. Decl.  3-4, 6. 5. See Defendants' Opposition to Plaintiff American LibraryAssociation, et al.'s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction ("USALA Resp.") at 16-17 ("[S]ection 223(d) . . . by no means is a'ban' on adult expression.  Rather, it is a command toinformation content providers on the Internet to undertakereasonable measures to direct their communications to otheradults, rather than to minors.").6. It is undisputed that the burden of demonstrating that theAct is narrowly tailored rests squarely on the Government.  SeeACLU and ALA Plaintiffs' Joint Response to the Court's QuestionsRegarding the Burden of Proof ("Pltfs Joint BOP Mem."), at 6-11;Defendants' Response to the Court's Inquiry Concerning Burden ofProof Issues, at 5.7. Bradner Test. Decl.  46-49 (newsgroup); 39-41 (mailexploder); 56-59 (IRC chat).8. Bradner Test. Decl.  41, 42, 49-50, 59; see also SchmidtTest., Tr. Vol. IV, at 73:15 to 74:2; cf. Bradner Test. Decl. 22-33 (same technological infeasibility applies to one-to-onee-mail).9. Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 219:23 to 220:8; Olsen Test.Decl.  19.10. The Government's expert witness testified that even a one-minute delay in Internet access would be intolerable for theaverage user.  See Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V, at 73:3-9.11. Imposing this task on content providers is constitutionallysuspect.  See Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 152-55 (1959).12. The defenses in section 223(e)(1)-(4) are irrelevant.  13. Plaintiffs specifically asked the Government whether aspeaker rating or labeling system would constitute a defense. ALA Plaintiffs' First Set of Interrogatories to Defendants,Interrogatory 1 (March 18, 1996).  The Government objected tothat interrogatory and refused to provide a specific response. Defendants' Responses to ALA Plaintiffs' First Set ofInterrogatories (March 20, 1996).     The Government's ambiguous posture mirrors language in theConference Report, which acknowledges that "content selectionstandards" and "other technologies" that are "currently underdevelopment, might qualify" as defenses, but makes clear theywould qualify only "if they are effective at protecting minorsfrom exposure to indecent material via the Internet."  H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 458, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., at 190 (1996)(emphasisadded)("Conf. Rep.").14. He confirmed, for example, that there is currently no way topost an "indecent" message in a newsgroup and avoid the risk ofprosecution under the Act, because, even if the message istagged, there is no way of insuring that the message will not be"available" to persons under 18.  Id. at 234:19-25.     Olsen acknowledged that the tag "-L18" is technologicallyand functionally identical to the tag "xxx."  Olsen Test., Tr.Vol. IV, at 208:19-209:3.  Of course, some speakers already tagtheir speech "xxx," or in other ways that indicate its sexuallyoriented content (such as "alt.sex.erotica"), and Senator Exon,the sponsor of the CDA, certainly did not consider those tags tobe a defense; to the contrary, he considered them to be aproblem, because minors can use those tags to find inappropriatespeech.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9,1995)(statement of Sen. Exon).15. The CDA specifies that measures taken under subsection (e)to restrict or prevent access by minors must be "effective" and"feasible under available technology."  47 U.S.C.  223(e)(5)(A).16. See Pl. Pro. Find. Part III.F.4; Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV,at 222:10 to 224:11; id., Tr. Vol. V, at 89:5-8 (acknowledgingthat PICS works in this manner and will be available in 2-3months).17. There is no evidence in this record on that point.  SeeSable Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 129-30 (1989).18. See 47 U.S.C.  223(b)(2)(A) (criminalizing making anyindecent telephone communication "for commercial purposes"(emphasis added).19. Conf. Rep. at 191.  Indeed, the Government's hearingevidence included repeated references to newsgroups, even thoughnewsgroups and newsgroup speakers are not commercial speakers. Senator Exon also referred to newsgroups as a principal target ofthe legislation.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9,1995).20. Congress deliberately rejected the narrower "harmful-to-minors" standard that originated in Ginsberg v. New York, 390U.S. 629 (1968).  See Conf. Rep. 189.  Indeed, Congress rejectedan amendment that would have specified that speech could not befound indecent or patently offensive if it had serious value forminors.  See ACLU Post-Trial Br., at 9-15 & n. 15.  Thus, theGovernment now asks the Court to adopt an interpretationapproximating the very standard Congress rejected.21. See, e.g., Enforcement of Prohibitions Against BroadcastIndecency in 18 U.S.C.  1464, 5 FCC Rcd. 5297, 5308-09 (1990). See also Gillett Communications of Atlanta v. Becker, 807 F.Supp. 757 (N.D. Ga. 1992)(holding TV broadcast of videotape"Abortion in America:  The Real Story," as part of a politicaladvertisement by a candidate for public office, was indecent),appeal dismissed, 5 F.3d 1500 ( 11th Cir. 1993).22. Thus, although the Pacifica Court emphasized that that casedid not involve a criminal sanction, 438 U.S. at 750, the ACLUnow faces potential prosecution for posting the same GeorgeCarlin monologue online.  Stip.  78.  Similarly, it was not acrime to publish the "Rimm" study in print, but onlinepublication of that study puts libraries at risk of prosecutionunder the Act.  Croneberger Test. Decl.  15, 17.  TheGovernment has shown no justification for criminalizing speech onthe Internet that would not be criminally sanctioned if it werebroadcast on television or radio, or published in a print medium.23. See also KLOL(FM), 8 FCC Rcd. 3228 (1993); WVIC-FM, 6 FCCRcd. 7484 (1991).  Indeed, in Pacifica, the Supreme Court did notsuggest that George Carlin's satirical monologue lacked seriousvalue.  See Action For Children's TV v. FCC, 852 F.2d 1332, 1340n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (concluding monologue "may be an example ofindecent material possessing significant social value").24.

Cir. 1974); Implementation of Section 10 ofthe Cable Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, 8 FCCRcd. 998, 1004 (1993) ("We do not agree that any determination ofindecency [in the cable medium] is required [to] take intoaccount the work as a whole."); WIOD, 6 FCC Rcd. 3704, 3705(1989)(less than 5 percent of a program devoted to sexually-oriented material supports an indecency finding "[w]hether or notthe context of the entire Neil Rogers Show dwelt on sexualthemes").25. See Schmidt Test. Decl. Exs. 3, 8, 11, 12, 25, 26, 27, 30,31, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 52.  At least one online image wasvirtually identical to, but less explicit than, an image in theprint version of Playboy Magazine.  Compare Def. Exh. 42, at 5(print version) with Def. Ex. 43, at 3 (online image); seeSchmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 98:13-21; Schmidt Test. Decl. 46.  Senator Exon confirmed that the prohibition would apply toan online version of Playboy Magazine.  141 Cong. Rec. S8330(June 14, 1995) (Sen. Exon).  Thus, publication of the printversion of the image was entirely lawful; publication of theonline version is apparently a felony.26. See n. 20 supra, and accompanying text.27. It would not be possible to narrow the scope of the Act bysevering "invalid" language.  This case is thus unlike Brockettv. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491 (1985), where the Courtheld that it was permissible to sever one problematic word --"lust" -- from an otherwise complete and valid law in order toassure that the law covered only obscenity.  See also Lind v.Grimmer, 30 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 1994) (discussingBrockett), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 902 (1995).28. As explained more fully in our prehearing memorandum (seeALA P.I. Mem. at 38-42), here, as in Sable, the legislativerecord provides no support for the Government on this point.  TheGovernment's case therefore depends entirely on the factualrecord put before this Court.29. Some of the images referred to by Howard Schmidt involvedepictions of sexually explicit conduct.  See Schmidt Test. Decl.Exs. 4, 14, 19, 22, 24, 46, 49, 51.  These images meet thethreshold requirement for an obscenity prosecution, and couldtherefore be found obscene if a jury determined they meet theMiller test.  Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).  TheGovernment already has ample means to punish such communicationsunder existing laws banning obscenity and child pornography.  SeeALA P.I. Mem. at 38.  To the extent purveyors of such materialare already willing to violate these other laws, the CDA will notdeter them (although user blocking would prevent their materialfrom reaching children).  See, e.g., Riley v. National Fed'n ofthe Blind, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 800 (1988) (statute is notnarrowly tailored if "vigorously enforc[ing]" existing laws wouldhave substantially the same effect).30. The Government made no attempt to rebut this evidence -- oreven to "test" these control mechanisms.  See Schmidt Test., Tr.Vol. IV, at 79:4 to 80:1 (tested only SurfWatch); Olsen Test.,Tr. Vol. IV, at 196:17-21.31. Duvall Test. Decl.  13; Pl. Pro. Find.  788, 807.32. SurfWatch blocks all of the sites Senator Exon used tojustify the Act.  141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995). For example, it blocks access to all "alt.sex" newsgroups. Duvall Test. Decl.  24.  It also blocks all of the sitessubmitted by defendants as exhibits in opposition to the ACLU'sTRO motion, including excerpted material such as the "InternetYellow Pages."  Id.  25.  See Pl. Pro. Find.  800.33. It is highly doubtful whether the United States even has theauthority under customary international law to restrict"indecent" or "patently offensive" speech placed on the Internetby foreign speakers, especially where the speech was notspecifically directed to the United States.  See 1 Restatement(3d) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States  403(limitations on nations' "jurisdiction to prescribe").  It isunlikely that the United States would wish to -- or even that itcould consistent with the First Amendment -- subscribe to aprinciple of reciprocity in international law whereby AmericanInternet users would be subject to foreign nations' often verydraconian speech restrictions for any Internet speech accessiblein those nations.  Surely the United States would not agree thata domestic poster of Internet speech critical of China's humanrights record could be prosecuted by that country for violationof its law prohibiting speech critical of the government.     Domestic caching of foreign material (to the extent itoccurs) is not a solution to this problem.  The operator of acache on the Internet (such as the operator of a transatlanticcable) could not be treated as a republisher of the overseascontent for the purpose of the CDA.  As defendants' expertadmits, the cache operator does not have any knowledge of thedata that is temporarily cached.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. V., at55:24 to 56:1.  Caching is an automatic process that takes placewithout any knowledge on the part of the cache operator of thecontent being cached -- the content is simply a "stream of bits." Id. at 56:1.  This type of "intermediate storage" is preciselywhat is excluded from coverage by the CDA in  223(e)(1).  Olsentestified that, if a screening requirement were imposed oncachers, they would simply stop caching.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol.V, at 55:19 to 57:6.34. In fact, to the extent the same or virtually identicalcontent is available from both domestic and foreign sites, theAct will not diminish minors' ability to access that content atall.  Much "pornography" is functionally indistinguishable fromother "pornography."  And as more and more domestic sites moveabroad, or use anonymous foreign re-mailers, the problem offoreign postings will be compounded.35. PICS technology enables parents or other adults to selectwhich Internet material children can access, based on labels thatassign ratings to the content.  Vezza Test. Decl.  5.  PICS willprovide the ability for third parties, as well as individualcontent providers, to rate content on the Internet in a varietyof ways.  Stip.  50; Vezza Test. Decl.  5.  For example,material could be rated as inappropriate for children under 10;or inappropriate because of violence or sexual content.  Thisflexibility enables parents to give older children access to morematerial than younger children.  Vezza Test. Decl.  12.  PICS-compatible Web browsers, Usenet News Group readers, and otherInternet applications, will provide parents the ability to choosefrom a variety of rating services, or a combination of services. Stip.  50.  See Pl. Pro. Find.  826-28, 837.          The PICS working group participants include many of themajor online services providers, commercial Internet accessproviders, hardware and software companies, major Internetcontent providers, and consumer organizations.  Stip.  51, 52. Given the powerful market forces driving development of PICS, thechance that all vendors will adhere to the PICS standard are"extremely high."  Vezza Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 182:23 to 183:20. Indeed, it is anticipated that all of the major online servicesand Web browsing software programs will be PICS-compatible byearly summer 1996, and that at least four independent contentratings will be available (three of them at no cost) by thattime.  Burrington Test. Decl.  29.36. No system dependent on tagging by speakers of their ownspeech is ever going to be fully effective.  For example, Olsenacknowledged it is unlikely that foreign speakers would tag theirown speech.  Olsen Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 226:4-18.  And Schmidtagreed that foreign countries where sexual material oftenoriginates have more lenient views about the legality of suchmaterial.  Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. IV, at 131:14-24.37. Congress enacted the CDA after only cursory examination ofalternative, less restrictive approaches, and without making anyfindings concerning the nature of the problem it sought toaddress.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 35-37 & n.72.  Congress's failureto recognize user blocking as a less restrictive alternative inthe computer context is especially indefensible in light ofCongress's explicit endorsement of user blocking as a "narrowlytailored" approach to addressing violence and sex on television. See Pltfs Joint BOP Mem. at 9-10.38. The Government has essentially conceded that a great deal ofthe expression covered by the CDA is at the outer periphery ofCongress's concern.  It has not seriously contended, for example,that purely textual "indecency" -- including the satirical use ofprofanity at issue in Pacifica -- was viewed by Congress as aserious concern.  Although eliminating the CDA's application totextual material would not by itself have resolved the CDA'sconstitutional defects, it would have dramatically reduced theamount of constitutionally protected speech covered by thestatute, without material harm to the Government's assertedinterests.  See ALA P.I. Mem. at 41. 39. Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. at 128 (quoting fromBolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp. 463 U.S. 60, 73 (1983),which in turn quoted from Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383(1957)).40. Thus, this bedrock principle has already been applied in thecontext of sale or distribution of immoral books and otherprinted materials (Butler), use of the postal service to mailunsolicited commercial advertisements about contraceptives tohomes (Bolger), and use of the telephone to sell sexuallyexplicit communications (Sable).41. Anker Test. Decl.  28; see Duvall Test., Tr. Vol. I, at107:8 to 132:14 (demonstrating complexity of computer andInternet tasks).  Moreover, as noted, parents have a range ofsoftware options to limit children's access to the Internet.  SeePoint I.C.1. supra.42. The record contains ample evidence of plaintiffs' inabilityto define the scope of the CDA's prohibitions and defenses.  Pl.Pro. Find. Part IV.D.1.  See also ALA P.I. Mem. at 79-80.43. Furthermore, the Conference Report (which most speakers willnever see) compounds the confusion by ascribing to the FCC"indecency" precedents the Act purportedly adopts, a gloss onthose terms that cannot be found in those precedents.  See, e.g.,Conf. Rep. at 189 (stating that the FCC's "patent offensiveness"standard requires the "intention to be offensive"). In fact, itdoes not.  Moreover, although the Government elsewhere invokesthe Conference Report in an effort to give meaning to the CDA'sterms, e.g., US ALA Resp. at 11 ("the Conference Report ... makescrystal-clear the statute's intended scope"), it nowherecontends, notwithstanding the explicit statement in theConference Report, that "patent offensiveness" under subsection(d) requires proof of "intention to offend."  It isunderstandable that the Government would choose to ignore thislanguage from the Conference Report, because an "intent tooffend" requirement would provide a defense even for"pornographers" if they could show their only intent was totitillate or to make money by selling their speech to adults.  44. In fact, however, the FCC has had extreme difficultydetermining the meaning of indecency even in the broadcastcontext.  See, e.g., William J. Byrnes, Esq., 63 Rad. Reg. 2d(P&F) 216 (Mass Media Bureau 1987)(declining to clarify whetherPacifica radio's broadcast of its annual Bloomsday reading fromJames Joyce's Ulysses would be indecent).  See also ACLU Post-Trial Br. at 9-15.45. The Government's expert witness acknowledged that communitystandards vary throughout the country.  Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol.IV, at 137-38.46. It might refer, for example, to the nature of the rest ofthe communication of which the potentially "offensive" message isa part, the time of day it was conveyed, the purpose of thecommunication, the intended, probable or actual audience, theelegance or inelegance of its presentation, the identity of thespeaker, the presence or absence of warnings or other indicationsthat the communication may not be appropriate for minors, or thespecific mode of communication.  47. Schmidt Test., Tr. Vol. III at 140-41.  As Schmidt'stestimony suggests, one variant of "context" that someprosecutors may draw upon to decide whether a communication isprohibited is whether the communication constitutes "art" and"entertainment."  That highly subjective decision should not beleft to government officials, whether prosecutors or judges.  Cf.Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.S. 239, 251(1903) ("It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trainedonly to the law to constitute themselves final judges of theworth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest andmost obvious limits.").    48. See Hynes v. Mayor & Council, 425 U.S. 610, 622 (1976);Community Television of Utah v. Wilkinson, 611 F. Supp. 1099,1117 (D. Utah 1985), aff'd, 800 F.2d 989 (10th Cir. 1986), aff'd,480 U.S. 926 (1987)("context" does not adequately limit scope of"indecency" regulation).49. Nor has the Government done anything to obviate theambiguities concerning application of the access-provider defenseto service providers, such as Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, whoset up Web sites for other speakers on their servers.  SeeCroneberger Test. Decl.  39; 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(1); ALA P.I.Mem. at 77-78.50. The Court may "invalidate [for vagueness] a criminal statuteon its face even when it could conceivably have had some validapplications."  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 n.8.51. See Telecommunications Act of 1996,  561; 142 Cong. Rec.S694 (daily ed. Feb. 1, 1996) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (Becauseconferees "have doubts about [the CDA's] constitutionality," they"added a section to speed up judicial review to see if thelegislation passes muster.").  See also 142 Cong. Rec. S2095(daily ed. March 14, 1996) (statement of Sen. Exon) 142 Cong.Rec. S715 (daily ed. Feb 1, 1996) (statement of Sen. Moynihan)142 Cong. Rec. S1180 (daily ed. Feb. 9, 1986) (statement of Sen.Leahy).  Congress made clear that it did not want to repeat itsexperience with the dial-a-porn statute, the constitutionality ofwhich was litigated for over a decade.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8346(daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statement of Sen. Biden);  id. S8342(statement of Sen. Leahy).52. Thus, to the extent judge-made limitations on facialchallenges are intended to insulate legislative enactments frombroad judicial scrutiny, those policies do not apply where, ashere, Congress has specifically authorized a facial challenge.53. Plaintiffs also have demonstrated that subsections(a)(1)(B)(ii) and (d) are overbroad because they prohibit allminors from receiving material deemed inappropriate for theyoungest users of the Internet.  See ALA P.I. Mem. 45-48; SchmidtTest., Tr. Vol. IV, at 130:24 to 131:7 (material inappropriatefor his son at age 11 will not be harmful at age 17).54. National Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.2d1271, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring) (citingnumerous cases), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995).  See Salerno, 481U.S. at 745 (noting that "every application" rule applies"outside the limited context of the First Amendment"); see alsoMichael C. Dorf, Facial Challenges to State and Federal Statutes,46 Stan. L. Rev. 235, 265 (1994).55. In several cases, the Supreme Court has addressedoverbreadth claims without finding it necessary to determinefirst whether the plaintiffs' own expression was or was notvalidly regulated.  See, e.g., Board of Airport Comm'rs v. Jewsfor Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569, 572, 575-76 (1987) (holdingrestriction on expressive activity overbroad and thereforefacially invalid without finding it necessary to rule onplaintiffs' claim that their own activity was constitutionallyprotected); Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a BetterEnvironment, 444 U.S. 620, 634 & n.8 (1980) (same).  56. Plaintiffs do not seek invalidation of the entire CDA. Their facial challenge is limited to subsections (a)(1)(B)(ii),(a)(2) and (d).  Under ordinary principles of severability, seeAlaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684-86 (1987), theremainder of the CDA may be left intact.  Moreover, plaintiffschallenge these provisions only insofar as they apply to speechthat is constitutionally protected for adults.  Subsection(a)(1)(B)(ii) (and hence Subsection (a)(2)) may be left intactinsofar as it proscribes "obscene" communications.  However,there is no evidence or reason to believe that Congress intendedSubsection (d) -- which does not refer separately to "obscene"communications -- to address material that is legally obscene,which it dealt with in other provisions that would renderSubsection (d) superfluous as an anti-obscenity measure.  See CDASection 507 (amending 18 U.S.C.  1462 to "clarify" criminalprohibition on transmitting "obscene" materials by "interactivecomputer service"); United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701 (6thCir. 1996) (affirming conviction under  1462 and 1465 fortransmitting obscenity by computer).  Therefore, subsection (d)should be set aside in toto. 57. Pl. Pro. Find. Part IV.A.  58. The Supreme Court has observed that a court should"ordinarily" decide an as-applied challenge before proceeding torule on a facial one, Fox, 492 U.S. at 485, and should generallyrestrict its remedy to what is sufficient to protect thelitigants, e.g., NTEU, 115 S. Ct. at 1018.  However, in the FirstAmendment context, the preference for litigant-specific reliefover facial relief is not an inflexible rule, e.g., Fox, 492 U.S.at 485; see also Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 345 (1991)(Marshall, J., dissenting), so that in appropriate cases a courtmay strike a law on its face even though a narrower remedy wouldbe sufficient to protect the particular litigant's speech. Indeed, the Court has often held laws facially invalid withoutruling on the litigants' alternative claim that the law was alsounconstitutional "as applied" to them.  E.g., Board of AirportComm'rs v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569 (1987); Houston v.Hill, 482 U.S. 451 (1987); Schaumberg v. Citizens for a BetterEnvironment, 444 U.S. 620 (1980).59."Self-censorship is immune to an `as-applied' challenge, forit derives from the individual's own actions, not an abuse ofgovernment power."  City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. Co.,486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988).  See also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380U.S. 479, 491 (1965) (persons covered by a law that restrictsexpression in vague and overbroad terms should not be expected to"hammer[] out the structure of the statute piecemeal, with nolikelihood of obviating similar uncertainty for others").60. Under the terms of the Stipulation entered between theparties, the Government has retained the right to prosecute anyof the plaintiffs for speech posted online during the pendency ofthis proceeding in the event plaintiffs' motion for a preliminaryinjunction is denied.

The effect of the change would be to ease the burden on U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have the need to temporarily export cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief periods of time.EFFECTIVE DATE: February 16, 1996.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:Rose Biancaniello, Deputy Director for Licensing, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Department of State, (703) 875-6643 or FAX (703) 875-6647.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The U.S. Government has since 1993, at the direction of the President, been reviewing the U.S. policy regarding the domestic use of, and export controls on, cryptographic technology. While U.S. national security and foreign policy compel maintaining appropriate export controls on cryptography, the Department of State has continued to reform the export control procedures applicable to those products incorporating cryptography which are controlled by the ITAR in Category XIII(b)(1). For example, on September 2, 1994, the Department published (at 59 FR 45621) a final rule change which created a new Section 124.15. The section provides for a new arrangement by which the Department of State may provide approval for category XIII(b)(1) cryptography products to be distributed by U.S. manufacturers directly to foreign end users without obtaining an individual license for each transaction.    After extensive review, the Department of State has decided to further amend the regulations to provide for an exemption for the temporary export of cryptographic products for personal use. The exemption does not apply to other circumstances, for example, those in which a person contemplates sales, marketing or demonstration. Nor does the exemption apply to exports to destinations listed in Section 126.1 of the ITAR which are prohibited by a United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a [[Page 6112]]license for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, i.e., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria).    This rule amends Part 123 to add a new Section 123.27 to reduce the burden on individual users of cryptographic products by providing an exemption for the temporary export for personal use of products covered by Category XIII(b)(1) when the product remains in the possession of the exporter or the possession of another U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident traveling with him/her. For purposes of this exemption, a product is considered to be in the possession of the exporter if the exporter takes normal precautions to ensure the security of the product by locking the product in a hotel room, safe, or other comparably secure location; and, while in transit, the exporter keeps the product in his/her carry-on luggage or locked in baggage accompanying the exporter which has been checked with the carrier.    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States and thus is excluded from the procedures of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) and 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554.    However, interested parties are invited to submit written comments to the Department of State, Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Attn: Regulatory Change, Personal Use Cryptographic Products, Room 200, SA-6, Washington, DC 20520-0602.    This rule affects collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq), and will serve to reduce the burden on exporters by adding an exemption which will remove the current requirement for a license.Paperwork Reduction Act    The record-keeping requirement contained in section 123.27(b) has been approved by OMB and has a control number of 1405-0103. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number.List of Subjects22 CFR Part 123    Arms and munitions, Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.22 CFR Part 126    Arms and munitions, Exports.    Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, title 22, chapter I, subchapter M, of the Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as set forth below:PART 123--LICENSES FOR THE EXPORT OF DEFENSE ARTICLES    1. The authority citation for part 123 continues to read as follows:    Authority: Secs. 2 and 38, Pub. L. 90-629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778); E.O. 11958, 42 FR 4311, 3 CFR 1977 Comp. 79; 22 U.S.C. 2658.    2. A new Sec. 123.27 is added to read as follows:Sec. 123.27  Temporary export for personal use of Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic products.    (a) District Directors of Customs may permit a U.S. citizen or a U.S. person who is a lawful permanent resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) to temporarily export from the United States without a license not more than one each of any unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic hardware product and not more than a single copy of each type of unclassified Category XIII(b)(1) cryptographic software product provided that:    (1) The software product(s) are to be used only on a simultaneously temporarily exported Category XIII(b)(1) hardware product or a simultaneously exported item on the Commerce Control List (CCL); and    (2) The cryptographic products covered by Category XIII(b)(1) are not destined for export to a destination listed in Sec. 126.1 of the ITAR (22 CFR 126.1) which is prohibited by a United Nations Security Council Resolution or to which the export (or for which the issuance of a license for the export) would be prohibited by a U.S. statute (e.g., by Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2780, to countries that have been determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism--currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria); and    (3)(i) The encryption products remain in the possession of the exporting person or the possession of another U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident traveling with him/her, are for their exclusive use and not for copying, demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export or transfer of ownership or control. The export of cryptographic products identified in Category XIII(b)(1) in any other circumstances, for example, those in which a person contemplates sales, marketing, or demonstration must be licensed in accordance with policies and procedures established in this subchapter.    (ii) Special definition. For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, a product is considered to be in the possession of the exporter if:    (A) The exporter takes normal precautions to ensure the security of the product by locking the product in a hotel room, safe, or other comparably secure location; and    (B) While in transit, the exporter keeps the product in his/her carry-on luggage or locked in baggage accompanying the exporter which has been checked with the carrier; and    (4) At the time of export from the U.S. and import into the U.S., the cryptographic products are with the individual's accompanying baggage or effects. They may not be exported or imported in unaccompanied baggage, mailed or transmitted by any other means (e.g., electronically); and, the cryptographic products must be returned to the U.S. at the completion of the stay abroad; and    (5) The exporter, upon request of a U.S. Customs officer, will submit the products to inspection at the time of export and/or import.    (b) Use of this exemption requires the exporter, in lieu of filing a Shippers' Export Declaration, to maintain, for a period of 5 years from the date of each temporary export, a record of that temporary export and the subsequent import. Included in this record must be a self certification that the individual complied with the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section and a self certification that he/she has no reason to believe that any of the temporarily exported cryptographic products were stolen, lost, copied, sold or otherwise compromised or transferred while abroad. The record should include the following information: A description of the unclassified cryptographic products; the countries entered, including the dates of entry and exit for each foreign country; and, the dates of temporary export from and subsequent import into the United States.    (c) In any instance where a product exported under this exemption is stolen, lost, copied, sold or otherwise compromised or transferred while abroad, the exporting person must, within 10 days of his/her return to the United States, report the incident to the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Washington, D.C. 20520-0602. Also, any person who knows or has reason to know that cryptographic products exported under [[Page 6113]]this exemption are being transferred, exported, or used for any other activity which must be licensed or otherwise authorized in writing by the Department of State, should immediately inform the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Washington D.C. 20520-0602.PART 126--GENERAL POLICIES AND PROVISIONS    1. The authority citation for part 126 continues to read as follows:    Authority: Secs. 2, 38, 40, 42 and 71, Arms Export Control Act, Pub.

The Administration seems determined to ensure government surveillance of all electronic information and communications. It began with President Clinton's "Clipper Chip," but has not stopped. Consumers aren't happy with these proposals, and neither is the business community nor civil libertarians. In fact, it's hard to find anyone supportive outside the Administration except for the that would benefit from the Administration's "proposed relaxation" of the nation's export policy. The Administration refuses to let American computer hardware and software companies sell products with good encryption worldwide unless the U.S. Government is guaranteed access to a key that unlocks that information. The Administration is trying to leverage these companies' need to export -- they derive more than half their earnings from sales abroad -- and desire to develop a single product worldwide, to force them to include a feature in products they sell in the U.S. and abroad that will allow government access. Administration officials also have said that if American companies do not 'voluntarily" include such a feature, then they will seek legislation making such a feature mandatory. The Administration's approach is the wrong policy for today's marketplace. It's anti-consumer. Computer users will not entrust their sensitive information to computer networks unless its security and privacy are assured. Without good privacy protection, there simply will not be a Global Information Infrastructure -- and America won't be in the lead. It's anti-marketplace. There is no consumer demand for encryption products that give the government easy access. The Administration has come forward with a typical big-government approach -- a government designed solution for a government problem. This completely overlooks the realities of a free-market. It is anti-American business. The Administration's current policies are seriously harming the continued competitiveness of one of our fastest growing and most successful industries -- the computer hardware and software industry. Computer users are demanding good encryption but American companies are not allowed to supply it. Yet there are hundreds of foreign encryption products manufactured and encryption programs are widely available on the Internet. Finally, it is anti-progress. Wishing that there was no encryption available will not make it so. The technology is widely understood and available -- you can't put this genie back in the bottle. Government policies should not encumber the American computing industry as it leads the world technology revolution. We strongly urge you to oppose attempts to limit the ability of Americans to use whatever encryption they wish and to support the immediate relaxation of harmful export controls on American products and programs with encryption features.

With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally available today in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on World Wide Web sites or usenet newsgroups. If signed by President Clinton as expected, this bill will transform the Internet overnight from the freest communications medium to the most heavily regulated medium in the United States. CDT believes this legislation is unconstitutional. We are committed to challenging it in the courts at the earliest possible opportunity.Despite the sustained effort over the past 12 months by Senators Leahy (D-VT), Feingold (D-WI), and Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA), Rick White (R-WA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) to defeat the bill, the House passed the measure on a vote of 414 - 16, while the Senate concurred a few hours later on a vote of 91 - 5. Ironically, the vote comes exactly one year to the day that Senator Exon (D-NE) originally introduced the proposal (2/1/95).CONGRESS MAKES CRIMINALS OF MOST INTERNET USERSThe Communications Decency Act, enacted as part of a massive telecommunications reform legislation, will impose $250,000 fines and prison terms for anyone who posts "indecent" material, including the "7 dirty words", the text of classic works of fiction such as The Catcher In The Rye or Ulysses, artwork containing images of nudes, or rap lyrics, in a public forum. CDT strongly opposes this legislation. We believe the bill threatens the very existence of the Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political discourse. The bill is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans. Although the free speech rights of Internet users and the free flow of information online received a major setback today, the battle is far from over.  President Clinton is expected to sign the legislation in the coming days.  Several civil liberties and public interest advocacy groups, including CDT, People for the American Way, EFF, and the ACLU are already preparing to challenge these new restrictions in court.  Other affected entities, including commercial content providers, Internet Service Providers, and the commercial online services industries, are also expected to mount court challenges to this legislation.  CDT is confident that the courts will find the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional and reject it outright.INTERNET COMMUNITY ACTIVISM MADE A CRITICAL DIFFERENCEAlthough the CDA passed by Congress today represents a significant threat to the viability of the Internet and the free speech rights of individual users, the efforts of the Internet.community to mobilize against the bill kept it from being a lot worse.  The Christian Coalition, with the support of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-IL), fought hard to hold online service providers criminally liable for materials generated by their subscribers. Fortunately, these efforts were not successful. Holding providers liable would have forced them to pre-screen all material on their networks, or, worse yet, shut down entire parts of their services for fear of massive fines and prison sentences. The Christian Coalition was also unsuccessful in their efforts to remove provisions encouraging the development and deployment of parental control applications. Due to the efforts of the 115,000 Internet users who signed the petition against the CDA, the more than 20,000 users who in one day flooded Congress with phone calls, faxes, and email messages, and those who throughout 1995 regularly called their Congresspeople to express concerns about the various proposals, the Internet community showed itself to be a true political force with real influence over the legislative process.  Although we did not accomplish all of our most important objectives, we have become a powerful force.  This is not the last time Congress will consider issues vital to the interests of Internet users across the United States. We must never loose sight of the fact that, despite the apparent defeat today, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done.SEVERAL KEY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF INTERNET USERSAlthough a majority of Congress today demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the Internet and the implications of the Communications Decency Act, several members deserve credit for standing up for freedom of speech and the free flow of information online.  During the course of the debate over the last year on the CDA, Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Russ Feingold (D-WI), along with Representatives Chris Cox (R-CA), Rick White (R-WA), Michael Oxley (R-OH), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA), showed courage and conviction by working to support enlightened alternatives to government content restrictions.  These members have shown themselves to be friends of the Internet, and we look forward to working with them on other issues which lie ahead.ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT PASSED TODAYThe legislation approved today was not changed from a previous version released December 21, 1995 (See CDT Policy Post No. 33).  Briefly, the proposal contains several troubling elements.  Among other things, the bill: * Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency"   standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))* Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making   indecent material available for display in a manner available to a   minor (including World Wide Web pages, ftp sites, or usenet   newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).* No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill   prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the    Internet or other interactive media.* Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial   activities such as free-nets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers   (Sec 502 (h)).* Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer,   the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec   508).The full text of the bill, along with other relevant background information (including final vote tallies when available) can be found at CDT's Internet Censorship Issues Web Page (http://www.cdt.org/cda.html).As CDT prepares to fight this issue in court, we will continue to update you on our progress as information becomes available.

During much of this century the mass media,particularly radio and television, have been characterized by alimited number of speakers transmitting programming andinformation to essentially passive audiences.  The communicationsmedium of the twenty-first century -- the Internet and"cyberspace" generally -- is changing that, and will allowhundreds of millions of individuals to engage in interactivecommunication, on a national and global scale never beforepossible.  The public square of the past -- with pamphleteering,soap boxes, and vigorous debate -- is being replaced by theInternet, which enables average citizens to participate innational discourse, publish a newspaper, distribute an electronicpamphlet to the world, and generally communicate to and with abroader audience than ever before possible.  It also enablesaverage citizens to gain access to a vast and literally world-wide range of information, while simultaneously protecting theirprivacy, because in this new medium individuals receive only thecommunications they affirmatively request.          2.  In enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996(to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223) (the "Act"), Congressacknowledged that the Internet represents "an extraordinaryadvance in the availability of educational and informationalresources to our citizens," and acknowledged that interactivecomputer services "offer users a great degree of control over theinformation that they receive."  Congress therefore declared"[i]t is the policy of the United States . . . to promote thecontinued development of the Internet and other interactivecomputer services; [and] to preserve the vibrant and competitivefree market that presently exists for the Internet and otherinteractive computer services, unfettered by Federal or Stateregulation."  Act  509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  230). Unfortunately, as we will show, provisions of the Act that wereintended only to protect minors from communications deemedinappropriate for them will have the effect, perhaps unintended,of depriving adults of communications that are appropriate, andindisputably constitutionally protected, for them.  Because ofthe way the Internet works, the Act's prohibition ofcommunications that may be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for minors will effectively ban those samecommunications between adults, reducing the adult population incyberspace to only what is appropriate for minors.  The bannedspeech includes valuable works of literature and art, informationabout health and medical issues, and examples of popular culture. It also includes robust human discourse about politics, currentevents, and personal matters that may at times include harsh,provocative, or even vulgar language, all of which isconstitutionally protected for adults.          3.  Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individualsand entities from the computer and communications industries andthe general public who are harmed by the Act.  Plaintiffs includepublishers and creators of content on the Internet; "onlineservices," "Internet service providers," libraries, and otherswho provide access or connection to the Internet; and speakers,listeners, and users on the Internet.  The Act's effective ban ofa broad category of communication that is constitutionallyprotected for adults directly harms the First Amendment rights ofplaintiffs, and of the tens of millions of adult speakers andlisteners who are "online" and linked through this newcommunications medium.  Plaintiffs also include parents, who seekto protect the rights of parents to decide what is appropriatefor their children to receive through interactive computercommunications.          4.  The speech at issue in this case does not includeobscenity, child pornography, harassing speech, speech intendedto entice or lure minors into inappropriate activity, or otherspeech that lacks First Amendment protection even for adults. This complaint does not challenge governmental regulation ofthose categories of non-protected speech, and the relief soughtherein will not affect the government's ability to prosecute thecommunication of those categories of speech, all of which arealready prohibited by existing law.           5.  The most sweeping provision of the Act, Section502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(d)), prohibits the"display" of material deemed "patently offensive" "in a manneravailable to a person under 18 years of age" (emphasis added). That provision is subject to certain defenses, which the sponsorof the Act and Congress apparently believed would enable speakersto restrict access by minors while simultaneously permittingaccess by adults.  But those defenses, which were merely liftedfrom the "dial-a-porn" laws, simply do not work in the quitedifferent medium of cyberspace.  Because of the manner in whichinformation is stored, transmitted, and received on the Internet,this provision has the (perhaps unintended) result of banningspeech between adults that is suitable and constitutionallyprotected for adults.          6.  The Act is also unconstitutional because there arealternative ways of protecting minors from material inappropriatefor them that would not abridge the First Amendment rights ofadults, and would be more effective in protecting minors than themechanism Congress imposed.  The speaker-based blocking requiredby the Act will not protect minors from access to words andimages posted on the Internet abroad by foreign speakers, who arenot effectively subject to prosecution under the Act, or even bydomestic speakers who intentionally or inadvertently violate theAct.  But user-based blocking technology enables parents andother users to block or screen whatever words or images they deeminappropriate, regardless of where posted, at little or no cost. For these reasons, every application of the Act unnecessarily andunconstitutionally abridges the First Amendment rights of adults,and does so even though there are less drastic alternatives thatwould be more protective of minors.                     JURISDICTION AND VENUE          7.

FACTS   Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace          31.  The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. It is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smallergroups of linked computer networks:  a network of networks.  Thisis best understood if one considers what a linked group ofcomputers -- referred to here as a "network" -- is, and what itdoes.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often called"local area networks").  For example, in many United StatesCourthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purposeof exchanging files and messages (and to share equipment such asprinters).  These are networks.  In the language of the Act,these networks would each be termed an "interactive computerservice."          32.  Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked toother computers or networks (although the Act still directlyapplies to such closed local area networks).  Many networks,however, are connected to other networks, which are in turnconnected to other networks in a manner which permits eachcomputer in any network to communicate with computers on anyother network in the system.  This global web of linked networksand computers is the Internet.          33.  This amalgam of computers and computer networks --some owned by governmental and public institutions, some owned bynon-profit organizations, and some privately owned -- lacks anycentral control or supervision.  The resulting whole is adecentralized, unrestricted global medium of communications -- or"cyberspace" -- that links individuals, institutions,corporations, and governments around the world.  Thiscommunications medium allows any of the literally tens ofmillions of people with access to the Internet to exchange ideas,research, software, poetry, images, literature, sound, or simpleelectronic mail with others on the Internet.  Thesecommunications can occur virtually instantaneously, and can bedirected either to specific individuals, to a broader group ofindividuals interested in a particular subject, or to the worldas a whole.          34.  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as anexperimental project of the Advanced Research Project Agency("ARPA").  First called ARPANET, the network linked computers andcomputer networks owned by the military, defense contractors, anduniversity laboratories conducting defense-related research.  Thenetwork later allowed researchers across the country to accessdirectly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located ata few key universities and laboratories.  As it evolved farbeyond its research origins in the United States to encompassuniversities, corporations, and individuals around the world, theARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally justthe "Internet."          35.  From its inception, the network was designed to bea decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant linksbetween computers and computer networks, capable of rapidlytransmitting communications without direct human involvement orcontrol, and with the automatic ability to re-routecommunications if one or more individual links were damaged orotherwise unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant, self-healing system of linked computers was designed to allow vitalresearch and communications to continue even if portions of thenetwork were damaged.          36.  To achieve this resilient nationwide (andultimately global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouragedthe creation of multiple links to and from each computer (orcomputer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located inWashington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicatedtelephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or onthe Eastern seaboard.  Each of those computers would in turn belinked to numerous other computers, which themselves would belinked to other computers.          37.  A communication sent over this redundant series oflinked computers could travel any of dozens of routes to itsdestination.  Thus, a message sent from a computer in Washington,D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might first be sentto a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to acomputer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and SaltLake City, before finally reaching Palo Alto.  If the messagecould not travel along that path (because of military attack,simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message wouldautomatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) bere-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and thento Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, andfinally to Palo Alto.  This type of transmission, and re-routing,would likely occur in a matter of seconds.          38.  At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (itsubsequently ceased to exist), similar decentralized networksdeveloped to link universities, research facilities, businesses,and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loosenetworks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. Eventually, each of these networks (many of which wereoverlapping) were themselves linked together, allowing users ofany computers linked to any one of the networks to transmitcommunications to users of computers on other networks.  It isthis series of linked networks (themselves linking computers andcomputer networks) that is commonly known today as the Internet.          39.  No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, ornon-profit -- controls, governs, or runs the Internet.  It existsand functions solely as a result of the fact that hundreds ofthousands of separate operators of computers and computernetworks independently decided to use a common data transferprotocol to exchange communications and information with othercomputers (which in turn exchange communications and informationwith still other computers).  There is no centralized storagelocation, control point, or communications channel for theInternet, and it would be impossible for any single entity toregulate the information conveyed on the Internet.          40.  The nature of the Internet is such that it isimpossible to determine its size.  However, it is indisputablethat the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in thepast few years.  In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked tothe Internet, and by 1989, the number stood at fewer than 90,000computers.  By 1993, however, over 1,000,000 computers werelinked.  Today, it is estimated that over 9,400,000 hostcomputers worldwide are linked to the Internet, and this countdoes not include the tens of millions of personal computers usedby individuals to access the Internet using modems (as detailedbelow).  In all, reasonable estimates are that over 40 millionindividuals around the world can and do access the enormouslyflexible communication medium of the Internet.  That figure isexpected to grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.               How Individuals Access the Internet          41.  Individuals have a wide variety of avenues toaccess cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular.  Interms of physical access, there are two common methods toestablish an actual link to the Internet.  First, an individualcan use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (andusually permanently) connected to a computer network that isitself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  Second,an individual can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" toconnect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computernetwork that is itself directly or indirectly connected to theInternet.  As detailed below, both direct and modem connectionsare made available to individuals by a wide variety of academic,governmental, or commercial entities.          42.  Students, faculty, researchers, and othersaffiliated with the vast majority of colleges and universities inthe United States can access the Internet through theireducational institutions.  Such access is often via directconnection using computers located in campus libraries, offices,or computer centers, or may be through telephone access using amodem from a student's or professor's campus or off-campuslocation.  Internet access is considered to be so important tothe modern educational process that many colleges anduniversities install "ports" or outlets for direct networkconnections in each dormitory room or provide access viacomputers located in common areas in dormitories.  Such accessenables students and professors to use information and contentprovided by the college or university itself, and to use the vastamount of research resources and other information available onthe Internet worldwide.          43.  Similarly, Internet resources and access aresufficiently important to many corporations and other employersthat those employers link their office computer networks to theInternet and provide employees with direct or modem access to theoffice network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access isespecially important, for example, to any corporation involved inscientific or medical research or manufacturing to enablecorporate employees to exchange information and ideas withacademic researchers in their fields.          44.  Individuals who lack access to the Internetthrough their schools or employers still have a variety of waysthey can access the Internet.  Many communities across thecountry have established "free-nets" or community networks toprovide their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and toprovide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The firstsuch community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community ComputerSystem, was established in 1986, and free-nets now exist inscores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia,Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at littleor no cost via modem connection or by using computers availablein community buildings.  Free-nets are often operated by a locallibrary, educational institution, or non-profit community group.          45.  Individuals can also access the Internet throughmany local libraries.  Libraries often offer patrons use ofcomputers that are linked to the Internet.  In addition, somelibraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet. Increasingly, patrons are using library services and resourceswithout ever physically entering the library itself.  Such director modem access is typically provided by libraries at no cost tothe individual user.          46.  Individuals can also access the Internet bypatronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer coffeeshops," where customers -- while they drink their coffee -- canuse computers provided by the shop to access the Internet.  SuchInternet access is typically provided by the shop for a smallhourly fee.          47.  Individuals can also access the Internet throughcommercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" thattypically offer modem telephone access to a computer or computernetwork linked to the Internet.  Many such providers -- includingthe members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange Association-- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a modestmonthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however,are non-profit organizations that offer free or very low costaccess to the Internet.  For example, the International InternetAssociation offers free modem access to the Internet uponrequest.  Also, an increasing number of trade or other non-profitassociations offer Internet access as a service to members.          48.  Another simple and common way that individuals canaccess the Internet is through one of the major nationalcommercial "online services" such as America Online, Apple'seWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  Theseonline services offer nationwide computer networks (so thatsubscribers can dial-in to a local telephone number), and theservices provide extensive and well organized content withintheir own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowingaccess to the extensive content available within each onlineservice, the services also allow subscribers to link to the muchlarger resources of the Internet.  Full access to the onlineservice (including access to the Internet) can be obtained formodest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial onlineservices have almost twelve million individual subscribers acrossthe United States.          49.  In addition to using the national commercialonline services, individuals can also access the Internet usingsome (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in computerservices, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs."  Withan investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of atelephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacygroups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer"bulletin board" service where friends, members, subscribers, orcustomers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range fromsingle computers with only one telephone line into the computer(allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with manytelephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneoususers), to multiple linked computers each servicing multipledial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users). Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirectlinks to the Internet.  Some BBS systems charge individuals anominal fee for access, while many others are free to theindividual users.           50.  Although commercial access to the Internet isgrowing rapidly, many individual users of the Internet -- such ascollege students and staff -- do not individually pay for access(except to the extent, for example, the cost of computer servicesis a component of college tuition).  These and other Internetusers can access the Internet without any requirement that theyprovide a credit card or other form of payment.          51.  In part because the Internet is an unregulated"network of networks" with literally millions of access pointsand tens of millions of users, individual Internet users often donot have their own "username" or identification code that wouldindicate to others on the Internet the identity of the user. Many users access the Internet anonymously or through a methodthat would not allow for clear identification by a remote contentprovider.            Methods to Communicate over the Internet          52.  Once an individual has access to the Internet,there are a wide variety of different methods of communicationand information exchange over the network.  These numerousmethods of communication and information retrieval are constantlyevolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely. The most common methods of communications on the Internet (aswell as within the major online services) can be roughly groupedinto six categories:  one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"),one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"), distributed messagedatabases (such as "USENET newsgroups"), real time communication(such as "Internet Relay Chat"), real time remote computerutilization (such as "telnet"), and remote information retrieval(such as "ftp," "gopher," and the "World Wide Web").  Most ofthese methods of communication can be used to transmit text,data, computer programs, sound, or visual images.          53.  One-to-one messaging.  The simplest method ofcommunication on the Internet is via electronic mail, or "e-mail," the modern equivalent to a first class letter.  Anindividual can address and transmit a message to one or morespecific other individuals.  E-mail on the Internet is not routedthrough any central control point, and can take numerous andvarying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail, simple e-mail is not "sealed" or secure, and can be accessed or viewed onintermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unlessthe message is encrypted).          54.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also containsautomatic mailing list services (such as "listserv") that allowsimple and efficient communications about particular subjects ofinterest.  For example, individuals can subscribe to a "listserv"mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  Theindividual can submit messages on the topic to the listserv thatare automatically forwarded (via e-mail) to anyone who hassubscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a messagecan reply to the message and have the reply also distributed toeveryone on the mailing list.  This service provides thecapability to keep abreast of developments or events in aparticular subject area.  Most listserv-type mailing listsautomatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing listsubscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list serviceson the Internet, collectively with hundreds of thousands ofsubscribers.          55.  Distributed message databases.  Similar infunction to listservs -- but quite different in howcommunications are transmitted -- are distributed messagedatabases such as "USENET newsgroups."  Like listservs,newsgroups are open discussions and exchanges on particulartopics.  Users, however, need not subscribe to the discussionmailing list in advance, but can instead access the database atany time.  An individual user can post a message to a newsgroup,and the message is then automatically forwarded to all othercomputers that furnish access to the newsgroups (but not to anyindividual users).  The messages are temporarily stored on eachreceiving computer, where they are available for review andresponse.  The messages are automatically and periodically purgedfrom each system to make room for new messages.  Responses tomessages -- like the original messages -- are automaticallydistributed to all other computers receiving the newsgroup. There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand differentsubjects.  In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted tonewsgroups each day, and those messages were distributed to theapproximately 190,000 computers or computer networks thatparticipate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Messages posted tonewsgroups are not stored on or channelled through any centralcomputer or location.          56.  Real time communication.  In addition totransmitting messages that can be later read or accessed,individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate dialog --in "real time" -- with other individuals on the Internet.  In itssimplest forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and"Internet Relay Chat" allows two or more individuals to typemessages to each other that almost immediately appear on theother individuals' computer screens.  In addition, commercialonline services such as America Online, CompuServe, eWorld, theMicrosoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat" systemsallowing their members to converse.           57.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Anothermethod to utilize information on the Internet is to access andcontrol remote computers using "telnet."  For example, usingtelnet, a researcher at a university would be able to utilize thecomputing power of a supercomputer located at a differentuniversity.  A student can use telnet to connect to a remotelibrary to access the library's online card catalog program.  Or,individuals can link via telnet to a computer to interactdirectly and communicate with other users linked to the samecomputer.  Accessing a computer via telnet occurs in "real time,"and content and communication accessed via telnet is oftencreated only at the time of the communication.          58.  Remote information retrieval.  The final majorcategory of communication may be the most important and wellknown use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval ofinformation located on remote computers.  There are numerousmethods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet.  Asimple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to list thenames of computer files available on a remote computer, and totransfer one or more of those files to an individual's localcomputer.  Another approach uses a program and format named"gopher" to guide an individual's search through the resourcesavailable on a remote computer.  A third approach, and fastbecoming the most well known on the Internet, is the "World WideWeb."  The Web utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language calledhypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" theWeb can display HTML documents containing text, images, andsound.  Any HTML document can include links to other types ofinformation or resources, so that while viewing an HTML documentthat, for example, describes resources available on the Internet,an individual can "click" using a computer mouse on thedescription of the resource and be immediately connected to theresource itself.  Such "hyperlinks" allow information to beaccessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allowindividuals to locate and efficiently view related informationeven if the information is stored on numerous computers allaround the world.          59.  With the exception of point-to-point mail, noinformation flows through cyberspace to a particular individualunless the individual requests the information.  Listservs,newsgroups, chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the World WideWeb all require an affirmative request by the Internet user priorto the user receiving information over the Internet.  Further-more, when a user makes such an affirmative request it is usuallyclear what type of content will be delivered.  Thus, unlike radioor television, there is no significant risk that a user will be"assaulted" with unsolicited and undesired content.          60.  The vast majority of transmissions of content fromspecific sites on the Internet are in response to electronicrequests the user could not have anticipated more than a fewseconds or moments before making the request.  Becauseinformation is located on millions of computers around the world,with no central organization or control, a user cannot possiblyknow which computers might have useful information until startinga search.  Instead, the user could access any of dozens ofdifferent search databases, obtain a list of sites that might beof interest, and then immediately link to one or more of thesites.  Indeed, the very theory of "hyperlinks" and the hypertextmarkup language (HTML) (the foundation of the World Wide Web) isthat the user can jump from site to site to site without everneeding to know where physically in the world the next site islocated.  Thus, there is no way for a user to pre-register withevery computer that might contain useful content on a particulartopic.  Moreover, when an individual is researching a topic onthe Internet, he or she might access dozens of newsgroups, telnetcomputers, and ftp, gopher, and Web sites around the world in amatter of minutes.  If a researcher was required to requestaccess from content providers prior to actually viewing theinformation (and prove to the provider that the researcher wasnot a minor), the Internet would be transformed from a dynamicand instantaneous content searching tool into a cumbersome,multi-step, much slower, and much less useful research tool.  Thevibrancy and immediacy that sparked the Internet's recentextraordinary expansion and development would be lost.          61.  The inability to predict where on the Internet auser would want to access information is not limited to research,and applies equally to any attempt by a user to accessinformation on the Internet when the individual does not know inadvance the precise location of that information.  There aremillions of computers on the Internet that contain content, andit would be practically and economically impossible for the tensof millions of Internet users to pre-register with each of thosemillions of content sites, and equally impossible for thosemillions of content sites to maintain and instantaneously updatelists of registered users.          62.  For both the speaker and the listener,communications on the Internet bear virtually no similarity tocommunications on television and radio.  With radio andtelevision, the number of speakers is limited by the availablespectrum, the ability to speak is limited by the high cost ofspeaking, and listeners are merely passive recipients of thecommunications.  With the Internet, the number of speakers isboundless, anyone can speak for pennies a day (or for free at hisor her public library), and listeners can respond and engage thespeaker in an interactive and on-going dialogue.  Furthermore,unlike television and radio, on the Internet viewers andlisteners generally receive only the communications theyaffirmatively request, and are not a passive or "captive"audience.  Moreover, unlike with television and radio, on theInternet a speaker can reach the entire world (at no additionalcost) yet at the same time can direct his or her speech toindividuals who share an interest in a particular subject.  Inthe twenty-first century, the Internet -- if allowed to flourishunhindered by government censorship -- can revive the now-little-used public square and convert it into a global medium ofcommunication and discourse.                     Content on the Internet          63.  The diversity of content on the Internet is asbroad as the Internet itself.  Content can be found on millionsof computers worldwide, and ranges from academic research to artto humor to literature to medical information to music to news tovirtually anything else.  Moreover, at any one time, the Internetserves as the communication medium for literally tens ofthousands of global conversations, political debates, and socialdialogues.  For example, on the Internet, one can view the fulltext of the Bible, all of the works of Shakespeare, and numerousother classic works of literature.  One can browse throughpaintings from museums around the world, or view in close-updetail the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or see the latestphotographs transmitted by the Jupiter space probe.  One can evenhear pieces of music or view clips of movies and videos over theInternet.          64.  There is a significant amount of content on theInternet that could be considered "indecent" for minors in somecommunities in the United States, but which most people wouldconsider to be extremely valuable and appropriate for adults, andwhich, in any event, is constitutionally protected for adults. Such content includes, for example, great works of art andliterature (containing depictions and descriptions of nudes andsexual conduct), examples of modern popular culture (containingpopular music, lyrics, movie images, or literature with sexualcontent), medical information (containing depictions anddescriptions relating to child birth, sexually transmitteddiseases, and sexually related medical conditions), andhistorical and scientific information (containing, for example,accounts of historic criminal trials or other historical,sociological, and anthropological works).  Such content, andother content typically provided by non-commercial providers, iseffectively banned by the Act.          65.  The fear that some communities in the UnitedStates would conclude that this type of valuable material is"indecent" for minors is well founded.  Communities across thecountry have banned or sought to ban classic works of literature,such as Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, As I Lay Dying byWilliam Faulkner, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by MarkTwain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in theRye by J.D. Salinger, and I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by MayaAngelou, as "indecent" for minors.  Even the American HeritageDictionary and parts of the Bible have been attacked as being"indecent" for minors.  All of these works (some of which areavailable in whole or in part on the Internet), and works withsimilar content, are effectively banned by the Act.          66.  In addition to the above type of content that isbanned by the Act, a tremendous amount of common human discourseis banned by the Act.  In the course of conversations,discussions and debates, many citizens use language and imagerythat in some communities would be viewed as "indecent" forminors.  Vigorous and heated debate often occurs with harsh orvulgar words.  Many people, and many speakers on the Internet,use in common discourse words that describe "sexual or excretoryactivities or organs" in terms that might be deemed to be"patently offensive" for minors.  The use of vulgar words in adialog with friends -- which would be perfectly legal over thetelephone or in a letter or on a basketball court -- would beillegal under the Act if sent over the Internet.          67.  There are many examples on the Internet ofvaluable content that can be displayed only subject to the threatof criminal liability and prosecution.          68.  For example, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display ofwritten descriptions of sexual intercourse.          69.  There are available on the Internet importantworks of literature that include descriptions of sexualintercourse.          70.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display ofimages of nude men and/or women.          71.  There are available on the Internet numerousimportant works of art -- paintings, drawings and photographs bygreat masters and modern artists alike -- that depict nude menand/or women.  An example of such a work of art is Manet'sOlympia.          72.  Similarly, content providers would reasonably fearprosecution under the Act for engaging in a vigorous onlinedebate in which there is repeated use of the "seven dirty words"at issue in the decision in Federal Communications Commission v.Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).          73.  There are on the Internet -- on a daily basis --vigorous political, social, and other dialogues and debates thatinclude unrestricted use of one or more of the "seven dirtywords."          74.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the display on a World WideWeb "home page" of vulgar statements of the type at issue inCohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971).          75.  The Supreme Court has specifically held that theuse of the vulgar statement in Cohen is protected expression,even when displayed in public areas when children are present.          76.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the display of a parody thatmakes explicit assertions about the "sexual or excretoryactivities or organs" of a well known public figure, as was atissue in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988).          77.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Falwellthat a parody that made explicit assertions about the "sexual orexcretory activities or organs" of a well known public figure isprotected expression.          78.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonablyfear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display ofdetailed information concerning birth control and thetransmission of sexually transmitted diseases.          79.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Bolger v.Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), that suchcommunications are protected expression and can be mailed,unsolicited, into homes.          80.  There is a tremendous amount of valuable contenton the Internet that is constitutionally protected for adults,but is nevertheless subject to prosecution under the Act.                 The Statutory Language At Issue          81.  Signed into law on February 8, 1996, theCommunications Decency Act criminalizes the display anddistribution of constitutionally protected expressive material.          82.  The Act contains two primary criminal provisions. Violation of either provision is a felony, punishable by as muchas two years in prison and substantial fines.            83.  Section 502(2) of the Act, to be codified at 47U.S.C.  223(d), broadly prohibits knowingly using any"interactive computer service" to send to a specific person orpersons under 18 years of age, or to "display," "in a manneravailable to" a person under 18, certain "patently offensive"communications.  Section 502(2) provides, in pertinent part:(d) Whoever--   (1) in interstate or foreign communications   knowingly--         (A) uses an interactive computer service to      send to a specific person or persons under 18      years of age, or         (B) uses any interactive computer service to      display in a manner available to a person under      18 years of age,    any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,   or other communication that, in context, depicts or   describes, in terms patently offensive as measured   by contemporary community standards, sexual or   excretory activities or organs, regardless of   whether the user of such service placed the call or   initiated the communication; or   (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications   facility under such person's control to be used for   an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the   intent that it be used for such activity, shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, orimprisoned not more than two years, or both.Act  502(2).          84.  "Interactive computer service" is defined as "anyinformation service, system, or access software provider thatprovides or enables computer access by multiple users to acomputer server, including specifically a service or system thatprovides access to the Internet and such systems operated orservices offered by libraries or educational institutions."  Act 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(h)(2)) referring toAct  509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  230(e)(2)).          85.  The terms "patently offensive," "contemporarycommunity standards," and "display" are nowhere defined in theAct.          86.  Another section of the Act, Section 502(1), to becodified at 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B), prohibits and criminalizesthe use of a "telecommunications device" knowingly to make orcreate and "initiate[] the transmission of, any comment, request,suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is. . . indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communicationis under 18 years of age."  Another provision of the same sectionmakes it a crime to "knowingly permit[] any telecommunicationsfacility under [a person's] control to be used for any activityprohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used forsuch activity."  Act  502(1) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 223(a)(2)).          87.  "Telecommunications device" is defined to excludean "interactive computer service."  Act  502(2) (to be codifiedat 47 U.S.C.  223(h)(1)(B)).          88.  The term "indecent" is not defined.          89.  The Act establishes several defenses a defendantmay assert in a criminal prosecution under the Act.  First, noperson shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d)solely for providing access or connection to or from afacility, system, or network not under that person'scontrol, including transmission, downloading,intermediate storage, access software, or other relatedcapabilities that are incidental to providing suchaccess or connection that does not include the creationof the content of the communication.Act  502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(1)).          90.  The phrase "not under that person's control" isnowhere defined in the Act.          91.  This defense is not available "to a person who isa conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation orknowing distribution of communications that violate this section,or who knowingly advertises the availability of suchcommunications."  Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(2)). Nor is this defense available to "a person who provides access orconnection to a facility, system, or network engaged in theviolation . . . that is owned or controlled by such person."  Id.(to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(3)).  The level or natureof control is not defined.          92.  In addition, the Act provides a defense to acriminal prosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) foruse of a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if thedefendant(A)   has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective,and appropriate actions under the circumstances torestrict or prevent access by minors to a communicationspecified in such subsections, which may involve anyappropriate measures to restrict minors from suchcommunications, including any method which is feasibleunder available technology; or(B)   has restricted access to such communication byrequiring use of a verified credit card, debit account,adult access code, or adult personal identificationnumber.Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(5)).  Congress did notprovide any details as to what might be considered a "good faith,reasonable, effective, and appropriate action[]."  Congress didallow the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") to promulgatenonbinding guidelines as to what might be an "appropriateaction," but it now appears that even those guidelines will notbe issued until sometime in 1997 at the earliest, and compliancewith the guidelines will not insulate speakers from prosecutionor conviction under the Act.          93.  Congress made no findings in connection withenacting Section 502 of the Act.  Congress made no findings as toits purpose or interest in criminalizing online communication of"indecent" or "patently offensive" materials to, or that would beavailable to, persons under age 18.  In considering the Act,Congress made no inquiry into or findings regarding the extent towhich such materials were available to persons under 18. Congress made no inquiry into or findings whether the meansCongress chose to address whatever interest it had wouldsubstantially further that interest.  Congress made no inquiryinto or findings whether any less restrictive means wouldsubstantially further its interest.          94.  In another section of the Act, however, Congressdid make the following relevant findings:   (1) The rapidly developing array of Internet andother interactive computer services available toindividual Americans represent an extraordinary advancein the availability of educational and informationalresources to our citizens.   (2) These services offer users a great degree ofcontrol over the information that they receive, as wellas the potential for even greater control in the futureas technology develops.   (3) The Internet and other interactive computerservices offer a forum for a true diversity ofpolitical discourse, unique opportunities for culturaldevelopment, and myriad avenues for intellectualactivity.   (4) The Internet and other interactive computerservices have flourished, to the benefit of allAmericans, with a minimum of government regulation.   (5) Increasingly Americans are relying oninteractive media for a variety of political,educational, cultural, and entertainment services.Act  509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.  230(a)) (emphasisadded).              The Impact of the Act on the Internet          95.  Because of the realities of the Internet, the Acteffects a total ban on certain constitutionally protected speechto adults.  The Act reduces discourse on major portions of theInternet to that which is appropriate for a young child.          96.  Virtually all of the tens of millions of users ofthe Internet -- except those who at all times stand mute in thediscourse that occurs on the Internet -- are content providerswho are subject to the terms of the Act.  An individual is acontent provider subject to the Act if he sends a single e-mail,or participates in a listserv discussion, or contributes to aUSENET newsgroup, or responds to a survey on the World Wide Web,or establishes a personal "home page" on the Web, or converseswith a friend through a real time service, or simply places afile in a publicly available area of a computer or network.            97.  In other words, virtually any use of the Internetmakes someone a content provider subject to the criminalpenalties of the Act.  Commercial content providers -- whotypically require a credit card for users' payment -- may be ableto use the credit card defense allowed by the Act.  But for non-commercial content providers, who are responsible for a majorpart of communications on the Internet, there is no practical waythe speaker can control who can access the message.  Thus, forthe vast majority of speech on the Internet, it is impossible forthe speaker to prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in amanner available" to a person under 18.  Act  502(2).          98.  Because of this impossibility, Section 502(2) ofthe Act effectively requires that almost all discourse on theInternet be at a level suitable for young children.  Thisprovision has the effect of a flat ban on an entire category ofconstitutionally protected speech between adults.          99.  As used by millions of people daily, the primarymethods to access information on the Internet do not permitindividual or non-commercial content providers to control who onthe Internet can access their content.  From the perspective ofthe content provider, information that is publicly available onthe Internet is available to all users of the Internet, evenusers who might be minors.            100.  None of the major methods of accessinginformation -- including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups,chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher, and the World Wide Web -- hasthe ability to track the millions of individuals who access theInternet and screen out those who are under eighteen years ofage.  Although password-required access to content is possible(and is used in some circumstances), a password-access systemwould effectively remove from public access an enormous volume ofvaluable content on the Internet, and would reduce theinformation available to adults on the Internet to only contentdeemed suitable for minors.          101.  The vast majority of content providers on theInternet are individuals who post messages to newsgroups andlistservs, and who create content on the World Wide Web.  Thoseindividual content providers could not possibly create andmaintain a database of specific Internet users who request accessto the content and who prove they are 18 or older.  Nor couldindividuals or other non-commercial content providers practicallyadminister or economically afford an instantaneous credit cardverification system.  Such a requirement would effectivelypreclude any communications by those content providers that couldbe deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors.          102.  Even larger organizations that provide content onthe Internet cannot practically or economically track themillions of Internet users to determine whether those users areminors or adults.            103.  Moreover, even if pre-registration by contentusers were practically or economically possible, the value of thecontent would be dramatically diminished because so few contentusers would anticipate the need to pre-register for a particularsite.  A huge percentage of Internet traffic is by users engagedin spontaneous and unpredictable research or searches forcontent, and a pre-registration requirement would effectively endthis type of search.           104.  As described above, the World Wide Web is aspontaneous and serendipitous communications medium, in which auser can jump from site to site to site depending on what contentlooks most useful or interesting, without any pre-registration oradvance request.  Requiring pre-registration for all sites thatmight contain content arguably covered by the Act (if such pre-registration were practically possible) would drastically reducethe usefulness of the World Wide Web.          105.  For other methods of providing content on theInternet, it is flatly impossible for a content provider tocontrol who can access the content.  With USENET newsgroups, forexample, once a content provider posts a message to a newsgroup,that message is automatically distributed to over 190,000computers around the world, and the individual content providerhas no ability whatsoever to control who is permitted to accessthe content on those 190,000 computers.  Under the Act, allcontent posted to USENET newsgroups must be reduced to a levelappropriate for young children.  Similarly, Internet mailing listservices such as "listserv" also do not allow the speaker tocontrol who receives the communication, and thus speech via amailing list service would also be reduced to the levelappropriate for young children.Ineffectiveness of the Act and Effectiveness of Alternative Means          106.  The overwhelming majority of content on theInternet is non-sexual in nature, and is not even arguably"indecent" or "patently offensive," even for minors.  However, asignificant amount of the content on the Internet could arguablybe deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in somecommunities, and the Act bans or burdens all of that content.          107.  Although imposing extreme burdens on theInternet, the Act will in fact have very little impact on theavailability to persons under 18 of "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" images or communications on the Internet.  At least inpart because Congress held no hearings on the Act, did notcollect information about how the Internet works, and onlyhaphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, the Act doesnot accomplish or even significantly further the ostensible goalof limiting access by persons under 18 to "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" images.  There are at least two reasons whyimplementation of the Act will be highly ineffective as alimitation on such access.          108.  First, a high percentage of sexual content on theInternet originates outside of the United States, and it is notpossible to prevent that content from being "available" in theUnited States.  To the extent the Act imposes any burdens ondomestic commercial providers of such communications, thoseproviders will have the option of moving their operationsoverseas.          109.  Second, the existence of "anonymous remailers"means that any content -- indecent or otherwise -- can be placedonto the Internet anonymously, and the government would be unableto identify the content provider.  Anonymous remailer systems --which often are located overseas -- will automatically receive acommunication and forward it to a destination after havingremoved all trace of the origin of the communication.          110.  At bottom, therefore, the Act does little tolimit the ability of commercial or non-commercial entities toprovide "indecent" or "patently offensive" images on theInternet.          111.  A critical difference between the Act's attemptto regulate indecency on the Internet and prior governmentalattempts to regulate indecency (over radio, television, andtelephone sex lines, for example) is that there are tens ofmillions of speakers on the Internet, with no bottleneck throughwhich all of the speech must pass.          112.  There are alternative means that are far moreeffective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" communications.  The only place where it ispractically possible to screen out commercial indecency, non-commercial indecency, domestic indecency, overseas indecency,intentional indecency, inadvertent indecency, and anonymousindecency is in the computer that is attempting to receive thespeech.          113.  The government's legitimate interest in aidingparental control over the Internet material their children accessmay be served by several means that are both less restrictive andmore effective than a blanket ban on "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" communications.  Parents have control over theirchildren's access to communications through interactive computerservices.  For example, parents can deny their child access tothe computer; parents can supervise their child's use ofinteractive computer services; parents can decline to subscribeto interactive computer services until their child is older;parents can take advantage of the free screening and blockingoptions available at no extra charge from commercial onlineservices; and parents can obtain software (some of it free, andmost of it for a very modest cost) for their home computers toscreen material they find objectionable.          114.  Commercial online services such as AmericaOnline, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offertechnologies that allow parents to block their children's accessto certain online forums and areas where children might beexposed to inappropriate content.  These online services, forexample, include a feature that allows parents to prevent theirchildren from accessing interactive discussion forums (chatrooms).  They also offer parents the ability to block access toall or portions of the Internet, including the World Wide Web andUSENET newsgroups, based on keywords, subject matter, or specificnewsgroups.  These tools can be configured to block access togroups based on any keyword.          115.  In addition, a variety of software providers havedeveloped applications to use in conjunction with commercialonline services, over and above the parental control featuresprovided by commercial services, while others are designedspecifically for direct access.  SurfWatch, for example, allowsparents to block their child's access to USENET newsgroups, WorldWide Web, gopher, and ftp sites with sexually explicit content. When activated with a private password held only by a parent,SurfWatch completely prevents any user from accessing theseareas.  The service automatically updates the list of blockedsites, without any intervention required from the user.  NETNANNY, another example, contains a dictionary in which the parentcan enter the names of sites that contain sexually explicit orother material.  Parents may also enter phrases which iftransmitted or received will automatically disconnect thenetwork.  Among other things, the program also keeps a log of allactivity that occurs on the computer, allowing parents to monitortheir children's use of the computer.          116.  Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server andWEBTrack provide schools and businesses the ability to blockspecific sites from access by all users on the network, and totrack and monitor use of the Internet.          117.  Because the Internet is a global network withmillions of users, speaker-based content restrictions cannoteffectively control the availability of materials inappropriatefor children.  The only effective way to protect children frominappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage thecontinued development and deployment of user-based tools thatempower parents to control their children's online activitiesbased on the parents' views of what is appropriate for theirchildren.  The products described here, and others like them,provide parents these tools, and can do so without the need forcriminalizing or banning the distribution to adults ofconstitutionally protected communications.       Speech of the Plaintiffs and the Impact of the Act          118.  The plaintiffs (and the plaintiffs' members,subscribers, patrons, and customers) interact with and use theInternet, and cyberspace generally, in a wide variety of ways,and they are burdened by the Act in an equally wide variety ofways.  Plaintiffs include content providers on the Internet,access providers to the Internet, and users of the content on theInternet.  The Act burdens plaintiffs in all of these capacities.          119.  Plaintiffs who are content providers (or whosemembers or customers are content providers) are expressly subjectto the Act.  Under the Act, anyone who speaks on the Internet isa content provider.  These plaintiffs do not understand whatstandard for indecency should be used under the Act, how thestandard applies to the plaintiffs' speech, or how numerous otherprovisions of the Act are to be understood and applied.  Theseplaintiffs provide content that would likely or possibly be foundto be indecent as to a young child in some communities. Accordingly, they are subject to prosecution under the Act. These plaintiffs will either self-censor their speech or willcontinue to speak under the threat of prosecution.          120.  Plaintiffs who are, or whose members are, accessproviders (including "Internet service providers" or "ISPs") areexpressly subject to the Act.  As access providers theseplaintiffs enable their customers and users to use plaintiffs'facilities to link to the Internet.  Although the Act providesdefenses for access providers, access providers reasonably fearthat these defenses will not be construed and applied as broadlyas Congress intended, and they therefore fear they may bedirectly subject to prosecution under the Act.  These plaintiffswill continue to provide access under the threat of prosecution.          121.  All plaintiffs (and their members and customers)are users of the Internet.  These plaintiffs and other users havea right to engage in ordinary human discourse free from thethreat of prosecution created by the Act.  In particular, theseplaintiffs and other users have a right to receive content thatis criminalized under the Act.          122.  Plaintiffs AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ("ALA")and FREEDOM TO READ FOUNDATION ("FTRF") sue on behalf ofthemselves, their members, who are libraries and librariansacross the country, and their members' patrons.  These librariesrecognize that the Internet offers their patrons a uniqueopportunity to access information, and many libraries providetheir patrons with facilities the patrons can use to access theInternet.  Many libraries also have their own World Wide Websites on the Internet.  Thus, in addition to providing patronswith access to the Internet, where they can access informationposted by third parties, libraries post their own material on theInternet.  Many libraries post their card catalogues, postinformation about current events, sponsor chat groups, posttextual information or art on the library Web site, or postlicensed online versions of reference and other materials fromtheir library collections.  Patrons could, for example, accessthe Web site of a library anywhere in the country to peruse itscard catalogue, review an encyclopedia reference, or check adefinition in the dictionary.  These libraries and librarians areinjured by the Act.  Because of fear of prosecution, they will bechilled from posting materials on the Internet that might bedeemed "patently offensive" or "indecent" for minors by somecommunities.  Given the global and unrestricted nature of theInternet, the lack of precision in the definition of "indecency,"and the past attempts by some persons to ban literature andreference items from library collections, many of ALA's andFTRF's members may choose not to post a substantial amount ofexpressive material at all -- material that many adults mightconsider useful for themselves or their own children -- ratherthan risk prosecution for posting material that someone in someother part of the nation might deem "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for minors.  As a result of the Act, the librarypatrons ALA and FTRF members serve will be limited in theconstitutionally protected information that would otherwise beavailable to them on the Internet.  These plaintiffs (and theirmembers) sue in their capacity as content providers, accessproviders, and users of the Internet, and on behalf of theirpatrons who are content providers and users of interactivecomputer services.          123.  Plaintiffs AOL, COMPUSERVE, MSN, and PRODIGY sueon their own behalf and on behalf of their subscribers.  Asonline service providers, these plaintiffs are content providersand access providers, and their customers are content providersand users of the Internet.  These plaintiffs create content andmake it available both to their customers and to the entire worldof Internet users.  They also allow their customers to createcontent on the Internet (including the creation of personal Webpages).  As speakers, these plaintiffs and their customers arechilled by the Act in what they can say on the Internet and ontheir own online services.  As access providers, these plaintiffsfear they may be at risk of prosecution under the Act for whatothers say.  And as users, these plaintiffs and their customersare limited by the Act to the ability to access only content thatis suitable for a young child.          124.  Plaintiff MICROSOFT CORPORATION ("Microsoft")sues on its own behalf as a content provider, access softwareprovider, and user of the Internet.  Microsoft provides contenton the Internet through MSN, on its own Web sites, and throughpostings, messages, and other contributions to the Internet. Microsoft's diverse content includes compilations of musical,artistic, literary and encyclopedic information, news and currentevents, and other content.  Some of this content might beconsidered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in some communityin the nation, exposing Microsoft to the risk of prosecutionunder the Act.  As an access software provider, Microsoft sellsor plans to sell software for accessing and exploring theInternet, for establishing and maintaining Internet servers andrelated services, and for creating Web sites and other Internetcontent.  As users, Microsoft and its employees are chilled inwhat they can say and the frankness of their discussion incommunications posted to or transmitted over the Internet, andare exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act.  Microsoftbelieves that the defenses provided in Section 502(2) of the Actare provided only to access providers, not to content providersand/or users, and that as to access providers, including accesssoftware providers, they are inadequate, incomplete, and exposeMicrosoft to potential prosecution under the Act.  In addition,the chilling effect of the Act on other content providers andusers of the Internet will damage Microsoft by reducing themarket for access software, services software, and content-creation software.          125.  Plaintiff APPLE COMPUTER, INC. ("Apple") sues onits own behalf as a content provider, access software providerand user of the Internet.  Apple provides content on the Internetthrough eWorld, on its own Web sites, and through postings,messages and other contributions to the Internet.  Because of thevagueness of the Act, Apple is uncertain whether some of thiscontent might be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" insome community in the nation, exposing Apple to the risk ofprosecution under the Act.  As users, Apple and its employees arechilled in what they can say and the frankness of theirdiscussion in communications posted to or transmitted over theInternet, and are exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act. In addition, the chilling effect of the Act on other contentproviders and users of the Internet will damage Apple by reducingthe market for Internet software.          126.  Plaintiff COMMERCIAL INTERNET EXCHANGEASSOCIATION ("CIX") sues on behalf of its member Internet serviceproviders ("ISPs") and the customers of their members.  CIXmembers typically serve as passive carriers who offer access ortransmission, and related incidental capabilities, for theInternet transmissions of others; as such they are clearlycovered by the defense of  223(e)(1).  However, because ofambiguity in this defense, CIX members who operate news serversthat carry USENET content are uncertain whether they may be heldliable for the content of others that resides temporarily onmembers' USENET news servers, and is accessed by users from suchservers.  In addition, many CIX members also assist contentproviders in establishing and operating Web sites.  In thiscapacity CIX members will often be at risk of prosecution underthe Act for what others say.  Due to fear of prosecution, CIXmembers are chilled from assisting providers of valuable contentthat may be deemed indecent.  Furthermore, CIX members have astrong interest in the continued growth of the Internet as ameans of communication, and in their subscribers' rights to freeexpression over the Internet.  The Act undermines both interests.          127.  Plaintiff NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION SERVICES,INC. ("NETCOM") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of itssubscribers.  As a provider of Internet access and services,NETCOM is both a content provider and an access provider. NETCOM's individual subscribers create content on the Internet,such as through the posting of personal web pages, and make thatcontent available both to their own customers and to the entireworld of Internet users.  As speakers, NETCOM and its subscribersare chilled in what they can say on the Internet and on their ownInternet sites.  As an access provider, NETCOM cannot controlwhat others say, yet faces the risk of prosecution under the Actfor the speech of others made available through its systems.  Asusers of the Internet, NETCOM and its subscribers are limited bythe Act to accessing and producing only content that is suitablefor a young child.          128.  Plaintiff OPNET, INC. ("OpNet") sues on its ownbehalf and on behalf of its subscribers.  As a provider ofInternet access and services to subscribers, OpNet facesuncertainty as to the applicability of the Act's defenses.  OpNetalso fears that it will be construed to have liability forcontent posted by third parties through its systems.          129.  Plaintiff INTERACTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION("ISA") sues on behalf of its members, who include the majorcommercial online services, and other content providers, accessproviders, and users of the Internet.  As with the onlineservices, ISA's members risk prosecution for engaging in, orserving as a conduit for, constitutionally protected speech thatmight be deemed indecent.  Accordingly, the Act will chill ISAmembers from exercising their First Amendment rights.          130.  Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PUBLISHERS("AAP") sues on behalf of its members, who are content providerson, and users of, the Internet.  Although rooted in printpublishing, AAP's members are very actively involved in theInternet.  AAP's members create electronic products to accompanyand supplement their printed books and journals; create customeducational material on the Internet, publishing on and todemand; communicate with authors and others, receivingmanuscripts, and editing, typesetting, and designing bookselectronically; transmit finished product to licensed end-usercustomers; communicate with bookstores and other wholesale andretail accounts; and promote authors and titles online.  Many ofAAP's members have Web sites and provide content to the world onthe Internet.  Some of the content provided by AAP's membersmight be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minorsin some communities (as most of the efforts to ban books incommunities have been directed at books published by AAP'smembers).          131.  Plaintiff AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS("ASNE") sues on behalf of its members, who are editors of dailynewspapers throughout the United States that, in addition topublications in print form, are now or soon will be published inelectronic formats available to the public on the Internet orthrough online service providers.  Historically, the FirstAmendment guarantee of "freedom of the press" has protectednewspapers from government-imposed content restrictions which,like those in the Act, prohibit and punish the dissemination ofmaterials considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" withrespect to non-adult readers.  By its terms, however, the Act canbe applied to the press in the same manner that it can be appliedto any other person.  ASNE members, who make the editorialdecisions regarding what content will be published in the dailyeditions of their newspapers, are concerned that the Act willrequire them to censor the online version of their print editionsaccording to these vague and overbroad statutory standards,thereby restricting the content of the "electronic" edition ofthe daily newspaper in ways that the First Amendment does nottolerate with respect to the traditional hard-copy print edition. For this reason, ASNE believes the Act imposes an unprecedentedbut very real threat of unconstitutional press censorship whichcould throttle the Internet's potential to greatly enhance thediversity, availability, timeliness, quality, and utility ofdaily newspapers by creating a powerful disincentive forpublication through the use of interactive media technologies.            132.  Plaintiff NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA("NAA") files this lawsuit on behalf of its members, a majorityof which are daily newspapers in the United States.  Approxi-mately 175 daily newspapers in North America are currentlyavailable on the Internet, via commercial online services orthrough local bulletin board services.  As content providers,newspapers have utilized the Internet to provide electronicversions of their printed product.  In fact, many newspapersprovide archives of their print product online.  As accessproviders, newspapers have established electronic forums forlocal communities to communicate and to conduct business.  Whilethe content in newspapers is considered neither indecent norpatently offensive when published on newsprint, it now may bewhen published electronically.  The dual standard imposed by theAct will force newspapers to edit out content from publicationsoffered on the Internet -- content that is constitutionallyprotected and not subject to challenge in printed form.  In manycases, newspaper publishers will be forced to edit contentcontained in the archived electronic version of the newspaperalready placed on the Internet long before the Act went intoeffect.  Thus, the Act will seriously infringe upon the rights ofNAA members to publish constitutionally protected news andinformation.          133.  Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF PUBLISHERS, EDITORS ANDWRITERS ("APEW") sues on behalf of its members, who write andpublish in print and online.  Members of APEW include the SanFrancisco Guardian, the largest and oldest independently ownedalternative newsweekly in the United States; the Internet PressGuild, an unincorporated association of writers, authors andjournalists who publish their works online; the California FirstAmendment Coalition, a nonprofit, public interest corporationwhose membership comprises approximately 700 individuals andorganizations, including most of California's daily newspapers,many weekly and student newspapers, broadcasters, law firms andothers; and individual writers and editors including Jim Warren,a columnist and advocate for open government, and owner andeditor of the listserv GovAccess; Professor David Farber of theUniversity of Pennsylvania; John Quarterman, a columnist andSecretary of Matrix Information and Directory Services, Inc.; T.Bruce Tober, a freelance writer who researches and writes aboutthe Internet for a variety of print and online publications;Stephanie Stefanac, Editor of MacWorld Online, a monthly tradepublication for users of the Macintosh computer manufactured byApple Computer Co.; and Rogier van Bakel, a Contributing Editorto Wired Magazine.  The members of APEW face criminalprosecutions under the Act for the online publication of workswhich some communities might find "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive."  The vagueness of the Act leaves APEW membersuncertain whether the publication of their works over theInternet would be a crime.          134.  Plaintiff SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTSsues on its own behalf and on behalf of its members.  TheSociety's membership produces a tremendous volume of content madeavailable over the Internet:  news stories, special interestarticles, columns, and opinion pieces, among many others.  Eachyear brings a dramatic increase in the importance of electronicmedia as a venue for distributing the news and opinion piecesproduced by professional journalists.  The members of the Societyfear that their right and ability, traditionally protected by theFirst Amendment, to engage in an unfettered marketplace of ideasand expression will be severely compromised by the CommunicationsDecency Act.  In addition, the Society operates a listservecalled "SPJ-L," a forum among more than 1,000 Internet users(both Society members and non-members) from roughly 25 countriesto discuss and debate primarily journalism-related issues. Though, or perhaps because, it typically addresses topics of theutmost seriousness and importance for journalists, the languageused in messages posted on SPJ-L can be offensive, harsh, andvulgar.  The Society does not edit these messages for content. By continuing to provide this forum for discussion and debate,the Society risks prosecution under the Act.  Its members, whosewritings and other speech would be protected by the FirstAmendment in the context of other media, will be chilled by theAct from engaging in constitutionally protected speech over theInternet.          135.  Plaintiff HOTWIRED VENTURES LLC ("HotWiredVentures") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of itssubscribers.  HotWired Ventures operates an online magazine namedHotwired.  Some of HotWired's editorial content might beconsidered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in somecommunities.  HotWired features articles containing facts aboutand opinions on popular culture.  These articles sometimescontain vulgar language and references to, inter alia, sexualacts and sexual organs.  One area of HotWired's editorial focusis cyberspace-related issues, including governmental attempts tocensor and regulate the Internet.  These articles sometimesemploy vulgar language in expressing opinions about this topic,and may contain references to, and discussions of, examples ofmaterial that might be deemed "patently offensive" or "indecent"under the Act.  In addition, HotWired operates a regular sectioncalled Piazza, an interactive discussion area where members cancommunicate with each other both through asynchronous postingscalled "threads" and in real time "chat rooms," sharing opinionsand engaging in outspoken discourse which can involve vulgarlanguage and may involve sexually explicit subject matter.  Plaintiff WIRED VENTURES, LTD. ("Wired Ventures") sues on its ownbehalf and on behalf of its subscribers.  Wired Venturespublishes Wired Magazine, a print publication.  Like HotWired,Wired publishes articles and short fiction that sometimes containvulgar language and references to sexual acts or sexual organs. Many articles published in Wired are also published online byHotWired.  Thus, some articles that are perfectly legal forminors or adults in print form are nevertheless banned from theInternet.  The Act creates the anomalous situation that apublication that is a leading commentator on issues and eventsonline may not under the Act be able to publish online articlesabout the Internet that can be published in print.  HotWiredVentures and Wired Ventures believe that the Act would severelyinfringe their right to publish constitutionally protectedmaterial and their readers' right to choose to read suchmaterial.          136.  Plaintiff AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION("ABA") sues on behalf of its member bookstores (as contentproviders and users) and their patrons (as users of theInternet).  Although ABA's members are not "adult bookstores,"many of ABA's members sell materials that deal frankly with thesubject of human sexuality.  Some member bookstores have theirown Web pages that discuss the content of books the stores sell. Most member bookstores use the Internet and electroniccommunications to obtain information and excerpts of books frompublishers.  ABA members' right to learn about, acquire, anddistribute constitutionally protected materials, and theirpatrons' right to purchase such constitutionally protectedmaterials, will be seriously infringed by the Act.          137.  Plaintiff FAMILIES AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP("FAIC") is a national organization of parents dedicated to theproposition that they, not the government, should decide whattheir children should be able see or receive.  FAIC sues onbehalf of its members.  As parents, FAIC's members are deprivedof the opportunity to raise their children as they see fit.  Asusers of the Internet, the Act violates FAIC's members' rights toreceive material suitable for adults.          138.  Plaintiff CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT COALITION("CIEC") sues on behalf of its members as content providers,access providers, and users of the Internet.  In particular, CIECand its members are injured because the Act deprives parents ofthe ability to determine the content their children, includingolder teenagers, should have access to on the Internet.          139.  Notwithstanding the defenses set forth in theAct, and the fact that Congress expressly directed courts toconstrue those defenses broadly, plaintiffs reasonably fearprosecution under 47 U.S.C.  223(d)(1)(B), as enacted by Section502(2), for knowingly permitting their services or computers tobe used to display indecent material in a manner available topersons under age 18, or to transmit such material to specificpersons under age 18.  Unless and until the defendants or theCourts make clear that these defenses must be broadly construed,there is nothing to prevent an aggressive prosecutor, in aparticularly intolerant community, from bringing a prosecutionand urging that the defenses be construed more narrowly thanplaintiffs believe Congress intended.          140.  For these reasons, plaintiffs reasonably fearthat the defense in 47 U.S.C.  223(e)(1) may not protect onlineservice providers from criminal conviction for indecentexpression by third parties when that expression is located onthe providers' computers (such as when an individual computeruser posts a vulgar message to an online discussion).  Plaintiffsreasonably fear that the defense may apply only to the extent anonline service acts as a mere conduit to enable its subscribersto gain access to another network.          141.  The speech at issue in this case is fullyprotected by the First Amendment.  "Indecent" speech or "patentlyoffensive" communications, while considered by some to beoffensive or sexually suggestive, are not obscene.  Such speechcan have serious literary, artistic, political or other merit,and thus has considerable value to adults and to society as awhole.          142.  The Internet, and cyberspace generally, carries asignificant amount of communications, images and text that mightbe deemed inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" foryounger children (for example, in elementary school), but whichwould not, under the same community standards, be deemedinappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" for olderminors (for example, in high school or early college).  The Actmakes no distinction between these age groups, and wouldcriminalize a university professor's distribution -- using theuniversity's interactive computer service -- of "indecent" butclassic works of literature to a 17-year-old freshman.          143.  Dissemination of many of the same communicationswhose dissemination via interactive computer services is madecriminal by the Act would not be unlawful if disseminated bytraditional print media (e.g., newspaper or magazine) or by usingthe United States mail.  Thus, many of the very samecommunications the Act makes it unlawful to make available tominors through interactive computer services can lawfully be madeavailable through other media, and are, in fact, so available.          144.  Any government regulation of "indecent" or"patently offensive" speech may withstand constitutional scrutinyonly if it both serves a "compelling interest" and is "the leastrestrictive means" to advance that interest, and only if thebenefit gained from the Act outweighs the loss ofconstitutionally protected rights.          145.  The government has no legitimate, much less"compelling," interest in preventing adults from sending orreceiving "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech.  Thegovernment has no legitimate, much less "compelling," interest inpreventing older children from sending or receiving speech thatwould only be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" ifcommunicated to younger children.          146. One legitimate interest the government does have-- and the only interest articulated in the Act ( 509, to becodified at 47 U.S.C.  230) -- is to assist parents insupervising their children's access to expressive materials.  TheAct does not, however, further that interest.  Indeed, the Actinterferes with that interest because parents who decide theirchildren, whether 7 or 17, should have access to some materialsthat some community might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive"for those children are prevented from exercising their parentaljudgment by the Act's blanket prohibition on all access by allpersons under 18 to all such materials.          147.  Even if the government had a legitimate interest,more broadly, in preventing interactive computer service accessby all persons under 18 to communications that some communitymight deem "indecent" or "patently offensive" to them, the Actwould not materially further that interest.  Among other things,communications of foreign origin are freely accessible on theInternet, and the United States government has no means toprosecute foreign content-providers for violation of the Act, orto deter such postings.  Furthermore, existing statutes and otherprovisions in the Act already prohibit the use of computers todisseminate obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech,enticing or luring minors into inappropriate activities, andother speech that is not protected even for adults.          148.  Even if the Act could be viewed as substantiallyfurthering a compelling governmental interest in protectingminors from "indecent" or "patently offensive" communications, itis not the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. The screening and blocking tools described above achieve thatinterest far more effectively than does the Act itself, and withno adverse impact on the constitutional rights of adults. Efforts by government to spur the further development of suchtools would further the claimed governmental interest moredirectly and materially than does the Act.          149.  Even if the Act could be viewed as the leastrestrictive means to further a compelling governmental interestin protecting minors from "indecent" or "patently offensive"communications, any benefit gained from the Act would be faroutweighed by the loss of constitutionally protected rights ofadults, because only some applications of the Act will in factprotect minors, but every application of the Act will punish ordeter speech that is constitutionally protected for adults.                        CAUSES OF ACTION                             COUNT 1          150.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          151.  With respect to constitutionally protectedcommunications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms andpractical effect, bans a substantial amount of speech by and toadults, including speech by and to plaintiffs, their members, andtheir subscribers, patrons and customers, in violation of theFirst Amendment of the United States Constitution.                             COUNT 2          152.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          153.  With respect to constitutionally protectedcommunications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms andpractical effect, unduly burdens and deters a substantial amountof speech by and to adults, including speech by and toplaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers, patrons, andcustomers, in violation of the First Amendment of the UnitedStates Constitution.                             COUNT 3          154.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          155.  Sections 502(1) and 502(2) of the Act undulychill and compel self-censorship of constitutionally protectedspeech of plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers,patrons, and customers, in violation of the First Amendment ofthe United States Constitution.                             COUNT 4          156.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          157.  Section 502(2) of the Act, 47 U.S.C.  223(d), isfatally overbroad.  In particular, it bans, burdens, andcriminalizes speech that is constitutionally protected foradults, and for older minors, restricting both adults and 17year-olds to communications appropriate for 7 year olds.  And itbans, burdens, and criminalizes a much broader range ofconstitutionally protected expression than is constitutionallypermissible.  Accordingly, the provision violates the FirstAmendment.                             COUNT 5          158.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          159.  Any blocking system to be imposed by the contentprovider/speaker would require advance identification of thoseseeking access to a particular Web site, chat room, discussiongroup, or other online forum that might potentially containcommunications that could be deemed "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" to persons under 18.  See 47 U.S.C.   223(e)(5)(B). A requirement of advance identification would make it impossiblefor users to engage in constitutionally protected anonymousspeech on matters of public and private importance.  For manyusers, such anonymity is critical to their participation in thespeech.          160.  For such users, the Act will require them tochoose between anonymity and losing access to suchcommunications.  As a result, in many cases, their FirstAmendment rights to read and view constitutionally protected textand images will be infringed.          161.  Section 502(2) accordingly violates the FirstAmendment.                             COUNT 6          162.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          163.  Plaintiffs are unable to determine withreasonable certainty which constitutionally protected expressionCongress sought to proscribe in  223(a)(1)(B) and (d).  Inparticular, the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive asmeasured by contemporary community standards" are entirelysubjective; as a matter of law depend on the context in which thecommunications arise; are undefined and undefinable in thecyberspace context; have entirely different meanings dependingupon the age of the recipient even though the Act treats allminors of all ages the same; and give no indication as to whichcommunity governs the inquiry.  In these, and other ways, the Actdoes not put reasonable persons on notice of what communicationsare prohibited.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, andsubscribers, patrons, and customers are forced to guess at whichspeech on interactive computer services may give rise to criminalprosecution.          164.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and"patently offensive as measured by contemporary communitystandards," and of other provisions of the Act, and the draconianpenalties for a wrong guess, will force plaintiffs, theirmembers, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, andsubstantial numbers of other providers of content to theInternet, to self-censor far more speech than would in fact beprohibited in order to comply with their understanding of theAct's requirements, or to avoid potential criminal prosecution,and will thus chill constitutionally protected expression.          165.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and"patently offensive as measured by contemporary communitystandards," and of other provisions of the Act, invites arbitraryenforcement.          166.  The Act is, accordingly, so vague as to violatethe First and Fifth Amendments.                             COUNT 7          167.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          168.  Plaintiffs reasonably fear that the defensesunder the Act will not be construed as broadly as Congressintended, and will therefore subject their dissemination orfacilitation of constitutionally protected speech to criminalprosecution and conviction in several significant contexts.          169.   The "good faith defense," which is the onlydefense even arguably available to non-commercial content-providers, gives insufficient guidance to content-providers as towhether their dissemination of constitutionally protected speechis prohibited.  Plaintiff content-providers have no means ofascertaining whether a jury will determine that they have taken"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under thecircumstances" to restrict minors' access to material that is"indecent" or "patently offensive as measured by contemporarycommunity standards."  Act 502(2), to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 223(e)(5)(A).          170.  Similarly, service providers who host Web sitesor other online sites, without controlling content, but on whosefacilities others' communications reside, reasonably fear anaggressive prosecutor will argue, contrary to plaintiffs'understanding of Congressional intent, that such actions willconstitute a "display" of such communications under 223(d)(1)(B), and that such services are not protected by the"access provider" defense, even though the service providers'role clearly "does not include the creation of the content of thecommunication."   223(e)(1).          171.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot withreasonable certainty rely on the access provider defense, 223(e)(1), to exempt access providers' operation of USENET newsservers that automatically store content posted by users, whichremains on their servers for a number of days and is available tosubscribers.          172.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot withreasonable certainty determine whether the defense,  223(e)(1),applies to ISPs who assist content providers in establishing oroperating Web pages or other online sites, and who, althoughhaving no control of content, might be deemed to be a"conspirator" under  223(e)(2) if they knowingly arrange foraccess to valuable, constitutionally protected material that maybe deemed "indecent."          173.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, andtheir subscribers, patrons, and customers, are forced to guess atwhether their activities may give rise to criminal prosecution.          174.  The uncertainty of how prosecutors or the courtswill construe the defenses, the fact that they are only defenses,which must be raised and proved after a defendant has alreadybeen subjected to the humiliation, stigma, and expense of acriminal prosecution, and the draconian penalties for a wrongguess, will force plaintiffs, their members, and theirsubscribers, patrons, and customers, and a substantial number ofother providers of content to the Internet, to self-censor speechprotected by the First Amendment in order to comply with theirunderstanding of the Act's requirements, or to avoid potentialcriminal prosecution, and will thus chill constitutionallyprotected expression.          175.  The vagueness of these provisions invitesarbitrary enforcement.          176.  Sections 502(1) and (2), accordingly, are sovague as to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.                             COUNT 8          177.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.          178.  Sections 502(1) and (2) of the Act violate theFirst Amendment rights of plaintiffs, their members, and theirsubscribers, patrons, and customers, insofar as they single outfor special bans or burdens speakers engaged in one class ofconstitutionally protected speech by one specific medium, and donot similarly ban or burden speakers engaged in other classes ofspeech, or in the same speech via other mediums, withoutsufficient justification.     WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court:          A.  Declare that Sections 502(1) and (2) of theCommunications Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B),223(a)(2), and 223(d), are unconstitutional;           B.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendantsfrom enforcing those provisions.          C.  Award plaintiffs such costs and fees as are allowedby law; and           D.  Grant plaintiffs such other and further relief asthe Court deems just and proper.

The filingsets the stage for an historic court battle which will determine the futureof the Internet as a viable means for free expression, education, andcommerce, as well as the fate of the First Amendment in the informationage.  Witnesses will begin to testify before the Philadelphia Federal courtbeginning March 21, 1996.The Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) is coordinated by theCenter for Democracy and Technology, America Online, the American LibraryAssociation, and others, including People for the American Way.  Its 37members include over 5000 individual Internet users, libraries, bookpublishers, newspaper publishers, editors, advertisers, commercial onlineservice providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, and civil liberties advocates.Individual Internet users are encouraged to join the fight! All users ofthe Internet are potentially subject to massive fines and prison sentencesunder the Communications Decency Act.  Join the CIEC and become a part of alandmark case which will determine the future of  free speech online.Over 5000 individuals have joined as of 5:30 pm Friday 3/1! For moreinformation, on what you can do to help overturn the CDA,  please visit theCIEC web page at:http://www.cdt.org/ciec/You must join by March 15, so please hurry!The text of the CIEC complaint and other relevant information is currentlyavailable on the CIEC web page. Copies of today's motion, along with thedeclarations listed below, will be available on the CIEC page shortly.THE INTERNET IS A UNIQUE COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WHICH DESERVES FULLFIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONSIn the motion filed today, CIEC argues that the Internet is a uniquecommunications technology distinct from traditional broadcast mass mediaand telephone networks, and that the broad content regulations imposed bythe CDA are unconstitutionally restrictive.  The CIEC argues that becausethe Internet offers users tremendous control over the content they receive,it deserves first amendment protections at least as broad as those enjoyedby the print medium.  Specifically, the motion states:  "The Internet, and 'cyberspace' generally, is an entirely new   communications medium that differs from other media in crucial   respects: it is global, it is decentralized, it gives ordinary   citizens unparalleled ability to communicate to and with others on a   scale never before possible, an it is unobtrusive, because users   access only the communications they affirmatively request. It   therefor merits the highest level of First Amendment protection."   (Page 2)The motion goes on to argue:  "In sum, this Court should accord to the interactive computer medium  the most vigilant protection from government censorship and  overreaching.  The unparalleled potential of cyberspace to effectuate  the core policies of the First Amendment calls for a reaffirmance of  our 'profound national commitment' to public discourse that is  'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open."  "The challenged provisions of the Act, however, represent an  indiscriminate and damaging retreat from that commitment, one that  reflects an as-yet poor legislative understanding even of the basic  operating methods  of cyberpsace.  Those provisions are facially  invalid because they abridge far too much protected speech while  affording little incremental protection for minors, and threaten to  disrupt the rapidly unfolding development of a salutary communications  revolution that until now has flourished with a minimum of  governmental interference." (Pages 60 - 61).OVER 39 DECLARATIONS DESCRIBE THE INTERNET AND THE IMPACT OF THE CDA.Included in the CIEC filing today were declarations from individuals,libraries, online service providers, content providers, publishers,non-profit groups, civil liberties advocates, and even a US Senator.  Thedeclarations describe in detail the potential impact the CDA will have ontheir rights to free speech on the Internet, and will be considered by thecourt as evidence in the case.

In response, and in overwhelming numbers, people around the world are making their web pages black (with white text) to illustrate the far reaching effect of the new online 'indecency' restrictions included in the "Communications Decency Act".  Over 1500 sites have indicated their support for the protest, including:* Sen. Patrick Leahy  - http://www.senate.gov/~leahy* Rep. Jerrold Nadler - http://www.house.gov/nadler/welcome.html* Yahoo               - http://www.yahoo.com/* SurfWatch Software  - http://www.surfwatch.com/* Netcom              - http://www.netcom.com/* And many others. A complete listing is available at http://www.cdt.org/speech.htmlThe story about the protest, and the concerns of the entire Internet community over the new, sweeping restrictions on constitutional speech enacted today, are finally getting the attention they deserve in the National media. In addition, we've seen an amazing outpouring of support around the country and around the world for this effort, and hope you all feel a part of something larger than all of us put together.  We certainly do.  CDT, along with other prominent public interest civil liberties organizations, individuals, community groups, and businesses which would be effected by the CDA, are preparing a law suit against the provisions to be filed in Federal Court very soon.  Details will be announced on this list and posted on CDT's web site as they become available.48 HOUR PROTEST INFORMATION - DARKENING THE WEBIf you have joined the protest, please continue to keep your web pagebackgrounds black until Saturday, noon.

The challenge will argue that the Internet is aunique communications technology which deserves First Amendment protections at least as broad as those enjoyed as by the print medium.The group, known as the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC -pronounced "seek") is coordinated by the Center for Democracy andTechnology, America Online, and the American Library Association, andothers, including People for the American Way. Its 35 members includelibraries, book publishers, newspaper publishers, editors, advertisers,commercial online service providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, and civilliberties advocates.Individual Internet users are also invited to join the CIEC in the fight toprotect free speech online (see instructions below).In addition to CIEC, named plaintiffs in the challenge include the AmericanLibrary Association,  America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy, Microsoft,NETCOM, The Commercial Internet eXchange,the Newspaper Association of America, the American Booksellers Association, HotWired and WiredMagazine, and others (a complete list of plaintiffs and CIEC members isprinted below).EDUCATING THE COURT ON THE NATURE OF THE INTERNET AND ALTERNATIVES TO CENSORSHIPIn a 55 page complaint that details the history of the Internet andoutlines how the network operates, the CIEC intends to educate the courton how the Internet functions and why the broad content regulations imposed by the CDA threaten the very existence of the Internet as a viable medium for free expression, education, and commerce. Among other things, the CIEC challenge argues that:* The Internet is a unique communications medium which deserves First  Amendment protections at least as broad as those afforded to print  media.* Individual users and parents, not the Federal Government, should  determine for themselves and their children what material  comes into their homes based on their own tastes and values.* The CDA will be ineffective at protecting children from "indecent" or  "patently" offensive material online.The full text of the CIEC complaint, along with other relevant backgroundinformation, and information on how you can participate in this landmarkcase, can be found on the CIEC World Wide Web Page:http://www.cdt.org/ciec/The CIEC challenge is separate from the case brought by the ACLU, EFF,EPIC, Planned Parenthood, and several other plaintiffs in the samePhiladelphia court on February 8, 1996. The ACLU effort has madesignificant and important headway in the past several weeks.  The CIEC casewill reinforce the ACLU's efforts while focusing on the unique nature ofthe Internet and alternatives to government content regulations.  ACLU andCIEC attorneys are closely coordinating their efforts, and it is expectedthat the courts will eventually consolidate the two cases.The outcome of the legal challenges to the CDA will likely determine thelegal status of speech on the Internet and the future of the FirstAmendment in the Information Age.INDIVIDUAL INTERNET USERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO JOIN THE FIGHTCIEC is inviting individual Internet users to join this landmark case tohelp protect freedom of speech and the future of the Internet as a viablemeans of free expression, education, and commerce.If you post messages to a public listserv, Usenet newsgroup, participatein an IRC or chat session, or maintain your own World Wide Web page, ftp or gopher archive, you could potentially face $250,000 fines or 2 years injail if someone, somewhere considers the material you post to be "indecent"or "patently offensive"To find out how you can join the fight to protect free expression and thefuture of the Internet, please visit the CIEC web page.http://www.cdt.org/ciec/Individuals have until March 15 to join the CIEC.

The bills, sponsored by Sen. Leahy (D-VT), Sen.Burns (R-MT), Rep. Goodlatte (R-VA), Rep. Eshoo (D-CA), and others,represent a major step towards breaking the stranglehold on encryptiontechnologies which for years has denied computer users access to vitalprivacy-protecting applications.The "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996" represents a rejectionof the Clinton Administration's invasive and unworkable "Clipper Chip" and"Clipper II" key escrow policies. Under the guise of promoting so-called"voluntary" encryption standards, these Administration efforts have soughtto use export controls to compel the adoption of key escrow encryptiondomestically, and have left Internet users without adequate privacy andsecurity.By relaxing export controls on "generally available" cryptographicapplications such as PGP, popular Web browsers, and other programs, theEncrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996 would encourage thedevelopment and use of strong privacy protecting technologies. Majorprovisions of the legislation would:* Ease export controls on encryption products, allowing the export of  'mass market' or 'generally available' cryptography. This would  include products such as PGP or many of the popular Web browser  programs.* Affirm the right of Americans to use any encryption domestically. The  bills explicitly prohibit the government from imposing any limits  on the domestic use or sale of encryption.* (Senate version only) Provide protections to those who choose to store  their encryption keys with third parties by creating criminal and  civil  penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of keys and strict  requirements for law enforcement access.  The bill does not in any way  affect the ability of any person to use encryption without a key  escrow function..The legislation also contains several provisions which CDT believes requirefurther clarification and consideration, including controversial languagethat would create a new federal crime for the use of encryption towillfully obstruct a law enforcement investigation. CDT will work withSenators Leahy and Burns and Representatives Goodlatte, Eshoo, and otherinterested members to address these concerns as the bill makes its waythrough the legislative process.The full text of both the House and Senate versions of the bills, alongwith other relevant background information, is available on CDT's CryptoIssues World Wide Web page:http://www.cdt.org/crypto/CDT believes that the House and Senate encryption bills are an importantstep forward in the ongoing attempts to build better security into theinformation infrastructure through the widespread availability ofencryption. Congressional action is particularly welcome as theAdministration has continued to impose a flawed approach to encryptionbased upon export controls, key length limits, and key escrow policies allaimed at slowing the adoption of strong cryptography in the U.S. andthroughout the world.While CDT believes improvements can be made in both bills, they establish asolid framework for building a comprehensive, global cryptography policy.CDT believes the bills deserve careful consideration and support. We lookforward to working with Senator Leahy, Senator Burns, Rep. Goodlatte, Rep.Eshoo, individual Internet users, public interest advocates, and thecomputer and communications industry to develop a cryptography policy thatprotects privacy, security, and competitiveness on the Global InformationInfrastructure.SUMMARY OF THE LEGISLATION: WHAT THE BILLS WOULD DOThe House and Senate bills both modify Title 18 of the U.S. Code to clarifythe status of encrypted communications, access to those communications bylaw enforcement, and the liability of third-party key holders.  The billswould:* SIGNIFICANTLY EASE EXPORT CONTROLS: The bills would remove all export  restrictions on "mass market" or publicly accessible encryption  software and similar hardware -- that is, products that are generally  available to the public and sold for installation "as is," or that are  in the public domain such as PGP or some popular web browsers. (For  example, products commercially available "off the rack," or freely  available to the public via the Internet, would all be exportable.)  Other encryption hardware would be exportable to countries where  hardware with similar capabilities is already commercially available.  The bills also allow export of other encryption software if it is  currently exportable under law for use by foreign financial  institutions.* PROHIBIT ANY RESTRICTION ON THE DOMESTIC USE OR SALE OF ENCRYPTION:  The bills would affirmatively prohibit any government restrictions or  attempts to mandate the domestic sale or use of any type of  encryption.* IMPOSE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED KEY DISCLOSURES:  (Senate Version Only) The Senate bill would lay down privacy  guidelines to protect those users who choose to store their  keys with  third parties. The bill would impose civil and criminal penalties for  the unauthorized release of decryption keys or other decryption  assistance by third parties who individuals have entrusted with their  keys. No privacy protections and only limited restrictions for law  enforcement access currently exist for those who choose to store their  keys with trusted third parties.* PROVIDE LIMITS FOR ACCESS TO KEYS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT: (Senate Version  Only) The Senate bill would also spell out limits and guidelines for  law enforcement access to the keys of those users who have  chosen to store their keys with third parties. Today, encryption keys  held by third parties could be released to law enforcement with  nothing more than a subpoena. Under the Senate bill, third parties  could only provide assistance to law enforcement in decrypting  communications if presented with a court order. The bill also limits  the scope and duration of such assistance. Decryption keys for stored  communications could be disclosed with a proper court order or  subpoena.* ESTABLISH A BROAD "PERSONAL USE EXEMPTION" FOR U.S. TRAVELERS: The  bills would allow U.S. persons to use any form of encryption in a  foreign country, establishing a less restrictive form of the "personal  use exemption" recently published by the State Department. The  provision is intended to accommodate "U.S. citizens and permanent  residents who have the need to temporarily export encryption products  when leaving the U.S. for brief periods of time". While the intent of  this provision is clear, CDT believes that the language of the bill  should be further clarified.* PROHIBIT THE USE OF ENCRYPTION TO CONCEAL THE COMMISSION OF A FELONY:  Finally, the bills would criminalize the use of encryption to  willfully obstruct justice.  Anyone who "willfully endeavors" to use  encryption for the purpose of obstructing, impeding, or preventing the  communication to a law enforcement officer of information relating to  a Federal felony would be subject to criminal penalties. CDT believes  this new federal crime is unnecessary since it duplicates obstruction  of justice crimes that are already available to prosecutors, and is  unwise since it might be interpreted to discriminate against users of  encryption.BACKGROUND - BILLS ADDRESS LONG-STANDING FRUSTRATIONS WITH U.S.             ENCRYPTION POLICYCongressional action comes as Clinton Administration encryptionrestrictions continue to jeopardize the security of computer users.Encryption tools, which scramble electronic communications and data, arewidely viewed as the key to providing security and privacy and encouragecommerce on the Global Information Infrastructure.Individuals need encryption in order to trust the GII with confidentialdata such as financial transactions, medical records, or privatecommunications.  Businesses need encryption to provide individuals withprivacy protections they need and to protect their own proprietaryinformation as it flows across vulnerable global networks. The lack of goodencryption today has left computer users vulnerable to the prying eyes ofhackers, corporate competitors, and even foreign governments.Current Administration policy restricts the export of "strong" encryptionhardware or software products with keys greater than 40 bits long. (Thelength of encryption "keys" is often used to indicate the security of asystem.) Export controls actually influence the entire GII -- bothdomestically and internationally -- due to the difficulty of distributingand interoperating products with different strengths of encryption. Thelevel of security permitted under the export controls, and hence the levelof security largely available to domestic users as well, has been judgedwoefully inadequate by many experts. Even the most recent Administration"Clipper II" proposals would only allow the export of moderately strongerencryption, and then only with "key escrow" restrictions to guarantee U.S.government access to individual keys -- restrictions which raise realConstitutional issues and are bound to fail in the competitiveinternational marketplace.In recent months, groups from across the political spectrum haveincreasingly criticized the Clinton Administration's restrictive exportcontrols. In November 40 companies, trade associations, and public interestgroups wrote to Vice President Gore calling the latest Administrationproposals flawed and inadequate. Last month a report by the CEOs of 13leading U.S. technology companies found that U.S. industry stands to loseup to $60 billion dollars per year by the year 2000 due to restrictions onthe export of cryptography. And several weeks ago a group of noted computersecurity experts released a report calling for the deployment ofdramatically longer encryption key lengths of at least 75 to 90 bits.The House and Senate bills give voice to this growing drumbeat of criticismdemanding a radical departure from the flawed approach of the ClintonAdministration's current encryption polices. CDT looks forward to workingwith members of Congress to push for a more comprehensive U.S. encryptionpolicy that reflects the privacy and security needs of computer users.FOR MORE INFORMATIONMore information on the cryptography policy debate, including the text ofthe Senate and House bills, is available on CDT's Cryptography IssuesWeb Page:http://www.cdt.org/crypto/For More Information Contact:Center for Democracy and Technology    +1.202.637.9800  Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director      Alan Davidson, Staff Counsel        -----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATIONBe sure you are up to date on the latest public policy issues affectingcivil liberties online and how they will affect you!

The schedule for a Senate vote is unclear, although a vote before the end of the week is possible. President Clinton is expected to sign the bill.Even if no votes occur today, once the Conference Committee members agree to send the bill to the floor of the House and Senate, no further changes can be made. Ironically, the possible vote comes exactly one year to the day that Senator Exon introduced the original Communications Decency Act (Feb. 1, 1995). Although significant changes have been made to the CDA since its introduction, the proposal is still an unprecedented violation of the First Amendment rights of all Internet users, and threatens to destroy the Internet as a viable means of free expression, education, and political discourse.  CDT is committed to challenging this bill all the way to the supreme court, if necessary, to ensure that these provisions are overturned.The decision to bring the bill to a vote was unexpectedly announced late Wednesday 1/31 after Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) dropped his objections to provisions granting broadcasters fee access to new digital spectrum.Despite the objections of civil liberties advocates and the telecommunicationsand computer industries, Congress is expected to pass the telecommunicationsbill with the CDA intact.  However, if you feel strongly about this issue,you should continue to speak your mind.  An Action Alert prepared by the VotersTelecommunications Watch (VTW) describing what you can do is attached below.CDT will post an analysis of the final legislation, along with statementsfrom key members of Congress and other relevant information soon after the final vote.  In the mean time, for more information, including the text and analysis of the latest proposal (Dec 21, 1995), see CDT's Net-Censorship Issues Web Page (http://www.cdt.org), or send email to ______________________________________________________________________________(2) TEXT OF THE VTW COALITION ALERT========================================================================           CAMPAIGN TO STOP THE NET CENSORSHIP LEGISLATION        (SEE THE LIST OF CAMPAIGN COALITION MEMBERS AT THE END)        Update: -Latest News: Congress could vote on Thurs (2/1/96) to                              censor the Internet; passage is likely.                -What You Can Do Now: Call Congress and tell them                                      to remove the net censorship                                      language.

It could be voted on asearly as this Thursday, 2/1/96.This legislation, available from http://www.cdt.org/cda.html, has changedconsistently for the worse despite the best efforts over the last year ofmany public interest groups to bring it in line with the protections outlinedin the First Amendment.Congress is poised to vote on Thursday, Feburary 1.  We are not hopefulthat Congress will reject the behemoth Telecommunications bill on the basisof the unconstitutional Internet censorship language.  It is likely to pass,or be cemented in stone to prevent it from changing in any way before afuture vote, should this one be delayed.This is one issue that, despite the legislative efforts of the best civilliberties representatives on the planet, will have to be resolved in court.________________________________________________________________________WHAT YOU CAN DO NOWIt is unlikely that even a massive public outcry will be enough to defeatthe Telecommunications Deregulation bill.  We do feel that you shouldcontinue to speak your mind however, and remind Congress that you areconcerned about the callousness with which they treat the First Amendmentin a medium they often have little experience in.  Remember, no matterhow bad it gets this year, someone will probably introduce a similarbill next year, and we'll need to continue to educate these people all overagain.1.

Introduced last fall by Senators RobertBennett (R-Utah) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), and co-sponsored bySenators Kassebaum, Kennedy, Dole, Daschle, and others, the "MedicalRecords Confidentiality Act" (S. 1360) seeks to create strong,comprehensive privacy safeguards for the health data of all Americans.Among provisions, the "Medical Records Confidentiality Act" would:*  Give people the right to get a copy of their own medical record;*  Limit disclosure of personal health information by doctors,   employers, insurance companies and others in the health care   arena; and,*  Would establish stiff civil and criminal penalties for   unauthorized disclosures of information.For a summary of S.1360, CDT's testimony on the need for medical recordsprivacy protections, and other information please visit CDT's HealthInformation Privacy Web Page at http://www.cdt.org/health_priv.htmlCDT supports the Bennett-Leahy bill and believes that its enactment wouldbe an important first step in creating strong, enforceable privacyprotections where few currently exist. (See CDT Policy Post No. 27).When S. 1360 was first introduced last fall, some in the privacy communityargued that the bill did not go far enough.  Over the past several months,CDT, along with other public interest advocates and consumer groups, hasdeveloped the following proposed changes to the bill which we believe arenecessary in order to strengthen the proposal and ensure that individualsare better able to control access to and disclosure of their private healthrecords.  Among the proposed changes, CDT recommends the committee:1. Eliminate current exemptions which allow health information to be   disclosed to researchers without an individual's consent.2. Eliminate current exemptions which allow doctors, insurance   companies, and other health information trustees to disclose health   information to government officials involved in health oversight   activities without an individual's consent.3. Raise the standard for law enforcement access to health records4. Place tighter controls on access to health information inside health   care institutions.S.1360 will be before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee inearly May.  The House is expected to hold hearings on the companion bill,H.R.435, in the Spring. CDT urges the committee to adopt these changes whenit considers S. 1360 in early May, and looks forward to working withCommittee members to ensure that S. 1360 contains strong privacysafeguards.Our nation is rapidly developing a health information infrastructure thatwill make it possible to quickly transmit and access health information fortreatment and payment purposes. This brings obvious public health benefits,such as improving patient care, increasing patient access to treatment andlowering costs. However, the risk of abuse is magnified when health recordsare transmitted and storedelectronically. CDT believes that S. 1360 will help to bring the benefitsof the health information infrastructure while ensuring privacy andconfedentiality of sensitive medical information.CDT is pleased that other privacy and consumer groups are actively workingto ensure that S.1360 is strengthened.  The Consumer Project on Technology,the Coalition for Patient's Rights, and many others have voiced similarconcerns to the Committee.  As a result of the collective commentssubmitted by privacy and consumer organizations, we believe that the finalbill will contain stronger, more comprehensive protections for personalhealth information.For more information on the Medical Records Privacy legislation, includingthe text of the bill, analysis, CDT's testimony before the Senate Labor andHuman Resources Committee, and other relevant information, visit CDT'sHealth Information Web Page at:       http://www.cdt.org/health_priv.htmlFor Additional Information ContactThe Center for Democracy and Technology   +1.202.637.9800 Janlori Goldman, Deputy Director  Deirdre Mulligan, Staff Counsel  ------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) CDT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMITTEE*  ELIMINATE CURRENT EXCEPTION TO CONSENT FOR CREATION OF NON-   IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.As drafted, S. 1360 would allow protected health information to bedisclosed without an individual's consent to certified health informationservices, for the sole purpose of creating non-identifiable information.CDT recommends that this provision be stricken from the bill.  Trustees(such as doctors, hospitals, or insurance companies) should be prohibitedfrom disclosing personal health information without individual consent inall but the most compelling circumstances.  If a trustee chooses tode-identify, or strip data, they may do so.  CDT believes that a healthinformation service should only handle personal information when they areacting as an employee, agent, or contractor of a health care provider orhealth plan.*  ELIMINATE CURRENT EXCEPTION TO CONSENT FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.S.1360 currently allows protected health information to be disclosed toresearchers without an individual's consent.  CDT urges the Committee toaffirm the individual's right to control disclosure of personal healthinformation by requiring that the individual's consent be obtained by theprovider or health plan prior to disclosing personal health information toa researcher, unless exceptional circumstances are presented that justify awaiver.We recommend that federal regulations requiring federally-fundedresearchers to obtain the individual's consent be adapted to govern allresearcher access to personally identifiable records.  Through adoption ofa consent mechanism, the bill would provide a strong incentive forresearchers to use non-identifiable data where possible.*  ELIMINATE CURRENT EXCEPTION TO CONSENT FOR OVERSIGHT PURPOSES.S.1360 currently allows health information trustees (such as doctors,insurance companies) to disclose protected health information without anindividual's consent to government officials involved in health oversightactivities, such as reducing fraud and abuse.  As drafted, the billprohibits information obtained during an oversight activity from being usedin an action against an individual (if not related to health fraud orabuse).CDT believes that the legislation be amended to require oversight officialsto obtain a subpoena prior to seeking access to records. By requiring legalprocess, government officials would have to justify their requests forinformation, providing a much needed method of ensuring publicaccountability.  In conjunction with the substantial protection forindividuals afforded by the current limitation on using the informationagainst the individual in an unrelated action.  This amendment would hinderany government effort to use oversight activities as fishing expeditions.These recommended changes to the bill would give individuals the greatestdegree of control over the use and disclosure of personal healthinformation by restricting unauthorized disclosures of personal healthinformation.*  HEIGHTEN STANDARD CONTROLLING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS.As drafted S.1360 requires law enforcement personnel to present a warrantto health information trustees when seeking access to personal healthinformation -- the bill does not require trustees to disclose theinformation.  However, the warrant requirement in the Bennett-Leahy billcontains a standard that is weaker than the standard governing access tosubscriber records under the Cable Communications Act.CDT urges the Committee to strengthen the standard governing lawenforcement access to personal health information.   The bill should beamended to provide a heightened standard governing access that is as strongas, if not stronger, than the standard found in the Cable CommunicationsAct.  It would be absurd to have weaker privacy protections for peoples'medical records than for their cable records.CDT believes that personal health information is some of the most sensitiveand revealing information about individuals and is therefore entitled tothe strongest legal safeguards.  Law enforcement personnel should be forcedto make a very compelling showing of evidence and need before they aregiven access to peoples' medical records.*  LIMIT INSIDER ACCESS.CDT is concerned that the bill as drafted does not clearly convey thataccess to information within an institution must be limited and regulatedas closely as disclosure of information outside the institution.CDT urges the Committee to clarify the language restricting internal usesof protected health information.  Internal uses of information must belimited to those that are both compatible with and directly related to thepurpose of collection.  In addition, the minimization requirement governingall disclosures of information must also govern internal use ofinformation.  For instance, while within health care institutions a numberof health care professionals may be involved in a patient's care and needaccess to information in the patient's record, there must be limits on whohas access and the amount of information they are provided.Although some groups have raised concerns about the preemption language ofS.1360, after a review of state laws regarding confidentiality of andaccess to medical information, CDT is confident that the protections andpenalties provided by S.1360 are more comprehensive and stronger than thoseprovided under existing law.  Moreover, the preemption provision is notabsolute.  S.1360 leaves states free to craft stronger privacy laws in theareas of mental health, public health (communicable disease), anddoctor-patient privilege.  In addition, where more protective courtdecisions exist in the area of doctor-patient confidentiality, they toowould remain undisturbed.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.    This Act may be cited as the "Promotion of Commerce On-Linein the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996"SEC.2.FINDING;PURPOSE   (a) FINDINGS. - The Congress finds the following:                     (1) The ability to digitize information makes        carrying out tremendous amounts of commerce and         personal communication electronically possible.           (2) Miniaturization, distributed computing, and        reduced transmission costs make communication via        electronic networks a reality.           (3) The explosive growth in the Internet and         other computer networks reflects the potential        growth of electronic commerce and personal        communication.           (4) The Internet and the global information        infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize        the way individuals and businesses conduct business.           (5) The full potential of the Internet for the        conduct of business cannot be realized as long as it         is an insecure medium in which confidential business        information and sensitive personal information               remain at risk of unauthorized viewing, alteration,        and use.           (6) Encryption of information enables busi-        nesses and individuals to protect themselves against        the unauthorized viewing, alteration, and use of         information by employing widely understood and          readily available science and technology to ensure        the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of        information.           (7) In order to promote economic growth and        meet the needs of businesses and individuals in the        United States, a variety of encryption products and        programs should be available to promote good, flexi-        ble, and commercially acceptable encryption capab-        ilities.           (8) United States computer, computer software and        hardware, communications, and electronics business are                 leading the world technology revolution, as those        businesses have developed and are prepared to offer         immediately to computer users worldwide a variety of         communications and computers hardware and computer        software that provide good, robust, and easy-to-use        encryption.           (9) United States businesses seek to market the        products described in paragraph (8) in competition        with scores of foreign businesses in many countries        that offer similar, and frequently stronger, encryp-        tion products and programs.            (10) United States businesses have been discouraged        from further developing and marketing products with         encryption capabilities because of regulatory efforts        by the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the         National Institute Of Standards and Technology and         other entities of the Department of Commerce, to        promulgate standards and guidelines in support of         government-designed solutions to encryption problems         that-              (A) were not developed in the private sector;                  and              (B) have not received widespread commercial                  support.          (11) Because of outdated Federal controls, United        States businesses have been prohibited from exporting        goods encryption products and programs.          (12) The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the        National Institute of Standards and Technology has         attempted to leverage the desire of United States         businesses to sell commercial products to the United         States Government, and sell a single product         worldwide, to force the businesses to include features         in products sold by the businesses in the United States         and in foreign countries that will allow the Federal         Government easy access to the plain text of all         electronic information and communications.                   (13) Specifically, the Secretary of Commerce, acting        through the National Institute of Standards and          Technology, has proposed that United states businesses          be allowed to sell products and programs offering good          encryption to the United States Government, and in          foreign countries only if the products and programs         include a feature guaranteeing the Federal         Government access to a key that decrypts information        (hereafter in this section referred to as "key escrow          encryption").          (14) The key escrow encryption approach to regulating         encryption is reflected in the approval in 1994 by the         National Institute of Standards and Technology of a         Federal information processing standard for a standard        known as the "clipper chip", that was flawed and         controversial.          (15) The Federal Government-               (A) has designed key escrow encryption to solve                    a perceived problem; and               (B) has ignored the fact that-                   (i) there is no demonstrated commercial                       demand for features which give                       governments easy access to information;                       and                     (ii) numerous nonkey escrow encryption                      alternatives are available commercially                       from foreign suppliers and free of charge                      from the Internet.          (16) In order to promote electronic commerce in the               twenty-first century to realize the full                potential of the Internet and other computer               networks-                           (A) United States businesses should be                          encouraged to develop and market products                   and programs offering encryption                    capabilities; and                (B) the Federal Government should be prohibited                   from promulgating regulations and adopting                   policies that discourage the use and sale of                   encryption.   (b) PURPOSE- The purpose of this Act is to promote electroniccommerce through the use of strong encryption by-          (1) recognizing that businesses in the United States         that offer computer hardware and computer software made         in the United States that incorporate encryption        technology are ready and immediately able, with respect         to electronic information that will be essential to        conducting business in the twenty-first century to        provide products that are designed to-               (A) protect the confidentiality of that                   information: and               (B) ensure the authenticity and integrity                   of that information;          (2) restricting the Department of Commerce with        respect to the promulgation or enforcement of regulations,        or the application of policies, that impose government-        designed encryption standards; and               (3) promoting the ability of United States businesses        to sell to computer users worldwide computer software and        computer hardware that provide the strong encryption        demanded by such users by-               (A) restricting Federal or State regulation of the                   sale of such products and programs in                   interstate commerce;               (B) prohibiting mandatory key escrow encryption                   systems; and               (C) establishing conditions for the sale of                   encryption products and programs in foreign                   commerce.SEC.3 DEFINITIONS.

Bob Goodlatte (R-VA)and Tom Campbell (R-CA) on Wednesday (5/15) sent a letter to PresidentClinton urging the President to abandon the Administration's key-escrowencryption proposal and "instead immediately liberalize export controls onnon-key escrow encryption technology."Expressing "serious concerns" about the impact of current U.S. encryptionpolicy on individual privacy and US competitiveness, the bi-partisan groupwrote: "The ability of companies and individuals to ensure that theinformation they send over communications and computer networks is secureis a prerequisite to exploiting the potential of the Global InformationInfrastructure."The letter was signed by several prominent members from both parties,including Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Tom Campbell (R-CA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA),Rick Boucher (D-VA), Bob Barr (R-GA), Pat Schroeder (D-CO), CarlosMoorehead (R-CA), and 20 other members.The bi-partisan call to President Clinton to abandon the Administration'skey escrow policy is yet another encouraging sign of increasingly strongCongressional support for reform of US encryption policy.  Congress iscurrently considering several bills designed to encourage the widespreadavailability privacy-protecting technologies for the Internet by liftingexport controls on strong encryption:* HR 3011, the "Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act of  1996", sponsored by over 30 members including  Reps Goodlatte (R-VA),  Campbell (R-CA), Eshoo (D-CA), Boucher (D-VA).* S. 1726, the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-  CODE) act of 1996, sponsored by Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT),  Pressler (R-SD), Dole (R-KS), Wyden (D-OR), and Murray (D-WA)* S. 1587, the "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996", also  sponsored by Senators Burns and Leahy.Hearings on HR 3011 (Rep Goodlatte's bill) and the Burns/Leahy S. 1726(Pro-CODE) are expected in June.INTERNET SECURITY DAY - A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE NEED TO REFORM USENCRYPTION POLICYIn July, CDT and over 25 other organizations will hold a daylong educationevent in California's Silicon Valley in July.

Wednesday's hearing illustratedthat a sea change has occurred in Congressional attitude towards theencryption policy debate.While members of the Subcommittee noted the complex law enforcement issuesraised by the encryption policy debate, the Senators also recognized thatbecause of the global nature of the Internet, top down regulations such asexport controls and centralized government mandates like the Clipperschemes will not address the needs of individuals, business, and even lawenforcement in the Information Age.In addition, several Senators noted that future of electronic commerce,privacy, and the competitiveness of the US computer industry should not beheld hostage to law enforcement considerations.This change in Congressional attitude towards encryption policy issignificant and extremely encouraging.Wednesday's hearing was also significant because it was the first everCongressional hearing cybercast live on the Internet. Details on theCybercast are attached below.The hearing, chaired by Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), was called to considerthe Promotion Of Commerce Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) legislation,which would relax current regulations restricting the export of strongencryption.Witnesses testifying before the panel included:* Phil Zimmermann, Inventor of PGP* Whit Diffie, Sun Microsystems, Father of Public-Key Cryptography* Phil Karn, Qualcomm Inc, Cryptographer* Marc Rotenberg, Director, Electronic Privacy Information Center* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center for Democracy and Technology* Matt Blaze, Lucent Technologies Cryptographer,* Barbara Simons, Chair of US Public Policy Committee, ACM* And 135 Netizens (http://www.crypto.com)CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman also testified before the Subcommittee.Noting that the current US encryption policy has left individual Internetusers without adequate privacy and businesses without necessary security,Berman urged Congress to instead move forward to reform US policy based onthe following principals:* THE INTERNET IS NOT LIKE A TELEPHONE SYSTEM: The traditional approach  to wiretapping cannot simply be extended to the Internet. This new  medium encompasses a range of social functions far beyond simple two-  way voice communication.  These broad activities demand a heightened  capacity for uses to protect their security and privacy online.* THE INTERNET IS A GLOBAL, DECENTRALIZED MEDIUM: Efforts to impose  unilateral national policies -- such as export controls or key escrow  proposals -- are unlikely to be accepted widely.  Decentralized user  choice solutions to privacy problems are preferable to and more  effective than centralized, governmental mandates (such as the  Clipper proposals).* ON THE INTERNET, THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS A LOCAL ORDINANCE:  Constitutional guarantees of privacy and free expression to U.S.  Citizens whose communications regularly cross national borders.  Policies should be designed to protect Americans outside the shelter  of U.S. law.Berman expressed CDT's strong support for Congressional efforts to reformUS Encryption policy, and urged Congress to act quickly to liberalizeexport controls and provide American Internet users with the strongsecurity and privacy they so badly need.Audio transcripts of the Hearing, copies of the prepared statements of thewitnesses, and other background information is available at CDT'sencryption policy web page: http://www.cdt.org/crypto/HEARING SHOWS NEW SENSE OF URGENCY AND FOCUS IN CONGRESSThe clearest example of the emerging frustration in Congress with thecurrent export restrictions came in an exchange between Senator JohnAschroft (R-MO) and Phil Karn, a cryptographer with Qualcomm and aplaintiff in a case challenging the export restrictions:Sen. Aschroft: So for all other countries, the world is the market, but               for American companies, America is the only market and               the rest of the world is off limits?Karn:          You've got it.Sen. Aschroft: Mr. Chairman, I think that's one of the reasons we need               to look very carefully at the bill (Pro-CODE) we are               looking at here today...Sen. Aschroft: In all our discussions about whether it (cryptography) is               good or bad, we ignore the fact that it's THERE, and it               can be available to Americans by American companies, it               cannot be available to anyone else by American companies,               but it can be available around the world by a company in               any other country.This exchange, as well as strong statements in support of the BurnsPro-CODE bill from Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), andRepresentative Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), who made the unusual move of coming toa Senate hearing, show that Congress is finally giving the need to reformUS encryption policy serious support.A hearing of the full Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Senator LarryPressler (R-SD) is expected in mid July.  Representatives from theAdministration and Law Enforcement agencies are expected to testify.  CDTis working with Senator Burns' and Senator Pressler to bring that hearinglive online.

The bill is scheduled to be considered by the full Laborand Human Resources Committee on April 24. If the Committee approves the bill,S.1360 will be ready to be voted on by the full Senate in the coming months. The revised Bennett-Leahy bill incorporates many of the key changes recommended by CDT (see CDT policy post March 19, 1996) and members of a CDT-led coalition, including AIDS Action Council, the Legal Action Center, the Center for Patients' Rights, IBM, AARP, the American Hospital Association, and the Association of Academic Health Centers. In addition, thebill includes revisions suggested by Public Citizen, the Coalition for Patient's Rights, the ACLU, and EPIC.In its current form, CDT believes that S.1360 is an extremely strong and enforceable medical privacy bill, which would give people the right to seetheir own records, prohibit disclosures of most personal medical data withoutthe patient's consent, and bring heavy criminal and civil penalties to bear on those who violate the law. The revised S.1360, like its predecessor, is more stringent than any medical records privacy law currently on the books ateither the state or federal level. If passed, the Bennett-Leahy bill will give people the greatest degree of control over the use and disclosure of their personal medical data. CDT hopes that the Senate Labor Committee will unanimously approve the amended S.1360.Significant changes to S. 1360 include: o  A new section has been added to S.1360 that lays out the principles underlying the bill, including that people have a right of confidentiality in their medical records that is being eroded, and that such erosion may jeopardize the quality of health care by reducing peoples' willingness to confide in their doctors. o  The revised S.1360 narrows instances under which protected health information may be disclosed without the individual's consent. Under S.1360 as introduced, a number of disclosures of personal health information were allowed without the individual's consent, such as to researchers and for the purpose of creating nonidentifiable data. Both of these exceptions to consent have been eliminated. S.1360 now requires researchers who want access to identifiable data to get the record subject's consent, unless they can meet a waiver standard already in place for federally funded researchers.   o  The revised S.1360 removes "health information services" from being treated as trustees, and now only allows them to receive personal health information with an individual's consent. Now, trustees, such as doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies, must anonymize personal health information prior to disclosing it to health information services, such as EDS or Equifax. A health information service may only strip the identifiers if they are under the control of a trustee as an employee or contractor. This change is a major improvement in the bill, which will significantly limit the number of people who get access to sensitive medical data. Overall, the bill creates a big incentive to use health data in nonidentifiable form.  o  S.1360 now includes a higher "clear and convincing evidence" standard that law enforcement must meet before a warrant can be issued for access to personal medical information. o  S.1360 has now been narrowed by clarifying that insider access to medical records must be limited. The bill now states explicitly that internal disclosures of personal health information must be compatible with and directly related to the purposes for which the information was collected.For more information on the Medical Records Privacy legislation, including the text of the S.1360 as introduced and as revised (once it is made available), CDT's recommended changes to S.1360, CDT's testimony before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, and other relevant information, visit CDT's Health Information Web Page at:	http://www.cdt.org/health_priv.htmlFor additional information contactThe Center for Democracy and Technology    +1.202.637.9800	Janlori Goldman, Deputy Director	Deirdre Mulligan, Staff Counsel-------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATIONBe sure you are up to date on the latest public policy issues affectingcivil liberties online and how they will affect you!

Senator Burns announcedthe bill via a teleconference during a special session at the Computers,Freedom, and Privacy Conference in Boston, MA.The bill, titled the "Promoting Commerce On-Line in the Digital Age Act"(PROCODE), joins two recent bills introduced earlier this month (S. 1587and HR 3011) designed to encourage the development of strong, easy-to-useprivacy and security products for the Internet.The Burns bill is different from the other proposals in several respects.Specifically, the latest bill does not contain any new criminal provisionsor provisions imposing liability on third party key holders.In his presentation today at CFP, Sen. Burns outlined his new bill. Among other things, the "Promoting Commerce On-Line in the Digital Age Act" would:* Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"  encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy  and popular World Wide Web software. Encryption software and hardware   for sale in local software stores or widely available on the Internet   would all be exportable under the proposed Act.* Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export of  other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are  generally available outside the United States.* Prohibit the Federal Government from imposing mandatory key-escrow  encryption policies on the domestic market.* Limit the authority of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for  encryption products.CDT applauds this effort by Senator Burns to put strong privacy andsecurity technologies in the hands of individuals and businesses. CDT isalso pleased that the Senator chose the Computers, Freedom, and PrivacyConference as a forum to announce this proposal. The choice of CFPdemonstrates that the Internet community is becoming an increasinglyimportant political constituency.CDT looks forward to working with Senator Burns and other members ofCongress interested in policies which encourage the development andwidespread use of strong privacy protecting technologies for the GlobalInformation Infrastructure.FOR MORE INFORMATIONFor more information on the cryptography policy debate, including the textof Senator Burns' proposal when available, visit CDT's Cryptography IssuesWeb Page:http://www.cdt.org/crypto/Contacts:Center for Democracy and Technology  +1.202.637.9800 Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director,  Alan Davidson, Staff Counsel, -------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATIONBe sure you are up to date on the latest public policy issues affectingcivil liberties online and how they will affect you!

March 14, nearly 25,300 individuals have joined theCitizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC) legal challenge to theCommunications Decency Act.  This historic legal challenge will determineboth the fate of the Internet and the future of freedom of expression in the Information Age.  To allow more Internet users to participate in thislandmark case, the deadline for individuals to join the Citizens InternetEmpowerment Coalition (CIEC) legal challenge to the Communications Decency Act has been extended.Individuals who join the CIEC before March 31, 1996 will be added to theCoalition documents to be filed in the Federal Court in Philadelphia.  Thecoalition will remain open after March 31 until just before the casereaches the Supreme Court (expected late 1996).   The goal is to have asmany individual members of the CIEC as possible by the time the casereaches the Supreme Court (regardless of who wins the first courtchallenge, slated to begin on March 21 and last through April 12, eitherside can immediately appeal to the Supreme Court).For more information, including information on how you can join the fight,visit the CIEC home page at: http://www.cdt.org/ciec/The 25,300 individual CIEC members, collected in just over 17 days, is atruly astounding representation of the breadth the net.community's concernover the impact of the Communications Decency Act.  Under the CDA, everyInternet user who posts messages to Usenet Newsgroups, public listervs, IRCor online chat sessions, or maintains their own World Wide Web page ispotentially subject to $250,000 fines and 2 years in prison if someonesomewhere considers the material "indecent".  CIEC members believe thatthis law is clearly unconstitutional and threatens the viability of theInternet as a medium for free expression, education, and commerce.COURT TO HEAR THE CASE BEGINNING MARCH 21The CIEC challenge, which has been consolidated with another challengemounted by the ACLU, EFF, EPIC, and other plaintiffs, will be argued beforea 3 judge panel in a Philadelphia Federal Court beginning Thursday March21. The schedule for the hearings are as follows:March 21, 22 & April 1:  CIEC and ACLU lawyers and witnessesApril 11, 12:            Dept. of Justice lawyers and witnessesCDT, with the cooperation of the Justice Department, the clerk of thePhiladelphia Federal Court, and Bell Atlantic, has arranged to wire theCourt Room for Internet access. We are installing a T1 line and a smalllocal area network with at least 3 computers to enable the court to see theInternet and view demonstrations of parental control technologies.  To thebest of our knowledge, this represents the first time a Federal Court hasbeen wired to the Internet for the purposes of a trial.CDT is also working out arrangements to provide real-time updates of thecourt proceedings.  Please stay tuned for more information, and continue tovisit CDT's home page for more information (URL:http://www.cdt.org)BACKGROUND ON THE CIEC CHALLENGEThe Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition challenge, which in addition tothe 25,300 individuals includes libraries, online service providers,newspaper and book publishers, commercial and non-commercial contentproviders, and public interest advocates, argues that the Internet is aunique communications medium.  Because of the tremendous user controlinherent in interactive media, and because the Internet providesessentially unlimited publishing capacity, broad, mass-media contentregulations such as those imposed by the Communications Decency Act areoverly restrictive and therefore unconstitutional.The CDA is so broad that it encompasses material such as the '7 dirtywords', classic works of fiction such as the Catcher in the Rye or Ulysses,Sex education and AIDS education materials, artwork, and otherconstitutionally protected materials. Although some of this material maynot be appropriate for children, it is protected by the Constitution. Underthe CDA, the very same material which is legal today in newspapers,magazines, and books would be *illegal* if posted to a public forum on theInternet. As a result, the CDA threatens to chill the free flow ofinformation and create second-class status for online speech.The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the government may onlyregulate constitutionally protected speech if it employs the "leastrestrictive means".  Because of the availability of strong, effective userempowerment technologies such as SurfWatch, Cyberpatrol, PICS, etc., thebroad content regulations imposed by the CDA are clearly not the "leastrestrictive means" and are therefore unconstitutional.For more information on the CIEC challenge, including information on howyou can join this historic legal battle:World Wide Web:   http://www.cdt.org/ciec/email:            ciec-info@cdt.org (general information via auto-reply)-----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATIONBe sure you are up to date on the latest public policy issues affectingcivil liberties online and how they will affect you!

Senator Burnsalso discussed the importance of his bill to the future of privacy andsecurity on the Internet and the need to encourage the widespreadavailability of strong, easy-to-use encryption technologies.Excerpts of the 50 minute discussion are printed below. The full transcriptof the event is available at the Encryption Policy Resource Page: URL: http://www.crypto.com/By bringing together a United States Senator and interested Internet usersin a discussion of an important Internet policy issue, last night's eventillustrates the value of the Net in the political process and the growingimportance of the net.community as a political constituency.  Several moresimilar events are planned for the coming weeks (see scheduling informationbelow).------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) EXCERPTS FROM MONDAY NIGHT'S TOWN MEETINGThe entire transcript is available at http://www.crypto.com/Question   : Senator Burns, As a small business in Montana that             provides web-space to local Montana             businesses, I'm concerned that the lack of privacy             and security on the Net will keep many of my             potential customers from purchasing online. How will             this bill help?Sen Burns  : That's exactly why I introduced this bill. Right now             I don't think any of us feel safe ...             transmitting our credit card numbers over the             Internet, and many companies ...             who have workers around the nation or world are             worried about how they can safely send ...             sensitive information back and forth between them. If             we can raise their level ...             of security, we can guarantee that that information             will be sent without unwanted eyes ...             looking in.Question   : How will these new crypto bills (PRO-CODE, S.1587, HR             3011) affect the administration's                 concerns in the areas of counter terrorism, counter             narcotics, etc? (Columbia, MD)Sen Burns  : Well, the point is that these terrorists already have             access to strong encryption ...             from other companies around the world. I mean, my             heavens, you can download it ...             right over the Internet now. I expect we will have             conversations with the FBI, with NSA ..             to address their concerns. But this technology is             like a lot of other things out there ...             It can be used for good purposes, but it also can be             misused. I don't think we want to ...             ban kitchen knives just because a few evil-doers out             there are misusing them.Question   : What do you think the Administration, FBI, and NSA reaction             to your bill will be? Have you already heard from them?             (I run an ISP in Missoula, Montana.)Sen Burns  : We expect them to have some concern with this, and we will             work with them but we have to understand that the people we             are concerned with can already gain encryption that is             already longer than 40 bits on the international market.The transcript is the property of America Online, who retains the copyright.------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) SCHEDULE OF FUTURE EVENTSSenator Conrad Burns - Monday May 13, 9:00pm ET at HotWired's Club Wired  * Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) will hold a second 'town meeting' to    discuss his recent legislation to encourage the widespread    availability of strong, easy-to-use, privacy and security    technologies for the Net.HotWired (http://www.hotwired.com) is a free service open to all Internetusers.

Thegroup, co-founded by Reps. Rick White (R-WA), Rick Boucher (D-VA), SenatorsLarry Pressler (R-SD) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) will work to educate membersof Congress about how the Internet works, bring more members of Congressonline, and encourage the use of the Net to facilitate better communicationbetween members of Congress and their constituents.The formation of the Caucus represents a tremendous opportunity for theInternet community to have an even more powerful voice in the many policydebates affecting the future of the Internet. Additional Caucus membersinclude Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA), and SenatorRon Wyden (D-OR). The Center for Democracy and Technology, the Progress andFreedom Foundation, other public interest groups and industry associationsserve on the Caucus' advisory committee.The Caucus has set up a World Wide Web page with information on itsactivities and information on how to contact Caucus members:http://www.house.gov/white/internet_caucus/netcauc.htmlCAUCUS BORN OUT OF NEED TO EDUCATE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ABOUT THE NETIn an historic move and an important overture to the Internet community,Congressman Rick White on Friday March 29 presented an overview of theCaucus and its goals via teleconference during a special session at theComputers, Freedom and Privacy Conference (CFP) in Boston MA.  CFP is anannual gathering of the Internet community, law enforcement officials, andrepresentatives from the computer and communications industry.During his presentation at CFP, Rep. White told the audience that theCaucus was formed in part as a result of his frustration that, during thecourse of the debate on the recently enacted Communications Decency Act,many members of Congress voted for the CDA without any knowledge of whatthe Internet is. White said that one of the primary goals of the Caucus isto educate the Congress to ensure that future policy debates on Internetissues such as Cryptography policy, copyright, and content regulations arebased on a full understanding of and familiarity with the Internet.Members of Congress who join the Internet Caucus have pledged to thefollowing five principals:* Open up Congress so that constituents can have more information from  and more access to their elected representatives.* Network with the Internet community to receive their input on the  issues affecting the Internet that come before Congress.* Learn more about how the Internet works and how to use it.* Increase member's usage of the Internet by working to get more members  of Congress online by the end of this year.* In Ninety days, get online by maintaining a World Wide Web site and  public email for constituents.* Educate members of Congress about the Internet and raise the level of  knowledge on upcoming Internet issues that Congress will deal with in  the Information Age.The formation of the Caucus comes not a moment too soon. In the wake of thepassage of the Communications Decency Act, Congress is poised to considerseveral other issues which will have tremendous implications on the futureof the Internet, including Cryptography Policy and Copyright.  As we sawwith the passage of the Communications Decency Act, bad Internet policy isthe direct result of a lack of understanding of the Net and how itfunctions. CDT looks forward to working with the Caucus to help educateCongress on the nature of the Internet and to encourage the use of theInternet to promote dialogue between members of Congress and theirconstituents. CDT believes that the Internet Caucus will play a criticalrole in ensuring that the concerns of the Internet community arerepresented in Congress.-------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATIONBe sure you are up to date on the latest public policy issues affectingcivil liberties online and how they will affect you!

The full House/Senate conference committee will consider the issue within the next two weeks.After months of contentious debate, the conferees must now choose between two proposals: one proposal sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL) and an alternative proposed by Rep. Rick White (R-WA).  The Hyde proposal would severely restrict freedom of speech on the Internet, and grant the Federal Communications Commission new authority to regulate online content. The White proposal relies on parents, not federal bureaucrats, to determine what material is and is not appropriate for themselves and their children, though it also imposes new criminal penalties for individuals who transmit material that is "harmful to minors".The outcome of this decision will have tremendous implications on the future of freedom of expression and the development of interactive media as a whole. If the Hyde proposal prevails, the Internet as we know it will never be the same. CDT firmly believes that no new laws in this area are necessary. Current law is already working to punish online stalkers and prosecute the distribution of obscene material online. However, choosing nothing is not an option available to the Conference Committee. Given the options before the committee, CDT believes that the effort of Congressman White should be commended. He has tried to find a resolution to this issue which preserves freedom of speech and relies on user empowerment over government control of online content. Rep. White's proposal represents the only option on the table which will not destroy the Internet and the future of interactive communications technologies. Although this is a difficult choice for the Net.Community, White must prevail at this stage.The Hyde proposal, which is being pushed heavily by the Christian Coalition, would severely restrict freedom of speech and the democratic potential of the Internet and other interactive media. It fails to recognize the global, decentralized nature of interactive media and its tremendous ability for user control. The proposal would be wholly ineffective at accomplishing its stated objective of protecting children from objectionable material, while destroying the Internet in the process.If the conferees choose Hyde's approach over White, the Federal Communications Commission will, for the first time ever, have the authority to regulate online content and the underlying technologies of the net itself. In addition, the First Amendment and the free flow of information online will be chilled by an overly broad "indecency" standard. Online service providers will be forced to monitor all traffic to ensure that no "indecent" material is transmitted (creating a nightmare for freedom of speech and privacy), or shut down some service all together for fear of expensive law suits or prison sentences. And although all these provisions can be challenged in court, recent history with the so-called "dial-a-porn" and indecency an cable channels (Alliance for Community Media vs. FCC) suggest that such challenges can take years to resolve, and even then with no guarantee of success.Representative White's approach seeks to protect cyberspace from intrusion by the federal government, and to empower parents to make decisions about what is and is not appropriate for themselves and for their children. While the proposal does contain new criminal provisions, including restrictions on the display of material that is "harmful to minors", it also creates a defense to prosecution for those who take good faith, reasonable efforts to label content and enable others to block it using user control technologies. The fate of the Net, and the future of freedom of speech and the democratic potential of interactive media, now rests in the hands of the conference committee members.OVERVIEW OF THE HYDE AND WHITE PROPOSALSI.  THE HYDE PROPOSALRepresentative Hyde is pushing an unconstitutional and overly regulatory proposal which would criminalize the transmission and display of "indecent material" (a broad classification which includes everything from the so-called '7 dirty words' to classic works of fiction such as The Catcher In the Rye and Ulysses), hold carriers liable for material created by their subscribers, and grant the Federal Government broad new authority over online content and the underlying technologies of the Internet. The Hyde proposal has been endorsed by the Christian Coalition and other members of the "religious-right".Among other things, the Hyde proposal would:1. Create $100,000 fines and 2 year jail terms for anyone who makes or    makes available any indecent material to a minor (Sec 402 (d)).2. Grant the FCC broad authority over on line speech and over online    technology (Sec (e)(1))3. Criminalize the transmission or display of indecent material to       anyone under 18 years of age (Amendment to 18 USC 1465),4. Not pre-empt state from passing even more restrictive, or even     inconsistent, regulations.See CDT Policy Post No. 30 (December 1, 1995) for a detailed description of the Hyde proposal. For more information, including the text of the Hyde proposal and other relevant documents, visit CDT's net-censorship issues page (http://www.cdt.org/cda.html)II.  THE WHITE PROPOSALThe proposal offered by Representative White, an original co-sponsor of the Cox/Wyden/White "Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment" Amendment, is based on the user empowerment aspects of the original Cox/Wyden/White amendment. The White proposal substitutes the narrower "harmful to minors" standard for "indecency", and prohibits the FCC from imposing content regulations on online speech and from meddling in the underlying technologies of the Internet.  While the White proposal does prohibit the "display" of material that is harmful to minors online, it creates a defense for those who take good faith, reasonable steps, to labile content and enable users to block or objectionable material using user control technologies (such as SurfWatch, the Parental Control features of AOL or Prodigy, or the PICS standards being developed by MIT and the World Wide Web Consortium).Briefly, the White proposal would:1. Prohibit intentionally sending material that is harmful to minors    directly to a to someone the sender knows is a minor,2. Prohibit the display of material that is harmful to minors. However,    content providers (including individual users) would be immune to    prosecution if they have taken good faith, reasonable efforts to    labile their content and enable it to be blocked or filtered by others    (The MIT/World Wide Web consortium's PICS would be one example),3. Prohibit the FCC from regulating content on or the technologies of     the Internet and other interactive media, 4. Pre-empt inconsistent state laws, although this provision would not    apply to individuals, non-profit providers of interactive computer    services (such as BBS's or freenets), or non-profit organizations.5. Clarify the House-passed Cox/Wyden/White to ensure that it does    inadvertently create loopholes in ECPA or other privacy laws,6. Protect online service providers from vicarious liability for    transmitting their subscribers messages or for merely providing     access to the Internet.III. BACKGROUND ON THE "HARMFUL TO MINORS" STANDARDWhite's proposal would prohibit sending material that is "harmful to minors" directly to a minor, as well as prohibit the display of material that is "harmful to minors" unless good faith, reasonable steps to labile and enable others to block access to such material.Harmful to minors is an intermediate standard between indecency and obscenity. It is essentially material that is obscene to a minor. It has been used in 48 state statutes and has been ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court. It is defined as follows:"'harmful to minors' means any communications or material that is obscene or that:   (a)  taken as a whole, and with respect to minors, appeals to a           prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion;   (b)  depicts, represents, or describes in a patently offensive way         with respect to what is suitable for minors, ultimate sexual         acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, sado-masochistic         acts or abuse; or lewd exhibition of the genitals, pubic area,         buttocks, or post-putertal female breasts; and   (c)  taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political,        or scientific value for minors.Materials that would be acceptable under this standard include the text of Catcher in the Rye, Ulysses, the use of the "7 dirty words" in context, and works of art which contain nudity. These same materials would be prohibited under an "indecency" standard. NEXT STEPSOnce the House conferees vote on Wednesday, the full House/Senate conference committee will consider the issue. If the House conferees accept the White proposal, there will be additional opportunities to clarify and strengthen the proposal. However, if Hyde prevails, the entire battle will be lost.In addition to the "cyberporn issue", there are several other issues in the telecommunications bill which the conferees much resolve, including competition in the long distance market, cable rate regulation, and universal service, to name a few. The Republican leadership has reportedly instructed the conferees to finish all remaining issues this week and to have the final bill ready for the full House and Senate during the week of December 11. It is not clear whether this deadline can actually be met given the range of unresolved issues, but the House and Senate leadership appear committed to the timeline. CDT will keep you informed of developments on this issue as they occur. We will also post the text of the White proposal on our net-censorship web page as soon as a final copy is available (we expect it to be posted by Tuesday afternoon 12/5).For more information, visit CDT's net-censorship issues page:     http://www.cdt.org/cda.html---------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CDT POLICY POST LISTCDT Policy Posts, which is what you have just finished reading, are the regular news publication of the Center For Democracy and Technology.

Recommendations to create a national "worker verification" data system are central components of 3 bills currently before the Subcommittee on Immigration of the Judiciary Committee:  S. 269, "The Immigrant Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1995," introduced on January 24, 1995, by Senator Simpson (R-WY), Chairman of the Subcommittee, is scheduled for mark-up on June 6th; S. 580, the "Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 1995," introduced on March 21, 1995, by Senator Feinstein; and, S. 754, the "Immigration Enforcement Improvements Act of 1995," introduced on May 1, 1995, by Senators Kennedy, Simon and Boxer.  The Center for Democracy and Technology is opposed to the creation of a computerized system to verify work eligibility.  Such a system poses a substantial threat to privacy and is unlikely to accomplish the goal of eliminating the job market for undocumented immigrants.Leading the opposition to the national identification system proposals is a coalition of organizations and individuals, including conservative/free market groups, representatives of the business community, civil rights organizations and civil liberties organizations.  The loudest protest against the pending bills has been voiced by the conservative and libertarian communities.  In a speech at the Cato Institute, House Majority Leader Dick Armey stated, "I will fight it. . .Any system in which Americans would be forced to possess such a card, for any reason, is an abomination and wholly at odds with the American tradition of individual freedom."  The Center for Equal Opportunity and the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute are leading the conservative/libertarian outcry.  Stuart Anderson, Policy Director at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute spoke out against the proposals in a recent Washington Times editorial, "The federal government has never before held detailed information on all Americans in one consolidated place accessible to government officials and outside entities. . . The IRS, Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, computer hackers, even private organizations such as banks, could potentially access a national computer database."  IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS, ESTIMATED TO COMPRISE 1.5% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION, THE PROPOSALS CAST A BUREAUCRATIC NET AROUND 100% OF THE UNITED STATES POPULATION.  The coalition questions the logic of imposing a multi-billion dollar system of increased government bureaucracy upon the daily lives of Americans, at a time when less federal power and intrusion is the mantra of the day.  As Anderson says, "The price of fake documents and acceptable Social Security numbers will likely increase, but there is no reason to believe the number of illegal immigrants working here will decrease."  In this ill-conceived effort to address the problem of undocumented workers, every American worker will be forced to participate in an intrusive government system.  This is truly an Orwellian nightmare.Under the guise of reforming immigration policy the bills sponsors are asking Congress to authorize the creation of a broad worker verification registry that by design must contain information not just on illegal immigrants, but on every American and legal immigrant who desires to work.  For the first time the federal government has created a detailed system of records on individuals that it intends to make accessible to the public.  Rather than designing an effective system to manage immigration, these bills propose a national database that tramples on the civil rights and liberties of every American citizen and resident by subjecting each to unwanted and unnecessary invasions of privacy.  A NATIONAL WORKER VERIFICATION SYSTEM WILL NOT ACCOMPLISH ITS GOAL -- ELIMINATING THE JOB MARKET FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS -- BUT IT WILL INCREASE DISCRIMINATION.  A worker verification system is an ineffective tool for curbing the job market for unauthorized workers, and is very likely to lead to increased discrimination and erode individual privacy.  No matter what system or card is developed, the black market will continue to meet the demand for false documents.  Employers who hire undocumented workers will continue to violate the law; they do so intentionally and are unlikely to use a verification system.  Instead they will continue to hire undocumented workers, while law-abiding employers are subject to new and costly government regulation.  During the pilot study of the Telephone Verification System the projected costs to employers, for equipment and administration, ran between $1,075.00 and $16,155.THE PROPOSALS WILL LEAD TO THE CREATION OF AN ALL PURPOSE NATIONAL IDENTITY DOCUMENT.  In a "Roll Call" article on May 22, 1995, Senator Feinstein made her preference for a single fraud-resistant document clear.  Feinstein stated, "I believe that a new, phone or machine-readable card that all job and benefits applicants would be required to present . . . deserves careful consideration. . . counterfeit-resistant cards that incorporate 'biometric' data are available and in use today . . . whether the card carries a magnetic strip on which the bearer's unique voice, retina pattern, or fingerprint is digitally encoded. . . it is clear to me that state-of-the-art . . . IDs can and must replace the dinosaur age documents now being used."  Although the Senate proposals do not call for the creation of a document to verify identity, the very design of a vast system of information makes the development of such a document inevitable.  At a hearing held by the Subcommittee on Immigration on May 10, 1995, "Verification of Applicant Identity for Purposes of Employment and Public Assistance," it was quite clear that the creation of a national identity document is at the core of the "worker verification system" proposals.   The proposals will expand the treasure trove of information accessible to the unscrupulous individual who gets hold of another's SSN.  The use of the SSN as the "worker verification identifier" will facilitate linkage between various systems of governmental and private sector records, making the inevitable temptation to use the data base for other purposes even stronger.  The proliferation of the Social Security Number, a number that by law was to be used exclusively within the social security system, offers a telling example of the Government's inability and unwillingness to limit the uses to which such a massive system of identification and tracking can be put.  The SSN was created for a limited purpose.  Over the past fifty years its use by both the government and private sector has proliferated.  The SSN has become a multi-use identifier that can be used to link information contained in public and private sector databases.  The SSN is a key that unlocks vast storehouses of information collected on American citizens, such as credit, health, driving and banking records.AMERICANS WILL BE WRONGLY DENIED JOBS DUE TO INACCURATE DATA.  According to a recent GAO report, over 65 million American's change jobs or enter the workforce each year.  Even if the system's error rate was reduced to 1% over 650,000 people would inaccurately be denied the right to work each year due to faulty data.  Each Americans' ability to work will be dependent on the accuracy of data from the Social Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service, both of which have been widely criticized for keeping inaccurate records.  The INS recently admitted to losing 60,000 files of green-card applicants in California and is currently being sued by the American Civil Liberties Union.  Current estimates reveal error rates in INS records as high as 30%.  The Commissioner of Social Security, testifying in 1991 stated, "over 60 percent (of the SSNs in use today) are based on the assertions a person made at the time he or she applied for a SSN."  According to the testimony of Gilbert Fisher, Assistant Deputy Commissioner of SSA before the Subcommittee on May 10th, the cost of reissuing the 270 million cards necessary to address the problem of cards issued without proof of identity would cost between 3 and 6 billion dollars.  In fact, during a recent hearing it became apparent that a bottom line figure for the accuracy level to be reached prior to deploying the "worker verification system" has not been established or seriously considered.  It seems that the supporters of the bills would move forward on the "worker verification system" with full knowledge that individuals will be unfairly denied employment and benefits due to inaccurate data.  Senator Feinstein seems to be the least concerned with the loss of employment and benefits by eligible individuals.  In a Roll Call article on May 22, 1995, Senator Feinstein advocated moving forward immediately without the "pilot" studies and information gathering included in the majority of proposals.    A WORKER REGISTRY WILL BE ABUSED TO DISCRIMINATE AND INVADE PRIVACY.  The ability of the SSA or other government agency to monitor and control access to and use of an information system that is available to both agency employees and all potential employers is dubious.  A "worker verification system" or national identity document is prone to abuse by persons who use it to selectively screen individuals whose appearance, surname or accent suggests they are foreign, or to screen such persons outside the employment context.  The system or document will place a powerful weapon in the hands of those seeking to harass and discriminate.          In addition to unauthorized outside use of the system, the creation of a worker verification data system will subject individuals to invasions of privacy and discrimination from agency employees.  Both the IRS and the SSA have recently been subject to criticism for their lack of control over agency employees who were both browsing through information for their own purposes, and making information available to outsiders for monetary compensation.  The openness of the proposed worker verification system will make it more difficult to monitor and control the use of sensitive personal information and therefore subject individuals to greater invasions of personal privacy and discrimination from system misuse.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------* ANALYSIS OF SELECT SECTIONS OF BILLS:1. The bills propose to expand the existing Telephone Verification    System (TVS) pilot  The TVS pilot project should not be expanded.  During phase I, nine companies participated in a pilot to test the TVS project.  This pilot has allowed companies to call the INS and ask for verification that non-citizens applying for work are eligible for employment.  Both S. 269 and S. 754 call for an expansion of TVS.  Numerous flaws were illuminated during phase I of the TVS pilot which counsel strongly against its expansion and undermine its utility.  First, it relies on "self- attestation" -- those presenting for employment must self identify as aliens -- to trigger the system.  Illegal immigrants can avoid the pilot and never have their eligibility to work checked by simply claiming to be a citizen.  Second, during the initial pilot, the INS found it was unable to make a determination of employment eligibility based on information contained in its computerized files 28% of the time, thus the INS had to perform a manual search to fulfill 28% of the verification requests.  2. S. 754 and S. 269 both recommend additional pilots that will improve,   utilize and link the Social Security Administration (SSA) and   Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) records and data systems S. 754 recommends the establishment of additional pilot projects that may include:  a process which allows employers to verify the eligibility for employment of new employees using the SSA's records and if necessary, to conduct a cross-check using INS records;  a simulated linkage of the electronic records of the INS and the SSA; and, improvements and additions to the electronic records of the INS and the SSA for the purpose of using such records for verification of employment eligibility.  (Section 202)  S. 269 directs the Administration to conduct demonstration projects in five states to test the feasibility of the system.  (Section 112 (a),(b))  More importantly, Section 113 of S. 269 directs the Attorney General to establish a database containing information obtained from the Social Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to be used in determining work authorization for individuals living in the United States within one year.  The database may be used in conjunction with both the demonstration projects and the final system.  This new data system will be managed by a new Office of Employment and Public Assistance Eligibility Verification.  The information collected by the Social Security Administration is insufficient for establishing identity.  The creation of a national identification system run by the SSA, INS or a new agency would require a vast increase in data collection on individuals.  For a system to accurately establish the identity of individuals it would need to contain information as to their identity - name, birth date and location, height and weight, for example - citizenship status, and most likely a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint.  Such a system would provide the government and private institutions with the ability to track and profile people from birth to death, creating what Professor Arthur Miller termed a "womb-to-tomb" dossier.Linking information contained in separate databases raises privacy concerns.  By allowing government agencies to share information we accelerate the creation of a system of national identification, and condone the use of information individuals provided to the government with the understanding that it would be used for a limited purpose for additional purposes without the individual's consent.  Use of the Social Security Number (SSN) and the underlying SSA database to verify the eligibility of individuals to work is impracticable and threatens privacy.  Like the INS database, the SSA database is riddled with errors.  The SSN was never intended to be relied on by itself as foolproof identification.  Historically, SSNs have been easy to obtain because there was no need for a secure card for Social Security Administration purposes.  Even with the strictest security measures it is impossible to build an impenetrable system.  The database will be a target for computer hackers who want information on individuals.  Although both S. 269 and 2. 745 contain provisions regarding use and protection of the data, the ability of the federal government to limit the use of large databases by the government and private sector is doubtful.  The "pilot" programs and "worker verification" system proposed by these bills are a huge step toward the establishment of a system of national identification and the creation of a national identification document.  The designation of the projects as "pilots" is misleading.  Under the guise of limited "pilot" projects the government is building the basic infrastructure necessary to implement a wholesale worker verification system.  The language used in the proposals masks the cold fact that actual individuals will be denied jobs and benefits, during the "test" of these "pilots."  A significant number of denials will be based on inaccurate information.  As the proliferation of the SSN demonstrates, the creation of a national database to verify each American's eligibility to enter the work force will lead to increased sharing of information, increased demands for access for purposes other than the one the system was designed to support, and increased demands on individuals by third parties for access to this information --  a heavy price to ask all American's to pay and one that has not been justified by the problem of illegal immigrant workers.  The "worker verification" system proposals open the door to an Orwellian nightmare.  Handing over the civil liberties of 98.5% of the American public is not the way to deal with the estimated 1.5% of the population that are illegal immigrants.  In the final analysis, the establishment of a "worker verification registry," is a solution that threatens to create more serious problems than it solves.  Given the tarnished history of national identification systems in America and other countries, the public distrust of data collection, and the extreme threat to civil liberties and civil rights posed by such systems, a "worker verification" database should not be adopted as the "quick fix" to the problem of undocumented workers.-----------------------------------------------------------------------2) LETTER SENT FROM RIGHT-LEFT COALITION MEMBERS OPPOSING NATIONAL ID   SYSTEMS.May 23, 1995Dear Member of Congress: We are writing to express our concern that both Congress and the Administration are moving toward the implementation of a national worker registry. We believe such a plan put forward in the name of immigration control, is both misguided and dangerous for the following reasons: It will not work. Those employers who rely on undocumented labor are already violating the law; they do so intentionally and are unlikely to use a verification system. Instead, they will continue to violate the law by hiring undocumented workers while employers who already comply with the law are subjected to new, costly requirements for the hiring process. Faulty data. The data which a nationwide verification system would use would rely on two highly flawed data bases, one by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the other the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS~. Both are notorious for containing incorrect or outdated information, with error rates as high as 28 percent. Roughly 65 million Americans either enter the work force or change jobs every year. Even an error rate of no higher than one percent would mean that 650,000 Americans could be denied jobs every year. An unfunded mandate on employers. The creation of a national verification system for every workplace in America would present a huge administrative burden to the nation's employers, especially small business. All employers would be required to ask the federal government's permission every time they want to hire somebody. Americans want fewer burdensome regulations, not new ones. A threat to privacy and civil rights. Worker registry proposals ask Congress to create a database of personal information on all Americans and make it accessible to all employers. The openness of the proposed systems raises barriers to controlling and monitoring the use of information. Such systems are prone to abuse by persons who use it to selectively screen individuals whose appearance, surname or accent suggests they are foreign or to screen such persons outside of the context of employment. In addition, government often lacks the political will to limit access to information once collected. Indeed, other purposes for the data base are already being proposed, including verifying eli~ibility for public benefits, tracking childhood immunizations, and tracking child support payments. Once a system of information on all Arnericans is in place, it will inevitably become ubiquitous in American life, presenting an enormous threat to the privacy and liberty of Americans. We believe it is unwarranted and unwise to create a data system involving 100 percent of Americans in an effort to identify the 1.5 percent who live illegally in the United States. We urge you to oppose the creation of a nationwide verification system.

"Gingrich's leadship on this issue will assure that new interactive media will be free to grow without unproductive government intrusion, and that the First Amendment rights of users will be protected."The statement from the Republican leader came on the same day that Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR) announced that they are developing a different approach to the problem of children's access to controversial material on the Internet.  Cox and Wyden say that they seek to encourage the development of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to screen the material to which their children have access.  At the same time, they hope to keep the growing Internet free from intrusive and ineffective regulation by the Federal Communications Commission."Along with the Speaker, Congessmen Cox and Wyden know that federal content censorship such as has existed in radio and television mass media will not be effective at protecting children," said Daniel Weitzner, CDT Deputy Director.  "In the decentralized, global Internet environment, we must rely on user control technology to enable users and parents to determine for themselves the information that they and their children receive."The Exon Internet censorship bill was strongly opposed in the Senate by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI).  The Exon/Coats bill was approved, however, by the Senate last week and is still awaiting House action.Gingrich made his remarks (attached below) last night on a national television show, the Progress Report carried on National Empowerment Television during a discussion with Rep. Bob Walker (R-PA) and Progress and Freedom Foundation Chairman Jay Keyworth.Gingrich said:"I think that the Amendment you referred to by Senator Exon in the Senate will have no real meaning and have no real impact and in fact I don't think will survive. It is clearly a violation of free speech and it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each other. I don't agree with it and I don't think it is a serious way to discuss a serious issue, which is, how do you maintain the right of free speech for adults while also protecting children in a medium which is available to both? That's also frankly a problem with television and radio, and it's something that we have to wrestle with in a calm and mature way as a society.

The provisions adoptedtoday would make the Internet and Interactive media the most heavilyregulated communicatoins medium in the United States, and severely threaten the future of free expression and democratic values in the information age.The proposal, if agreed to by the full conference committee, would impose$100,000 fines and prison terms for anyone who posts any "indecent"material, including the "7 dirty words", the text of classic works offiction such as The Catcher In The Rye, or Ulysses, artwork containingimages of nudes, rap lyrics, in a public forum.CDT strongly opposes the legislation agreed to by the House confereestoday. We believe this proposal threatens the very existence of theInternet as a means for free expression, education, and politicaldiscourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion bythe Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.Indecent material is constitutionally protected speech which the SupremeCourt has ruled can only be restrictive through the "least restrictivemeans". Material that has been considered "indecent" has included, amongother things:* The so-called "7 dirty words"* The Catcher In The Rye* Sex and AIDS Education literature* Photographic, sculpted, and painted images of nudes* Rap LyricsPosting any of the above materials in a public forum would be illegal underthe provision approved today. Although it is unrealistic to expect thatFederal law enforcement has the resources to go after each and everyviolation, the threat of $100,000 fines and 2 year prison sentences willresult in a severe chilling effect over all online communications.CDT will devote all our efforts in the coming weeks to ensure that the fullconference committee does not endorse the approach approved today by theHouse. We are also committed to fighting this battle all the way to theSupreme Court, if necessary, to ensure that these provisions areoverturned.The text of the proposal will be placed on CDT's net-censorship web page(URL below) as soon as it's available. CDT will also post a detailedanalysis of the bill soon.WHITE PROPOSAL ADOPTED, THEN AMENDED TO INCLUDE INDECENCY STANDARD 2 LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TIP THE SCALES IN FAVOR OF RELIGIOUS-RIGHTAt today's meeting of the House and Senate Conference Committee members,Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL) offered his proposal to prohibit the transmissionand display of indecent material online, and grant the FCC new authority toregulate the Internet. As expected, Rep. Rick White (R-WA) offered hisalternative, based on the narrow and constitutional "harmful to minors"standard and provisions to encourage parental control, not governmentcensorship. The House conferees then adjourned to a private room, away fromthe press and television cameras, to vote.The Conferees voted 20 - 13 to accept the White proposal. However, Rep.Goodlatte (R-VA) offered an amendment to substitute "indecency" for the"harmful to minors" standard in the White proposal. The Goodlatte amendmentwas approved on a vote of 17 - 16 and the "harmful to minors" standard wasreplaced by the blatantly unconstitutional "indecency standard".Representative White did NOT vote for the Goodlatte amendment.Amazingly, two traditionally liberal democrats, Reps. Pat Schroeder (D-CO)and John Conyers (D-MI) voted for the "indecency" standard! Had either ofthese members voted the other way, libraries, schools, and even parents whoallow children to access the text of The Catcher In The Rye online wouldnot now face $100,000 fines and prison sentences. Schroeder and Conyersshould be ashamed of themselves for not standing up for freedom of speechand democratic values at such a critical moment, and for assisting thecampaign of religious conservatives to impose their moral values on theInternet without regard for long-standing constitutional principals.Representative White should be commended for his efforts to craft aconstitutional proposal which preserved freedom of speech and relied onuser empowerment over government control of online content. He deservesgreat credit for his commitment to protecting the Internet and preservingfreedom of speech, and his willingness to stand up to religiousconservatives. Unfortunately, the critical element of his proposal whichmade it constitutional was removed over White's objections.NEXT STEPSThe provision approved today by the committee is similar to the Exon/CoatsCDA in that it relies on the "indecency" standard and contains defenses foronline service providers. The Senate is likely to adopt the proposal withonly minor changes. Senator Exon expressed optimism at today's conferencecommittee meeting that the issue would be resolved soon, perhaps as earlyas Friday.The Senate conferees are reviewing the language agreed to today by theHouse conferees. The House and Senate must each agree on the provisionsbefore the final bill can be voted on. CDT will keep you informed ofdevelopments on this issue as they occur.FOR MORE INFORMATIONVisit CDT's net-censorship issues web page:    http://www.cdt.org/cda.html---------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CDT POLICY POST LISTCDT Policy Posts, which is what you have just finished reading, are theregular news publication of the Center For Democracy and Technology.

Harkin's proposed amendment would eliminate the Fourth Amendment protections currently in 18 USC Sec. 2703 and would give law enforcement access to subscriber and customer information on telemarketers from an electronic communications service provider with the presentation of a mere written notice.  Harkin's proposal threatens to undermine severely the privacy protections on personal information held by communications providers.  If Harkin's amendment passes, it would open the door to the future unraveling of thissection which now requires the government to present a court order, warrant, or subpoena in order to obtain subscriber information.The Senate is expected to vote on the Harkin Amendment as early as today. CDT urges you to contact Senator Harkin to express your concern about his prposal.To Contact Senator Harkin:Phone: +1.202.224.7303by email: tom_harkin@harkin.senate.gov-----------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) Text of CDT/ACLU Letter to Sen. HarkinJune 13, 1995The Honorable Tom HarkinUnited States SenatorSH-531 Hart Senate Office BuildingWashington, DC 20510-1502Dear Senator Harkin:We are writing to register our strong opposition to your proposed amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652) which would amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(c)(1)(B), which provides privacy safeguards for telecommunication subscriber information by controlling government access.  Under your proposal, law enforcement could gain access from a telecommunications service provider to subscriber information upon mere submission of a "formal written request" where the subscriber is a telemarketer.  This proposal represents a severe departure from the strict Fourth Amendment framework that governs law enforcement access to personal communications and information under Title 18.  Under �2703, law enforcement officers must first present a warrant, court order, or administrative subpoena to an electronic communications service provider prior to disclosures of information about its subscribers.  This section acknowledges the important privacy interest people have in the personal information held by electronic communications service providers.  Your proposal would require information to be provided with fewer privacy protections than currently exist even in the case of a foreign counter-intelligence investigation.  The Fourth Amendment privacy protections embodied in Title 18 are the product of a long and thorough debate in which the concerns of law enforcement and the rights of citizens were aired and carefully balanced.  Your proposed amendment would unravel this delicate balance without the deliberative process necessary to carve out any exception to standard Fourth Amendment protections.The proposed amendment suggests that the available mechanisms offered in Title 18 are inadequate to address the problem of telemarketing fraud.  However, there has been no opportunity to create a record of the problem or the necessity of amending existing law.  We oppose weakening of court order requirements of Title 18.  We do not believe that this instance justifies opening the door on eliminating the strong Fourth Amendment privacy protections -- rendering other future "exceptions" to these privacy protections a virtual certainty.  We agree, telemarketing fraud is a serious problem and we are available to meet with you to discuss means of addressing it.  We encourage you to seek hearings on this issue so that a full record is developed and appropriate remedies, tailored to the problem, are crafted.  However, we must adamantly oppose your proposed amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act.  We look forward to working with you.

Senator Exon has joined forces with SenatorCoats (R-IA), and has introduced a revised Exon/Coats CommunicationsDecency Act amendment. The text of this proposal was not available forposting at the time of this writing, but will be made available as soon aswe have it.The Exon/Coats proposal is reportedly similar to the earlier Exonproposals, and would severely restrict the free speech and privacy rightsof all Internet users. In addition, the Exon/Coats proposal adds aprovision to ban the dissemination of indecency on all cable channels. Thiswould ban the showing of popular programs like NYPD Blue, Melrose Place,educational programing dealing with reproduction, and other programming,and is a clear violation of longstanding Constitutional precedent.Senator Leahy plans to offer his alternative (S. 714) during the debatetoday, but the outcome at this point is uncertain.

The Center for Democracy and Technology strongly opposes the Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act for the following reasons:* UNCONSTITUTIONAL BAN ON "INDECENT" MATERIAL IN MOST PARTS OF THE   INTERNET: The Act imposes criminal penalties of $100,000 fines or up to two   years in prison on anyone who "knowingly ... makes or makes available any   indecent communications ... to any person under 18 years of age."  This   restriction on indecency (a legal term which includes the "seven dirty words"   as well as any sexually-explicit material) amounts to a total ban on all   "indecent" information in public areas of the Internet, since all users of the   Internet know that public areas are accessible to minors.  The United States   Supreme Court has held over and over again that indecent material is protected   by the First Amendment and may only be regulated with narrowly tailored means   that leave adults free to communicate.  Senator Exon's bill has failed to   identify Constitutionally-appropriate means of regulation.  As Senator Leahy   pointed out during the Senate debate,  the Exon bill would force everyone on   the Internet to behave as if there were in "Sunday school."* SECOND-CLASS FREE SPEECH RIGHTS FOR ALL INTERACTIVE MEDIA:  The    Exon/Coats amendment diminishes the First Amendment rights of those who use   interactive media as opposed to those who communicate through print.  The    indecency ban in Exon/Coats creates the paradoxical result that speech which   would be fully-protected in books, magazines, newspapers, or other print-based  publications, would be subject to criminal sanction if made available   over the  Internet. In other words, what is legal in all of the nation's   bookstores would become illegal in cyberspace.  * CRIMINALIZATION OF "ANNOYING" MESSAGES:  Annoying someone using harsh   (but not obscene) language over interactive media would become a crime, also  punishable by $100,000 fines and two year jail terms.  Federal and many state  laws already criminalize harassment, no matter what the medium, but  prohibiting mere annoyance is clearly unconstitutional and a wasteful abuse of  federal power.* FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION JURISDICTION OVER CONTENT AND   TECHNICAL STANDARDS ON THE INTERNET:  Enforcement of the Exon/Coats bill will   require extensive an ongoing FCC proceedings to determine what exactly   constitutes "indecency" in various interactive media, and how the "safe harbor"   defenses in the bill will function.  Such regulation will mean that the FCC   intrude on the development of all current and future Internet standards for   services such as the World Wide Web, electronic mail, and Usenet newsgroups.  CDT   believes that such an FCC role will lead to unnecessary confusion and delay in   the growth of the Internet, as well as cast a continual chill over all speech on  the Internet and other interactive media.* PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM LIABILITY ARE  INEFFECTIVE:  The "defenses" to prosecution that are intended to   protect online services and Internet access providers from liability will   create significant risk of criminal liability for all services that provide   access to the Internet.  Though Senator Exon may originally promised to exempt   these providers from liability, his last-minute compromise with Senator   Coats, and failure to understand the basic operation of Internet services, left   all Internet access providers at risk of criminal liability for providing   access to Usenet newsgroups and other public information services.* "GOOD FAITH DEFENSE" FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY ENCOURAGE VIOLATIONS OF   USER PRIVACY:  Section (f)(4) of Act insulates online service providers   from any contractual liability that may arise from their efforts to restrict   minors' access to indecent material.  Because of the vaguaries of the   Electronic Communications Privacy Act regarding service provider access to   subscriber email for "system maintenance purposes," this provision may imunize   online service providers who read private messages of their users in    circumstances where the provider is acting within the bounds of the Exon/Coats   bill.* UNDUE BURDEN ON INDIVIDUAL USERS, CONTENT PROVIDERS, AND SMALL SYSTEM  OPERATORS:  Although Senator Exon claims that his bill is only an extension  of the dial-a-porn law, it is actually far broader.  The dial-a-porn law  applied only to commercial providers of 900 number services, not every  telephone customer in the country.  Given the fact that every Internet user is  both publisher and a receiver of information, Exon's new law, if enacted,  would create new regulations on the speech of all those who use interactive  media.In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in statute a sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, one would not be able to access the identical information over the Internet.  Both the interactive media and the print media are arenas in which individuals and organizations exercise core First Amendment free speech rights.  Before Congress elects to diminish the First Amendment protections available in this new medium, we believe that careful, public consideration is required.A.  UNCONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON INDECENT SPEECH ONLINE:  BANNING     THE"SEVEN DIRTY WORDS" ON THE NET.If this new proposal became law, the level of discourse on the Internet as a whole would have to be reduced to that which is considered appropriate for children.  A newly added section (e) effectively makes it illegal to use any of the "seven dirty word" in public forums on the Internet.  This new subsection makes in a crime to "knowingly" make and transmit an indecent message to anyone under 18 years old.  This provision covers both private messages between two individuals and public postings to newsgroups that may well reach hundreds of thousands of people around the world.  Though the drafters may want to limit this crime to situations where material is provided directly to minors, that is simply impossible on the net.  Anyone who participates in public discussion groups knows that there may well be kids reading the group as well.  Thus, they would be violating the law simply by posting a hotly-worded message.Examples of Prohibited items under the new subsection (e)        Rap music lyrics (both the text and the sound files)    Lady Chatterly's Lover      Public declaration that you're "pissed off" or that someone is a    "shit."    Calvin Klein advertisements (the ones with naked bodies)The constitutional flaw in this section lies in the critical distinction between "obscenity," that which is truly hard-core pornography, and "indecency," sexually-explicit material which may be offensive to some or may be considered by some to be inappropriate for children, but which is protected by the First Amendment.  Under the First Amendment, Congress has broad power to ban obscenity, but can only regulate indecency in very narrow circumstances, such as in the broadcast media where there is a captive audience.  Pacifica Foundation v. FCC (1978) .  Even in these narrow circumstances, such regulation may be the "least intrusive means" for accomplishing the government's goal of protecting children.  Sable Communications v. FCC.  Given the existence of software and hardware that enable parents to block children's access to indecent material the regulation here does not constitute the "least restrictive means" requirement set out by the Supreme Court.  CDT believes that the Act as drafted would not survive a First Amendment challenge under the law of Sable because the Senate has altogether failed to investigate less restrictive alternatives to meeting its goal of protecting children.  The Senate has held no hearings and made no legislative findings which support its decision.  During the debate on the Senate floor, both Senator Leahy and Senator Feingold offered evidence that there are less restrictive alternatives available.  Neither Senator Exon, Senator Coats, no any other Senator rebutted or responded to these assertions.  In light of the overwhelming evidence that users and parents can exercise control over what they and their children receive over the Internet, a court reviewing the constitutionality of the bill, would, we believe, be forced to return the matter to Congress for further consideration.Furthermore, the government may not regulation indecent material in a way that would deny adults access to such material.  Butler v. Michigan (1957).  This is precisely the result that is produced by this new statutory proposal.  Such as result would be both unwise and unconstitutional.  The highly restrictive treatment proposed here for interactive media creates a situation in the future whereby material that is legally available to people of all ages in bookshops and libraries will be banned from the Internet.  During the Senate debate, Senator Feingold also pointed out that there are many kinds valuable information on the Internet that might be considered indecent under FCC definitions, such as AIDS education information, various works of art, etc.B. INTRUSION OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ON CONTENT AND    STANDARDS IN INTERACTIVE MEDIAThere are "defenses to prosecution" under this statute which are designed to limit the liability of service providers and, possibly, users and content creators.  (See subsection (f))  To avoid being prosecuted under this statute an entity can take "good faith steps" to restrict access to the possibly infringing communications and then hope that if charged with violating the Act, that the court believes you took sufficient steps.  A more prudent person, or a corporation with money and reputation at risk, would more likely wait to see what the FCC says are sufficient steps to restrict access and follow those regulations.  Until the FCC acts, the defenses applicable to the dial-a-porn law are available, but it is not clear how they would apply to interactive media.If this provision were to become law, an FCC rulemaking will be required to decide two issues:1) what is indecent in interactive media?  This could include the "seven dirty words", frontal nudity, sound files with heavy breathing, or many other examples. However, granting the Federal Communications Commission the authority to answer to this question would bring the Internet under a similar content regime as broadcast television and radio. 2) what steps must be taken to restrict access to indecent material?The FCC will also have to decide what techniques must be used to restrict access sufficiently to enable users and providers to avoid criminal liability. FCC intrusion in the rapidly evolving interactive media market promises to delay the development of new technologies, squelch the entrepreneurial spirit which has helped the Internet to grow, and chill the speech of all users and content creators.  The FCC took 8 years to get blocking rules settled just for 900# services, and that was one relatively simple technology.  Giving the FCC authority to set child-access standards for every piece of the Net, and all new Net services that develop is a disaster for the medium and will have a sweeping chilling effect on both the technology and free expression online.As Senator Leahy noted during debate on the bill, "the Internet has become the tremendous success it is because it did not have Big Brother, the Federal Government, trying to micromanage what it does and trying to tell users what it could do.  If the Government had been in charge of figuring out how to expand the Internet or make it more available and so on, I guarantee it would not be one-tenth the success it is today." (Cong. Rec. 8344)C. A NEW CRIME OF ONLINE ANNOYANCESenator Exon proposes criminal sanctions for anyone who uses "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications "with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person."  Federal and state laws already punish criminal harassment, regardless of the medium used  to perpetrate the crime.  (See 18 USC 875(c)).  CDT believes that additional laws in this area are simply unnecessary.  Moreover, the Department has Justice has said that it has adequate prosecutorial powers in this new environment. (See DoJ letter June 14, 1995).D. LIMITATIONS ON SERVICE PROVIDER LIABILITY ARE WEAK AND THREATEN TO    RADICALLY REDUCE THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF THE INTERNETSome provisions of the Exon/Coats bill attempt to limit the liability of service providers where they act only as passive transmitters of content.  However, these provisions have been significantly weakened as a result of pressure from anti-pornography groups, and are subject to interpretation which creates great risk for both users and service providers.  Anti-pornography groups have been pressing to hold online providers responsible for all of the information accessible to minors on the Internet.  The earlier version of the Exon bill excused from criminal liability anyone who had no editorial control over the content of the message.  However, the bill passed by the Senate removed the "editorial control" defense.  Instead, service providers could limit their liability only if they "ha[ve] no control" over the service, or if they take steps to restrict access for minors.  The degree of nature or degree of control which could leave a provider open to liability is, however, not specified.  CDT believes that these weakened "defenses" leave access providers, and thus Internet users, in a state of great uncertainty as to their responsibility under this bill.  One of the major criticisms of the original legislation introduced by Senator Exon in February 1995 was that it placed criminal liability on online service providers and Internet access providers for any content that traveled across their networks.  In response to these criticisms, Senator Exon altered his bill to assure that service providers would not be held responsible for content on their network unless they exercised editorial control.  However, in the final days before Senate action on the bill, Senator Exon changed the provisions again at the request of Senator Coats.  Now, the presumption of liability has been reversed and a service provider would have to show that it has no control over the service which carried indecent content to a particular minor.*  THE END OF USENET NEWSGROUPS?The major uncertainty of the defenses centers on what it means for a service provider to have control over indecent or obscene content.  The uncertainty of this defense is revealed in an analysis of an Internet access providers relationship and potential criminal liability for providing access to Internet newsgroups such as Usenet.  Most Internet service providers provide access to Usenet, and, generally make choices about which newsgroups they carry.  Some carry all newsgroups, others carry only some groups.  The architecture of the Internet newsgroup system is such that a particular Internet access provide can chose to exclude the "alt.sex" newsgroups, or not.  Does this ability to exercise control mean that the service provider is criminally liable under the statute?  Or, does a carrier have to actually exercise control over the content of individual messages?  These definitional questions are legal fine points, but create substantial uncertainty over the meaning of the Act and are likely to lead to litigation and instability in the Internet environment.  Until these issues are resolved, there will likely be a substantial chilling effect on all speech on such services. The bill and associated legislative history leave some doubt as to the meaning of control, since it is never explicitly defined.  Debate on the Senate floor, which is often used by courts to divine the legislative intent of the drafters where a statute is unclear, gives seemingly contradictory signals on the question of service provider liability for services such as Usenet newsgroups.  One the one hand Senator Exon says in the Congressional Record of the debate that an online provider merely providing access, navigational tools and incidental services "is not aware of the contents of the  communications and should not be responsible" for violation of the obscenity, indecency or harassment crimes in the Act.  (Cong. Rec., S8345).  On the other hand, Senator Coats, the co-sponsor of the bill, says that the Act "does not create a defense for someone who has some level of control over the material of the provision of the material."  (Cong. Rec. S8345).  Senator Exon also says in the course of this "colloquy" with Senator Coats that those "engaging in pornography and indecency should install 'electronic bouncers' at their electronic doors" to keep minors out. (Id.)CDT believes that defenses to prosecution for online service providers are critical in the context of this legislation, but is concerned that the defenses no longer serve the function for which they were originally designed.  As written in the Senate-passed bill, the defenses appear to require Internet service providers to interfere with the content of messages on their networks if they have any ability to do so.  *  CREATION OF NEW GATEKEEPERSForcing online services providers to exercise control as the new Exon/Coats bill seems to require would spell the end of the open, decentralized communications environment which has characterized the Internet until now.  As we have argued elsewhere, users and parents have a great degree of control over what they and their children receive in interactive media.  Federal policy should encourage the development of this user control potential, rather than return to the centralized control regulatory models which characterized the mass media.  As an open, decentralized medium, the Internet promotes the free flow of information and serves as a valuable political and cultural forum. If we rely on user control technology we can protect children without involving federal regulators in the censorship of constitutionally-protected speech.E. UNFAIR TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUAL USERS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND    OTHER NON-COMMERCIAL SERVICES: PRE-EMPTION AGAINST RESTRICTIVE STATE LAWS    ONLY FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICESIf enacted, this proposal would protect commercial service providers from additional censorship by state legislatures, but leave all non-commercial users, including libraries, schools, community groups, and individuals subject to additional regulation and censorship under state law.  The proposal pre-empts state statutes that might censor commercial services beyond the scope of federal law, but leaves all other net users and groups exposed to any censorship that states may choose to enact.  We find no valid public policy argument which would accord greater protection to commercial speech than is granted to non-commercial users of the net.CONCLUSION: Failure to take full advantage of user and parental control features inherent in interactive mediaLegislating about new interactive media requires a careful understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice over the information that they and their children have access to.  In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate information.  Any legislative action in this are must identify ways to promote greater parental and user control.  As drafted, the proposal before us suggests possible FCC rulemaking on this issue, but is no guaranty that the Commission would take this course.  Instead of just passing this critical question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify both legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and more flexible and accessible user control techniques.Interactive media such as the Internet, commercial online services, and interactive television networks, are, by nature, distinctly different from traditional broadcast and television mass media.  Interactive media does not suffer from a scarcity of capacity, nor does it assault an audiance of captive viewers. Most importantly, interactive media offers users tremendous control over the content that they and their children receive.  The Exon/Coats proposal completely fails to account for these unique aspects of interactive media. As House of Representatives begins to consider this and other proposals to regulate content on the Internet, CDT will continue to fight the Exon/Coats proposal, and will work to find alternative prolicy solutions which preserve the First Amendment an the free flow of information in cyberspace.Center for Democracy and Technology             Jerry Berman            Daniel Weitzner +1.202.637.9800------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) TEXT OF THE STATUTE WITH PROPOSED AMENDMENT       TITLE 47.

Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security? 1 I. Overview A. Spirit of ECPA calls for expanded protection for network transactional information In the eight years since the enactment of ECPA, society's patterns of using electronic communication technology have changed dramatically. Over twenty million people now have electronic mail addresses, numerous business, nonprofit and political groups conduct work over the Internet, and "cyberspace" has become a household world. Indeed, it is now commonplace to speak about "life online." Records of all of these activities -- who sends a message to whom, where a given communications device is located, which political party one contacts for information, and which online discussion group or virtual community one associates with -- are available both in real time and in stored form as part of the transactional information generated by advanced computer and communications networks. With increasing use of telecommunications, this transactional information reveals almost as much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally followed us around on the street, watching our every move. As the ECPA drafters recognized, "the law must advance with the technology to ensure the continued vitality of the Fourth Amendment."2 Under current law, much of this transactional information may be available to law enforcement merely by subpoena which recites that the requested information is "relevant to an ongoing investigation."3 In response to dramatic changes in the way that people use electronic communication services, ECPA should be revised to reflect the increasingly sensitive nature of network transactional information B. Proposal to protect network transactional information that is personally identifiable or that reveals the contents of the communication As this memorandum will demonstrate, the scope and depth of personal, sensitive information available through network transactional records has increased dramatically since the 1986 law was passed. Thus, EFF believes that the requirements for law enforcement access to certain categories of transactional records should be increased from a mere subpoena standard to a full "probable cause" warrant requirement. All transactional records which: contain personally identifiable information related to an electronic communications, or reveal the content of the electronic communication should be accessible to law enforcement only with a warrant obtained after showing probably cause. II. Online transactional information contains extensive personally identifiable information and thus deserves greater protection than telephone toll records A. Personally identifiable information in online transactional records The bulk of email addresses in use today are unique to an individual user. Either the address reveals on its face the identity of the user, or a simple command can be issued to translate the address into the owner's name. Email addresses are personally identifiable jberman@eff.org belongs to Jerry Berman whitfield.diffie@eng.sun.com belongs to Whitfield Diffie Therefore, unlike telephone toll records, a transaction indicating that a message is sent to or received from a particular email address is almost always a definitive record of a communication by an identifiable person. [For a detailed description of email transactional records, see Appendix A] Whereas, toll records record only the fact that a given telephone instrument connects an another instrument, a record of an email sent or received will establish the identity of the communicating party with some certainty. Ownership of a telephone instruments may be well-established, but without access to the content of the telephone communication, there is no proof that any individual was actually using the phone coincident with a communication recorded in toll records. In practice, courts also agree that toll records fall short of disclosing identity of the calling parties.4 Some early email systems tied the email address to a particular computer or terminal, just as a telephone number is tied to a given telephone instrument. But today, someone who owns an email address can use it from virtually any computer in the world. Moreover, no one else can easily use another person's email address, since the ability to send and receive mail with an address is generally controlled by password or other security device. While it is, in some cases, possible to use someone else's email address, this practice will increasingly be considered a fraud on the receiver of the message and a theft of service from the owner of the email account. By contrast, no fraud is required to use someone else's telephone number, unless one fails to pay the charges associated with the call. B. Transactional records reveal location of sender and recipient Transactional information in new mobile communications services such as cellular network and Personal Communications Services (PCS) provide law enforcement with information about the location and travel of users. These services are designed in order to deliver calls and other communications to the subscriber, no matter where in the country he or she is. As a side effect of this feature, the network generates trails of transactional information that pinpoint the users location at any time that the user has the device turned on. For example, when a cellular phone is set to "roam" from one territory to another, it signals the network each time it crosses into a new service area, so that calls can be delivered to that phone and so that proper billing connections are established. Furthermore, transactional records from mobile communications services will also reveal the movement of an individual from place to place, in real time. As the target moves from one cell or service area to another, an electronic trace of the fact that a given geographical boundary line is crossed will be created. If law enforcement has access to such traces, it will be possible to determine not only the targets location, but also his or her direction of movement. Such location specific information goes far beyond simple calling and called number information contemplated by Congress when it authorized access to transactional information without a warrant or other judicial scrutiny. Where a probable cause warrant has been issued, we do not contest law enforcement's right have access to such information, where technically feasible. However, we believe that it is contrary to the Fourth Amendment and to the policy framework established in the 1968 Act and ECPA, to allow access to this increasingly rich source of information based on subpoena authority alone. C. Online transactional records deserve a greater degree of protection than telephone toll records In contrast to telephone toll records, online transactional information may reveal the identity of the communicating parties, and even the precise location of the communicators. These attributes distinguish online transactional records from traditional telephone toll records and other records generally available to law enforcement under subpoena power. III. Content of communication revealed by online transactional information In many instances, addressing information from online systems will reveal the content or subject of the electronic communication. As in the example below, messages are often directed to, or received from discussion groups on particular topics. EMAIL MESSAGE from:       djw@eff.org (Danny Weitzner)to:         eff-crypto@eff.org,whitfield.diffie@sun.eng.comsubject     crypto policy updatedate        July 29, 1994, 08:15:48 ESTThis week significant progress was made on the Clipper front, but slide continues on export control liberalization... This message would be sent to everyone who is a participant in this particular group. Discussion groups (such as eff-crypto) are similar to telephone conference calls, except that they may last for days, weeks, or years. [See Appendix A for discussion of online transactional records logs which reveal such information.] Here again, email address records are dramatically more revealing than analogous telephone toll records. Telephone toll records might reveal the fact that the user of a particular telephone was connected to a conference call service, but would not indicate the subject of that conference. In the email example, above, the subject of the conference is embedded into the address line, along with other individual addressed. Furthermore, since the conference name is indistinguishable from an individual email address, there is no way to segregate such information out of the transactional record stream. B. Freedom of association and assembly implicated by disclosure of personally identifiable information Not only does the transactional log of such a discussion group reveal the contents of the discussion, but also, the names of the parties to the discussion are disclosed in the logs. This as an excerpt from an actual email log which records the progress of the above from the sender to all of the members of the online discussion group. 01 7/29  08:15:48	  IIA12559:	from=, msgid=<199407291215.IIA12559@eff.org>02 7/29  08:15:49	  IAA12559:	to="|/usr/local/etc/cryptoarchiver" stat=Sent03 7/29  08:15:50	  IIA12559:	to="|/usr/local/etc/dmail2list eff-crypto eff-crypto-exploder", 04 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	from=owner-eff-crypto, msgid=<199407291215.IIA12559@eff.org>05 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=gnu@toad.com (John Gilmore), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued06 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=mkapor@kei.com (Mitchell Kapor), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued07 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=jberman@eff.org (Jerry Berman), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued 08 7/29  08:15:52	  IIA12565:	to=jseiger@eff.org (Jonah Seiger), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued 09 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=djw@eff.org (Danny Weitzner), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued First, line 1 of the log reveals that a message was sent to the eff-crypto discussion group. Then, lines 5 through 9 reveal the identity of all of the recipients of that message, in other words, all of the participants in this particular group. For those who associate and assemble online, these email logs are equivalent to membership lists deserving of constitutional privacy protection. Inasmuch as online transactional records reveal the identity of the parties who are engaged in the discussion, fundamental constitutional rights such as freedom of association and freedom of assembly are implicated by any disclosure to the government. Since NAACP v, Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 US 449 (1958), courts have agreed that threats to privacy of association constitute impermissible intrusion on First Amendment freedom of association and freedom of assembly. The NAACP case involved a challenge to a government action which would have compelled the NAACP to disclose its membership list to the State of Alabama. The Supreme Court found that: Inviolability of privacy in group association may, in many circumstances, be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association. Id. at 462. Inasmuch as online transactional records reveal such group association, they should be given a high level of protection from government intrusion. The transactional records of online conferences discussed above and in shown in Appendix A, clearly reveal association with particular groups. IV. Quantity, Detail, and Ease of Analysis of transactional records require expanded protection With the passage of ECPA , electronic mail messages were given the same degree of privacy protection as first class mail. Notwithstanding the analogy drawn in 1986, there are significant differences between email addressing logs and information which may be obtained under a mail cover. A. Transactional logs of email contain significantly more information than available from a mail cover Automatic email transaction trail Email systems create detailed transaction logs as a matter of course, whereas the postal service only keeps address logs if specifically required to do so by valid legal process. Thus, in the case of email surveillance, law enforcement may decide after the fact of a particular transmission, to seek access to transactional records. Automatic attachment of return address information When using US Postal Service mail, the addition of a return address which identifies the sender is entirely optional and requires an affirmative step by the sender. In contrast, most email systems automatically append a return address to each electronic mail message, thus guarantying that anyone who examines the email log, will be able to identify both the sender and recipient. Email co-mingles functions traditionally accomplished with voice, fax, paper mail, and even face-to-face communications Email communication is often a substitute for many other forms of communications. An email message can replace a fax, a voice telephone call, a short note sent through the US mail, and even face-to-face communication. Therefore access to logs of such communication is vastly more revealing than a log of any other single form of communication. Courts have recognized an increased privacy interest in co-mingled information as compared to the same information in disaggregated form. B. Increased privacy interest in compilations The volume and detailed nature of email transactions raise much more serious privacy concerns than do either toll records or mail cover logs. The Supreme Court and the US Congress have recognized that computerized compilations of information raise unique privacy concerns. Beginning with the Privacy Act of 1974, Congress has acknowledged that "computerized data banks ... present issues considerably more difficult than, and certainly very different from, a case involving the source records themselves."5 Later, in Whalen v. Roe, the Supreme Court found that "[t]he central storage and easy accessibility of computerized data vastly increase the potential for abuse of that information."6 And finally, in US Department of Justice v. Reporter's Committee, the Court found that a "strong privacy interest inheres in the nondisclosure of compiled computerized information...."7 It is precisely the great volume of and easy access to transactional information which raises an increased privacy interest in these records. V. Extend the spirit of ECPA to cyberspace: Need to update ECPA protections for transactional information in the changing digital world The guiding principle of ECPA was that new privacy protection should be extended to electronic communications, so that user of new communications technology would have confidence that their communications were free from unwarranted private or government intrusion. With the qualitative shift in communications activity that has occurred over the last decade, it is time to extend greater protection to the transactional information that records people activities online. A. Gaps left by 1986 law -- Unclear definition of transactional records The main focus of ECPA was to offer clear privacy protection for the contents of electronic communication despite the fact that the communication is handed over to a third party, namely the electronic communication serviceprovider.8 However, little consideration was given at the time to the proper treatment of transactional records. The records are mentioned in the statute, but not given any definition. The committee report from the Senate does offer brief discussion of the nature of these records, but focuses primarily on customer lists and telephone toll records.9 The House report recognizes that electronic communications services create records that do not conform to legal categories for older technologies: The newer technologies such as electronic mail and remote computing services maintain a type of records which do not neatly fit within the legal categories which exist for older technologies.10 However, no where in either committee report is the issue of access to email transactional records discussed for the purposes of establishing the appropriate standard for government access. B. Extension of protection is consistent with the spirit of ECPA and the expressed intend of the drafters In the spirit of ECPA, we should recognize that it is again time to extend privacy protection to the personally identifiable transactional information that is, in may cases, indistinguishable from content.11 The drafters did not intend that electronic communication service providers should not disclose "profiles" of users that were related to the contents of the communication.12 Furthermore, discussions of transactional records was limited at the time to telephone toll records and other customer account billing and demographic information.13 VI. Conclusion This memo has shown that: transactional records now reveal the content of communication, these records contain personally identifiable information, disclosure of such records implicate fundamental privacy and free association rights, current law is unclear as to the definition of such records, and, increased protection for transactional records is consistent with the spirit of the 1968 Act and the 1986 Act. Attached is proposed statutory language which would amend the stored communications section of ECPA to provide a higher level of protection for sensitive transactional records. The amendments would leave intact law enforcement's current authority regarding telephone toll records and basic billing information such as subscriber billing address and service arrangements. These changes to current law are necessary to provide assurances to users of new communication technology that their private activities in the online world are free from unwarranted interference.

Weitzner, Deputy Director djw@cdt.org Appendix A Telephone Toll Records and Electronic Mail Logs The most significant difference between a telephone toll record and an electronic mail log is that electronic mail addresses are unique to individual users. Unlike a telephone number, which corresponds only to a specific location (such as a home or business address), most electronic mail addresses are linked by a secret and unique password14 to an individual regardless of physical location. Thus, while a record indicating that a certain telephone number was dialed from another telephone number indicates that a transaction occured, an electronic mail record indicates that a specific and unique individual has communicated with another individual or group of individuals.

These records do not indicate that Jonah Seiger himself actually placed the calls, the identity of the recipients, or the nature of the communication (i.e, voice, modem, fax, etc). Electronic Mail Logs The table below represents actual electronic mail logs from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's electronic mail server. These logs indicate a message sent by an individual user (in this case, djw@eff.org) to members of an online discussion titled (eff-crypto) (EFF's online forum on issues relating tocryptography and digital privacy in general). Although this example contains addresses unique to EFF, virtually all electronic mail software logs transactions in an identical way. In the course of accounting and processing electronic mail messages, the mail server assigns each message a unique message ID number. By tracking a message ID number, one can easily know who sent a message, and to whom that message was sent. (For ease of reading, line numbers have been added). 01 7/29  08:15:48	  IIA12559:	from=, msgid=<199407291215.IIA12559@eff.org>02 7/29  08:15:49	  IAA12559:	to="|/usr/local/etc/cryptoarchiver" stat=Sent03 7/29  08:15:50	  IIA12559:	to="|/usr/local/etc/dmail2list eff-crypto eff-crypto-exploder", 04 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	from=owner-eff-crypto, msgid=<199407291215.IIA12559@eff.org>05 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=gnu@toad.com (John Gilmore), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued06 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=mkapor@kei.com (Mitchell Kapor), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued07 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=jberman@eff.org (Jerry Berman), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued 08 7/29  08:15:52	  IIA12565:	to=jseiger@eff.org (Jonah Seiger), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued 09 7/29  08:15:51	  IIA12565:	to=djw@eff.org (Danny Weitzner), delay=00:00:01, stat=queued The table above follows a message sent by to the recipients of the (eff-crypto) mailing list. Line 01 indicates that message IIA12559 was sent by (djw@eff.org). Line 03 indicates that that message was sent to the address (eff-crypto). In line 04, indicates that message IIA12559 was sent from (eff-crypto) as message IIA12565. Lines 05 through 09 indicate that message IIA12565 was sent to specific individual recipients of the (eff-crypto) list. Comparison of Telephone Toll Records and Electronic Mail Logs From these two examples, it is clear that electronic mail logs reveal a great deal more about both the destination and substance of a communication than does a telephone toll record. While the telephone toll record does show that a specific number was dialed at a certain time, it reveals nothing else about the nature of the communication, or the identity of the sender or the recipient. There is nothing inherent in a toll record to indicate that a specific individual communicated with another. In the example above, we only know that 202 483-4529 dialed 313 555-4545 on a certain date and time. In contrast, because each electronic mail address is linked directly to an individual with a password unique to that address, a record of a communication in this medium indicates the occurrence of a communication between two specific individuals. Moreover, in the example above, the log reveals that an individual communicated with a group of individuals who belong to a subject specific group (in this case eff-crypto). Through a simple analysis of message identification numbers, one can very easily track the communications of one person, and know with certainty with whom that person is communicating. Appendix B File Transfer and Retrieval Logs Tracing a File Directly to an Individual Virtually all online information services, such as America On Line (AOL), Prodigy, Compuserve, and the Internet, contain a wealth of files and information in areas known as "file archives". There are many thousands of archives throughout cyberspace, containing files ranging from political information (e.g.: White House press releases, legislation, policy statements, etc.), shareware (free, public domain software), to images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Users can access file archives through a variety of ways depending on the service they subscribe to. For purposes of maintenance, accounting and security, most online services keep records of all transactions involving file transfer and retrieval. Through a simple analysis of these records, one can easily trace a file directly to an individual user. The example to follow will illustrate how such a trace can be accomplished using transactional records from the Internet File Transfer Protocol (ftp), the primary method for transferring and retrieving files over the Internet. FTP provides any Internet user with the ability to retrieve files from any computer on the network. Files available via ftp are stored in 'ftp archives' which can be accessed by a user through the execution of a few relatively simple commands. [EDITORS NOTE: This document was originally written in July 1994, before the explosion of the World Wide Web. File transfers over the World Wide web are essentially the same as FTP transfers, raising the same issues identified here]. Every user on online networks is identified by an electronic identity, usually identical to their electronic mail (email) addresses. Individuals control access to their email addresses through a secret personal password. Because email addresses are tied to individual users, and because ftp logs indicate that a specific file has been retrieved, a simple analysis of ftp logs can easily reveal that an individual has retrieved a specific file. FTP Transaction logs This example will trace an individual user's retrieval of a file from the online archives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The file, named 'digitel.faq', contains answers to frequently asked questions about the Digital Telephony legislation. The records below are actual records from EFF's ftp archive (named ftp.eff.org) and main computer (eff.org) All computers connected to the Internet have names. In this example, it is important to note that ftp.eff.org and eff.org are two distinct computers. The computer ftp.eff.org keeps separate records from the computer eff.org. Furthermore, each authorized user has a unique electronic identity, usually same as that individual's electronic mail address (e.g.: brown@eff.org is the user Dan Brown [EFF's system administrator]). A simple correlation of the timestamps on the transactions between the two computers will reveal that Dan Brown retrieved the file 'digitel.faq'. I. Dan Brown Logs Onto eff.org #  User  Terminal	  Remote machine	Timestamps05 brown   ttyp0	  elec.eff.org	Fri Jul 29 12:59:04 - 13:03:14 Because the user 'brown' is linked to Dan Brown through a unique personal password, this record indicates that Dan Brown was logged onto eff.org on Friday July 29 between 12:59 and 13:03. II. Dan Brown Executes a File Transfer (ftp) By examining the logs which record the programs run by users on eff.org, and noting the times at which those programs were run, we can determine when Dan Brown executed a file retrieval program (ftp). This record is displayed below (printed on July 29 at 13:15): #  program   user name	  terminal	  start time   	end time08 ftp	   brown	  ttyp0	  13:00:21	      13:01:20 Note that the start and end times correspond to the period of time Dan was logged onto eff.org. This record clearly shows that Dan Brown ran the file retrieval program (ftp) between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20. III. Logs from the File Archive Show a File Transfer We now turn our analysis to the records of the computer containing EFF's online file archives (the computer named ftp.eff.org). Again, a simple check of timestamps reveals that a user from eff.org made a connection using the file transfer program (ftp). These records are displayed below: #  Timestamp	  Hostname	   Process ID	Message		04 Jul 29 13:00:21  ftp.eff.org  in.ftpd[5458]: connect from brown@eff.org	12 Jul 29 13:01:20  ftp.eff.org  ftpd[5458]:    FTP session closed Note the direct correlation between the times indicated above and the times indicated on the previous two logs. This log shows that the file transfer program run by Dan Brown was executed on the computer ftp.eff.org, indicating that Dan Brown retrieved a file from EFF's online file archive. IV. Logs from the File Archive Name the File Transferred to Dan Brown One final check of the logs from EFF's online archive show which file Dan transferred to his own computer. We already know that Dan was logged onto the network between 12:59:03 and 13:03:14. We also know that he ran the file transfer program between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20. This has been confirmed by logs from two separate computers. By examining one additional log on the computer containing EFF's online file archive (ftp.eff.org), we can see which particular file Dan retrieved. This log is displayed below: Fri Jul 29 13:01:18 1994 1  				eff.org	67773  /pub/EFF/Policy/Digital_Telephony/digitel.faq This log shows that the file 'digitel.faq' was retrieved at 13:01:18 by a user logged onto the computer eff.org. Note that the exact time of the file retrieval corresponds to the time that Dan Brown was running the file retrieval program (as indicated on the logs described previously). We have seen that Dan Brown was running the file retrieval program between 13:00:21 and 13:01:20. This is confirmed on the logs from both the computer Dan was logged onto (eff.org) as well as the computer containing the online file archive (ftp.eff.org). Because the logs also show that the only user running the file transfer program at that time was Dan Brown, we have now confirmed that Dan Brown retrieved the file 'digitel.faq'. FTP Logs Reveal the Actions of an Individual User and the Contents of those Transactions Detailed transactional information from online information services enables anyone with access to these records to reconstruct a detailed picture of a user's actions. In this case, the logs show which document the user accessed. Because all users on the Internet and other online services are linked to their electronic identities by a unique password, transactional records which reveal the electronic identity of a user correspond directly with that individual. The electronic identity (brown@eff.org) is always Dan Brown. In the case of this example, transactional records reveal that Dan retrieved the file 'digitel.faq' from the online archives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Transactions similar to the one illustrated here occur millions of times each day on computer networks throughout the United States. Furthermore, because computer logs record each and every transaction, it is not difficult to track the actions of any individual using an online service simply by examining such logs. This type of detailed transactional information is not unique to Internet ftp sessions. It is captured in similar forms on computers throughout the online service world. Every time a user logs on to an online service, sends electronic mail, retrieves a file, or joins a discussion group, detailed information is collected in the normal course of completing these transactions. And, since virtually all users of online services are personally linked to their electronic identities by a unique password, all of these transactional records point directly to the actions of individual people.

As will be discussed below, the statutory distinction between contents and records is unclear, so that current scope of law enforcement access is not a matter of settled law. 4 In United States v. Anderson (542 F.2d 428, 1976), the 7th Circuit found that "toll records could not be relied on to show the contents of calls nor the parties thereto; ... identification of places called ... did not reveal the identity of the recipient or the nature of the call..." 5 H.R. Rep. No. 1416, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 3, 6-9 (1974) Legislative history of the Privacy Act of 1974. 6 429 U.S. 589, 607 (1977) (Brennan, J., concurring) 7 489 U.S. 749, 766 (1989) 8 "A letter sent by first class mail is afforded a high level of protection against unauthorized opening by a combination of constitutional provisions, case law.... But there are no comparable Federal statutory standards to protect the privacy and security of communications transmitted by new noncommon carrier communications services or new forms of computer technology. This is so even though American citizens and businesses are using these forms of technology in lieu of, or side-by-side with, first class mail and common carrier telephone services." ECPA Senate report, p5. 9 "Subsection (c) provides for access to records or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of an electronic communications or remote computing service, not including the contents of electronic communications. This section permits the provider of the service to divulge, in the normal course of business, such information as customer lists and payments to anyone except a Government agency. It should be noted that the information involved is information about the customer's use of the service not the contents of the customer's communication." ECPA Senate Report, p. 38 10 House Report, p. 26 11 Curiously, the original language in Title III, before it was amended by ECPA, provided that the "contents" of a communication included the "identity of the parties to such communication or the existence, substance, purport, or meaning of the communication." Thus, in 1968, telephone toll records were accessible under a lower standard precisely because they did not reveal the identity of communicating parties or the existence of the communication. Any transactional information which reveals the identity of the parties, or the content of the communication, should therefore be accessible to law enforcement only through a probably cause warrant. 12 ECPA House Report, p.64 13 "The type of records involved are billing records and telephone toll records (including record of long distance numbers and message unit information." ECPA House Report, p. 69. 14 All commercial on line services (AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy, etc), as well as most Internet providers require users to enter a password each time they log onto the service. Passwords are unique to each individual (similar to a PIN number used for cash machines at Banks), and in most cases the practice of using another persons password without permission is considered a breach of contract or user agreement. 15 The dialed numbers have been changed . The information described above has been certified by Bell Atlantic to be identical to information obtainable by law enforcement officers with proper subpoena authorization. Records indicate long distance toll calls. According to Bell Atlantic, only long distance dialed number records are collected. Law enforcement must use pen register or trap and trace devices to capture local dialed number records.

Digital Telephony).  As required by law, the FBI will accept public comments on the proposed capacity requirements for 30 days (ending November 15, 1995).  The notice, which includes instructions for submitting comments, is attached below.CDT is in the process of examining the proposed notice, and will issue formal comments in the next several weeks.  We are evaluating the notice with the following criteria in mind:* Has the FBI met all the public accountability and oversight criteria  required by the statute?* What is the impact of the proposed notice on the privacy of individual   telephone subscribers and the security of telecommunications networks?* Does the requested capacity accurately reflect the needs of law   enforcement? * The capacity requests are based on an FBI survey of recent surveillance    activity. Is the factual justification for the FBI request sufficiently   detailed to facilitate a substantial public discussion about the   reasonableness of the needs?* Does the FBI expect telecommunications carriers to comply with the   capacity requests if Congress fails to appropriate funds for   reimbursement?CDT plans to meet with the FBI to discuss the proposed notice. CDT will also work both on our own and through the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG, a coalition of over 50 public interest groups, telecommunications carriers, manufacturers, trade associations, coordinated by CDT), and with members of Congress to ensure that the reporting requirements and public accountability provisions of the law are enforced and that law enforcement provides the necessary accounting of its capability requests.CDT stands ready to intervene as necessary before Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards bodies charged with setting technical standards for implementing the requirements, and at other points necessary to ensure that privacy is protected and the public accountability provisions are strictly enforced.  We will continue to update you on developments on this issue as they occur. ________________________________________________________________________BACKGROUND -- PUBLIC OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS IN THE DIGITAL TELEPHONY LAWThe Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that their systems contain sufficient capability and capacity to permit law enforcement to conduct authorized electronic surveillance. However, the requirements of the statute do not apply to the Internet, commercial online services (such as America Online, Prodigy, or Compuserve), or BBS's.The statute also contains specific new statutory privacy protections for transactional records generated by online electronic communications services, greater protection for cordless telephones, and prohibitions on pen register authority to gather location information ('pen registers' are devices used to gather dialed numbers).  Furthermore, the statute contains provisions which require public accountability and oversight over law enforcement surveillance capacity requests, telecommunications carrier liability, standards setting, and cost reimbursement.Although law enforcement officials must still obtain a search warrant in order to conduct a wiretap, the statute granted law enforcement new authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  This authority must be closely monitored through the law's public accountability and oversight provisions to ensure that law enforcement does not over-reach or abuse the powers granted under the statute.The statute separates compliance into two categories: * CAPACITY (The subject of the current notice): The ability of a   telecommunications network to accommodate a specified number of   intercepts, pen register, and trap and trace devices; and* CAPABILITY: Functional requirements to ensure that a telecommunications   network can enable law enforcement to conduct electronic surveillance.Below is a basic overview of the compliance processes for both the capacity and capability requirements of the Digital Telephony law, along with a description of the proposed notice.  A more detailed explanation of the compliance process, as well as the privacy and public accountability provisions can be found on CDT's Digital Telephony Web Page (URL:http://www.cdt.org/digtel.html)_______________________________________________________________________SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTSSection 104 of CALEA requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that their systems posses sufficient capacity to accommodate a specified number of simultaneous intercepts, pen register, and trap and trace devices.  As required by Section 104 (a)(1), the FBI, after consultation with state and local law enforcement officials and the telecommunications industry, has published an initial notice or capacity requirements.  Section 104 (a)(1) requires that the FBI seek public comment and then publish in the federal register and provide to telecommunications carriers:1. NOTICE OF ACTUAL CAPACITY: The actual number of simultaneousintercepts,    pen registers, and trap and trace devices that will be necessary 4 years    from the date of enactment (October 25, 1998) (Sec 104 (a)(1)(A); and2. NOTICE OF MAXIMUM CAPACITY: The maximum capacity required to accommodate    all intercepts, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the    Attorney General estimates government agencies will be authorized to    conduct simultaneously after the date 4 years after enactment (Sec 104       (a)(1)(B)).Carriers then have 180 days to identify which aspects of their networks are not compliant with the published capacity requirements.  Section 104 (e) requires the government to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all reasonable costs associated with capacity upgrades.  If the government fails to reimburse a carrier, that carrier will not have to modify any feature or service.  This provision is intended to ensure that the government prioritizes capacity requests and does not demand unnecessary surveillance capability financed by hidden charges to subscribers._______________________________________________________________________PROPOSED CAPACITY REQUIREMENTSThroughout the past year, the FBI, through its Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit (TILU) developed a "baseline of electronic surveillance activity" by compiling  information from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement, U.S. District Courts, State Attorney's General, and State District Attorneys. From this information, the FBI derived the total simultaneous electronic surveillance activity by switch and geographic area.  Future capacity needs were determined by considering the impact of demographics, market trends, and "other factors" [page 53645, see below] (Section 104 (a)(2) gives the FBI broad latitude in determining the basis of capacity needs).  As described above, the capacity requests include both "actual capacity" (which must be in place within 4 years), and "maximum capacity" (which must be in place after 1998). The FBI has proposed to create three categories of capacity requirements based on the projected number of simultaneous surveillance orders in geographic areas.  Requirements are based on what the FBI refers to as the "engineered capacity" of each switch, feature, or service in a specific geographic region [page 53646, see below]. Although we contacted several telecommunications carriers, CDT has not yet been able to determine precisely what "engineered capacity" corresponds to.  According to the FBI notice, engineered capacity refers to the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by a particular equipment, facility, or service.  For the purposes of the descriptions below, we assume that the average number of subscribers is equal to 100,000 for each facility, equipment, or service deployed on a telecommunications carrier's network.  Of course, it could be far more or less depending on the actual definition of the term and the number of subscribers per equipment, facility, or service.         CATEGORY III -- Baseline Surveillance CapacityAccording to the notice, all telecommunications carriers would be required to meet the Category III requirements.  The FBI estimates that roughly 75% of the U.S. would be covered by this category [page 53646, see below]. ACTUAL CAPACITY: .05% of engineered capacity, or 50 simultaneous surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 100,000 subscribers.MAXIMUM CAPACITY: .25% of engineered capacity, or 250 simultaneous surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 100,000 subscribers, by 1998.CATEGORY II --  Areas With Moderate Surveillance ActivityCarriers in geographic areas which the FBI estimates require higher than average surveillance capacity, including large suburban areas and some urban areas will be required to meet Category II and Category I requirements.  The FBI estimates that roughly 25% of the U.S. will be covered by Category II and Category I [page 53646, see below]. ACTUAL CAPACITY: .25% of engineered capacity, or 250 simultaneous surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 100,000 subscribers.MAXIMUM CAPACITY: .5% of engineered capacity, or 500 simultaneous surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 100,000 subscribers, by 1998.CATEGORY I -- Areas With Heavy Surveillance ActivityLarge urban areas and other areas the FBI estimates require the greatest surveillance capacity would fall under Category I [page 53646, see below]. ACTUAL CAPACITY: .5% of engineered capacity, or 500 simultaneous surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 100,000 subscribers.MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 1% of engineered capacity, or 1000 simultaneous surveillance orders for each equipment, facility, or service serving 100,000 subscribers, by 1998._______________________________________________________________________SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTSIn addition to specific capability requirements, the Digital Telephony statute requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that they possess sufficient capability to enable law enforcement, pursuant to proper legal authorization, to (Section 103):1. expeditiously isolate and intercept all wire and electronic    communications within a carrier's network; 2. expeditiously isolate and enable the government to access call   identifying information;3. deliver intercepted communications and call-identifying information to a   location specified by the government (but only with the affirmative    intervention of the telecommunications carrier).  Remote monitoring is    explicitly prohibited; 4. to meet these requirements in a way that protects the privacy and    security of communications and call-identifying information not    authorized to be intercepted._______________________________________________________________________PROCESS FOR DETERMINING AND MEETING CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTSThe process for determining and meeting capability requirements (outlined in Sections 103 and 107 of the statute) is separate and distinct from the process for determining capacity requirements.The CALEA requires law enforcement determine the specific capabilities it needs, and consult with appropriate telecommunications trade associations, standards setting bodies, representatives of users of telecommunications equipment, and State utility commissioners in order to determine what specific changes are required to meet the capability requirements (Sec 107 (a)).  The telecommunications industry, through standards-setting bodies, is charged with developing technical standards to meet the capability requirements (the statute explicitly prohibits the government from imposing any technical standards on the telecommunications industry). Finally, the standards can be challenged before the FCC if any person believes they do not adequately protect privacy or fail to meet other requirements (Sec. 107 (e)).  Carriers are responsible for meeting the capability requirements by October 1998.The FBI is currently in the process of determining its specific capability needs _______________________________________________________________________NEXT STEPSWhen Congress passed the Digital Telephony bill last year, it simultaneously authorized, but did not appropriate, $500 million to reimburse telecommunications carriers capacity upgrades and capability upgrades where compliance is not 'reasonably achievable (Sec 109 (b)).  If Congress fails to appropriate funds to cover reimbursement, telecommunications carriers will not be obligated to comply with the requirements of the statute.The Administration has requested to fund the program through a 30-percent surcharge on civil monetary penalties and criminal fines at a level of $100 million dollars for fiscal year 1996.  The request is currently part of the stalled anti-terrorism legislation.  However, the FBI expects that funds will be appropriated as part of the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, which is currently pending before the Congress.CDT believes that no funds should be appropriated or spent to fund the implementation of the Digital Telephony law unless and until law enforcement demonstrates it has met the public accountability and oversight provisions. CDT is committed to working with the telecommunications industry, Congress, and the FBI to ensure that this requirement is met.For More Information Contact:    Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director:  djw@cdt.org    Jonah Seiger, Policy Analyst:  jseiger@cdt.org-----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) THE PROPOSED NOTICE OF CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL    REGISTER, OCTOBER 16 1995.Note: Follow this link to view the text of the FBI's notice---------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CDT POLICY POST LISTTo subscibe to the policy post distribution list, send mail to "Majordomo@cdt.org" with:    subscribe policy-posts in the body of the message (leave the subject line blank)-----------------------------------------------------------------------(4) ABOUT THE CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGY/CONTACTING USThe Center for Democracy and Technology is a non-profit public interestorganization based in Washington, DC.

While the letter praised the administration for its efforts to develop a national cryptography policy, the signatories, which include groups such as EFF and companies such as America Online, Apple, AT&T, MCI, Lotus, Microsoft, and Tandem Computer (organized by CDT), expressed concern that the Administration's proposal is weighed heavily in favor of law enforcement and national security while neglecting the privacy and security needs of individuals and the marketplace. The letter states: "A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure   (GII) is essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of   the Information Age society.  Competitive businesses need cryptography   to protect proprietary information as it flows across increasingly   vulnerable global networks. Individuals require privacy protection in   order to build the confidence necessary to use the GII for personal and   financial transactions... The undersigned groups recognize that   the Administration's recently articulated cryptography initiative was a   serious attempt to meet some of these challenges, but the proposed   initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography   policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute for   a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering   the development of a secure and trusted GII."The coalition pledged to work together to formulate recommendations for an alternative cryptography policy based on the following principals:* ROBUST SECURITY:  access to levels of encryption sufficient to address   domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in   computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less   secure.* INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  the ability to securely interact   worldwide.* VOLUNTARY USE: freedom for users to choose encryption solutions,   developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs.* ACCEPTANCE BY THE MARKETPLACE: commercial viability and ability to   meet the expressed needs of cryptography users.* CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS: safeguards to ensure basic Fourth   Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and   interceptions.* RESPECT FOR THE LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT and national   security, while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will   have access to virtually unbreakable encryption.A second group, composed of conservative/libertarian organizations including Americans for Tax Reform and Citizens for A Sound Economy, issued a similar letter on Wednesday to House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The text of that letter, as well as additional information on the cryptography policy debate, can be found on CDT's Cryptography Issues Page:        URL:http://www.cdt.org/crypto.htmlThe letters come as the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) this week announced revisions to the Administration's proposed export criteria announced last September (See CDT Policy Post No. 24). The revised proposal is substantively similar to the previous version, and maintains controversial provisions including: * LIMITS ON KEY LENGTH: The revised proposal would continue to only   allow the export of cryptography systems with 64 bit key lengths, but   only if the keys are escrowed by an agent approved by the U.S.   Government and if the systems meet the other export criteria. * RESTRICTED INTEROPERABILITY: While the revised proposal does clarify   the interoperability provision,  it would continue to prohibit   exportable products from operating with any other cryptographic   products that do not meet the NIST criteria.* NO PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS: The proposal contains no mention of the     procedures for law enforcement access to escrowed keys, the standards   for certifying escrow agents, or the obligations on escrow agents to   protect privacy.CDT believes that the NIST proposals fall far short of the promise for a more sensible and comprehensive cryptography policy outlined last July in Vice President Gore's letter to Rep. Maria Cantwell.  The current proposal fails to provide adequate security, protect the privacy of individuals, and meet the needs of the global marketplace. CDT believes that a more comprehensive approach to cryptography policy is necessary to address both the immediate need for strong cryptographic applications and the long-term development of a secure and trusted Global Information Infrastructure. CDT will work with the signatories of the letter to over the next six months to develop an alternative to the Administration's proposal.-----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) Text of CDT-led Coalition Letter to Vice President GoreNovember 8, 1995The Honorable Albert Gore, Jr.Office of the Vice PresidentOld Executive Office Building, Room 276Washington, D.C. 20501Dear Mr. Vice President:A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of the Information Age society.  Competitive businesses need cryptography to protect proprietary information as it flows across increasingly vulnerable global networks. Individuals require privacy protection in order to build the confidence necessary to use the GII for personal and financial transactions.  Promoting the development of the GII and meeting the needs of the Information Age will require strong, flexible, widely-available cryptography.  The undersigned groups recognize that the Administration's recently articulated cryptography initiative was a serious attempt to meet some of these challenges, but the proposed initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute for a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering the development of a secure and trusted GII.A number of the undersigned organizations have already written to express concern about the latest Administration cryptography initiative. As some of us have noted, the Administration's proposed export criteria will not allow users to choose the encryption systems that best suit their security requirements.  Government ceilings on key lengths will not provide an adequate level of security for many applications, particularly as advances in computing render current cryptography systems less secure.   Competitive international users are steadily adopting stronger foreign encryption in their products and will be unlikely to embrace U.S. restrictions.  As they stand, current export restrictions place U.S. hardware manufacturers, software developers, and computer users at a competitive disadvantage, seriously hinder international interoperability, and threaten the strategically important U.S. communications and computer hardware and software industries. Moreover, the Administration policy does not spell out any of the privacy safeguards essential to protect individual liberties and to build the necessary public trust in the GII. The current policy directive also does not address the need for immediate liberalization of current export restrictions. Such liberalization is vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-art software products during the potentially lengthy process of developing and adopting a comprehensive national cryptography policy. Without relief, industry and individuals alike are faced with an unworkable limit on the level of security available and remain hamstrung by restrictions that will not be viable in the domestic and international marketplace. Many members of the undersigned groups have been working actively with the Administration on a variety of particular applications, products, and programs promoting information security.  All of us are united, however, by the concern that the current network and information services environment is not as secure as it should be, and that the current policy direction will delay the secure, private, and trusted environment that is sought.Despite the difficulties of balancing the competing interests involved, the undersigned companies, trade associations, and privacy organizations are commencing a process of collective fact-finding and policy deliberation, aimed at building consensus around a more comprehensive cryptography policy framework that meets the following criteria:  * ROBUST SECURITY:  access to levels of encryption sufficient to address  domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in   computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less   secure.* INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  the ability to securely interact   worldwide.* VOLUNTARY USE: freedom for users to choose encryption solutions,   developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs.* ACCEPTANCE BY THE MARKETPLACE: commercial viability and ability to   meet the expressed needs of cryptography users.* CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS: safeguards to ensure basic Fourth   Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and   interceptions.* RESPECT FOR THE LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT and national   security, while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will    have access to virtually unbreakable encryption.In six months, we plan to present our initial report to the Administration, the Congress, and the public in the hopes that it will form the basis for a more comprehensive, long-term approach to cryptography on the GII. We look forward to working with the Administration on this matter.Sincerely,American Electronics AssociationAmerica Online, Inc.Apple Computer, Inc.AT&TBusiness Software Alliance Center for Democracy & Technology Center for National Security StudiesCommercial Internet eXchange Association CompuServe, Inc.Computer & Communications Industry AssociationComputing Technology Industry AssociationCrest Industries, Inc.Dun & BradstreetEastman Kodak CompanyElectronic Frontier FoundationElectronic Messaging Association EliaShim Microcomputers, Inc.Formation, Inc.Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers - United States ActivitiesInformation Industry Association Information Technology Industry Council Information Technology Association of AmericaLotus Development CorporationMCIMicrosoft CorporationNovell, Inc.OKIDATA CorporationOracle CorporationSecurities Industry AssociationSoftware Industry CouncilSoftware Publishers AssociationSoftware Security, Inc.Summa Four, Inc.Sybase, Inc.Tandem Computers, Inc.Telecommunications Industry AssociationViON Corporation---------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CDT POLICY POST LISTCDT Policy Posts, which is what you have just finished reading, are the regular news publication of the Center For Democracy and Technology.

Critics include the AmericanFamily Association, American Online, People for the American Way, and theUnited States Justice Department, as well as a variety of civil libertiesand press groups.  In an effort to seek a compromise among these disparategroups, some parties have drafted a legislative proposal as an alternativeto the current Exon language in the Senate Telecommunications Reform bill.As far as we know, this draft has not yet been accepted by any parties.We believe that the draft contains several significant improvementsover the original language, but it still contains unconstitutionalprohibitions against First Amendment-protected speech and fails to fullyaccount for the unique characteristics of interactive media.*       The Free Speech Rubicon for Interactive MediaThe key flaw remaining in this proposal is its well-intentioned butoverbroad effort to regulate indecent material (the "seven dirty words") ininteractive media.  Regulation of indecency has been found constitutionalonly in limited cases involving radio and television broadcasting andaudiotext services.  We believe that given the unique user controlattributes of interactive media, as well as the great abundance ofcapacity, it is unconstitutional to regulate indecency in this new medium.The result of this overbroad regulation is the paradoxical result thatinformation which is freely available in bookstores, libraries and recordshops will be barred on the Internet.  Such restrictions will stifle thefree flow of information in interactive media and deal a grave blow to thedevelopment of markets for multimedia products and services.Based on our initial analysis, we have the following comments onthe new language:A. Unconstitutional restrictions on indecent speech online:  Banning   the "seven dirty words" on the Net.If this new proposal became law, the level of discourse on theInternet as a whole would have to be reduced to that which is consideredappropriate for children.  A newly added section (e) effectively makes itillegal to use any of the "seven dirty word" in public forums on theInternet.  This new subsection makes in a crime to "knowingly" make andtransmit an indecent message to anyone under 18 years old.  This provisioncovers both private messages between two individuals and public postings tonewsgroups that may well reach hundreds of thousands of people around theworld.  Though the drafters may want to limit this crime to situationswhere material is provided directly to minors, that is simply impossible onthe net.  Anyone who participates in public discussion groups knows thatthere may well be kids reading the group as well.  Thus, they would beviolating the law simply by posting a hotly-worded message.Prohibited items under the new subsection (e) include:        * Rap music lyrics (both the text and the sound files)        * Lady Chatterly's Lover        * Public eclaration that you're "pissed off" or that someone          is a "shit."        * Calvin Klein ads (the ones with naked bodies)The constitutional flaw in this section lies in the criticaldistinction between "obscenity," that which is truly hard-core pornography,and "indecency," sexually-explicit material which may be offensive to someor may be considered by some to be inappropriate for children, but which isprotected by the First Amendment.  Under the First Amendment, Congress hasbroad power to regulate obscenity, but can only regulate indecency in verynarrow circumstances, such as in the broadcast media where there is acaptive audience.  Even in these narrow circumstances, such regulation maybe the "least intrusive means" for accomplishing the government's goal ofprotecting children.  Given the existence of software and hardware thatenable parents to block children's access to indecent material theregulation here does not constitute the "least restrictive means"requirement set out by the Supreme Court.Furthermore, the government may not regulation indecent material ina way that would deny adults access to such material.  This is preciselythe result that is produced by this new statutory proposal.  Such as resultwould be both unwise and unconstitutional.  The highly restrictivetreatment proposed here for interactive media creates a situation in thefuture whereby material that is legally available to people of all ages inbookshops and libraries will be banned from the Internet.B. Unfair treatment of individual users, educational institutions and   other non-commercial services: Pre-emption against restrictive state laws   only for commercial servicesIf enacted, this proposal would protect commercial serviceproviders from additional censorship by state legislatures, but leave allnon-commercial users, including libraries, schools, community groups, andindividuals subject to additional regulation and censorship under statelaw.  The proposal pre-empts state statutes that might censor commercialservices beyond the scope of federal law, but leaves all other net usersand groups exposed to any censorship that states may choose to enact.  Wefind no valid public policy argument which would accord greater protectionto commercial speech than is granted to non-commercial users of the net.C. Failure to take full advantage of user and parental control   features inherent in interactive mediaLegislating about new interactive media requires a carefulunderstanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First andforemost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercisechoice over the information that they and their children have access to.In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simplynot necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriateinformation.  Any legislative action in this are must identify ways topromote greater parental and user control.  As drafted, the proposal beforeus suggests possible FCC rulemaking on this issue, but is no guaranty thatthe Commission would take this course.  Instead of just passing thiscritical question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify bothlegal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and moreflexible and accessible user control techniques.ConclusionIn light of the serious constitutional concerns raised about theAct, and the danger that it poses for the development of a vital newcommunications medium, we believe that it is essential that the Congressgiven careful scrutiny and study to provisions involving the regulation ofindecency in interactive media.  Senator Leahy and Rep. Klink have offeredlegislation (S. 714) which would conduct just such as study.  Thoughtfulconsideration is essential before moving ahead with legislation that isboth unconstitutional and patently ineffective toward the goal ofprotecting children.For more information contact:Center for Democracy and Technology     202-637-9800        Jerry Berman                    Daniel Weitzner         People for the American Way             202-467-4999        Leslie Harris                   Jill Lesser             For background on the Communications Decency Act, see the Center forDemocracy and Technology's World Wide Web site at http://www.cdt.org/.-------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) Proposed revision to Communications Decency Act    May 19, 1995 draft** NOTE:    Changes indicated in this draft (as marked below) representchanges to the draft itself, and not to the language of the currentCommunications Decency Act (Title IV of S. 652).

The Bond bill does not adequately address the threats to individual privacy presented by the use of such systems. CDT urges Congress to pass legislation such as the Fair Health Information Practices Act (H.R. 435) introduced in the House by Gary Condit (D-CA). We urge Senator Bond to amend his proposal to incorporate the comprehensive privacy protections set out in the Condit bill.Currently there is no comprehensive federal law that protects the confidentiality of personal information that individuals divulge during encounters with the health care industry. Yet most individuals consider information on their health to be the most sensitive information about themselves and to be the information most in need of privacy protection. The lack of strong uniform privacy protection for personal health information has left individuals vulnerable to privacy violations in a paper-based world.However, the threats to privacy posed by the computerization of personal health information without appropriate privacy policies and technological mechanisms to control the collection, use, access and disclosure, will make such information more vulnerable to abuse than ever before.The traditional barriers of location and time disappear in the age of computerization. With birth to death dossiers on each American on line the potential for multiple simultaneous access from various locations exists. The locked file cabinet that traditionally protected medical information from prying eyes must be reinvented for the age of automation. Legislation to protect the privacy of health information is urgently needed.As health care reform came to a halt at the end of the 103rd Congress, a piece of health care reform legislation that received support from Democrats, Republicans, health providers, health insurers, and privacy advocates was the Fair Health Information Practices Act (introduced by Senator Pat Leahy (D-VT) and Representative Condit. The bill was coupled with an earlier version of Bond's Health Information Modernization Bill. In fact, the privacy protections for health information found in these proposals were fleshed out versions of language contained in every major piece of health care reform legislation in Congress. Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of health information is one of the issues on which broad consensus was reached during the health care debate last year. Without a detailed privacy section, the Health Information Modernization and Security Act harkens back to provisions in President Clinton's Health Security Act that received widespread ridicule. Like the Administration's Health Security Act, Senator Bond's proposal fails to fully address the confidentiality of personal health information. The Health Information Modernization and Security Act fails to incorporate privacy and security standards into the legislation. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish standards for the implementation of privacy and security within eighteen months of enactment.The lack of privacy, confidentiality and security provisions within the Act is disturbing, since a goal of the bill is "encouraging the development of a health information network through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information." The Act would greatly increase the ease with which information is accessed, compiled, exchanged and manipulated. The failings of this bifurcated approach to policy and technology were readily apparent to the Administration, Congress, privacy advocates and the private sector in 1994. If Congress advocates a move to automated record keeping, it must simultaneously protect the sensitive information on individuals that will be stored and transmitted by these systems. Before the government accelerates or mandates computerization in the health care field, it is crucial comprehensive privacy protections for health information be established. During last Congress there was consensus that health information systems could not be designed and constructed without enforceable privacy rules in place. It is neither reasonable nor rational to design a system knowing that the sensitive information each American would be asked to entrust would be largely unprotected from misuse and abuse, and that the failure to address privacy up front would likely lead to a complete system redesign or overhaul years later at an increased cost. We urge Senator Bond and Congress to ensure that personal health information is protected by strong enforceable privacy protections.

(Sec. 101) The Secretary of HHS is given responsibility for adopting standards for data elements and transactions, but is to be guided by current practice and by standards developed or modified by a standards setting organization (this is likely to be the American National Standard Institute - ANSI). (Sec. 1172) Sec. 1174 requires that the Secretary adopt standards relating to the information transactions, data elements and security and privacy within 18 months of enactment.The Secretary is to adopt uniform standards to increase the electronic availability of "financial and administrative transactions: claims or equivalent encounter information, claims attachments, enrollment and disenrollment, eligibility, payment and remittance advice, premium payments, first report of injury, claims status, referral certification and authorization," and "other transactions determined appropriate by the Secretary consistent with the goals of improving the operation of the health care systems and reducing administrative costs." (Sec. 1173(a)(1)). In addition, the Secretary is to adopt a unique health identifier for each individual. (Sec. 1174(b)(1)). Sec. 1177 sets penalties for use of the unique health identifier that are not authorized by the Secretary.The Secretary is to promulgate regulations specifying procedures for the electronic transmission and authentication of signatures that will meet current federal and state written signature requirements, "pen & quill" laws. (Sec. 1173(d)1)Privacy and Security Standards:Section 1172(b)(1) requires each person who "maintains or transmits health information or data elements that are subject to this Act" to maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure integrity and confidentiality and to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards and unauthorized uses and disclosures.Section 1174(b) gives the Secretary one and one-half years post enactment to establish the standards for implementing the privacy standards.Penalties for Wrongful Disclosure of Individually Identifiable Health InformationUnder Section 1177, individuals who violate the privacy standards, which govern obtaining or disclosing individually identifiable health information, established by the Secretary, may be fined up to $50,000 and imprisoned up to 1 year, or both. If the offense is committed under false pretenses the fine can be up to $100,000 and the sentence up to 5 years. If the offense is committed with the intent to sell, transfer, use for commercial advantage or personal gain, or use to maliciously harm the individual, the fine may be up to $250,000 and the sentence up to 10 years.PreemptionThe Act would preempt contrary provisions of State laws, including "requirements or standards that are more stringent than the requirements or standards under the Act, except: 1) where the requirement is more stringent with respect to electronic transmissions of financial or administrative transactions from providers to plans and incorporates standards adopted under the bill; 2) more stringent with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health information; of 3) is an already enacted provisions governing the coordination of benefits; or 4) in the Secretary's judgment, is necessary to curtail fraud and abuse. (Sec. 1178) The Act does not invalidate or curtail public health reporting laws. (Sec. 1178(b)).Health Information Advisory CommitteeSection 1179 establishes a Health Information Advisory Committee (15 members) to advise and assist the Secretary. The Committee is directed to study the issues of uniform standards and electronic exchange and report to the Secretary within four years of enactment. The Committee is to report annually on compliance with the act. The report will address compliance with privacy and security standards among other issues.Standards for Patient Medical Record Information Under Section 1180, within four to six years, the Secretary shall recommend a plan for developing and implementing uniform data standards for patient medical record information and the electronic exchange of such information.Grants for Demonstration ProjectsThe Secretary is given the right to make grants for demonstration projects aimed at promoting the development and use of electronically integrated, community-based clinical information systems and computerized patient medical records.----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3) WHAT YOU CAN DOThere is currently a companion bill in the House of Representatives, H.R. 1766, the Health Information Modernization and Security Act, introduced by Representative Thomas Sawyer (D-OH) and Representative David Hobson (R-OH). This bill is very similar to Senator Bond's bill. All concerns held by the Center for Democracy and Technology for Senator Bond's bill are also held for H.R. 1766. We urge you to contact Senator Bond (202) 224-5721 to voice your concern over S. 872, Health Information Modernization and Security Act, and Representatives Hobson (202) 225-4324 and Sawyer (202) 225-5231 over the House bill H.R. 1766, Health Information Modernization and Security Act. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (4) ABOUT THE CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGY/CONTACTING US The Center for Democracy and Technology is a non-profit public interest organization.

CDT believes that the new proposal fails to provide adequate privacy protection, would effectively eliminate the domestic market for non-escrowed encryption applications, and is weighed too heavily toward the interests of the National Security Agency.The administration has proposed to relax export controls on cryptographic applications (both software and hardware) with key lengths up to 64 bits provided that:* The keys required to decrypt a message or file are escrowed with an   agent certified by the US government (including private entities)* The product does not decrypt messages or files encrypted with non-  escrowed products or products whose escrow mechanisms have been   altered or disabled.* As well as eight other criteria (the proposal is attached below).NEW PROPOSAL FAILS TO ADHERE TO CRITERIA IN GORE LETTER TO CANTWELL.In a July 1994 letter to then Representative Maria Cantwell, Vice President Gore announced that the Administration intended to re-examine its cryptography policy. The Gore letter, which was widely viewed as an abandonment of the Clipper Chip Government Key Escrow scheme, pledged to develop a policy framework that would promote the development of encryption systems that would meet the following criteria:* Implementation in hardware of Software* Public, Unclassified Algorithms* Voluntary* Forth Amendment privacy Safeguards* Statutory liability rules to protect users* Multiple Escrow AgentsOn hearing that the Administration had set out to develop a new encryption policy based on the principles outlined in the Gore letter, the Center for Democracy and Technology was guardedly optimistic that a genuine policy breakthrough was possible.  However, having had the opportunity to review the current proposal, every principle, except the first (software implementation) and second (public algorithms), outlined in the July 1994 letter is violated or, in one case, left in doubt, by the September 1995 policy statement.The September 1995 policy statement diverges from the July 1994 letter in the following critical respects.  In our view, these divergences represent fundamental defects in the proposed policy.* NOT VOLUNTARY:  The current proposal effectively compels all domestic   users to use key escrow systems if they ever intend to communicate   internationally.  Point 6 of the export criteria requires that an   exportable system must not interoperate with any system that non-  escrow systems.  Thus, in order for a user in the United States to   communicate with anyone who uses a United States-made system on the   Internet but outside of the United States, the American user must   employ a key escrow system.  Domestic users are not legally compelled   to use key escrow products, but the proposed policy forces, in   practice, all but the most insular Internet user toward a key escrow   system. Moreover, this proposal further illustrates that the   Administration seeks to use export controls to push the domestic use   of escrowed cryptography. A policy based on such compulsion can hardly   be called voluntary. * INADEQUATE SECURITY:  Point 1 precludes export of systems with key   lengths beyond 64 bits.  Though this key size is larger than what is   currently exportable, it is a level of security already judged   inadequate for some applications.  Given the rate at which computing   power increases, even a 64 bit key would be subject to attach before   long. Ironically, even the Clipper Chip provided a stronger (80 bit)   key length  The premise of the key escrow policy is to provide law enforcement   and national security agencies a "front door" to be used to decrypt   messages when the agency obtains proper legal authorization.  Yet, the   architects of the current policy apparently are not willing to trust   that key escrow systems will meet law enforcement needs inasmuch as   the key length limit suggests that the Administration is intent on   maintaining an extra-legal method of decrypting communications.  The   Gore letter contains no suggestion that key escrow systems would also   be subject to key length limits but the Administration seems to have   lost faith in its own proposal.  Such a half-hearted effort cannot be   the basis of a long-lasting policy.* NO PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR USERS OF ESCROWED SYSTEMS:  The ten export   principles make no mention of privacy safeguards which the Vice   President previously recognized as necessary to safeguard individual   privacy and Fourth Amendment principles.  Any escrow policy must   contain safeguards against abuse and statutory liability provisions   for the operators of private escrow systems.* FAILS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY:  Points 6 and 10 of   the export criteria raise grave doubts as to the likelihood that the   current proposal will give rise to a secure global communications   environment.  Point 10 forces users in other countries (and their   governments) to accept United States-based escrow of all keys until   bilateral access agreements are entered into.  Such tactics seem   unlikely to produce satisfactory international agreements, and hold   global communications security hostage to the completion of such   agreements.NSA/ADMINISTRATION SEEK TO RUSH IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW POLICYThe NIST Key escrow conference was billed as an opportunity to begin a dialogue between the administration and industry on the new cryptography policy. However, as the conference began it quickly became apparent that many of the critical policy issues, including the 64 bit key length, interoperability with non-escrow products, and some requirements for key escrow agents (including whether individuals, corporations, and foreign entities are eligible) have already been decided. The Administrations attempt to rush many of the critical policy decisions drew sharp reaction from virtually all of the conference participants, including CDT, other public interest groups, and representatives from several major software and hardware manufacturers. Although the administration and NSA officials all indicated that they got the message, they still intend to publish a revised policy in the next 30 days for comment.INDUSTRY BALKSIndustry reaction to the new policy proposal was, with a few limited exceptions, decidedly negative. Both during formal presentations and in small group sessions, representatives from several of the largest hardware manufacturers and software publishers questioned whether the market would support products designed to adhere to the administration's proposal, particularly in light of the 64 bit key length limit.CDT believes that the administration must make every effort to accommodate the concerns of the public, civil liberties groups, software publishers, hardware manufacturers, users, and other interested parties before adopting any new national cryptography policy. The current proposal fails to address many of the critical concerns of public interest groups and industry, and should be abandoned.NEXT STEPSThe administration intends to published a revised policy within the next 30 days (October 7). CDT will closely monitor this issue and will inform you as it develops.PATHS TO RELEVANT DOCUMENTS:More information, including CDT's testimony from the NIST conference,other conference documents, etc. can be found at CDT's Crypto Issues Page:URL:http://www.cdt.org/crypto.html------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY9/1/95 Proposed Cryptography Policy for Software Key EscrowKey Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995Discussion Paper #3            Export Criteria Discussion Draft --           64-bit Software Key Escrow EncryptionAs discussed at the SPA/AEA meeting on August 17, 1995, theAdministration is willing to allow the export of softwareencryption provided that the products use algorithms with keyspace that does not exceed 64 bits and the key(s) required todecrypt messages/files are escrowed with approved escrow agents. On the same date, the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting atNIST was also announced.  The two principal topics at the meetingwill be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bitsoftware key escrow encryption and 2) desirable characteristicsfor key escrow agents. In order to help make most productive use of the limited timeavailable at the upcoming meeting and to better focusdeliberation, the following criteria are being distributed fordiscussion purposes.  Since it is important that final criteriabe clear, straightforward, consistent, and implementable, pleasereview these draft criteria and be prepared to discuss how they may be refined and made more specific.                            --- Draft Export Criteria ---for Software Key Escrow Encryption Software key escrow encryption products meeting the followingcriteria will be granted special export licensing treatmentsimilar to that afforded other mass-market software products withencryption.  1.    The product will use an unclassified encryption algorithm      (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to exceed 64 bits.2.    The product shall be designed to prevent multiple      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).3.    The key required to decrypt each message or file shall be      accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the product,      and such keys will be escrowed during manufacture in      accordance with #10.  If such keys are not escrowed during      manufacture, the product shall be inoperable until the key      is escrowed in accordance with #10.4.    The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include with      each encrypted message or file, in a format accessible by      authorized entities, the identity of the key escrow      agent(s), and information sufficient for the escrow      agent(s) to identify the key or key components required to      decrypt that message.5.    The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would      disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include      being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be      disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a      block of code by a modified block).6.    The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted      by non-escrowed products, including products whose key      escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.7.    The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's      encrypted information regardless of whether that user is      the sender or the intended recipient of the encrypted      information.8.    The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated      involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of      multiple decryption keys during the period of authorized      access.9.    In the event any such product is or may be available in the      United States, each production copy of the software shall      either have a unique key required for decrypting messages      or files that is escrowed in accordance with #10, or have      the capability for its escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and      any new key to be escrowed in accordance with #10.10.   The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only with      escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or by      foreign governments with which the U.S. Government has      formal agreements consistent with U.S. law enforcement and      national security requirements.Note: Software products incorporating additional encryptionmethods other than key escrow encryption methods will beevaluated for export on the basis of each encryption methodincluded, as is already the case with existing products. Accordingly, these criteria apply only to the key escrowencryption method incorporated by a software product, and not toother non-escrowed encryption methods it may incorporate.  Forinstance, non-escrowed encryption using a key length of 40 bitsor less will continue to be exportable under existing exportregulations.------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CDT POLICY POST LISTCDT Policy Posts, which is what you have just finished reading, are the regular news publication of the Center For Democracy and Technology.

The principal focus of the hearing was to discuss Senator Grassley's "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995" (S. 892). CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman testified before the panel.Senator Grassley (R-IA) deserves praise for holding the first Congressional hearing on this important issue. In addition, both Senator Grassley and Senator Leahy took great pains to ensure that both sides of the issue were represented. Although CDT may disagree with Senator Grassley's approach, we believe that this hearing represented an essential step towards advancing the dialogue on what has become an over-hyped and dramatically misunderstood issue.Senator Grassley's legislation, which has been co-sponsored by several other prominent members such as Dole (R-KS), Hatch (R-UT), and Thurmond (R-SC), would impose criminal penalties on a service provider that "knowingly" transmits indecent material to a minor, or who "willfully" permits its network to be used to transmit indecent material to a minor (S. 892, Sec (b)(2) & (b)(3)). Two important points emerged from the testimony:1. Current law prohibits the distribution of obscenity and child   pornography, as well as online stalking and solicitation of minors.   As troubling and disturbing as some of the testimony was, no evidence   was presented that there are gaps in current law which would be   filled by the Grassley legislation. 2. Serious questions exist as to the constitutionality of the Grassley   Bill. Although Senator Grassley has repeatedly stated that his bill    is narrowly drawn and targets only the bad actors, no evidence was   presented to establish that a court would not interpret the statute    more broadly, resulting in a complete ban on constitutionally    protected speech online.WITNESSESWitnesses testifying before the panel included:* Donnelle Gruff, a 15 year old Florida girl described as a victim of an  online stalker,* Patricia Shao, a mother of two from Baltimore MD and volunteer for  Enough Is Enough* Dr. Susan Elliot, a mother from McLean VA* Bill Burrington, Assistant General Counsel, America Online* Barry Crimmins, a children's rights advocate* Stephen Balkam, Executive Director, Recreational Software Advisory  Counsel* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center for Democracy and Technology* Michael S. Hart, Executive Director of Project Gutteberg, Professor of   Electronic Texts, Illinois Benedictine College* Dee Jepsen, Enough Is Enough (an anti-pornography group)DOES THE GRASSLEY BILL PROTECT CHILDREN?The testimony of 15 year old Donnelle Gruff focused on her experience as the victim of a stalker, while Dr. Elliot and Ms. Shao, two mothers of young children, described how their children had used commercial online services to access files they deemed inappropriate. Donnelle Gruff testified that she had been harassed and stalked by the sysop of a Florida BBS she had visited. The sysop had obtained her name, age, and address from her records and reportedly stalked Gruff while she was at home.During questioning however, Gruff's step-father told Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) that Florida law enforcement officials were currently investigating the case, and that they had given no indication that current law is insufficient with respect to prosecuting such cases. Senator Leahy noted that, as difficult and disturbing as Gruff's case is, it illustrates a need for additional law enforcement resources and education, but is not an issue of gaps in current federal or state laws. Senator Leahy mentioned similar recent prosecutions in Florida, and noted that the Grassley legislation does not explicitly prohibit online stalking of minors.In addition, Senator Leahy questioned whether government content restrictions would be an effective solution to protecting children online. "I hear a lot of rhetoric (from Congress) about getting government out of our lives, but here it seems as if the rhetoric is a little off of reality. Parents, not the government, should make the choices" about what their children should be permitted to access.Both Dr. Elliot and Ms. Shao testified that their children had stumbled across material while surfing the Internet that they, as parents, felt should not be accessible to children. Both described how their children had accessed "pornographic" images, and had been propositioned for "cybersex" while visiting a chat room on a commercial online service. In addition, Dr. Elliot described some of the images as representing 'bestiality and sodomy'.Barry Crimmins, a child protection advocate, testified that he has found numerous images of child pornography on America Online. Crimmins accused AOL of neglecting to adequately police its network. When questioned by Senator Leahy, Crimmins acknowledged that the distribution of child pornography and stalking or solicitation of minors is prohibited under current law. Crimmins added that while he thought the commercial online service should do more to remove such material, he believes that more vigorous enforcement of existing law would help to address his concerns.WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE -- IS CURRENT LAW SUFFICIENT?Often in the course of the debate on this issue, the term "pornographic" is assumed to be interchangeable with both "indecency" and "obscenity". However as Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) noted, "pornography" has no legal standing, and when legislating in this area Congress must be careful to avoid confusing these legal distinctions. In determining what material would be considered illegal under current law, the distinction between "obscene" and "indecent" material must be made completely clear. When pressed by Senator Feingold, Dr. Elliot agreed that precise definitions are important, but argued that the files that her child downloaded from the Internet that depicted bestiality and sodomy that would be, "obscene by any standard". Images of bestiality and sodomy, as Dr. Elliot described, would be considered obscene in virtually every community in the United States, and hence are illegal under current law. Though it raises difficult jurisdictional questions, obscenity has been clearly defined by the Courts. Moreover, trafficking in obscenity (18 USC Sec 1462, 1464, 1466) as well as child pornography (18 USC Sec 2252) have been successfully applied to punish conduct on computer networks. As Senator Leahy pointed out in his statement, the Justice Department is currently prosecuting cases involving material similar to that described by Dr. Elliot.Indecent material, on the other hand, is constitutionally protected and is much more difficult to define. The most common understanding of what constitutes indecent material includes the 7 dirty words, images of nudity, and other suggestive material. Moreover, the Supreme Court has ruled that any attempts by government to restrict access to indecent material must be accomplished in the "least restrictive means", and the determination of this standard is entirely dependent on the medium (see Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 (1989). Some of the material described by the witnesses would be considered obscene, and hence is already prohibited under current law. Other examples, including Ms. Shao's description of her daughter being propositioned for "cybersex", would likely not be considered obscene. Senator Feingold urged the committee to carefully consider the distinctions between "obscene" and "indecent" speech, and urged his colleagues to "exercise caution and restraint." How broadly should we define indecency, Feingold asked Dr. Elliot, "Where should we draw the line? Should we prohibit Playboy? swearing? The Catcher In The Rye? What about a discussion forum about how to avoid getting AIDS?". Because technologies currently exist to screen out messages such as those described by Ms. Shao, it is unlikely that a broad prohibition on such messages would pass constitutional muster. In this case, Congress must look to other, less restrictive methods of preventing children from having access to such materials -- including promoting the development and availability of user control technologies.CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUESThroughout the hearing, Senator Grassley stated that his legislation is carefully crafted and narrowly drawn in order to preserve the First Amendment rights of adults while protecting children from inappropriate material. Grassley stated that his bill would hold an online service provider liable only in cases where they "knowingly" allow their network to be used to transmit indecent material to a minor or "willfully" allow an individual to use their network to do so. However, as CDT's Jerry Berman and America Online's Bill Burrington argued the wording of the statute and the variety of possible interpretations could lead to severe chilling effect on the free flow of legitimate information in cyberspace and force online service providers to limit or remove certain areas of their service.BROAD KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENTThe scope of the "knowing" standard in the Grassley bill is an issue of some dispute. Senator Grassley and his staff maintain that it is intended to apply narrowly, but no evidence was presented that demonstrated why a court would apply a narrow interpretation. Berman cautioned that because of this uncertainty, online service providers would be forced to rely on the broadest possible interpretation of the statute in order to avoid liability, resulting in a severe chilling effect on all online communications:"The threat of a broad interpretation of this new statute would compel all who provide access to the Internet to restrict *all* public discussion areas and public information sources from subscribers, unless they prove that they are over the age of eighteen.  Under this statute, a service provider could not even provide Internet access to a minor *with the approval* of the child's parent.  Since every online service provider would have to similarly restrict access to minors, this proposed statute would create two separate Internets, one for children and one for adults."America Online's Bill Burrington agreed, stating that the potential for a broad interpretation of the statute would compel AOL and other online service providers to adhere to the broadest possible reading in order to avoid potential liability.  Burrington argued that would force AOL to shut down many parts of its service and place providers in the unenviable position of national censor."Constitutional guarantees of free speech and press should be cautiously guarded," Burrington stated, "The online service provider industry should be encouraged to provide *voluntary* editorial control over its service and to continue its research and development of parental empowerment technology tools.  This industry should not be cast in the role of national censor, determining which information may be fit for children, but nonetheless subject to criminal liability if it guesses incorrectly in any given instance." Senator Dewine (R-OH) asked several questions of many of the witnesses, and expressed concerne about the potential for an overly board interpretation of the knowledge standard.BROAD INTERPRETATION OF 'INDECENCY'As addressed earlier, a precise definition of 'indecent' speech has never been firmly established, and whether material would be considered indecent depends largely on the nature of the medium it is communicated through. Because of this, and because under the Grassley bill carriers would be liable for transmitting indecent speech, carriers would be forced to adhere to the broadest, most inclusive definition of indecency. This would include, among other things, the 7 dirty words, description of genitalia, nudity, and other material which is protected in other media.This issue was raised by Michael Hart, Executive Director of Project Gutteberg, who stressed that broad restrictions on indecency would prevent people from enjoying serious works of fiction on the Internet. Project Gutteberg makes electronic texts of books available on the Internet. Hart stated, with great emotion, that the proposed indecency restrictions contemplated by the Grassley bill would force him to remove some of Shakespeare's plays, The Catcher In The Rye, Lady Chatterly's Lover, Alice in Wonderland, and other books which have been classified as indecent in some parts of the United States. Although such an effect may not be intended by the drafters of the Grassley legislation, no evidence was offered at the hearing to counter Mr. Hart's concerns.EXON vs. BERMANCDT's Jerry Berman urged the Committee to act cautiously before voting to further restrict First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech.  Berman urged the Senate to fulfill its traditional role as the "deliberative body", and to carefully consider the implications before enacting broad new statutes to cover new media.  Referring to both the Exon CDA and the Grassley bill, Berman stressed that the country would be better served if the Senate did not enact legislation simply to "provide the illusion that the United States Senate could do something in this area".This remark drew a sharp rebuttal from Senator Exon, who, though not a member of the Judiciary Committee, sat in on the hearing on the invitation of Senator Grassley.  Exon defended his bill and accused CDT and others of launching "viscous attacks" against him and his legislation. Berman was not given a chance to respond."We are concerned about the situation", Exon argued, yet "we are viscously attacked for trying to have a rational discussion.  We don't want to create a false sense of security [but] we have a responsibility to protect children".  In addition, Exon dismissed parental control technologies as too little too late, arguing that "for every block there is a way around that block", and that such technologies may not be available in every home, allowing children to access inappropriate material at the homes of neighbors who may not employ such tools.WHAT WAS LEARNED?Although the hearing did illustrate that sexually explicit material can be found on the Internet, no substantial evidence was presented to indicate that law enforcement is currently unable to prosecute violations of obscenity, child pornography, stalking, or child solicitation laws. Moreover, although Senator Grassley intends his legislation to be narrow, serious questions were raised about whether other, more board interpretations are possible. In our opinion, the hearing illustrated that current law is sufficient to prosecute those who stalk or solicit children online, and that complex constitutional issues are raised by congressional attempts to restrict indecent material on the Internet.

The hearing, held by the Subcommittee on Basic Research, Chaired by Rep. Schiff (R-NM) and the Subcommittee on Technology, Chaired by Rep. Morella (R-FL) provided an important counter-balance to Monday's Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing.Witnesses testifying before the committee included:Witnesses Demonstrating Technology Solutions* Tony Rutkowski, Executive Director of the Internet Society* Ann Duvall, President of SurfWatch Software* Steve Heaton, General Counsel and Secretary, CompuserveLaw Enforcement Witnesses* Kevin Manson, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center* Mike Geraghty, Trooper, New Jersey State Police* Lee Hollander, Assistant States Attorney, Naples FloridaLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY CURRENT LAW SUFFICIENT, EXON BILL FLAWEDToday's hearing marked the first time law enforcement officials have testified on the issue of children's access to inappropriate material on the Internet. All three law enforcement witnesses agreed that, in their experience, current law is sufficient to prosecute online stalking, solicitation of minors, and the distribution of pornography and child pornography. All three said that they are vigorously prosecuting such cases. Instead of enacting new law, New Jersey State Trooper Mike Geraghty said that protecting children is "a matter of training law enforcement officers, prosecutors, lawyers and judges about how to enforce existing laws [with respect to computer networks]. The laws are good, we have to learn how to enforce them".The three law enforcement witnesses further argued that the Senate-passed Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act is the wrong approach to addressing an issue that is already covered under existing law. "I have several problems with the Exon bill as a prosecutor, both in terms of its practical enforcement and its constitutionality" said Florida Assistant States Attorney Hollander said.TRANSACTIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS CRITICIZEDIn an slightly unrelated asside, Florida Assistant States Attorney Lee Hollander criticized privacy protections for online transactional information as a hindrance to law enforcement. As part of last years Digital Telephony legislation, the standard for law enforcement access to online transactional records (logs that indicate what files an individual accessed from online archives and electronic mail transactions) was raised from a requirement of a mere subpoena to a court order from a judge based on the showing of "specific and articulable facts" that such records are "relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation". The higher standard was widely seen as a victory for online privacy.In response to a question of what Congress could do to help aid enforcement of existing law, Hollander noted that the higher standard for online transactional records adds an additional burden to law enforcement investigations. Calling it part of a "ballance between privacy and law enforcement", Hollander did not suggest that Congress should repeal the court order requirement, only that it made prosecutions more difficult (*NOTE: Members of CDT staff worked closely on this issue, and consider the court order standard to be a tremendous victory for online privacy).EXON CDA CONDEMNED BY ALLCondemnation of the Senate-passed CDA was not limited to the law enforcement witnesses. Not a single member of the Subcommittee stated support for the CDA, and all expressed concern that the issue had not received sufficient public consideration by Congress. Chairwoman Morella stressed that Congress should consider technological options to empower parents to exercise control over what their children access online before rushing to enact new laws. Rep. Geren (D-TX) expressed concern about the First Amendment implications of the CDA. Rep. Vern Elhers (R-MI) stated that he would "oppose bills that make network access providers (legally) responsible for the content they carry". In what was perhaps the strongest condemnation of the Senate-passed Communications Decency Act, Rep. Zoe Loefgren (D-CA) said, "While well intentioned, the Exon bill a totally wrong approach and a complete misunderstanding of the Technology."PARENTAL CONTROL TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONLY EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONInternet Society Executive Director Tony Rutkowski provided Committee members with a basic overview of the Internet and noted that the Internet Society (ISOC) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are currently looking at content tagging and other voluntary rating systems for future Internet protocols. Rutkowski stressed that centralized, command and control style content restrictions would be ineffective in the global, distributed network environment of the Internet. Rutkowski further noted that objectionable material constitutes a minuscule amount (less than .05%) of the total traffic on the network. Because of the global reach of the Internet and the millions of potential content providers, Rutkowski argued, the only effective means of addressing the availability of inappropriate material is to provide user control applications to empower parents to block and filter what the and their children access. SurfWatch President Ann Duvall, demonstrated SurfWatch, and described the product as "just one example of the computer industry responding to needs created by the explosive growth of technology".  Duvall stressed that the industry is developing solutions which are simple to use, inexpensive, and empower parents to make their own choices about what they or their children should see. Expressing concern about legislative efforts to control content online, Duvall noted that 30% of the sites blocked by SurfWatch reside outside the United States. "There is not a simple, national solution to the problem of children accessing inappropriate material on the Internet. Excessive government regulations might jeopardize private sector opportunities. SurfWatch firmly believes that the technology industry can and must respond to these socio-technological issues. We also affirm that parents must be involved in any solution"Compuserve General Counsel Steve Heaton agreed with some of the Committee members that parents have a right to be concerned about the availability of certain material on the Internet, but stressed that government solutions are no substitute for empowering users. Heaton described some of the current parental control technology, and outlined Compuserve's plans to develop KidNet, an interactive service designed specifically for kids. Heaton cautioned against overly broad attempts to regulate content on the Internet and other interactive communications service: "The cyber community, made up of hundreds of thousands of computers distributed across the globe, is truly a world without borders. Directly regulating cyberspace -- history's only true functioning anarchy -- may prove impossible. This makes it imperative that laws focus on individual responsibility and that education and empowerment among users and concerned parents be emphasized."PATHS TO RELEVANT DOCUMENTSTestimony from the Science Committe hearing will be available on CDT's Communications Decency Act Issues Page beginning Friday July 28.

CONCLUSION...........................................                               Introduction          Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individualsand entities from the computer and communications industriesand the general public who provide most of the access to theInternet, and a substantial volume of the communicationscarried on the Internet and other interactive computersystems./*1  Plaintiffs challenge provisions of theCommunications Decency Act of 1996 (the "CDA" or "Act")/*2that criminalize constitutionally protected communicationsamong the adult population whenever those communicationsmight be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" forminors.  The challenged provisions violate the bedrock FirstAmendment principle that government cannot "reduce the adultpopulation . . . to reading only what is fit for children." Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957).                    STATEMENT OF THE CASE          Four points are critical in this case.  First, theInternet, and "cyberspace" generally, is an entirely newcommunications medium that differs from other media incrucial respects:  it is global, it is decentralized, itgives ordinary citizens unparalleled ability to communicateto and with others on a scale never before possible, and itis unobtrusive, because users access only the communicationsthey affirmatively request.  It therefore merits the highestlevel of First Amendment protection.  Second, the provisionsof the Act that are the subject of this challenge -- Section502(2), 47 U.S.C.   223(d), and Section 502(1), 47 U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B) -- criminalize an enormous quantity of speech,all of which is constitutionally protected for adults, andapply to a vast and diverse range of speakers and speechactivities.  Third, because of the way the Internet works,the Act effectively bans the vast majority of that speech,and severely burdens the rest.  Thus, in nearly everyapplication, the challenged provisions abridge the FirstAmendment rights of adults.  Fourth, effective methods existto protect minors from online speech that is inappropriatefor them, methods that do not deny adult access to thatspeech.     A.   The Internet, And "Cyberspace" Generally, Is          A Unique Medium Of Communication./*3          Creation of the Internet and the Development of          Cyberspace          The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. It is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smallergroups of linked computer networks:  a network ofnetworks./*4  This amalgam of computers and computernetworks is a decentralized, unrestricted global medium ofcommunications -- or "cyberspace" -- linking individuals,institutions, corporations, and governments around the world. Anyone with access to the Internet can use it to exchangeideas, research, software, poetry, images, literature, sound,or electronic mail.  Communication can occur virtuallyinstantaneously, and can be directed to specific individuals,broader groups, or the world as a whole.          No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, ornon-profit -- controls the Internet./*5  It exists andfunctions solely because hundreds of thousands of computeroperators and computer networks independently decided to usea common data transfer protocol to exchange information withother computers (which in turn exchange information withstill other computers).  Although the nature of the Internetmakes it impossible to determine its size, it is estimatedthat over 5,000,000 host computers worldwide are linked tothe Internet, and that over 50 million individuals around theworld access this medium.  Two hundred million users areexpected by the year 1999./*6  There is no centralizedstorage location, control point, or communications channelfor the Internet.  It would be impossible for any singleentity to regulate the information conveyed on theInternet./*7             How Individuals Access the Internet          There are two common methods to establish an actualphysical link to the Internet.  First, individuals can use acomputer or computer terminal that is directly connected to acomputer network that is itself connected to the Internet. Second, individuals can use "personal computers" with"modems" to connect over a telephone line to a largercomputer or computer network that is itself connected to theInternet./*8          Students, faculty, researchers, and othersaffiliated with most of colleges and universities in theUnited States can access the Internet through computerslocated in campus libraries, offices, computer centers anddormitories.  Such access, considered vital to theeducational process, enables students and professors to useinformation and content provided by the college or universityitself, and to reach the vast research resources available onthe Internet worldwide./*9  Similarly, many employers linktheir office computer networks, and provide their employeesaccess to the Internet, to enable them to exchangeinformation and ideas with others in their fields.  Manycommunities have established "free-nets" or communitynetworks to provide citizens a free or low-cost localInternet link (and provide local-oriented content anddiscussion groups) using computers available in communitybuildings.  Libraries also often offer computers linked tothe Internet at no cost to the individual user./*10  Agrowing number of "computer coffee shops" offer connection tothe Internet at a modest fee.          Individuals can also access the Internet through"Internet service providers."  Some providers (including themembers of plaintiff Commercial Internet ExchangeAssociation) are commercial entities who charge a modestmonthly or hourly fee./*11  Others (such as theInternational Internet Association) are non-profitorganizations offering free or low-cost access.          Access is also available through major nationalcommercial "online services" such as America Online, Apple'seWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  Theseonline services offer nationwide computer networks (so thatsubscribers can dial-in to a local telephone number).  Inaddition to allowing access to extensive and well-organizedcontent within each proprietary network, the services allowsubscribers to link to the much larger Internet resources. Full access to the online service (including the Internet)can be obtained for modest fees.  The major commercial onlineservices have almost twelve million individual subscribersacross the United States./*12          Finally, with an investment of as little as$2,000.00 and the cost of a telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, and businesses canoffer their own dial-in computer "bulletin board systems" or"BBSs" to exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range fromsingle computers allowing only one user at a time to multiplelinked computers allowing multiple simultaneous users.  SomeBBS systems charge a nominal fee, while many others are free. In part because the Internet is an unregulated "network ofnetworks" with literally millions of access points and tensof millions of users, many users access the Internetanonymously or through a method that does not allow for clearidentification by a remote content provider./*13           Methods to Communicate Over the Internet          Once an individual has access to the Internet,there are a wide variety of different methods ofcommunication and information exchange over the network. Most networks can be used to transmit text, data, computerprograms, sound, or visual images.               One-to-one messaging.  The simplest method of     communication is via "e-mail," which allows an     individual to transmit a message to specific     individuals./*14               One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also     contains thousands of automatic mailing list services     (such as "listserv"), which allow a subscriber to     transmit messages on a given topic that the listserv     automatically forwards (via e-mail) to every other     subscriber.  This service enables subscribers to keep     abreast of developments or events in a particular     subject area./*15               Distributed message databases.  Distributed     message databases, such as "USENET newsgroups," are open     discussions on particular topics.  Users need not     subscribe in advance.  A message posted to a newsgroup     is automatically forwarded to all computers that furnish     access to the newsgroups (but not to any individual     users).  Messages are temporarily stored on each     receiving computer where they are available for review     and response.  There are newsgroups on more than 1,500     subjects.  In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were     posted to newsgroups daily, and were distributed to     approximately 190,000 participating computers./*16               Real time communication.  Individuals can     engage in an immediate dialog -- in "real time" -- with     other individuals on the Internet.  In its simplest     forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and     "Internet Relay Chat" allows an individual to send a     message that almost immediately appears on other     individuals' computer screens.  Commercial online     services such as America Online, CompuServe, eWorld, the     Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat"     systems allowing their members to converse./*17               Real time remote computer utilization.      "Telnet" can be used to access remote computers.      Students can use telnet to connect to a remote library's     online card catalog.  Individuals can link via telnet to     a computer to interact directly with other users linked     to the same computer.  Content accessed via telnet is     often created only at the time of the communication and     occurs in "real time."/*18               Remote information retrieval.  The final major     category is the search for and retrieval of information     located on remote computers, through means such as the     "World Wide Web."/*19  Programs that "browse" the     Web can display documents containing text, images, and     sound, as well as "links" to other types of information     or resources.  Using these "hyperlinks," an individual     can "click" using a computer mouse on the description of     the resource and be immediately connected to the     resource itself./*20          With all of these methods of communicating incyberspace (except point-to-point mail), no information flowsthrough cyberspace to a particular individual unless theindividual requests the information./*21  Listservs,newsgroups, chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the WorldWide Web all require an affirmative request prior to anindividual's receiving online information./*22  When anindividual makes such a request, it is usually clear whattype of content will be delivered.          Most transmissions of content from specific siteson the Internet are in response to recipients' requests thatcould not have been anticipated more than a few momentsearlier.  Because information is located on millions ofcomputers around the world, with no central organization orcontrol, a user cannot possibly know which computers mighthave useful information until starting a search, and whilesearching may have no knowledge of where the computersaccessed are physically located./*23  Thus, there is noway for a user to pre-register with every computer thatpotentially might contain useful content on a particulartopic (and equally impossible for those content sites tomaintain and continually update lists of registered users). Moreover, when exploring a topic, an individual might accessdozens of newsgroups, telnet computers, and ftp, gopher, andWeb sites around the world in a matter of minutes.  If a usermust request access from content providers (and prove he orshe is not a minor) prior to actually viewing theinformation, as the Act requires, the Internet would losemuch of its value as a dynamic and instantaneous researchtool./*24     B.   The Act Applies To A Very Broad Category Of          Protected Speech, And To A Diverse Range Of          Speakers And Communicative Activities.          Plaintiffs are not challenging the Act to theextent it prohibits speech that is unprotected by the FirstAmendment -- including obscenity, see Miller v. California,413 U.S. 15 (1973), and child pornography, New York v.Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982)./*25  Nor do plaintiffschallenge the Act's prohibition of communications made withthe intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass therecipient, or provisions that prohibit communicationsdesigned to entice or lure minors into illegal activity. See, e.g., 47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(A),(C),(D),(E).  Thosecommunications are not constitutionally protected even foradults.  But subsections 223(a) and (d) enact sweepingrestrictions on speech that is constitutionally protected foradults.  Indeed, the Act directly affects an extraordinarilybroad category of speech, a massive volume of speech, and anextremely diverse range of speakers and speech activities.          Subsection (a).  The Act makes it a felony,punishable by two years in prison, for a person to knowinglytransmit by "telecommunications device"/*26 "any comment,request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communicationwhich is . . . indecent" to a person whom the transmitterknows is under 18.  47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B)./*27  Thisprovision on its face prohibits any communications containingany indecent material whenever one participant knows anotherparticipant is under 18, and would make it illegal for aUniversity library to transmit the text of Lady Chatterly'sLover or George Carlin's satirical "Seven Dirty Words"monologue to a portion of the University's freshman class,because those works have been judged "indecent."/*28          Subsection (d).  Subsection (d) is even moresweeping.  The provision makes it a felony, punishable by twoyears in prison, for anyone to knowingly use an "interactivecomputer service"/*29 to "display in a manner availableto" a person under 18:          any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,          or other communication that, in context, depicts or          describes, in terms patently offensive as measured          by contemporary community standards, sexual or          excretory activities or organs[.]  223(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added)./*30          This "display" prohibition is truly breathtaking inscope.  Unlike the standard for obscenity, the Act'sprohibition of "indecent" or "patently offensive" material isnot restricted to materials with "prurient appeal."  SeeMiller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, (1973).  To thecontrary, while "[p]rurient appeal is an element of theobscene, . . . the normal definition of `indecent' merelyrefers to nonconformance with accepted standards ofmorality."  FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 740 (1978)(footnote omitted).  Nor are subsections (a) or (d) limitedto material that lacks serious literary, artistic, politicalor scientific value./*31      The Act plainly covers theso-called "seven dirty words," for those very words have beenfound "indecent" and "patently offensive" by the SupremeCourt in Pacifica,/*32 and the Conference Report makesclear that Congress was adopting Pacifica./*33 Similarly, Senator Exon, the Act's principal sponsor,confirmed that the prohibition would apply to Playboymagazine. 141 Cong. Rec. S8330 (June 14, 1995) (Sen.Exon)./*34          Not surprisingly given the enormous quantity anddiversity of information it carries, cyberspace contains asubstantial amount of expression that might be deemed"indecent" or "patently offensive" for youngerchildren./*35  This material includes serious works offiction (containing descriptions of sexual conduct or vulgarlanguage),/*36 use of profanity in casual conversationsvia e-mail, reproductions of artwork containing nudity orsexually explicit images, medical treatises (containingdepictions or descriptions relating to sexually transmitteddiseases and medical conditions), robust political or publicpolicy debates containing vulgar language or expletives, andserious discussions of sexuality and relationships.  SeeAction for Children's Television v. FCC, 852 F.2d 1332, 1340(D.C. Cir. 1988)("ACT I"); Action for Children's Televisionv. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C. Cir. 1991) ("ACT II"),cert. denied, 503 U.S. 913 (1992).  This type of informationis an important part of the Internet materials accessible byresearchers, members of the academic community and thepublic./*37           Indeed, in this litigation the government has citedand relied upon the "Rimm" study to illustrate the types ofmaterials with which the Act is concerned./*38  Thatstudy, which was published in the Georgetown Law Journal,itself contains descriptions that could be deemed indecent orpatently offensive within the meaning of the Act.  See DeftACLU Br. Ex. 9 at pp. 1880-1882.  The text of that study ismaintained online by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh,whose Director is understandably concerned with the "risk ofcriminal prosecution under the Act."/*39  It may now be afelony to post or maintain online the very materials thegovernment has relied on in this litigation./*40            In addition to criminalizing a broad category ofspeech, the Act subjects an unusually broad category ofspeakers to the risk of imprisonment and substantial fines. Nearly every online user and service provider will ofnecessity employ either a "telecommunications device" or an"interactive computer service," or both.  Almost all of thetens of millions of users of the Internet are "contentproviders."  By the very nature of the Internet, mostmaterial that is stored in a database or made part of abulletin board can be accessed by everyone, and is ipso facto"display[ed] in a manner available to" persons under18./*41  Thus, the Act regulates the activity ofvirtually everyone who uses the Internet or cyberspace.     C.   The Defenses Provided In The Act Do Not Provide A          Technologically or Economically Feasible Means For          Most Internet Speakers To Shield Themselves From          Liability.          Recognizing that the First Amendment forbids a flatprohibition of indecency on the scale imposed by subsections(a) and (d),/*42 Congress sought to narrow the sweepingeffect of the Act by providing a defense to a criminalprosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) for useof a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if thedefendant          (A)  has taken, in good faith, reasonable,          effective, and appropriate actions under the          circumstances to restrict or prevent access by          minors to a communication specified in such          subsections, which may involve any appropriate          measures to restrict minors from such          communications, including any method which is          feasible under available technology; or          (B)  has restricted access to such communication by          requiring use of a verified credit card, debit          account, adult access code, or adult personal          identification number.47 U.S.C.   223(e)(5)).            These "defenses," which the Act's sponsors borroweddirectly from "dial-a-porn" legislation, were intended toprovide a means to preserve access for adults while denyingaccess to minors.  Thus, the clear premise of the Act was theassumption that the "defenses" that worked in the dial-a-porncontext would work in cyberspace, and that, for that reason,the Act would not effectively ban constitutionally protectedindecent speech between adults.          That premise is flatly incorrect.  Fee-basedcontent providers -- who typically require credit cardpayment for users' access to their speech -- may be able toavail themselves of the "verified credit card" defenseallowed by the Act./*43  But for content providers whospeak to the public at large, and do not charge for access totheir speech, there is no practical way the speaker cancontrol who can access the message.  Thus, for a hugequantity of speech on the Internet, it is impossible for thespeaker to prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in amanner available to a person under 18."  47 U.S.C.  223(2)(d)(1)(B)./*44          The primary methods used to access information onthe Internet simply do not permit individual or non-commercial content providers to control access to theirspeech.  None of the major methods of accessing information-- including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups, chatlines, telnet, and the World Wide Web -- have the ability totrack the millions of individuals who access the Internet andscreen out those that are under 18./*45  With USENETnewsgroups, for example, once a content provider posts amessage to a newsgroup, that message is automaticallydistributed to over 190,000 computers around the world, andthe individual content provider has no ability whatsoever tocontrol who is permitted to access the content on thosecomputers./*46  Even larger organizations that providecontent on the Internet cannot practically or economicallytrack the millions of Internet users to determine whetherthose users are minors or adults./*47  Such a requirementwould effectively compel these content providers to refraincompletely from posting any material that could be deemed"indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors./*48          Although password-required access to content ispossible (and is used in some circumstances),/*49  thepassword system envisioned by the Act would effectivelyremove from public access an enormous volume of valuablecontent on the Internet, and would, in large part, reduce theinformation available to adults on the Internet to thatdeemed suitable for minors./*50          Because of the infeasibility of the statutorydefenses, the Act effectively bans an entire category ofconstitutionally protected speech among adults.  For thisreason, the Act will actually frustrate, rather than further,the Congressional policy goals.  The Act specifies that "[i]tis the policy of the United States . . . to promote thecontinued development of the Internet and other interactivecomputer services . . .  to preserve the vibrant andcompetitive free market that presently exists for theInternet and other interactive computer services, unfetteredby Federal or State regulation."  47 U.S.C.   230.  Insteadof a free, vibrant and unfettered market, cyberspace will bea cramped and highly regulated market, where all speakerswill have to choose their words with great care.     D.   There Are Existing Ways To Protect Minors          From Speech That Would Be Inappropriate For          Them, That Do Not Ban Or Burden Speech To          Adults.          The online medium offers the recipients ofinformation a degree of control unmatched in any othermedium.  Not only can users affirmatively select the contentof materials they view based on the subject matter of theparticular service or the information contained in theheadline or subject line, but there are also numerous -- andexpanding -- methods for users to screen and block incomingmaterials they choose not to receive.          Commercial online services such as America Online,CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offertechnologies that allow parents to block their children'saccess to inappropriate content./*51  These onlineservices, for example, include a feature that allows parentsto prevent their children from accessing interactivediscussion forums (chat rooms).  They also offer parents theability to block access to some or all of the Internet(including the World Wide Web and USENET newsgroups) based onkeywords, subject matter, or specific newsgroups.          A variety of software providers have developedapplications to use in conjunction with commercial onlineservices, while others are designed for direct Internetaccess.  SurfWatch, for example, allows parents to blockaccess to USENET newsgroups, World Wide Web, gopher, and ftpsites with sexually explicit content./*52  The serviceautomatically updates the list of blocked sites, without anyintervention required from the user./*53  Similarly,Cyber Patrol blocks access to locations and content on theInternet based both on a list of identified sites and on ascan for certain key words suggesting sexual content./*54 Certain of these screening programs can be set to keep a logof all activity that occurs on the computer, allowing parentsto monitor a child's use.  All of these programs containsafeguards to prevent children from circumventing theblocking software./*55          User-based content control programs provide parentsand others flexibility to select the kinds of content to bescreened.  For example, Cyber Patrol allows parents to chooseto screen out some or all of 12 separate categories ofcontent./*56  Moreover, these programs allow parents tomodify the screening criteria as their young children matureinto teenagers and young adults.          This screening technology is available at little orno cost to parents and other computer users.  Online servicesmake their internal parental control systems, as well asCyber Patrol, Surfwatch, and similar software, available toparents at no additional charge./*57  MicrosystemsSoftware, Inc. offers a version of Cyber Patrol that anyonecan obtain for free over the Internet./*58  Retailversions of this type of blocking software costs between$20.00 and $50.00./*59          Additionally, the World Wide Web Consortium/*60has promulgated a communications standard to facilitate thistype of user-based blocking.  The Platform for InternetContent Selection ("PICS") defines the precise method bywhich content ratings can be transmitted to user-basedblocking software./*61  The PICS standard allows alluser-based blocking software to be compatible, and to utilizecommon databases of content ratings.  Under the PICSstandard, any third party organization (such as a church,parents' organization, or pediatric association) can rateInternet content according to that organization's own values,and those ratings can be accessed by user-based blockingsoftware.  The PICS standard has been implemented in blockingsoftware such as Surfwatch and Cyber Patrol,/*62 andCyber Patrol has made its ratings available on the Internetin a PICS-compatible database.  With PICS, parents will beable to further tailor the content available to theirchildren according to the parents' own values.                           ARGUMENT          The requirements for issuance of a preliminaryinjunction are likelihood of success on the merits andirreparable injury if an injunction does not issue.  Bradleyv. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir.1990).  The court must also consider the public interest. Id.  This test is easily met here.  As the accompanyingdeclarations show, the Act is currently causing irreparableinjury to the First Amendment rights of plaintiffs, theirmembers, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, whilealso causing irreparable injury to the public interest infree expression, and particularly to the First Amendmentright of adults to receive expression that is indisputablyprotected for them.  Plaintiffs will now show that governingSupreme Court precedent virtually assures their ultimatesuccess on the merits.I.   THE ACT EFFECTIVELY BANS AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF SPEECH     THAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED FOR ADULTS, AND THE     SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THAT GOVERNMENT CANNOT     REDUCE THE ADULT POPULATION TO READING AND VIEWING ONLY     WHAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN.     A.   The Act's Content-Based Restrictions On Indecent          Speech Are Subject To Strict Scrutiny, And Cannot          Be Upheld Unless the Government Proves That the          Restrictions Materially Advance a Compelling          Interest In the Least Restrictive Way, And Proves          That the Benefit To Be Gained From the Restrictions          Outweighs And Does Not Unduly Burden the First          Amendment Rights Of Adults.          "At the heart of the First Amendment lies theprinciple that each person should decide for him or herselfthe ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration,and adherence.  Our political system and cultural life restupon this ideal."  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  For this reason, "the FirstAmendment . . . does not countenance governmental controlover the content of messages expressed by privateindividuals," and courts must "apply the most exactingscrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, orimpose differential burdens upon speech because of itscontent."  Id. at 2458-59.  Accord Simon & Schuster v. NewYork Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 117 (1991).          The Act is such a law.  It singles out forsuppression words and images that describe or depict sexualor excretory activity in a manner deemed "indecent" or"patently offensive" for persons under 18.  Thus, the Act issubject to the most exacting First Amendment scrutiny.  Itmust be struck down unless the government demonstrates itserves a compelling interest, and that it does so "bynarrowly drawn regulations designed to serve those interestswithout unnecessarily interfering with First Amendmentfreedoms."  Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126(1989).          The Supreme Court has foreclosed any argument thatso-called "indecent" expression should be subject to a lessexacting standard of review.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  Notingthat "[s]exual expression which is indecent but not obsceneis protected by the First Amendment," the Court unanimouslyheld that an act of Congress prohibiting the transmission ofindecent messages over telephone lines for commercialpurposes was subject to, and could not survive, strictscrutiny.  Id.  This Circuit has likewise held that lawsregulating so-called "indecent" expression must receive themost exacting First Amendment scrutiny.  Fabulous Assoc.Inc., v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm., 896 F.2d 780, 784-85(3d Cir. 1990).          Strict scrutiny is amply justified because thecategory of "indecency" sweeps in vast quantities of valuable-- though often controversial or unsettling -- expression. The Act prohibits the transmission of serious works offiction or drama that treat sexual themes with any degree ofexplicitness.  It likewise prohibits constitutionallyprotected profanity, whether in robust political debate, e.g.Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971) ("Fuck the draft"),in biting social criticism, e.g. Hustler Magazine v. Falwell,485 U.S. 46, 48 (1988) (vulgar satire of religious figuredepicting "drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother inan outhouse"), or in casual, private conversations.  And theAct also encompasses works of science and medicine, or publichealth information dealing with sex.          It is precisely because such expression may beprovocative, or even offensive, that full First Amendmentprotection is necessary.  "[P]ersons who voice acceptableviewpoints or who are able to articulate their goals andinterests in terms which are either shared or accepted aslegitimate by those who shape official policy are seldom inneed of the [First] Amendment's support.  It is when we mustface the unpopular or distasteful expression that the conceptof free speech needs its most vigilant protection."  Aiellov. City of Wilmington, Del., 623 F.2d 845, 859 (3d Cir. 1980)(Sloviter, J., concurring in part); see also Abrams v. UnitedStates, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting,joined by Brandeis, J.).            Application of strict First Amendment scrutiny to"indecency" regulations poses a particular challenge becausesuch expression is simultaneously valuable (and protected)for an adult audience and potentially harmful (and thusregulable) for children.  But one thing is clear:  governmentmay not resolve this tension by simply suppressing indecentspeech altogether in order to protect children.  Indeed, itis bedrock First Amendment law that "government may not`reduce the adult population . . . to . . . only what is fitfor children.'"/*63  "The level of discourse reaching amailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would besuitable for a sandbox," and this is so "regardless of thestrength of the government's interest" in protectingchildren.  Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60,74-75 (1983) (emphasis added).  It is settled that governmentmay not constitutionally "quarantin[e] the general readingpublic against books not too rugged for grown men and womenin order to shield juvenile innocence."  Butler, 352 U.S. at383.  A federal statute is unconstitutional if it has the"effect of limiting the content of adult [communications] tothat which is suitable for children."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 131(emphasis added)./*64           Thus, in the "indecency" context it is particularlyimportant that strict scrutiny not be reduced to amechanical, formalistic inquiry into whether government'sposited interest is compelling, and its chosen means arenarrowly tailored.  Rather, strict scrutiny demands that "thebenefit gained [by a content-based restriction] must outweighthe loss of constitutionally protected rights."  Elrod v.Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 363 (1976).  Accord Burns v. County ofCambria, Pa., 971 F.2d 1015, 1021 (3d Cir. 1992), cert.denied, 506 U.S. 1081 (1993).  A reviewing court mustundertake a "balancing process," Sable, 492 U.S. at 127(Scalia, J., concurring), to determine whether the benefitsto children of a restriction on indecency are sufficient tooutweigh the loss of adults' constitutional rights.  AccordFabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 787-88.  See also Bolger 463U.S. at 73./*65  Simply put, government may not "burn thehouse to roast the pig."  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383; Sable, 492U.S. at 127.          Applying these principles, no court has ever upheldan indecency regulation that on its face, or in its practicalapplication, banned "indecency" from any medium.  In Sable, aunanimous Supreme Court struck down a ban on telephoneindecency, notwithstanding that "enterprising youngsterscould and would evade" less restrictive regulatory mechanismswhich would have better protected adults' rights.  Sable 492U.S. at 128.  In Bolger, the Court struck down a ban on mailadvertisements for contraceptives for the same reason.  463U.S. at 73.  In Butler, the Court invalidated a convictionfor distributing indecent publications for the same reason. 352 U.S. at 381.  Indecency regulations have been upheld onlywhen government has proven that the regulation will providesubstantial protection for children, while ensuring thatadults have continued access to expression that isconstitutionally protected for them.  See Ginsberg v. NewYork, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 (1968) (upholding prohibition orsale of material harmful to minors under 17 becauseprohibition did not bar sale to persons over 17).          As we will show, a straightforward application ofthese settled principles invalidates the Act, for tworeasons.  First, the burden imposed by the Act's restrictionson indecency is so severe in relation to the marginal gainsin protecting minors achieved by the law that it must bestruck down.  Second, the government cannot meet its heavyburden of proving that the Act directly advances a compellinginterest in the least restrictive way.     B.   The Challenged Provisions Of The Act Violate The          Principles Established In Butler, Bolger And Sable          That Adults Cannot Be Reduced To Reading And          Viewing Only What Is Appropriate For Children.          Like the laws struck down in Butler, Bolger, Sableand Fabulous Assoc., the Act must be invalidated because itdenies the millions of adults who use the Internet access toconstitutionally protected expression in order to ensure thatminors are not exposed to indecency.  Subsection (d) inparticular criminalizes dissemination of "indecency" on theInternet in any manner that will result in its being"available" to minors.  Almost all "indecent" communicationdisseminated on the Internet will be "available" to minorsbecause there is no feasible way for most speakers in mostformats to limit who has access to communications theydisseminate./*66          The only way for those speakers to ensurecompliance with the Act is to undertake the enormous effortand expense of maintaining either a database that allows themto screen requests for access, or individually verifyingrequesters' age each time a request is received.  Individualsand other noncommercial content providers such as librariesand universities could not possibly afford such anexpense./*67  Furthermore, even apart from their cost,such "screening" methods simply cannot work with respect toseveral ways of communicating on the Internet, includinglistservs and newsgroups./*68  Thus, the Act leaves themajority of Internet content providers with only one choice:to avoid the risk of criminal prosecution and incarceration,they must self-censor all expression that might be deemed"indecent" or "patently offensive."  This is, for allpractical purposes, a ban of "indecency" on the Internet.          The suppressive effect of this ban is trulystaggering.  As demonstrated, the Act's prohibitions sweep ina vast quantity of valuable, fully protected expression.  Andthose prohibitions apply to tens of millions of Internetusers.  Thus, the Act is entirely unlike prior indecencylaws, which targeted narrow and well-defined types of speechand particular forms of communication (such as dial-a-porn). Congress has, in effect, prohibited the public communicationof indecency.  It is as if Congress had banned indecentspeech in public parks or squares, or had banned thecirculation of publications containing indecency.  At bottom,the Act seems to contemplate an entirely restructured, indeedbifurcated, Internet -- one Internet accessible to adults,which will contain indecent materials, and an entirelyseparate Internet accessible to children, which will bescrubbed of indecent material.  It postulates an entirelyimaginary world that does not exist and cannot be created.          It is no answer that the Act provides "defenses" tocriminal prosecution for those who make good faith,reasonable efforts to block access by minors.  The plain factis that those defenses cannot be utilized by the vastmajority of speakers to whom the Act applies.  Only a smallsubset of Internet speakers  -- those who sell informationthrough credit cards or other mechanisms, or who canotherwise afford the enormous cost of screening usersrequesting access -- will have even the potential to takeadvantage of the defenses.  And the Act would severely burdenthe speech of those speakers.          Even if these "defenses" were available to mostcontent providers -- and they are not -- they would not beginto cure the Act's constitutional infirmity.  The Act does nomore than provide Internet speakers the opportunity toconvince a jury in a criminal case that they have acted"reasonably" and in "good faith" and have taken "effective"actions to prevent minors from accessing "indecent" or"patently offensive" communications.  That hardly provides ameaningful check on the risk that speakers will self-censorvaluable expression.  By their nature, these defenses provideno guidance as to the line between lawful and unlawfulexpression; they invite -- indeed they require -- ad hoc,case-by-case judgments.  "It is fictional to believe thatanything less than extensive adjudications, under the impactof a variety of factual situations, will be required toclarify their meaning."  Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360,378 (1964).  "[T]hose affected by a statute are entitled tobe free of the burdens of defending prosecutions, howeverexpeditious, aimed at hammering out the structure of thestatute piecemeal."  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 491(1965).  The Act will certainly deter would-be speakers fromdisseminating potentially indecent speech "because of doubtwhether [the defense] can be proved in court or fear of theexpense of having to do so."  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,376 U.S. 254, 279 (1964) (fear of civil liability).  Such arisk is even more chilling here because potential speakersface not merely civil liability but the stigma of criminalconviction and severe criminal sanctions.          Thus, the Act contains precisely the fatal flawthat led to invalidation of the indecency regulations atissue in Sable, Bolger, and Butler:  in an attempt topreclude minors from access to indecent speech, Congress haseffectively denied adults access to that speech as well. Upholding the Act's suppression of adult dissemination andreceipt of "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech would beunprecedented.  No court has ever held, in the context of anymedium, that a ban on the transmission of indecentcommunications to adults satisfies this exacting standard. This Court should not endorse such an unprecedented intrusionon First Amendment rights.     C.   The Act Also Violates The First Amendment Because          The Government Cannot Prove That It Materially          Advances A Compelling Interest In The Least          Restrictive Manner.          The Act also violates the First Amendmentirrespective of whether, in practical effect, it is a ban ofthe kind struck down in Sable.  There is no doubt the Actwill cause self-censorship of vast quantities of speech bythose who simply cannot bring themselves within the Act'sdefenses, and will impose heavy financial burdens on speakerswho can.  These burdens will certainly inhibit speech, andthus drastically alter the content of expression on theInternet.  Faced with the substantial cost and ongoingadministrative burdens imposed by the Act's "defenses," mostspeakers will simply choose not to communicate anythingarguably "indecent."/*69  The Supreme Court has madeclear that "[a] law is presumptively inconsistent with theFirst Amendment if it imposes a financial burden on speakersbecause of the content of their speech."  Simon & Schuster,502 U.S. at 115 (emphasis added)./*70  The governmentmust thus demonstrate a compelling need for imposing thoseburdens, and show that its interests could not be served byless drastic alternatives.  It cannot make that showing here.          In the abstract, the government has a compellinginterest in protecting minors from communications harmful totheir psychological and moral development.  The governmentcannot, however, simply "posit the existence of" a problem tobe cured; it "must demonstrate that the recited harms [herenone were recited] are real, not merely conjectural, and thatthe regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a directand material way."  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2470 (emphasisadded).  And the government also "bears the burden of showingthat the remedy it has adopted does not 'burden substantiallymore speech than is necessary to further the government'slegitimate interests.'"  Id. (quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 799).          That showing cannot be made on the basis of thelegislative record here.  Congress made no findings regardingthe provisions at issue, and compiled no empirical recorddemonstrating either their necessity or the basis for theirconstitutionality./*71  Leahy Dec.    9, 19, 28, Tab 24. Just as in Sable,/*72 Congress failed to examine howdifficult it is for minors to access the indecent materialrestricted by the Act; how many minors, and of what ages,actually have accessed such material; the likelyeffectiveness of the measures Congress adopted in preventingaccess; the impact of those measures on speech protected bythe First Amendment; the effectiveness of alternatives to thechallenged provisions; and, in general, the extent to whichthe challenged provisions will materially further Congress'goal without abridging the First Amendment rights of adults. Cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 129-30.  The novelty and complexity ofcyberspace makes the absence of careful factual inquiryparticularly egregious.  Congress appears not to haveexamined how online communications work; which types ofonline communications present a substantial risk for minors,and whether the communications about which Congress wasconcerned are primarily obscene or nonobscene, commercial ornoncommercial, text or visual images; whether the "defenses"Congress established could, as a practical matter, beutilized; the ease or difficulty with which parents cancontrol their children's online access; and the possibilitythat existing legal prohibitions suffice to address theconcerns underlying the challenged provisions.  Instead, asthe government concedes, "Congress [did] no more thanincorporate the standards for blocking access to 'dial-a-porn' messages'" (see Deft ACLU Br. at 29-30), without evenconsidering whether those standards can be grafted on to thedramatically different, infinitely more complex, onlinecomputer medium.          This failure to make a considered judgment as tothe need, efficacy, and ramifications of the law has a directimpact on this Court's examination of the Act'sconstitutionality.   Without findings, for example, the Courtcan have no clear sense of what Congress perceived as theprecise harm to be remedied or of the precise goals Congresshad in mind in enacting the challenged provisions.  Thus,there is nothing to which the government can point in therecord before Congress to meet its burden.          Furthermore, far from advancing the government'sinterest "in a direct and material way," the Act "providesonly the most limited incremental support for the interestasserted."  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.  That is so forseveral reasons.  First, there is no reason to think thegovernment's interest will be inadequately served by"vigorously enforc[ing]" laws already on the books, which banobscenity, child pornography, enticement of minors, andharassment.  Riley v. National Fed'n. of the Blind, 487 U.S.781, 800 (1988); accord FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468U.S. 364, 398 (1984) (law is not narrowly tailored ifgovernment's goal is already served by "other regulatorymeans that intrude far less drastically upon [FirstAmendment] rights"); Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens For aBetter Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 637 & n.11 (1980)(enforcement of existing laws against fraud wouldsufficiently serve purported governmental objective,therefore new law is not narrowly tailored).  The expressionprohibited by these other laws was plainly Congress' coreconcern, and that expression can be fully regulated withoutextending the Act's prohibition to "indecent" communications.          Second, there are existing methods that are farmore effective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or"patently offensive" online communications, without impedingadult access to expression that is fully protected as tothem.  Because the Internet is a global network with millionsof users, speaker-based content restrictions cannoteffectively control the availability of materials.  The onlyeffective way to protect children from inappropriate onlinematerial is through recipient-based strategies . . . byencouraging user-based tools that empower parents to controltheir children's online activities based on the parents'views of what is appropriate for their children./*73  Theproducts we have described, and others like them (seeStatement of the Case, Point D), provide parents these tools,and do so without the need for criminalizing the distributionto adults of constitutionally protected communications. These approaches are most consistent with the fundamentalprinciple of our democracy that parents are responsible forthe well-being and upbringing of their children.  "It iscardinal . . . that the custody, care and nurture of thechild reside first in the parents, whose primary function andfreedom include preparation for obligations the state canneither supply nor hinder."  Prince v. Commonwealth ofMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944).  These technologiesput the responsibility for making choices about minors'access to communications that might be deemed harmful oroffensive to them precisely "where our society hastraditionally placed it--on the shoulders of the parent." Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 788 (citing Bolger, 462 U.S. at73-74).          That these screening alternatives are not entirelyfoolproof does not diminish their value.  As the Court heldin Sable, "the desire to prevent 'a few of the mostenterprising and disobedient young people,'" from securingaccess to such messages [is not] adequate justification for astatutory provision that ha[s] 'the invalid effect oflimiting the content of adult telephone conversations to thatwhich is suitable for children.'"  Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2dat 788 (quoting Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.)  Parental discretionand control is the "preferred method of dealing with such[offensive] material."  Id. (citing Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73-74).          Even with regard to broadcast, which both the Courtand Congress have acknowledged has "a uniquely pervasivepresence in the lives of American children," Congressrecognized that parental screening and blocking technologiescan protect children from inappropriate broadcastprogramming, including "sexual video programming" or other"indecent material," without a government ban on content. See Act,   551.  There, Congress required manufacturers toinstall a so-called "V-Chip" in televisions to allow readingof a rating system that will enable parents "easily to blockviolent, sexual or other programming that they believeharmful to their children," and authorized the FCC to developa recommended rating system.  Id.  Plaintiffs are notsuggesting that particular provision is constitutional.  Butin view of the fact that Congress contemporaneouslydetermined that parental empowerment technologies would be anadequate and "narrowly tailored means" to protect childreneven from broadcast indecency, id., the government cannotpossibly carry its burden of showing why parental empowermenttechnologies would not be adequate to protect children fromindecency in cyberspace.           Third, even if government had a compelling interestin banning indecent (but not obscene) visual images from theInternet -- and no such showing has been made -- the Act goesmuch farther, and needlessly embraces messages and filescontaining nothing but (electronically) written words.  Thesponsor of the Act used as his principal justification forthe Act a compilation of graphic sexually oriented visualimages.  But the Act is not so focused.  In covering a broadrange of purely "textual" indecency, the Act is apparentlyunique among indecency laws.  Indeed, even in the obscenitycontext, there have been few, if any, prosecutions in thelast four decades for distributing purely written material. See Final Report, Attorney General's Commission onPornography at 84 (1986).  Notwithstanding the attenuatedrelationship between written words and the concernsunderlying the Act's indecency provisions, the Act'sinclusion of written words accounts for a large portion ofthe protected speech that is prohibited, restricted orchilled by the Act's sweeping restrictions.          Fourth, at least in part because Congress did notcollect information about how online communications work andonly haphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, theAct does not accomplish or even significantly further theostensible goal of limiting access by persons under 18 to"indecent" or "patently offensive" images.  A high percentageof sexual content on the Internet originates outside of theUnited States, and it is not possible to prevent that contentfrom being "available" in the United States by imposing asource ban.  Foreign content providers may not know of, orcare about, the Act's prohibitions, and the legal andpractical ability of the U.S. Department of Justice toenforce the Act outside the United States is questionable. As to the most egregious materials -- obscenity and childpornography -- those posting such materials online arealready violating other criminal laws, and it is unlikely the"indecency" prohibitions will deter them any more.          All this boils down to a simple conclusion:  theinfringement on First Amendment rights imposed by the Act faroutweighs any marginal advancement of the government'slegitimate interest.  See Elrod, 427 U.S. at 361, 363.  As inBolger, "a restriction of this scope is more extensive thanthe Constitution permits."  463 U.S. at 73.II.  THE ACT IS SUBSTANTIALLY AND FATALLY OVERBROAD.     A.   The Subsection (d) "Display" Prohibition Is Grossly          Overbroad Because, in Nearly Every Application, It          Bans or  Severely Burdens Speech That Is          Constitutionally Protected for Adults.       As explained in Point I, the challenged provisions ofthe Act cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  Those provisionseffectively ban a broad category of speech that isconstitutionally protected for adults, because there is nopractical way of communicating that speech via cyberspace toadults without also making it "available to" persons under18, in violation of the subsection (d) "display" provision,and because the means of segregating "adult" materialscontemplated in the Act's defenses are simply impossible formost content providers and online services.  Where thesubsection (e)(5) defenses for providers could be implementedat all, those measures would substantially burden protectedspeech by, among other things, making it practicallyimpossible for adult users to explore areas of the Internetcontaining constitutionally protected material (and henceimpossible for content providers to reach an otherwisewilling adult audience).          In many and perhaps most cases, the combination ofthe Act's broad "display" prohibition and the infeasibilityof the statutory defenses will result in the complete removalof constitutionally protected material fromcyberspace./*74  In the comparatively few cases in whichadult access codes or similar measures might be feasible, thestatute will result in many adult users' having reducedaccess to material they would otherwise have had the abilityand desire to see.          A statute that restricts this much protected speechis, among other constitutional defects, substantiallyoverbroad.  "Far from providing the `breathing space' that`First Amendment freedoms need . . . to survive,'" City ofHouston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 466 (1987) (quoting NAACP v.Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)), the Act indiscriminatelystifles protected speech.  Like the laws that were struckdown as overbroad in Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angelesv. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.S. 569 (1987) (invalidatingordinance banning "First Amendment activity" within airport),and Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 (1981) (striking downban on all live entertainment within town as overbroad), thesubsection (d) "display" prohibition is invalid on its face.          This case differs from the standard overbreadthchallenge, but for reasons that make it unusually obviousthat the Act is unconstitutional.  In most overbreadth cases,the court must balance the constitutionally permissibleapplications of the statute against the impermissible ones,in order to judge whether the claimed "`overbreadth [is] notonly [] real, but substantial as well, judged in relation tothe statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'" Massachusetts v.Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 595 (1989) (quoting Broadrick v.Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973)).   Here, it is a strikingunderstatement to say that subsection (d) reaches a"substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,"City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. at 458 (quoting HoffmanEstates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489,494 (1982) and Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 359 n.8(1983)), for all the speech the provision covers isconstitutionally protected for adults./*75  The Act isnot only "susceptible of regular application to protectedexpression," Hill, 482 U.S. at 467 (emphasis added); it iscertain to be so applied.  A fortiori, it is fatallyoverbroad, and therefore "facially invalid."  Id./*76     B.   The Act Is Also Overbroad Because It Prohibits          Speech to All Persons Under 18 Years of Age on the          Basis of What Is Inappropriate for Young Children          The Act is also substantially overbroad because itbans and restricts speech that is sent or made "available" topersons under 18, see 47 U.S.C.   223(a)(1)(B), (d)(1),without accounting in any way for relevant differences amongthe different age groups within the prohibited under-18class.  Rather than acknowledging the vast intellectual andemotional differences between seven-year-olds and seventeen-year-olds, the Act erects a total prohibition based on what"community standards" deem inappropriate for very youngchildren.  The constitutional defect in this "one-size-fits-all" prohibition is particularly pronounced because of theabsence in the Act of any exemption for material with seriousliterary, political, scientific, or other educationalvalue./*77  Because a great deal of material that mightbe deemed objectionable for young children would nonethelessbe appropriate (indeed, highly valuable) for olderminors,/*78 the Act's procrustean age restrictions aresubstantially overbroad.  Just as the Act indiscriminatelybans speech appropriate for adults in the name of protectingchildren, it also bans speech appropriate for high schoolseniors and college freshmen in the name of protectingelementary schoolchildren./*79  This prohibition mostpalpably infringes the First Amendment rights of olderminors, but it also infringes the rights of persons who wouldotherwise communicate with them via the Internet./*80                  This is not a statute dealing with a narrow type of"adult" speech (such as the "dial-a-porn" services at issuein Sable)./*81  Such material is arguably harmful for allminors (albeit perhaps more harmful for young children thanfor teenagers).  But the open-endedness of the Act'sprohibitions of "indecent" and "patently offensive" material,combined with the immense diversity of material on theInternet, ensure that the Act applies to a great deal ofmaterial that is arguably harmful for 7-year-olds but is noteven arguably harmful for 17-year-olds.             Courts interpreting state harmful to minorsstatutes have recognized the inappropriateness of banningmaterial for all minors merely because it is deemed harmfulfor younger minors.  In American Booksellers v. Webb, 919F.2d 1493, 1504 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 942(1991), the court of appeals construed a Georgia statuterestricting the display of books that on its face made nodistinctions among different age groups, to apply only tomaterial that lacked value for older minors.  The courtconcluded that "if any reasonable minor, including aseventeen-year-old, would find serious value," the materialwas not "`harmful to minors'" for purposes of the statute.Id. at 1504-05; see also American Booksellers Ass'n v.Virginia, 882 F.2d at 127 ("`[I]f a work is found to haveserious literary, artistic, political or scientific value fora legitimate minority of normal, older adolescents, then itcannot be said to lack such value for the entire class ofjuveniles taken as a whole.'") (quoting Commonwealth v.American Booksellers Ass'n, 236 Va. 168, 372 S.E.2d 618, 624(1988)).  Congress's failure here to account for relevantdistinctions among minors of different ages--a defect that,because Internet usage by older minors is much greater thanby younger minors, mars the Act in a high proportion of itspotential applications -- renders the Act substantiallyoverbroad. III. THE SWEEPING PROHIBITION OF PROTECTED SPEECH ON THE     INTERNET CANNOT BE SAVED BY ANALOGY TO CASES IN WHICH     COURTS HAVE UPHELD LIMITED INDECENCY RESTRICTIONS SHORT     OF A BAN, OR BY INVOKING THE STANDARDS OF FIRST     AMENDMENT REVIEW GOVERNING BROADCAST MEDIA.          As demonstrated in Point I, the Act plainly failsstrict scrutiny.  The government, however, has sought todefend the Act as nothing more than a simple extension ofnarrow indecency restrictions courts have approved to othermedia, and perhaps as sustainable under the more relaxedFirst Amendment standard applied to the broadcast medium inFCC v. Pacifica.  See Deft ACLU Br. at 20-22, 26-27, 30-39. These arguments fail because the Act's restrictions differdispositively from the indecency restrictions at issue inprior cases, and the Pacifica standard has no application tocontent regulation of interactive computer services.     A.   Judicial Decisions Upholding Narrow Indecency          Restriction for "Dial-a-Porn," Broadcast Media,          and Leased Access Cable Television--None of Which          Involved a Total Ban--Are Entirely Inapposite.          The decisions cited by the government upholdingindecency restrictions for dial-a-porn, leased access cabletelevision, and the broadcast media, provide no support forthe Act.  None of those cases approved an effective ban onindecent speech.  In Pacifica, the Court affirmed anadministrative sanction against the broadcaster of "indecent"language imposed pursuant to an FCC rule that was not "`anabsolute prohibition'" on use of such language, but "'rathersought to channel it to times of day when children mostlikely would not be exposed to it.'" Pacifica, 438 U.S. at733 (quoting 59 F.C.C.2d 892 (1976)).  See Sable, 492 U.S. at127 (observing that Pacifica did not involve a ban); see alsoAction for Children's Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654, 666(D.C. Cir. 1995) (en banc) (by allowing indecent material tobe broadcast during nighttime hours, Congress had adequately"taken into account the First Amendment rights of the verylarge numbers of adults who wish to view or listen toindecent broadcasts").   Similarly, the post-Sable dial-a-porn restrictions upheld in Dial Information Services Corp.v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied,502 U.S. 1072 (1992), and Information Providers Coalition v.FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991), do not ban indecent speechto adults; they simply require providers to restrict theirservices to adults who request access.  See also Alliance forCommunity Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995)(upholding similar requirement for cable leased accessprogramming), cert. granted, 116 S.Ct. 471 (1995).            Thus, none of the cases on which the governmentrelies implicated the core First Amendment principle the Actcontravenes:  the government may not ban speech that isprotected for adults in the name of keeping it away fromchildren.  Instead, these decisions hold that government mayimpose carefully crafted measures to protect children fromexposure to indecent speech, provided those measures do notban or unduly burden adult access to that speech./*82            Although the Act contains a gesture towards theFirst Amendment by including the subsection (e)(5) defenses,those defenses are impossible to implement in many importantareas of online communications.  Even where some of thedefenses might be implemented, they will substantially burdenand dramatically restrict the availability to adults ofconstitutionally protected material.  In the case ofbroadcast, dial-a-porn, and cable television, the relativelysmall number of service providers all indisputably had thecapacity to comply with the indecency restrictions at issuewithout also blocking adults from receiving desiredcommunications.  See, e.g., Fabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 787-88.  As shown above, that approach does not work incyberspace.  The fact that, as the government observes, theAct's defenses would in theory operate something like thedial-a-porn blocking mechanisms does not change the factthat, given the realities of the Internet, the Act is "[i]neffect" a ban.  See Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n,484 U.S. 383, 389 (1988)(citing Bolger and Butler).  For thisreason, the Act's broad prohibitions are unconstitutional forthe same reason the commercial dial-a-porn ban at issue inSable was unconstitutional.          B.   The Unique First Amendment Standards Governing               the Broadcast Media Do Not Apply to               Cyberspace.          Without seriously disputing that the Act's content-based prohibitions require strict First Amendment scrutiny,the government nonetheless suggests that the Internet shouldbe governed by an unspecified but comparatively relaxedstandard of First Amendment review similar to the standardPacifica adopted for FCC regulation of broadcast indecency. Deft ACLU Br. at 22-23, 26.  In Pacifica, the Court upheldthe FCC's administrative reprimand of a radio station thataired a satiric monologue entitled "Filthy Words" at twoo'clock in the afternoon. The Court based its holding on the"uniquely pervasive" quality of broadcast which, like an"intruder," "confronts the citizen," who cannot protecthimself from "unexpected program content" because he is"constantly tuning in and out," and because of the "uniquelyaccessible" nature of broadcasting to children.  Pacifica,438 U.S. at 748-50.  In contrast to a "written message" suchas the "Fuck the Draft" jacket in Cohen v. California, 403U.S. 15 (1971), the monologue as broadcast "could haveenlarged a child's vocabulary in an instant."  Pacifica, 438U.S. at 749.  This ease of access even to very young childrenjustified a degree of restriction on indecent broadcastexpression not permitted on "[o]ther forms of offensiveexpression" such as books and motions pictures, which "may bewithheld from the young without restricting the expression atits source."  Id.  The Pacifica Court "emphasize[d] thenarrowness of [its] holding," noting, among otherqualifications, that the Constitution might preclude a"criminal prosecution" even for broadcasting the "FilthyWords" monologue, and that different considerations mightapply in the case of a "two-way radio conversation between acab driver and a dispatcher, or a telecast of an Elizabethancomedy."  Id. at 750./*83           In the 18 years since Pacifica was decided, theSupreme Court has declined repeated invitations to extend therelaxed broadcast standard to any other media.   In Bolger,the Court invalidated a ban on mailing unsolicitedcontraceptive advertisements, distinguishing Pacifica on theground that "[t]he receipt of mail is far less intrusive anduncontrollable" than broadcast.  Id. at 74.  Bolgeremphasized that "[t]he First Amendment `does not permit thegovernment to prohibit speech as intrusive unless the"captive" audience cannot avoid objectionable speech.'"  Id.at 72 (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public ServiceComm'n, 447 U.S. 530, 542 (1980)).  See also Erznoznik, 422U.S. at 209; Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 86-87 (1949).           In Sable, the Court held that the Pacificarationale should not be extended to commercial telephonecommunications, noting that Pacifica "relied on the `unique'attributes of broadcasting."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 127 (quotingPacifica).  The Court observed that in contrast to "means ofexpression which the recipient has no meaningful opportunityto avoid, the [telephone] medium requires the listener totake affirmative steps to receive the communication."  Id. at127-28.  Unlike broadcasting, "dial-a-porn" communicationsdid not present a captive audience problem:  "the messagereceived by one who places a call to a dial-a-porn service isnot so invasive or surprising that it prevents an unwillinglistener from avoiding exposure to it."  Id. at 128; see alsoFabulous Assoc., 896 F.2d at 784.  Even more recently, theCourt firmly and unanimously declined to extend thecomparatively lenient First Amendment standards governingbroadcasting to cable television.  See Turner, 114 S. Ct. at2456-57.          As with other media that have been asserted toresemble broadcast in relevant respects, see, e.g., Turner,114 S.Ct. at 2457, it is possible to argue that some aspectsof online communication resemble some aspects ofbroadcasting.  See Deft ACLU Br. at 26.  But a comprehensiveappraisal of the technical capabilities and communicativepossibilities of cyberspace demonstrates that in relevantrespects cyberspace is not like radio or broadcasttelevision.  The marked differences between the Internet andthe broadcast media, coupled with the Supreme Court'ssteadfast unwillingness to extend the "sliding scale"approach to reviewing content regulation of any other non-broadcast media, leave no doubt that pleas to extend Pacificato cyberspace should be rejected.            First, the Internet is emphatically not a medium onwhich individuals lack the power to choose the communicationsthey wish to receive or to protect themselves or theirchildren from unwanted or unexpected speech.  ComparePacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-51.  To the contrary, recipients ofonline communications enjoy a degree of individual controlover incoming material that is attainable in few, if any,other media.  With the exception of point-to-point e-mail, noinformation travels online to a particular individual unlessthe individual requests it./*84  Listservs, newsgroups,chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the World Wide Web allrequire an affirmative request by the online user prior tothe user receiving information on his or her computerscreen./*85  Furthermore, when a user makes such anaffirmative request it is usually clear what type of contentwill be delivered.  The online medium offers users theability to exercise control over precisely what informationthey access.  Thus, unlike radio or television, and even moreso than with telephone, there is no significant risk that auser will be assaulted with totally unsolicited and undesiredcontent.  The expression does not intrude upon the recipient;rather, to an even greater extent than telephone, incyberspace a recipient must "take affirmative steps toreceive the communication."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 127-28.          Second, online communications require a level ofsophistication that militates against fashioning a special,lenient standard of review.  Unlike radio and television,online communications are not easily accessible to very youngchildren.  At a minimum, recipients need to be able to readin order to execute the commands necessary to accesscommunications.  Cf. Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 749-50.  Moreover,parents can control their children's access to onlineexpression through a variety of means, including the manyuser-end screening options discussed above.  Given the fargreater degree of user control relative to broadcast, andgiven the relative lack of accessibility to young children,here, as in Bolger, there is no justification for regulatingonline expression "at its source."  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at749.          Third, unlike broadcasting, cyberspace presents noproblem of scarcity./*86  To the contrary, one of itsmost valuable features is open accessibility to millions ofnew users at low cost.  Cyberspace is not a physical ortangible entity.  It is a giant network which interconnectsinnumerable groups of linked computer networks and personalcomputers used by individuals.  Accordingly, there is no needfor government regulation to allow speakers to be heard or toensure diversity.  Compare, e.g., Turner, 114 S.Ct. at 2456-57.  Indeed, these important policy goals are imperilled, notfurthered, by content regulation such as that imposed by theAct./*87          In short, cyberspace does not share the "unique"characteristics of broadcast media that have been thought tojustify greater-than-usual tolerance for content regulation.     C.   The Internet's Unmatched Capacity for Furthering          the Core Policies of the First Amendment Requires          That This Court Apply the Rigorous Standards of          Scrutiny Normally Applicable to Content-Based          Restrictions.          The Supreme Court has frequently observed that,although "the basic principles of freedom of speech and thepress . . . do not vary," each medium of communicationpresents "its own peculiar problems" for purposes of FirstAmendment analysis.  Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S.495, 503 (1952) (motion pictures).  See also, e.g., Turner,114 S.Ct. at 2456-57, 2466 (cable TV); SoutheasternPromotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557 (1975) (liveentertainment).  This observation was critical to the Court'sapproval of relatively lenient First Amendment standards forbroadcasting in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. at386-87.  But the Court's attention to the uniquecharacteristics of certain media has often led it to reaffirmthe importance of adhering to the usual rule of rigorousreview of speech restrictions. E.g., City of Ladue v. Gilleo,114 S. Ct. 2038, 2046 (1994) (observing, in the course ofstriking down an assumedly content-neutral prohibition, that"[r]esidential signs are an unusually cheap and convenientform of communication," "[e]specially for persons of modestmeans or limited mobility"); Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S.141, 146 (1943) ("[d]oor to door distribution of circulars isessential to the poorly financed causes of little people").          Acknowledgement of the already enormous and rapidlygrowing social importance of interactive computer servicesrequires a similar response here.  Indeed, cyberspace'sunique and revolutionary capability to facilitate ordinarycitizens' ability to communicate and learn is a major reasonwhy online communications should receive the highest level ofFirst Amendment protection./*88           The Free Speech and Press Clauses are based on thesimple but important belief "that the ultimate good desiredis better reached by free trade in ideas."  Abrams v. UnitedStates, 250 U.S. at 630 (Holmes, J., dissenting, joined byBrandeis, J.).  See Turner, 114 S.Ct. at 2458.  Cyberspacehas the capacity to further this fundamental constitutionalcommitment more effectively than any previous medium ofcommunication.  By means unforeseeable to the FirstAmendment's authors, cyberspace offers individual citizensunprecedented opportunities to enjoy in a direct, personalway the freedoms of "speech," "press," "assembl[y]," and"petition."  The Internet makes speaking and listening to awide variety of others cheaper and easier than ever before. Through cyberspace, an individual citizen from her keyboardcan reach more people than can any conventional newspaper. Thousands of new personal, professional, political andavocational associations are forged on the Internet everyday, many of which link people who would never have hadopportunities to communicate before./*89  Manypoliticians in the United States have already establishedonline links with their constituents, and the process is sureto continue./*90  Cyberspace has already eliminatedwealth or political power as the prerequisites to masscommunications, and the implications of this historicdevelopment will be felt for decades.  See generally OwenFiss, "Symposium:  In Search of a New Paradigm," 104 YaleL.J. 1613 (1995).  Cyberspace is truly a global electronicmarketplace of ideas.           Because access is so inexpensive and easy,virtually everyone in the United States has or soon will haveaccess to the Internet and other interactive computerservices, making this, by far, the most democratic means ofcommunication ever devised./*91  All that is needed to"enter" cyberspace is a computer, a "modem" or otherconnection, and simple software.  For a relatively modestinvestment--far less than the cost of purchasing a printingpress, newspaper, broadcast station, or cable system --individuals can make their message available to more peoplethan they could reach if they owned the printing press,newspaper, broadcast station, or cable system.  They canelectronically communicate their messages to thousands in afraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost requiredto leaflet a single city block.  It is not even necessary toown a computer to have regular and meaningful access to theInternet./*92  Persons of very modest means now have theability both to send and to receive information on a scalethat until now would have been unattainable even for thewealthy.          The Internet has given citizens of modest meanspower even William Randolph Hearst would have envied.  Thenew interactive computer medium has the power to democratizeand diversify the marketplace of ideas.  As Congress found,"[t]he Internet and other interactive computer services offera forum for a true diversity of political discourse, uniqueopportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenuesfor intellectual activity."  Act,   509.  More so than anyother medium, the interactive computer medium "today standsat the center of an ongoing telecommunications revolutionwith still undefined potential to affect the way wecommunicate and develop our intellectual resources."  Turner,114 S.Ct. at 2451.  It serves the interests protected andfostered by the First Amendment like no other medium.  FirstAmendment analysis must respect its awesome potential.            In sum, this Court should accord to the interactivecomputer medium the most vigilant protection from governmentcensorship and overreaching.  The unparalleled potential ofcyberspace to effectuate the core policies of the FirstAmendment calls for a reaffirmance of our "profound nationalcommitment" to public discourse that is "uninhibited, robust,and wide-open."  New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 270.           The challenged provisions of the Act, however,represent an indiscriminate and damaging retreat from thatcommitment, one that reflects an as-yet poor legislativeunderstanding even of the basic operating methods ofcyberspace.  Those provisions are facially invalid becausethey abridge far too much protected speech while affordinglittle incremental protection for minors, and threaten todisrupt the rapidly unfolding development of a salutarycommunications revolution that until now has flourished witha minimum of governmental interference.  IV.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIM THAT THE     ACT IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE.          Even if the Act could otherwise surviveconstitutional scrutiny under the First Amendment -- and itcannot -- this Court should nevertheless enjoin itsenforcement because it is unconstitutionally vague under theFifth Amendment.  "No one may be required at peril of life,liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penalstatutes.  All are entitled to be informed as to what theState commands or forbids."  Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378U.S. 347, 351 (1964) (quotations omitted).  The Due ProcessClause of the Fifth Amendment "requires that a penal statutedefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness thatordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited andin a manner that does not encourage arbitrary anddiscriminatory enforcement."  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.352, 357 (1983) (holding criminal statute facially invalid asunconstitutionally vague)./*93   And where -- as here --the enactment threatens expression protected by the FirstAmendment, the enactment must provide more notice and allowless discretion than for other activities.  "Where astatute's literal scope . . . is capable of reachingexpression sheltered by the First Amendment, the doctrinedemands a greater degree of specificity than in othercontexts."  Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 573 (1974).  Theparticular evil of vague criminal prohibitions applied toexpressive activity is that the uncertainty causesindividuals to "steer far wider of the unlawful zone,"Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526 (1958), than if theboundaries were "clearly marked."  Baggett v. Bullit, 377U.S. 360, 371 (1964).  "Free speech may not be so inhibited." Id. (citing cases)./*94          The Act is unconstitutionally vague in at least twofundamental respects.  First, no ordinary person coulddetermine with reasonable certainty which communicationsCongress sought to proscribe in the Act.  The terms"indecent" and "patently offensive as measured bycontemporary community standards" are hopelesslyvague./*95  Second, the defenses established by the Act,especially as applied to content providers who do not chargefor access to their speech and those who host Web pages andother online sites, are also fatally vague.  Plaintiffs,their members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customersare forced to guess at whether their online expressiveactivities may give rise to criminal prosecution.  These law-abiding citizens take the duty to obey the law, and theprospect of criminal penalties, seriously.  They will self-censor a great deal of protected speech in order to avoidpotential criminal prosecution.  The Act thus impermissiblychills constitutionally protected expression.     A.   The Terms "Indecent" and "Patently Offensive As          Measured By Contemporary Community Standards" Are          Unconstitutionally Vague.          Both "indecent" and "patently offensive" areentirely subjective terms; there is therefore no objectiveyardstick for measuring the boundaries of the Act'sproscriptions./*96  As the Supreme Court observed instriking down a California statute that outlawed "offensiveconduct" as applied to an individual who wore a jacketdisplaying the words "Fuck the Draft":          How is one to distinguish this from any other          offensive word?  Surely the State has no right to          cleanse public debate to the point where it is          grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among          us.  Yet no readily ascertainable general principle          exists for stopping short of that result were we to          affirm the judgment below.  For, while the          particular four-letter word being litigated here is          perhaps more distasteful than most others of its          genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man's          vulgarity is another's lyric.  Indeed, we think it          is largely because governmental officials cannot          make principled distinctions in this area that the          Constitution leaves matters of taste and style so          largely to the individual.Cohen, 403 U.S. at 25 (emphasis added).  The governmentmaintains that the Act's only design is to control children'saccess to "what is colloquially referred to as pornography." Deft ACLU Br. at 21.  That design certainly cannot be gleanedfrom the text of the Act, or from its legislative history. Congress expressly stated that it intended to adopt the FCC"patently offensive" standard applied in Pacifica to censureGeorge Carlin's "Seven Dirty Words" monologue.  Conf. Rep. at188-89.  Although that monologue could be described as"'vulgar,' 'offensive,' and 'shocking,'" Pacifica, 438 U.S.at 747, it could not be described as "pornography."  Theobvious disconnect between the government's attempt todescribe the Act as applying only to "pornography," on theone hand, and the much broader text of the Act and Congress'smuch broader explanation of its understanding, highlights thefatal vagueness of the key statutory terms.          Even if a person of "common intelligence" couldreasonably discern what Congress meant by "indecent" and"patently offensive" in the abstract, that understanding isof little use because "indecency is largely a function ofcontext," Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 742, and the "patentlyoffensive" standard of   233(d)(1)(B), by its terms, demandsthat offensiveness be judged "in context."/*97  Thecontext is, in turn, a function of the medium.  See Pacifica,438 U.S. at 748; Sable, 492 U.S. at 127-28.  Congress clearlyunderstood and intended to adopt this principle inestablishing those standards, noting that the meaning ofindecency may vary "depending on the communications medium towhich it has been applied."  Conf. Report at 188.          But the Act provides no guidance as to whether aparticular communication is "indecent" or "patentlyoffensive" in the "context" of the online computer medium. The Internet bears no resemblance to broadcast television ortelephone communications -- the only other contexts in whichthe FCC has applied the terms./*98  The online medium isnot thrust upon unwilling listeners, as with broadcast. Moreover, the immensely broad and diverse range ofcommunications available over the online medium is totallydifferent from other mediums.  In addition, there is nobottleneck control over content and no significant barrier toentry into the marketplace of ideas, and unlike broadcast,cable and telephone, the online computer medium has beenvirtually unregulated.  As a result, what might be viewed as"intolerable" in other mediums could well be viewed astolerable in the cyberspace medium.  Cf. Pacifica, 438 U.S.at 747 (noting that "[w]ords that are commonplace in onesetting are shocking in another").  However, the cyberspacemedium is so new, the average person cannot know theboundaries of what will or will not be deemed "indecent" or"patently offensive" in this new medium.          Making the "patent offensiveness" of thecommunication depend upon "contemporary community standards"exacerbates the vagueness of this critical statutory term. Both of the FCC tests from which the Act's language wasborrowed expressly tied the community standard to the mediumat issue.  Although the legislative history states thatCongress intended for the Act to incorporate those tests, thetext of the Act (unlike the text of the FCC tests for thoseother mediums) does not expressly tie the community standardto the cyberspace medium, leaving the ordinary person toguess as to what standards of "offensiveness" will be applied-- what is tolerated and deemed appropriate in the"cyberspace community" or in the community at large?/*99          Even if an ordinary person could determine whetherthe "cyberspace community" or the larger community'sstandards would govern, the statutory text fails to specifywhich geographic aspect of that community is relevant.  Inthe "obscenity" context, it is settled that the relevantcommunity is the local community in which the jury sits. See, e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974)(obscenity); United States v. Thomas, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS1069 (6th Cir. Jan. 29, 1996) (obscenity in computercontext).  See also, e.g., American Booksellers v. Webb, 919F.2d 1493 (11th Cir. 1990) (state "harmful to minors"statute).  The Act uses the terms "obscene" and "indecent" inthe same prohibitory clause, which would lead an ordinaryperson to understand that the same community standard appliedto both terms. See   223(a)(1)(B).  But the Conference Reportexpressly states that the Act is "intended to establish auniform national standard of content regulation."  Conf.Report at 191 (emphasis added).  This apparent inconsistencybetween text and current caselaw, on the one hand, andlegislative history on the other, alone creates a fatalambiguity in the Act: how can a reasonable person be expectedto determine which community standard, local or national,will apply when judging the appropriateness of thecommunications he or she is disseminating?          Furthermore, even if it could be determined whetherCongress intended a "local" or "national" standard, eitherapproach would involve ambiguities, when applied to this newmedium, that would make it impossible for "ordinary people[to] understand what conduct is prohibited."  Kolender, 461U.S. at 357.  If a local community standard applies, it isimpossible for the vast majority of online speakers todetermine what standard will govern the lawfulness of theirspeech because they do not know, and cannot control, whoreceives the speech or the geographical location it reaches. Communications posted anywhere on the Internet are availablethroughout the United States.  A speaker cannot possibly haveknowledge (or reason to know) the local standards ofoffensiveness in each of the local communities in which hisor her speech will be available.  Unlike in Sable, where theCourt found that dial-a-porn services could limit theirmessages to the communities they chose to serve, 492 U.S. at125, local community standards imposed on computer onlinecommunications would "place message senders in a 'doublebind' by compelling them to tailor all their messages to theleast tolerant community."  Id. at 124./*100  Cf.Thomas, supra, at *23-*26 (leaving open question whetherFirst Amendment requires new definition of "community" incontext of obscenity prosecution involving computertransmissions).           If, on the other hand, Congress intended to apply a"national" community standard -- a standard nowhere indicatedin the text of the Act -- it would be impossible for anyspeaker to determine with reasonable certainty what thatstandard is.  The FCC, in interpreting and applying indecencyin the broadcast medium according to a "nonlocal" standard,has stated that its definition of indecency "does not addressa particular geographic area, but relies instead on theexpertise of Commissioners drawing on their knowledge of theviews of the average viewer or listener as well as theirgeneral expertise in broadcast matters."  In re SagittariusBroadcasting Corp., 7 F.C.C.R. at 6876.  There is no"expertise" that can be brought to bear here; the FCC has noenforcement authority, so even if it could develop a commonand consistent view of "offensiveness" in the nationalcyberspace community, it would not, even over time, providemeaningful guidelines for speakers.  The Act will be enforcedon an ad hoc basis by prosecutors and juries throughout thecountry.  It is difficult to comprehend how a local jurycould meaningfully apply a "national community" standard of"offensiveness," or how speakers could know what local juriesmight deem "patently offensive" nationally.           Congress created more confusion with regard toanother fundamental issue -- scienter.  The Conference Reportsuggests that Congress understood the "patently offensivenessinquiry" to require "the intention to be patently offensive." Conf. Report at 189 (emphasis added).  But it is entirelyunclear what that "intention" would entail, since much of thematerial Congress sought to suppress is certainly notintended to offend the viewer, but rather to titillate.  Nosuch scienter requirement is found in the text of the Act orin the FCC standard Congress adopted.  Again, a speaker isleft to guess whether an "intent" requirement is or is notsub silentio imbedded in the statutory terms, and whatexactly that requirement might be.  This also creates aserious problem for plaintiffs and other speakers./*101          The inevitable result of these ambiguities,particularly given the severe criminal penalties for a wrongguess, is that speakers will "steer far wider of the unlawfulzone," Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. at 526, and muchconstitutionally protected expression will be suppressed.          The uncertainty of the coverage of the Act, and itsattendant chilling effect, is forcefully evidenced in theaccompanying declarations.  The declarants -- libraries,booksellers, publishers, universities, writers, editors andother content providers -- post material of serious artistic,literary, scientific, educational and informational value. The declarants provide information about medical, literary,artistic, cultural, political and scientific issues.  Giventhe ambiguity in the Act, the University of PennsylvaniaLibraries risks criminal prosecution for posting academicmaterial directly related, and essential, to courses inabnormal psychology, sexuality, history and literature./*102 The Fort Vancouver Regional Library in Washington State fearsprosecution for providing patrons access to full textarticles in such mainstream publications asCosmopolitan./*103  Booksellers throughout the country whooffer links to the World Wide Web site of Random House and anexcerpt from the national best-seller, Primary Colors, facecriminal prosecution./*104  Members of the HealthSciences Libraries Consortium fear criminal prosecution forproviding detailed, comprehensive information about the AIDSvirus./*105  Public interest groups such as Media AccessProject and Center for Democracy and Technology cannot postinformation educating the public about their mission withoutrisk of prosecution./*106  If the Act is not enjoined,these materials may have to be removed from the Internet.           Contrary to the government's suggestion, andCongress' apparent belief, see Conf. Report at 189, theSupreme Court has never upheld the term "indecency" or thephrase "patently offensive as measured by contemporarycommunity standards" against a vagueness attack.  Thatquestion was not addressed in either Pacifica or Sable, thetwo cases relied upon by the government.  In Sable, the Courtstruck down Congress's ban on indecent dial-a-porn telephonecommunications on First Amendment grounds, without intimatingany view on the constitutionality of the standard applied bythe FCC under the Fifth Amendment.  492 U.S. at 131.  Whetherthat standard was vague was irrelevant to its determination.          Nor did the Court uphold the "indecency" standardagainst a vagueness challenge in Pacifica.  The Courtstressed that it was examining only "whether the [FCC] hasthe authority to proscribe this particular broadcast."  438U.S. at 742 (emphasis added).  The Court ruled only as to thelegitimacy of the FCC's determination of the "indecency" ofthat single broadcast, not the legitimacy of the standard ingeneral.  Thus, the Court declined to address the plaintiff'sFirst Amendment overbreadth argument.  Id. at 743.            Even if the Court's ruling in Pacifica were misreadas having ruled that the FCC broadcast indecency standard isnot vague, the decision would not govern here.  As the Courtrepeatedly stressed, the indecency standard before the Courtapplied solely to the broadcast medium, a medium with"unique" characteristics.  Id. at 749, 750.  The Court's viewof the agency's construction of that term thus has norelevance to an uninterpreted, unguided use of the term asapplied to an entirely different medium.  More importantly,the Pacifica Court expressly disavowed any suggestion thatits ruling would apply in the context of a criminal sanction. 438 U.S. at 750.  To the contrary, the Court has consistentlyheld that, "where a statute imposes criminal penalties, thestandard of certainty is higher."  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358n.8.  Accord, e.g., Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 515(1948) ("The standards of certainty in statutes punishing foroffenses is higher than in those depending primarily uponcivil sanction for enforcement.").  Thus, even if Pacificacould be understood to rule that the indecency standard isnot vague in the civil context -- which it cannot -- thatholding would not apply in this criminal context.          The government's defense of "indecent" and"patently offensive by contemporary community standards"essentially boils down to an admonition that plaintiffsshould trust government prosecutors.  It is precisely forthis reason that the Act is unconstitutionally vague: theFifth Amendment protects speakers from being subjected to theunguided discretion of criminal prosecutors.  The Act doesnot provide explicit standards for enforcement authorities,and the ambiguity of the critical terms "encourages arbitraryand erratic arrests and convictions."  Papachristou v.Jacksonville, 405 U.S. at 162.  Local prosecutors are free todefine the category of prohibited speech as they see fit,which would permit selective application against disfavoredspeakers. In the case of Internet communications, every localprosecutor has jurisdiction to prosecute any speaker, nomatter where that speaker is located, because of the ubiquityof the communications links.  Cf. Thomas, supra, at *16-*19. Consequently, the most aggressive prosecutor in the leasttolerant community could prosecute virtually anything on theInternet.  The Act thus "'furnishes a convenient tool forharsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prosecutingofficials, against particular groups deemed to merit theirdispleasure.'"  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. at 360 (quotingPapachristou, 405 U.S. at 170 (internal quotes omitted)). For these reasons, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on themerits of their claim that the challenged provisions of theAct are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the FifthAmendment.     B.   The Act's Defenses Are Unconstitutionally Vague.          As noted above, for content-providers who do notcharge for their speech -- the individual or library, forexample -- the verified credit card/ID defenses (47 U.S.C.  223(e)(5)(B)) are irrelevant because, as a practicalmatter, they cannot be utilized.  For these speakers, theonly possible defense is the vaguely worded "good faith"defense.  Congress has provided no guidance whatsoeverregarding what might or might not constitute "good faith,reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under thecircumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors."  Id.  223(e)(5)(A)./*107  To the contrary, while permittingthe FCC to opine as to what measures "might" satisfy thatdefense, Congress expressly and emphatically stated that theFCC's views would constitute nothing more than "evidence ofgood faith efforts."  Id.; Conf. Rep. at 190-91.  If Congressdid not anticipate that the FCC could definitively articulatemeasures that would satisfy the defense, persons "of commonintelligence must necessarily guess at [the defense's]meaning and differ as to its application."  Roberts v. UnitedStates Jaycees, 468 U.S. at 629 (internal quotation omitted). The inevitable result is that speakers who do not charge afee for access to their speech cannot have reasonableassurance that the steps they take will constitute adefense./*108  As a result of the patent ambiguities inthe Act, and the draconian penalties for a wrong guess, thesespeakers will "steer far wider of the unlawful zone," Speiserv. Randall, 357 U.S. at 526, than if the boundaries were"clearly marked."  Baggett v. Bullit, 377 U.S. at 371./*109            Even as to those defenses theoretically availableto fee-charging content-providers, there are significantambiguities.  For example, the Act establishes an absolutedefense to posting indecent material "in a manner availableto a person under 18 years of age," 47 U.S.C.   223(d)(1)(B),if the defendant "restricted access . . . by requiring use ofa verified credit card."  Id.   223(e)(5)(B).  But nowhere isthe nature of the required "verification"described./*110  Plaintiffs believe the provision mustbe construed to require no more than the type of"verification" performed by any retail store.  But plaintiffsand their members have a legitimate concern that individualprosecutors (or juries) may construe the defense to require a"verification" somehow tied to the cardholder's age (or, evenworse, to the card user's age)./*111  Such a requirementwould place an impossible burden on content providers, sincethere is no face-to-face contact between the provider and therecipient of the message and, typically, no papers or IDdocuments are exchanged.          Another implacable ambiguity in the Act arises forthose services that host Web pages or other online sites forcontent-providers, without exercising any control overcontent, but nonetheless providing the computer facility atwhich the content physically resides and from which arecipient obtains access to the content.  Online serviceproviders, such as plaintiffs AOL and Prodigy, and Internetservice providers, such as plaintiffs Netcom and OpNet, offerextensive services of this kind.  It is entirely unclearwhether such services might themselves be deemed to "display"-- in the sense of "post" -- content from the hosted Websites under   223(d)(1)(B) because the communications resideon their computers./*112  And, if they are so deemed, itis equally unclear whether such services can invoke the"access provider" defenses.  The ambiguity arises, in part,because while the services may not be considered to "solely .. . . provid[e] access or connection to or from a facility .. . not under [their] control," their role clearly "does notinclude the creation of the content of the communication."   223(e)(1).  The Conference Report indicates that the accessprovider defenses must be "construed broadly to avoid . . . aregime of vicarious liability" and are "designed to targetthe criminal penalties of new sections 223(a) and (d) atcontent providers, rather than entities that simply offergeneral access to the Internet and other online content." Conf. Rep. at 190.  But unless and until the access providerdefenses are broadly and definitively construed, theuncertainty regarding the scope of those defenses is anotherreason for preliminarily enjoining enforcement of theAct./*113V.   THE IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, THEIR MEMBERS, AND     THEIR SUBSCRIBERS, PATRONS, AND CUSTOMERS FAR OUTWEIGHS     ANY HARM TO THE GOVERNMENT IF AN INJUNCTION ISSUES, AND     THE PUBLIC INTEREST FAVORS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.            Deprivation of First Amendment freedoms, even forminimal periods of time, necessarily and always constitutesirreparable injury.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373(1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert.denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989) (quoting Elrod and noting thatthis principle is "well-established")./*114  "'[A]chilling effect on free expression'" is a such a deprivation,and is all that plaintiffs must show to establish irreparableharm.  Hohe, 868 F.2d at 73 (quoting Dombrowski v. Pfister,380 U.S. 479, 487 (1965)).  Plaintiffs, their members, andtheir subscribers, patrons, and customers regularly engage inconstitutionally protected expressive activities that theyreasonably fear subject them to criminal liability under theAct.  See, e.g., Croneberger Dec., Tab 13, Ex. B (researchstudy on Pornography located on web site of Carnegie Libraryof Pittsburgh); Hammer Dec., Tab 20, Ex. A, B (Cosmopolitanarticle summarizing research on sexual orgasms located on website of Fort Vancouver Regional Library); Krug Dec., Tab 23,Ex. C, D, E (examples of art, medical and culturalinformation located on Internet sites of libraries); MitchellDec., Tab 25, Ex. C, D (examples of articles located onInternet site of HotWired magazine); Mosher Dec., Tab 26, Ex.A, B, C, D (examples of academic materials on sexuality,psychological disorders, and history located on Internet siteof University of Pennsylvania libraries); Scorza Dec., Tab28, Ex. A, B (examples of medical information located onInternet site of Health Sciences Library Consortium); TeicherDec., Tab 33, Ex. B, C (examples of book excerpts located onInternet sites of bookstores and publishers); Wolf Dec., Tab39, Ex. B, C (examples of magazine articles on Internet siteof HotWired).  This reasonable fear of criminal liability,and the consequent threat of criminal prosecution, iscurrently chilling the exercise of their First Amendmentrights.  See, e.g., Hammer Dec.   7, Tab 20 (stating that"[b]ecause of the passage of the Communications Decency Actof 1996, the library has decided to refrain, at leasttemporarily, from making its web site available directly tothe public"); Krug Dec.   15, Tab 23 (stating that "[a]tleast one library that I am aware of has removed forty titlesfrom its card catalog in direct response to the Act");Wheaton Dec., Tab 38, Ex. A   11 ("I have now had my webspace taken away by its owner provider due to his fear oframifications of the CDA")./*115          The public has a substantial, constitutionallyprotected interest in having access to a robust, uninhibitedflow of constitutionally protected speech.  Virginia Bd. ofPharmacy v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976). This interest is severely damaged by the Act.  Although thepublic's interest in protecting children from communicationsthat would be inappropriate for them is also substantial,that interest is -- at best -- only marginally advanced bythe provisions plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin.          The damage to constitutionally protected expressionthat has already occurred, and the further damage that willoccur if defendants are not enjoined, is incalculable. Substantial quantities of constitutionally protected speechare being and will continue to be suppressed across theNation.  The concomitant negative impact on the burgeoningmedium for interactive computer services will be substantial.           Entry of the relief requested, pending finalresolution of the merits, will cause defendants nosignificant harm, especially because there are other criminalstatutes (including this Act's application to "obscene"communications) that prohibit the communications they claimare the principal focus of the Act.  Any delay in entry ofrelief, however, perpetuates and compounds the damage toplaintiffs' First Amendment rights and the First Amendmentrights of millions of adults to send and receivecommunications that are indisputably constitutionallyprotected for them.                          CONCLUSION          For the foregoing reasons, preliminary injunctiverelief against enforcement of    223(a)(1)(B)(ii), 223(a)(2)and 223(d) of the Act is essential and amply justified.

Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Provisions of the Act that are to be codified will usually becited only by their future U.S. Code citation.  3.  A more comprehensive description of the Internet andother interactive computer services, the way they function,and how they are utilized, can be found in paragraphs 31through 62 of the Complaint, and in the Declaration of VintonG. Cerf, Tab 11, Ex. A (detailing history and development ofthe Internet).  Cerf, who has been called the "father of theInternet," co-designed the communications protocols on whichthe Internet is based.     Declarations, statements and affidavits are exhibits toALA Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Tabs 1-39.  The declarations and affidavits have been arrangedalphabetically by the last name of the declarant.  Eachdeclaration also may include exhibits, labeled Exhibits A, B,C, etc.  A complete list of the declarations and affidavitsis included in the Motion and in an Appendix to thisMemorandum Of Law.  Thus, a citation to Doe Dec.   3, Tab 4,Ex. A would be a citation to Exhibit A of the declaration ofJohn Doe, located at Tab 4 of the exhibits to the Motion forPreliminary Injunction.  4.  Technically, the "Internet" is only the largest of thisnetwork of interconnected networks, but popularly the term"Internet" is now used to refer to all of these networkscollectively.  This brief uses the term "Internet" in thebroader, popular manner to refer to all of the interconnectednetworks.  In addition to these networks, there are othercomputer services, networks, and networks-of-networks thatare not interconnected to the Internet.  Although the bulk ofanalysis in this brief focuses on the Internet, theCommunications Decency Act equally applies to these otherservices and networks, and most of the same constitutionalconcerns are raised for those services and networks.  5.

See 18 U.S.C.    2251-52, 2256-57; 28 U.S.C.    1464-65; United States v.Thomas, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 1069 (6th Cir. Jan. 29, 1996)(upholding convictions under    1464 and 1465 fortransporting obscene materials by means of computer bulletinboard service).  See also Act, Section 507 (amendingobscenity laws to apply to interactive computer services). Plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of 47U.S.C.     223(a)(1)(B)(ii), 223(a)(2), and 223(d) to theextent they prohibit the transmission of communications thatare obscene or constitute child pornography.     26.  "Telecommunications device" is defined to exclude an"interactive computer service," 47 U.S.C.   223(h)(1)(B), butwould apparently include a modem used for private e-mailcommunications.  27.  Pursuant to   223(a)(2), it is also a crime knowinglyto provide use of a "telecommunications facility" that isused to violate   223(a)(1)(B).  28.  See FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 741 n.16(1978).  That is a significant problem for some plaintiffs,including universities with freshmen under the age ofeighteen.  See Mosher Dec.   6, 10, Tab 26; Boiss  Dec.   8,Tab 6.  29.  "Interactive computer service" is defined as "anyinformation service, system, or access software provider thatprovides or enables computer access by multiple users to acomputer server, including specifically a service or systemthat provides access to the Internet and such systemsoperated or services offered by libraries or educationalinstitutions."  47 U.S.C.   223(h)(2) referring to 47 U.S.C.  230(e)(2).  30.  It is a separate criminal offense knowingly to makeavailable a facility that is used to violate   223(d)(1).  223(d)(2).  31.  Cf. Miller, 413 U.S. at 24.  State "harmful to minors"statutes -- which the Conference Committee specificallyrejected as a model, see Joint Explanatory Statement of theCommittee of Conference for Title V, Communications DecencyAct of 1996 at 189 (hereinafter "Conf. Rep."), attached asExhibit 2 to Defendant's Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion fora Temporary Restraining Order in the ACLU case, No. 96-963("Deft ACLU Br."), do typically exempt materials with seriousvalue.  32.  438 U.S. at 745 (plurality op. of Stevens, J.)(describing the words at issue in the Carlin monologue as"patently offensive words dealing with sex and excretion").  33.  Conf. Rep. at 188.  34.  See also, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S8341 (June 14, 1995)(Sen. Leahy) ("works of fiction, ranging from `LadyChatterly's Lover' to Newt Gingrich's science fiction novel`1945,' which contains some steamy scenes, could not be putout on the Internet because of the risk that a minor mightdownload it").  In fact, titles and excerpts of populararticles or books located on the Internet do contain the"seven dirty words."  See Croneberger Dec.   5, Tab 13(titles containing expletives); Hammer Dec.   5, Tab 20(same); Krug Dec.   8, 13, Tab 23 (same); Teicher Dec., Tab33, Ex.

For a description of content on the Internet thatcould be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" forminors, see Complaint,    64-79.  36.  Communities across the country have banned or soughtto ban classic works of literature, such as Of Mice and Menby John Steinbeck, As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner, TheAdventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of TomSawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger,I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, as"indecent" for minors.  See Krug Dec.   7, Tab 23; see alsoGuttenberg Dec.   11 and Ex. Q, Tab 19 (detailing the list ofbooks published by Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Groupthat have been banned somewhere in the United States in thelast three years, including Silas Marner by George Eliot, AreYou There, God? It's Me, Margaret by Judy Blume, The GreatSantini by Pat Conroy and The Black Marble by JosephWambaugh).  See Also Action for Children's Television v. FCC,852 F.2d 1332, 1340 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (noting thatportions of the works of James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, JamesBaldwin, and Frank Harris could be deemed "indecent").  Eventhe American Heritage Dictionary and parts of the Bible havebeen attacked as being "indecent" for minors. Krug Dec.   7,Tab 23; Hammer Dec.   4, Tab 20; Guttenberg Dec., Tab 19, Ex.Q.  37.

ACLU Br. at 11 n.7, and Exhibit 9 thereto.   39.  Croneberger Dec.    3, 6, and Ex. B, at Tab 13.  40.  The government also relies on the Final Report of theAttorney General's Commission On Pornography (1986).  SeeDeft ACLU Br. at 28 n.14.  That report itself contains pageafter page of descriptions of graphic sexual acts that couldbe deemed indecent or patently offensive.  Apparently, itwould be a felony to put that government report online.  41.  Bradner Dec.    5, 7, 9, Tab 7; Berners-Lee Dec.    8,13, Tab 4.  42.  Both sponsors of the Act expressly acknowledged asmuch.  See 141 Cong. Rec. S8090 (June 9, 1995), 141 Cong.Rec. S8330, S8333 (June 14, 1995); id. at S9771 (July 12,1995) (Senator Exon); 141 Cong. Rec. S8333 (June 14, 1995)(Senator Coats).  The Department of Justice shared that view,and expressed serious reservations about theconstitutionality of the bill precisely because it threatenedto deprive adults of access to speech that isconstitutionally protected for them.  See Leahy Dec.    11,17, Tab 24.    43.  If "verified" means only verification that a cardbearing the number given was issued and is still valid, mostspeakers who charge for their speech could probably rely onthe "verified credit card" defense.  However, if "verified"means verification that the card was issued to a person whowas 18 or older when the card was issued, or who would be 18at the time the card was used, or verification that theperson using the card, as opposed to the cardholder, was 18or older, it would in many cases be impossible, and in allcases extremely burdensome and expensive, to obtain therequisite verification.  Berners-Lee Dec.    15, 16, Tab 4. The ambiguity concerning the meaning of "verified" is anotherreason why the Act is unconstitutionally vague.  See PointIV, infra.  44.  See Bradner Dec.    5, 7, 9, 10, Tab 7; Cady Dec.   3, 14, 20, 29, Tab 10; Collet Dec.   10, Tab 12; CronebergerDec.   8, Tab 13; Geiman Dec.   6, Tab 17; Grenquist Dec.  11, Tab 18; Hammer Dec.   8, Tab 20; Krug Dec.   14, Tab23; Mitchell Dec.   8, Tab 25; Teicher Dec.   10, Tab 33;Wolf Dec.   7, Tab 39.  45.

Thecommunications protocols underlying the Web lack anyprovision to track and screen individuals who access the Web. Berners-Lee Dec.   16, Tab 4.  Using additional programming,it would be possible for an individual web publisher toscreen access using a credit card or other identificationrequirement, but such a screening process would beprohibitively expensive and time consuming for non-feecharging speakers.  Id.; Cady Dec.   36, Tab 10.  The sameconstraints apply to ftp and gopher sites.  Cady Dec.   39,Tab 10.  46.  Bradner Dec.    3-5, Tab 7; Collet Dec.   10, Tab 12;Cady Dec.   20, Tab 10.  47.  See Bradner Dec.   10, Tab 7; Croneberger Dec.   8,Tab 13; Geiman Dec.   6, Tab 17; Grenquist Dec.   11, Tab 18;Hammer Dec.   8, Tab 20; Krug Dec.   14, Tab 20; MitchellDec.   8, Tab 25; Teicher Dec.   10, Tab 33; Wolf Dec.   7,Tab 39.  48.  Moreover, even if pre-registration by content userswere practically or economically feasible (which it is not),users' ability to find and utilize material would bedrastically diminished because few of them could anticipatethe need to pre-register for a particular site.  A hugepercentage of Internet traffic consists of users engaged inspontaneous unpredictable research (often aided by theextraordinary search potential of the hypertext language thatdrives the World Wide Web).  A pre-registration requirementwould effectively make this type of search impossible as tofiles or Web Sites containing any material deemed "patentlyoffensive."  The attendant decline in adult users' visits toinformation sites that had pre-registration requirementscould be expected, in turn, to diminish content providers'willingness to place arguably offensive material online.  49.  There are legitimate reasons why speakers may want tovoluntarily restrict access to their communications -- toprotect intellectual property or privacy interests, forexample.  The Act, however, imposes this duty upon speakerswho will either be unable, or find it extremely burdensome,to implement an access control system they would nototherwise establish.  The critical distinction is betweenspeaker-chosen and government-imposed restrictions.  50.  Cady Dec.    7, 8, 11, Tab 10; Butterworth Dec.    8-9, Tab 9; Stonesifer Dec.    5-6, Tab 32.  51.

In addition to these technologies that allow individualparents to control what their children can access, productssuch as the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack provideschools and businesses the ability to block specific sitesfrom access by all users on the network, and to track andmonitor use of the Internet.  60.  The World Wide Web Consortium is one of a number oforganizations of computer scientists and engineers who conferto agree upon technical protocols and standards to be usedwithin the Internet.  These defined standards and protocolsare what allow the diverse and otherwise incompatiblecomputers across the world to "internetwork" with each other.  61.  See generally Vezza Dec., Tab 35 (detailing PICSstandard and operations).  62.  Duvall Dec.   29, Tab 14; Spicer Dec.    37-41, Tab31.  63.  Sable 492 U.S. at 128; accord Bolger v.

Thus, this bedrock principle has already been appliedin the context of sale or distribution of books and otherprinted materials (Butler), use of the postal service to mailunsolicited commercial advertisements to homes (Bolger), anduse of the telephone to sell prerecorded commercial telephonemessages (Sable).  65.  The Supreme Court has stressed that in applying thistest it is important to consider whether other private orgovernmental alternatives, short of a ban -- already serve toprotect children.  If so, the advancement of the governmentalinterest served by the ban will be marginal.  See Sable, 492U.S. at 129 (no showing that other means do not affordsimilar protection without such infringement); Bolger, 463U.S. at 73 (ban "provides only the most limited incrementalsupport" because parents can exercise substantial control without any governmental involvement, and other laws affordcontrol over unwanted receipt of materials); Butler, 352 U.S.at 383 n.* (noting other criminal laws covering same topicshort of ban).  66.

(quotation omitted).  71.  Of course, Congress is not required to make findingsor hold hearings, and the absence of findings or hearings isnot, by itself, sufficient reason to hold an Act of Congressunconstitutional.  But it is the government's burden tojustify any law that abridges interests protected by theFirst Amendment, and as the Supreme Court has noted, theabsence of findings of fact or hearings decreases thelikelihood the government will be able to meet that burden. See Sable, 492 U.S. at 129-30.  72.  In Sable, the Court unanimously struck down 47 U.S.C.  223(b), which banned all "indecent" commercial telephonemessages.  The Court found that "the congressional recordpresented to us contains no evidence as to how effective orineffective the FCC's most recent regulations [permittingtechnological defenses to liability for generating indecentmessages] were or might prove to be" with respect toindecency.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 130 (emphasis in original). Instead, the record contained only     conclusory statements during the debates by proponents     of the bill . . . that under the FCC regulations minors     could still have access to dial-a-porn messages . . . .      No Congressman or Senator purported to present a     considered judgment with respect to how often or to what     extent minors could or would circumvent the rules and     have access to dial-a-porn messages.Id. at 129-30.  Because a lesser burden on speech may havebeen available, Congress' lack of findings doomed theindecency ban:  "For all we know from this record, the FCC'stechnological approach to restricting dial-a-porn messages toadults who seek them would be extremely effective . . . ifthis is the case, it seems to us that   223(b) is not anarrowly tailored effort . . . ."

Except insofar as it applies to obscenity and childpornography (and hence is redundant of existing obscenity andchild pornography laws), subsection (d) "`simply has no core'of constitutionally unprotected expression to which it mightbe limited."  City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 468(1987) (quoting Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S 566, 578 (1974)).  76.  In many overbreadth cases, the First Amendmentplaintiff (often a criminal defendant) relies exclusivelyupon the challenged law's effects upon the free speech rightsof persons not before the court.  See, e.g., Massachusetts v.Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 581 (1989).  Here, although the Actdirectly violates plaintiffs' own First Amendment rights in avariety of ways, the certainty that the Act's "veryexistence" will "cause others not before the court to refrainfrom constitutionally protected speech or expression,"Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973), underlinesthe need to invalidate subsection (d) on its face.  77.  Notwithstanding the government's power to restrictdistribution to minors of non-obscene materials with prurientappeal, see Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), and toregulate the use of profane language that could disrupt theeducational environment, see Bethel School District No. 403v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986), it is extremely doubtfulwhether the government could flatly ban -- as the Actpurports to do -- the distribution of sexually oriented buttruthful scientific or educational matter (e.g., informationon "safer sex" or AIDS) from children (particularly olderminors).  Statutes that restrict "`the free flow of truthfulinformation,'" suffer from "a `basic' constitutional defectregardless of the strength of the government's interest.'" Bolger, 463 U.S. at 75 (quoting Linmark v. Willingboro, 431U.S. 85, 95-96 (1977)) (emphasis added).  Nor are we aware ofany modern precedent holding that the government can withholdeven from minors works of serious literary value on theground that they are indecent.  78.  "In assessing whether a minor has the requisitecapacity for individual choice the age of the minor is asignificant factor."  Ernoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422U.S. 205, 214 n.11 (1975) (citing Rowan v. Post Office Dep't,397 U.S. 728, 741 (1970)).  For example, Web sites ordiscussion groups on the subjects of sexually transmitteddiseases, "safe sex," or contemporary novels that would beinappropriate for a 7-year-old Internet user might well beentirely appropriate for high school or college students whoare 17.  The Act, however, prohibits anyone from making suchresources available to anyone under 18.  It also makes sexual candor or vulgarity in a private e-mail exchangebetween 17-year-olds -- an exchange that would be entitled tocomplete First Amendment protection if conducted through theUnited States mail -- a series of felonies.  See  223(a)(1)(B), (d).  79.  The constitutional difficulties with the Act'sundifferentiating age line would be present even if thesubsection (e)(5) blocking provisions were feasible.  80.  Mosher Dec.    6, 10, Tab 26; Boiss  Dec.   8, Tab 6.  81.  The Act's sweep is far broader than that of the state"harmful to minors" statute upheld in Ginsberg v. New York,390 U.S. 629 (1968).  That statute banned the sale to personsunder 17 of sex-related pictures of which the predominantappeal was to the "prurient, shameful or morbid interest ofminors," that was "patently offensive" according to adults'community standards about what was inappropriate forchildren, and that was "utterly without redeeming socialimportance for minors."  Id. at 646.  The instant Act, incontrast, contains no "prurient appeal" or "redeemingimportance" requirements.  82.  See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968)(upholding ban on sale to persons under 17 of materialobscene as to minors; statute imposed no restrictions onsales to adults); Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957)(statute banning sale of materials tending to corrupt youthinvalid because it prevented adult access); AmericanBooksellers v. Webb, 919 F.2d 1493, 1502 (11th Cir. 1990) (inevaluating constitutionality of state law forbidding opendisplay of material harmful to minors "the crucial inquiry .. . is whether the restriction on adults' access to protectedspeech is unnecessarily burdensome, or `significant,' or,stated differently, whether alternate modes of adult accessare unduly restricted."); Upper Midwest Booksellers v. Cityof Minneapolis, 780 F.2d 1389, 1395 (8th Cir. 1985)(bookstore display restrictions designed to restrictchildren's access to sexually oriented material upheldbecause it did not "unduly burden the First Amendment rightsof adults"); M.S. News Co. v. Casado, 721 F.2d 1281, 1288(10th Cir. 1983) (upholding law requiring bookstores toemploy "blinder racks" for adult materials because it "doesnot unreasonably restrict adults' access to material which isnot obscene as to them").    83.  Pacifica is one of a series of Supreme Court decisionsholding that unique characteristics of the broadcast mediumjustify a degree of government content regulation that wouldnot be permitted elsewhere.  See id. 438 U.S. at 748.  Thus,for example, the Court has permitted federal regulators tooverride broadcasters' programming preferences to ensure thatlisteners and viewers "receive suitable access to social,political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences." Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 390 (1969). The Court has explained the special First Amendment standardby reference to four special characteristics of broadcastmedia:  scarcity of frequencies, intrusiveness, easyaccessibility for children, including "even those too youngto read," and difficulty of viewer control.  See Pacifica,438 U.S. at 748-50; Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 388; NationalBroadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 226 (1943). None of these characteristics applies to cyberspace.  84.  Even in the e-mail setting, recipients mustaffirmatively "open" their mail in order to read the fullmessage.  85.  Berners-Lee Dec.   9, Tab 4; Bradner Dec.    3, 6, 8,Tab 7.  86.  As one scholar has commented, the Turner Court'srefusal to extend the scarcity rationale to cable television,see 114 S. Ct. at 2456-58, "suggests that new technologieswill generally be subject to ordinary free speech standards,not to the more lenient standards applied to broadcasting." Cass R. Sunstein, The First Amendment in Cyberspace, 104 YaleL.J. 1757, 1769 (1995).  87.  Moreover, online content providers, like publishers inthe print medium, have no control over an individual's accessto expression in cyberspace.  See Turner 114 S.Ct. at 2466. Cyberspace, including the Internet, is owned by no one andcontrolled by no one and there exists no bottleneck orgatekeeper through which the expression must pass.  Althoughservices such as AOL, Compuserve, the Microsoft Network, andProdigy provide subscribers both content and access to theInternet, once the subscribers access the Internet, theseservices have no control over the content that is available. Moreover, the subscribers have a wide variety of avenues toaccess expression on the Internet and other interactivecomputer services; unlike with cable, they are not limited toone physical connection running into their home.  Cf. Turner,114 S.Ct. at 2466.  In cyberspace, there is no "potential forabuse of . . . private power" over "the free flow ofinformation and ideas."  Id.  88.  See Jerry Berman and Daniel J. Weitzner, "AbundanceAnd User Control:  Renewing the Democratic Heart Of The FirstAmendment In The Age Of Interactive Media," 104 Yale L.J.1619 (1995).  89.

"Computer coffee shops" are rapidly proliferating,where for less than it would cost to xerox 50 copies of apaper message, an individual could make that same messageavailable through the Internet to 40 million people. Moreover, most universities now provide free access to theInternet for their students.  And public libraries across thecountry provide free access to the Internet for librarypatrons.  See, e.g., Barrett Dec.   4, Tab 1; Boiss  Dec.  4, Tab 6; Vaughn Dec.   5, Tab 34.   93.  See, e.g., Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, HoffmanEstates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489 (1982); Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S.566 (1974); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972);Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972).  94.  The government is wrong in asserting plaintiffs mustdemonstrate that "'no set of circumstances exists under whichthe Act would be valid.'"  Deft ACLU Br. at 40 (quoting Rustv. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 183 (1991)).  The Supreme Courthas explained that the higher certainty requirement permitsthe Court "to invalidate [for vagueness] a criminal statuteon its face even when it could conceivably have had somevalid applications."  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 n.8 (emphasisadded).  95.  See Barret Dec.   6, Tab 1; Bendall Dec.   4, Tab 2;Bennett Dec.   11, Tab 3; Boiss  Dec.   7, Tab 6; CronebergerDec.   4, Tab 13; Fagin Dec. at 1, Tab 15; Geiman Dec.   9,Tab 17; Grenquist Dec.   12, Tab 18; Guttenberg Dec.   12,Tab 19; Hammer Dec.   3, Tab 20; Ketter Dec.   9, Tab 22;Krug Dec.   6, Tab 23; Mitchell Dec.   9, Tab 25; Mosher Dec.  2, Tab 26; Schwartzman Dec.   8, Tab 27; Scorza Dec.   5,Tab 28; Shelkrot Dec.   3, Tab 29; Teicher Dec.   6, Tab 33;Weisberg Dec.   10, Tab 36; Wheaton Dec., Tab 38, Ex. A, B;Wolf Dec.   8, Tab 39;   96.  In contrast to obscenity law, where expression mustpertain to statutorily specified "sexual conduct" in order tobe "obscene," Miller, 413 U.S. at 24 & n.6, the Act refersobliquely, and more broadly, to "sexual or excretoryactivities," without further explanation or specificity.  See  223(d)(1)(B).  The vagueness of these terms is anotherbasis for finding the Act violative of the Fifth Amendment.  97.  Although to any ordinary person the terms might beunderstood to have different meanings, Congress apparentlyintended that the "indecent" standard of subsection (a) andthe "patently offensive" standard of subsection (d) have thesame meaning.  See Conf. Report at 188 (noting that "section223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from[Pacifica].").  98.  In Pacifica, the Court examined the FCC's enforcementof an "indecency" standard which the FCC had interpreted tomean "language that describes, in terms patently offensive asmeasured by contemporary community standards for thebroadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities and organsat times of the day when there is a reasonable risk thatchildren may be in the audience."  438 U.S. at 732 (emphasisadded) (internal quotations omitted).  The Court stressed itwas upholding the FCC's determination that the "language asbroadcast was indecent."  Id. (emphasis added); accord id. at734 (confining holding to review of FCC's judgment as to "themonologue 'as broadcast'"); id. at 735 ("the focus of ourreview must be on the Commission's determination that theCarlin monologue was indecent as broadcast").  See also In reRegulations Governing Indecent Communications by Telephone,Gen. Dkt. No. 90-64,   12 (rel. June 29, 1990) (FCC "dial-a-porn" indecency standard refers to contemporary communitystandards "for the telephone medium").  99.  The FCC has argued that its standard for broadcast isvalid because it has "general expertise in broadcast matters"and therefore can adjudicate whether a particular broadcastis "indecent" under the broadcast test.  In re SagittariusBroadcasting Corp., 7 F.C.C.R. 6873, 6876 (1992).  However,neither the FCC, nor any other federal agency, has anycomparable "expertise in [computer] matters," and the Actexpressly denies the FCC the authority to enforce itsprovisions. See 47 U.S.C.   223(d)(6).  100.  Indeed, a speaker would have to consider whether the"least common denominator" is the least tolerant localcommunity in the world, since, as Congress recognized, thisis "a global, medium."  Conf. Report at 191.  Communicationsentirely appropriate for New York City may be deemedinappropriate for Salt Lake City, and grossly inappropriatefor Saudi Arabia.  101.

Schwartzman Dec.    4-7, Tab 27; Weitzner Dec.    10-12, Tab 37.  107.  The Conference Report unhelpfully states nothing morethan that the methods need not be "100%" effective.  But itgives no indication of what level of "ineffectiveness" thejury should tolerate.  See Conf. Rep. at 190.  108.  This is particularly so because this defense, and allof the Act's defenses, are only defenses which must be raisedand proved after the speaker has already been subjected toprosecution.  Even speakers who believe their actions willultimately be found to constitute a defense may be deterredfrom speaking in order to avoid the humiliation, stigma, andexpense of defending a criminal prosecution.    109.  If the Act is not enjoined, many content providerswill remove speech from the Internet in order to avoidcriminal prosecution.  See, e.g., Bendall Dec.   4, Tab 2;Bennett Dec.   13, Tab 3; Blum Dec.   8, Tab 5; CronebergerDec.   7, Tab 13; Gieman Dec.   8, Tab 17; Guttenberg Dec.  14, Tab 19; Ketter Dec.   10, Tab 22; Krug Dec.   13-15,Tab 23; Mosher Dec.   9, Tab 26; Scorza Dec.   10, Tab 28;Stonesifer Dec.   5, Tab 32; Teicher Dec.   9, Tab 33;Weisberg Dec.   10, Tab 36; Weitzner Dec.   12, Tab 37.  110.  There is no discussion of this defense in theConference Report.  111.  See supra n.43.  112.  The Act fails to specify whether there can be morethan one "content provider" of, or person who "displays" or"posts," any particular communication.    113.  The government agrees the access provider defensesshould be broadly construed, so the only question before theCourt is how broadly.  See Deft ACLU Br. at 49, n.35.  114.  Defendants erroneously rely on Hohe for theproposition that denial of First Amendment rights does notnecessarily constitute irreparable harm.  See Deft ACLU Br.at 20.  Hohe involved a challenge by nonunion members to theunion's procedures for collection of a fee charged for actingas the collective bargaining representative.  Hohe, 868 F.2dat 71 & n.1.  Although the Hohe plaintiffs raised a claimgrounded on the First Amendment, the court held that, becausethe alleged injury was merely a monetary one, it was fullyremediable at law and thus not irreparable.  Id. at 72-73. That is clearly not the case here.  115.  Defendants, in an effort to contend that the Act'schilling effect on plaintiffs' freedom of expression does notamount to irreparable harm, quote (out of context) casesinvolving the jurisdictional "case or controversy"requirement.   See Deft ACLU Br. at 19 (citing Younger v.Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 42 (1971) and Babbitt v. United FarmWorkers National Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)).  There isno question, however, that plaintiffs have standing to bringthis pre-enforcement facial challenge to the Act.  SeeVirginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, Inc., 484 U.S. 383,392 (1988) (concluding bookstores have standing to challengelaw criminalizing display of books harmful to minors because"the law is aimed directly at plaintiffs, who, if theirinterpretation of the statute is correct, will have to takesignificant and costly compliance measures or risk criminalprosecution.").

If enacted, the "Medical Records Confidentiality Act" would create strong, comprehensive, privacy safeguards for the health data of all Americans.  Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by Representative Gary Condit (D-CA). As CDT Deputy Director Janlori Goldman stated during a press conference announcing the Introduction of the bill, "the Medical Records Confidentiality Act is desperately needed to close a gaping hole in current law that leaves peoples' most personal, sensitive information extremely vulnerable to abuse and misuse.  Strong protections are needed to safeguard peoples' health records as the information moves on the Global information highway.  Congress must seize the opportunity to pass this bill this session."  Towards this end, CDT has organized a broad range of privacy and consumer advocates, along with representatives from the health care and information industries to work towards its passage. (see attached letter below) The 'Medical Records Confidentiality Act' would:*  Give people the right to see, copy, and correct their own medical    records; *  Limit disclosure of personal health information by requiring an    individual's permission prior to disclosure of his or her health    information by doctors, insurance companies, and other health    information 'trustees' (e.g.: researchers and public heath    departments);        *  Require the development of security guidelines for the use and    disclosure of personal health information; and        *  Impose strict civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations    of the Act, and provide individuals with a private right of action    against those who mishandle their personal medical information. CDT believes that strong uniform privacy rules for the handling of personal health data are critical to ensuring public trust and confidence in the emerging health information infrastructure.  Recent studies by the Institute of Medicine and the Office of Technology Assessment have shown that state laws are inadequate to protect peoples' health records, and that a federal law is needed to address this shortfall.More information, including the text of the bill and a section-by-section summary, are available from CDT's Health Information Privacy web page (URL:http://www.cdt.org/health_priv.html).BACKGROUND -- THE NEED FOR MEDICAL RECORDS PRIVACY PROTECTIONSThe public is continually told that increased data collection, linkage and sharing is necessary to improve the quality of health care and reduce costs. Yet without giving individuals confidence that their most sensitive personal information will be protected, we risk falling short of these health reform goals.  If people don't trust the health care system to maintain the confidentiality of personal health information, they will be reluctant to fully participate.  A 1993 Lou Harris poll shows that a majority of Americans favors new, comprehensive legislation to protect the privacy of medical records.  The poll found that nearly 50 million people believe their own medical records have been improperly disclosed.It is no wonder individuals are nervous about the privacy of their health information.  One need only read the paper to learn about leaks of the sensitive health information of politicians, sports figures, and celebrities.  The ordeals of Representative Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and the late tennis star Arthur Ashe expose the dire consequences that can occur when health information is wrongly disclosed.  Both Velazquez and Ashe suffered the disclosure of the most private intimate details of their lives -- a suicide attempt and HIV infection respectively -- to the world.  Public figures are not the only victims of unauthorized, egregious disclosures. The average American also suffers from leaks of sensitive medical information.  Recently,  information on the HIV status, drug-abuse history, and sexual practices of volunteers at an Ohio Health Department's AIDS prevention unit was wrongly disclosed.  Following another breach of confidential information, the office closed for retraining.  Weak security also leads to unauthorized internal access and misuse of peoples' health records.  In March of this year, a 13-year-old daughter of a hospital clerk printed out the names and phone numbers of patients who had been treated at the University of Florida's Medical Center.  As a hoax, the 13-year old girl then contacted seven patients and erroneously told them they were infected with HIV.  After receiving one of these prank calls, a young girl attempted suicide believing she had the HIV virus.CDT believes that the Medical Records privacy act is the most important privacy bill since the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA).  Furthermore, enacting health information privacy legislation is a critical first step in health care reform.  The Medical Records Confidentiality Act is supported by nearly everyone with a stake in the debate.  If passed, CDT believes the legislation will go a long way to restore the public's faith and confidence in the integrity and security of our nation's health care system.NEXT STEPS:The bill has been referred to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee (Chaired by Sen. Kassebaum (R-KS), a co-sponsor).  Committee hearings are scheduled for mid-November, and the bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate early in 1996.  Similar legislation is pending in the House (HR 435, sponsored by Rep. Condit (D-CA).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) CDT LED COALITION LETTER IN SUPPORT OF BENNETT BILLOctober 20, 1995Senator Robert Bennett431 Dirksen Senate Office BldgWashington, DC 20510Dear Senator Bennett:We write to express our appreciation and strong support for your efforts to enact a comprehensive privacy law to protect personal health information. We believe that safeguarding the privacy of peoples' health information is a necessary and critical component of health care reform. As the health system's infrastructure grows increasingly automated, it is essential that people have confidence that their participation in the health care system does not mean the loss of their privacy.Although we are still in the process of resolving certain issues in the draft Medical Records Confidentiality Act developed by your office, a substantial consensus has emerged on the central policy of providing Americans uniform, strong confidentiality protection for their health information.We look forward to continuing to work with you on this important bill.Sincerely,Aimee BerensonAIDS Action CouncilKathleen FrawleyAmerican Health Information Management AssociationRick PollackAmerican Hospital AssociationAmerican Association of Retired PersonsLeanord RubensteinBazelon Center for Mental Health Law Joel GimpelBlue Cross and Blue Shield AssociationJanlori GoldmanCenter for Democracy and TechnologyArthur LevinCenter for Medical ConsumersChristopher G.

These are:(1) A MODIFIED EXON PROPOSAL: Includes the CDA, the House-passed    manager's amendments which prohibit sending indecent material    online, and the Cox/Wyden bill.(2) THE HYDE/CHRISTIAN COALITION PROPOSAL: Rep. Hyde has endorsed a    proposal offered by conservative religious groups in October (the    so-called Reed, Schafly, Meese proposal, circulated on the net a    few weeks ago). This proposal is more restrictive than the Exon    proposal(3) THE GRASSLEY PROPOSAL: Conceptually similar to S. 892, the    Grassley/Dole 'Protection of Children from Computer Pornography    Act'. Among other things, the bill would create broad liability for    online indecency for both content providers and online service    providers, without any clear limitation.(4) COX/WYDEN/WHITE: Rep. Rick White (R-WA), an original co-sponsor of    Cox/Wyden, is preparing an alternative to the 3 proposals above. No    word yet on what it will contain, although it is expected to focus    on parental empowerment as opposed to unconstitutional indecency    restrictions and government regulation of online speech.Unfortunately, none of the three current proposals on the table (EXON,HYDE, and GRASSLEY), offer much hope. The fourth, WHITE, does not yetexist, though the reports we have received indicate that it is likely to bemore reasonable and workable than the others.Below is an overview of the current status of the issue and an analysis ofthe three current proposals.CURRENT STATUS OF CONFERENCE----------------------------A House/Senate conference committee is now in the process of reconcilingthe differences between the Senate-passed Exon/Coats CDA and theHouse-passed Cox/Wyden bill. Unfortuately, and despite the overwhelmingvictory of Cox/Wyden, the reports indicate that the CDA is sill very muchalive.Because the Senate passed the CDA, and because Exon is a member of theconference committee, Exon has the necessary leverage and support to pushfor his proposal. The same holds true on the House side, where theprincipal supporter of the Cox/Wyden position is Rep. Rick White.Ultimately, the conferees will have to decide how much of each proposal toaccept.The situation is complicated by the introcution of two new, even morerestrictive proposals (Hyde and Grassley). These proposals have the supportof the Christian Coalition (an influential group with many Republicans onthe conference), meaning that we face a steep, uphill battle in the nextfew weeks.OVERVIEW OF EXON, HYDE, AND GRASSLEY PROPOSALS----------------------------------------------Below is an overview of how the 3 proposals treat several of the keyissues, including the use of the indecency standard, the 'display' ofindecent material online, FCC oversight of cyberspace, vicarious liabilityfor service providers, preemption of inconsistent state laws, and defensesfor service providers.I. INDECENCYAll three seeks to prohibit indecent material on the Internet or otherinteractive media. As mentioned above, indecency is a broad classificationof material including sexually explicit material, the '7 dirty words', andeven classic works of fiction such as The Catcher In the Rye or Ulysses. Aswe have long argued, indecency restrictions on the Internet areunconstitutional given the tremendous amounts of control users have overthe material they receive.EXON:     Prohibits creating, transmitting, or making available any          indecent material to anyone under 18 (Sec 402 (a) - (e)).          Violators face $100,000 fines and up to 2 years in jailHYDE:     Criminalizes transmission or display of indecent material to          anyone under 18 (amendment to 18 USC 1465). Creates $100,000          fines and 2 years in jail for anyone who makes or makes          available any indecent material to a minor (Sec 402 (d)).GRASSLEY: Punishes 'Content Providers" who knowingly make an indecent          communication to anyone under 18 (Sec (3)).          Also punishes "Access Providers' who 'willfully' provide a          minor with access to a computer communications facility on          which indecent communications are available (Sec. (f)).          Violators face $100,000 fines and up to 2 years in jailII. 'DISPLAY CRIME'All three proposals seek to prohibit the 'display' of indecent material invarious ways. They are modeled on the concept of 'brown paper bags' orother blinders which cover adult magazines at 7-11 type stores, though inthe online context the current proposals are much more restrictive andwould apply to individual content providers (not just the owner of thestore).These provisions would apply to web pages, ftp and gopher archives, usenetnewsgroups, etc.EXON:     Prohibits the display of indecent material to minors (Sec          (e)(1)). Violators face $100,000 fines and 2 years in jail.HYDE:     Prohibits the display of indecent material to minors (Sec          402 (d)). Violators face $100,000 fines and 2 years in jail.          Proposal is identical to Exon described above.GRASSLEY: Prohibits the display of indecent material to minors (Sec          (e)), as well as knowingly allowing a minor access to a          computer network on which indecent material is available (Sec          (f)). Under this provision, anyone who allows a minor access          to the Internet, including an online service provider or even          the child's parent, could go to jail if they "know"          indecent material is available and allow a minor acess.III.    FCC ROLETwo of the new proposals would grant the FCC new authority to regulatecyberspace.EXON:     Grants the FCC jurisdiction over online speech and over          blocking and filtering technologies (Sec (f)(1) - (4).HYDE:     Grants the FCC broad authority over online speech and over          blocking and filtering technologies (Sec (e)(1)).GRASSLEY: No FCC role proposed.IV.     VICARIOUS LIABILITY FOR CARRIERSAll three proposals would hold carriers criminally liable merely fortransmitting content created by others. Holding carriers liable for contenton their networks would (1) force carriers to ensure that their networksare not being used to transmit prohibited material (creating a free speechand privacy nightmare), or (2) remove all incentives for those carriers whomay wish to exercise limited editorial control over their networks to actresponsibly.EXON:     Amends 18 USC 1465 to prohibit 'transmission' by computer of          indecent material to minors. This provision could be read to          apply to apply to service providers (Sec. 410).HYDE:     Similar to Exon proposal, amendments to 18 USC 1465 would          prohibit 'transmission' by computer of indecent material to          minors. This provision could be read to apply to service          providers.GRASSLEY: Would hold access providers liable for knowingly providing          minors access to a computer service on which indecent material          is available (sec (f)).V.      PREEMPTIONMore and more states are attempting to pass their own net-censorship bills.Some are more restrictive than others. However, because interactive mediais interstate and international, entire networks will be forced to adhereto the most restrictive standards unless Congress enacts a uniform nationalpolicy and pre-empts states from enforcing inconsistent or incompatibleregulations.The pre-emption provisions vary between the three proposals:EXON:     Pre-empts states from imposing liability on commercial          entities, nonprofit libraries and schools. However, states          could enact tougher restrictions on individual users, BBS's,          non-profit organizations, and non-profit computer networks          (freenets) (Sec. (g)HYDE:     Contains no pre-emption of state laws, allowing states to          impose stricter regulations and even enact inconsistent laws.GRASSLEY: Explicitly prohibits pre-emption. States would be free to          enact any restrictions, even if they are more restrictive (Sec          (I)).VI. DEFENSESAll three proposals contain defenses designed to protect service providersfrom liability in certain circumstances. While we have long held theposition that defenses are important (since holding service providersliable for their subscribers content creates huge problems for free speechand privacy), it is not clear that all these defenses will work asadvertised.EXON:     (1) No control -- Providers cannot be held liable for              providing access to material if the provider has no              control over the material (Sec (f)(1)).          (2) FCC Determination Of Good Faith -- Providers cannot be              held liable if they have taken good faith actions, as              prescribed by the FCC, to restrict access to prohibited              material (Sec. (f)(3)).          (3) Employers -- Employers will not be held liable for the              actions of an employee's activities online (unless the              conduct is part of their job or the employer authorizes              it) (Sec (f)(2)).HYDE:     (1) FCC Determination Of Good Faith -- No liability if a              person has complied with regulations designed to restrict              access to indecent communications to those under 18 as              enacted by the FCC, which is required to prepare final              regulations 120 days after passage of the bill.              No other defenses are offered.GRASSLEY: (1) Defense for Screening -- The proposal creates a defense              to prosecution if a person has taken good faith efforts to              restrict or prevent the transmission of or access to              indecent materials (Sec. (g))          (2) Employers -- Employers will not be held liable for the              actions of an employee's activities online (unless the              conduct is part of their job or the employer authorizes              it) (Sec. h)SUMMARY-------While this may all seem pretty bleak, all is not lost just yet. Asmentioned earlier, Rep. Rick White (R-WA) is reportedly about to offer analternative to the Exon/Hyde/Grassley proposals. The White proposal isexpected to be based on the Cox/Wyden/White 'parental empowerment'approach.However, even if the White approach is, as expected, preferable to the 3alternatives, the fact that Exon, Hyde, and Grassley are all pushing morerestrictive proposals means that it is unlikely we will come out of thiswith everything we want. The Christian Coalition is too powerful,especially with the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee on theirside, to not have some influence on the final outcome of this debate.We have a great deal of work ahead of us. Once the White proposal isavailable, we will be able to get a better sense of our chances forsalvaging a palatable outcome. We will keep you informed of developments asthey occur.BACKGROUND----------As you know, the House and Senate have passed two very different approachesto dealing with objectionable material online as part of a massivetelecommunications reform bill.In June, the Senate passed the Exon/Coats CDA, which would create a crimefor transmitting or displaying indecent material online. "Indecent"material is a vague and constitutionally suspect classification of materialwhich includes everything from sexually explicit material to the '7 dirtywords', to the text of classic works of fiction such as Catcher in the Rye.In addition, the Exon/Coats CDA would grant the FCC broad authority toregulate online speech as well as the underlying technology of the Internetand other interactive media.In August, the House passed the Cox/Wyden/White 'Internet Freedom andFamily Empowerment Act'. Cox/Wyden/White would prohibit the FCC fromimposing content or other regulations on the Internet or other interactivemedia, remove disincentives which prohibit online service providers fromdeploying blocking and filtering applications, and create a uniformnational policy of user control, rather than government censorship, foraddressing objectionable material online. However, the House also passedthe so-called 'Managers Amendments', which would criminalize sendingindecent material to a minors.FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:--------------------------The text of the Exon, Hyde, and Grassley proposals are available on CDT'snet-censorship issues web page (URL below).

Chris Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), which would prohibit the federal government from regulating content on the Internet, commercial online services, and other interactive media.Unlike the Senate-passed Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act (CDA), the Cox/Wyden amendment ensures that individuals and parents can decide for themselves what information they or their children receive. By contrast, the Exon/Coats CDA would grant the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) broad powers to regulate the expression of each and every one of the millions of users of the Internet. The Cox/Wyden amendment:* Prohibits the FCC from imposing content regulations on the Internet or   other interactive media.* Removes disincentives for online service providers to exercise   editorial control over their networks and to provide blocking and   screening technologies to their uses.* Seeks to create a uniform national policy prohibiting content   regulations in interactive media.CDT believes that the Cox/Wyden amendment is an enlightened approach toaddressing the issue of children's access to objectionable material online. Unlike the Senate-passed CDA, the Cox/Wyden approach recognizes that the Internet is a global, decentralized network, with abundant capacity for content and tremendous user control. House passage of the Cox/Wyden amendment sets the stage for a direct battle between the House and Senate on the issue of government content regulation in interactive media. CDT will work vigorously to ensure that the Cox/Wyden amendment replaces the Exon/Coats CDA in the final version of telecommunications Reform legislation.NEW UNCONSTITUTIONAL INDECENCY RESTRICTIONS ALSO APPROVEDAlthough the House vote today significantly advanced freedom of speech on the Internet, the threat of unconstitutional indecency restrictionsremains.In a vote unrelated to the Cox/Wyden amendment, the House also approvedchanges to federal obscenity laws which would criminalize the transmission of constitutionally protected speech online. These amendments were approved as part of the "Managers Amendment" to the Telecommunications reform bill (HR 1555). Although these amendments are more narrowly drawn than the Exon/Coats CDA or the Grassley/Dole "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act (S. 892), they clearly violate the First Amendment and remain an issue of serious concern to CDT. The new criminal law amendments are opposed by several prominent members of both the House and Senate, including Cox and Wyden. As the bill makes its way through the House/Senate conference committee, CDT will work with Reps. Cox and Wyden, Senator Leahy, and others to:* Remove the unconstitutional indecency restrictions added as part of  the "Managers amendment"* Ensure that the Cox/Wyden amendment replaces the Exon/Coats CDA in the   final telecommunications reform bill* Clarify that the Cox/Wyden amendment does not affect privacy   protections under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)* Strengthen provisions that pre-emption state online censorship laws.COX/WYDEN AMENDMENT PROTECTS CYBERSPACE FROM GOVERNMENT INTRUSION,RECOGNIZES PARENTAL CONTROL POSSIBILITIESThe Cox/Wyden bill seeks to accomplish four principal objectives:* PROHIBIT FCC CONTENT REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERACTIVE  COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.   The bill explicitly prohibits the Federal Communications Commission   from imposing or content or other regulations on the Internet or other   interactive communications services (Sec 2 (d)).  This provision recognizes that Interactive media is different from   traditional mass media (such as broadcast radio and television), and   will enshrine in statue strong protections for all content carried on   the Internet and other interactive communications services. Instead of    relying on government censors to determine what is or is not  appropriate for audiences, this provision recognizes that individuals   and parents are uniquely qualified to make those judgments.* REMOVE DISINCENTIVES FOR ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO EXERCISE   EDITORIAL CONTROL OVER THEIR NETWORKS AND TO DEPLOY BLOCKING AND  SCREENING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THEIR SUBSCRIBERS.    The bill would remove liability for providers of interactive     communications services who take good faith steps to restrict access   to obscene or indecent materials to minors or provide software or   hardware to enable their users to block objectionable material.(Sec 2  (c))  In addition, the bill would overturn the recent court  decision    (Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 24,   1995) which held Prodigy liable for content on its network   because the service screens for sexually explicit material and   language.  Prodigy now faces a $200 million lawsuit.   The bill does not intend to create an obligation for providers to   monitor or screen content or to allow violation of Federal privacy   statutes (such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act), although   some concerns remain on these points. CDT remains committed to   addressing these concerns as the legislation moves to conference, and   has been assured by Rep. Cox and Wyden that these issues will be   addressed.* PRE-EMPT INCONSISTENT STATE LAWS REGULATING CONTENT ON INTERACTIVE   COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.   The bill seeks to pre-empt States from enforcing inconsistent laws,   including restrictions on content available on interactive   communications services.  (Sec 2 (e)(2))  The actual scope of this preemption remains an issue of some   discussion. CDT believes that any legislation in this area MUST   contain a strong pre-emption of inconsistent state laws. A patchwork   of state laws which impose varying, and in some cases contradictory,   obligations on service providers and content providers must be   avoided. CDT will work to ensure that the Cox/Wyden bill creates a   uniform national policy which prohibits states from imposing content   regulations on interactive media.* NO EFFECT ON CRIMINAL LAW.   The bill is not intended to prevent the enforcement of the current   dial-a-porn statute or other Federal criminal statutes such as   obscenity, child pornography, harassment, etc. (Sec 2 (e)(1))NET ACTIVISM A CRITICAL FACTORWhen Senator Exon (D-NE) first proposed the CDA in February 1995, thenet.community reacted with strong opposition. A coalition of onlineactivist organizations, including CDT, EFF, People for the American Way,EPIC, the ACLU and organized with the Voters Telecommunications Watch(VTW), worked tirelessly over the last six months to mobilize grass roots opposition to the CDA. Through our efforts of generating thousands of phone calls to Congressional offices and an online petition which generated over 100,000 signatures in support of an alternative to the CDA, the net.community was able to demonstrate that we are a political force to be reckoned with.The net.campaign and public education efforts helped to encourage HouseSpeaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) to come out against the CDA, and was animportant factor in Reps. Cox and Wyden's decision to propose theiralternative. As the legislation moves to the conference committee and then on to final passage, the net.community must be prepared to continue to fight to ensure that the new criminal provisions are removed and that the Cox/Wyden amendment is not weakened.GENESIS OF THE COX/WYDEN AMENDMENTAfter the Senate passed the CDA by a vote of 84-16 on June 14, CDT stepped up our efforts to find an alternative which protected the First Amendment and recognized the unique nature of interactive media. Both on our own and through the Interactive Working Group (a group of over 80 public interest organizations and leading computer and communications companies, content providers, and others, coordinated by CDT. The IWG includes the ACLU, People for the American Way, the Progress and Freedom Foundation, America Online, MCI, Compuserve and Prodigy, and many other organizations and corporations), worked directly with Reps. Cox and Wyden to bolster the case that parental control technologies offered an effective alternative to government content regulations. To this end, the IWG held a demonstration for members of Congress and the press in mid-July to demonstrate parental control feature of products offered by Netscape, SurfWatch, WebTrack, America Online, and Prodigy.In addition, the IWG issued a comprehensive report reviewing currenttechnology and the state of current laws prohibiting trafficking inobscenity, child pornography, stalking, threats, and other criminal conduct online (this report can be viewed on CDT's web siteURL:http://www.cdt.org/iwg/IWGrept.html).Through these efforts and the efforts of VTW's online coalition, to educate members of the House about the problems with the Exon/CDA and the promise of interactive media, the House today has enacted an enlightened approach to dealing with children's access to inappropriate material online. Today's vote represents a tremendous victory for the first amendment and the promise of cyberspace.NEXT STEPSThe House Telecommunications legislation (HR 1555) is expected to passlater today (8/4). The Senate approved similar legislation (S. 652) inJune. Both bills now move to a House/Senate Conference Committee wheredifferences will be worked out. The Conference Committee is expected tobegin deliberation in early September. Once the Conference Committee agrees on a version of the bill, it will be sent back to both the House and Senate for final approval. This vote is expected to occur before the end of October.The Internet-censorship provisions of the Senate bill are among the keydifference between the House and Senate proposals. However, several keymembers of the Senate, including Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and RussFeingold (D-WI) have expressed opposition to the Exon/Coats approach.  CDT will fight vigorously throughout the remainder of this Congress toensure that the Exon/Coats CDA does not become law. We will also work toremove the new unconstitutional criminal law amendments passed by the House today.------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) How To Subcribe To The CDT Policy Post Distribution ListCDT Policy Posts, which is what you have just finished reading, are theregular news publication of the Center For Democracy and Technology.

A House vote is expected in mid July.In his effort to defeat the Exon amendment, Senator Leahy cited the over 35,000 signatures on the Internet petition, as well as the serious First Amendment and privacy concerns raised by the Exon proposal. Senator Feingold (D-WI) also spoke in opposition to the Exon amendment, and asked that the Senate consider the unique features of interactive media. Unfortunately, these efforts to protect the Internet from unnecessary and repressive censorship were not successful.A full analysis of the Senate passed bill, as well as a description of the events that occurred today on the Senate floor will be posted in the next few days. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) About The Center For Democracy And Technology/Contacting UsThe Center for Democracy and Technology is a non-profit public interestorganization.

The proposal to be offered by the Senate Majority leader and Republican Presidental candidate is more sweeping than the Exon Communicatons Decency Act, and comes on the heals of his recent attack on "sex and violence" in the entertainment industry.The Dole/Grassley proposal represents an even greater threat to the First Amendment and the free flow of information in cyberspace than the Exon Communications Decency Act, now pending before the Senate (a vote on the CDA is expected as early as tomorrow, 6/7/95). Senator Dole is expected to announce his support for the bill at a 6/7 lunch hosted by the anti-pornography group Enough Is Enough. The text of the proposal is attached below.Senator Grassley's staff has informed CDT that he bill will be introduced as a free standing bill and NOT AS AN AMENDMENT TO THE PENDING SENATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM BILL (S. 652). CDT hopes that the Dole/Grassley bill will not be fast-tracked (as was the Exon legislation), and that hearings will be held on the proposal.The introduction of Dole/Grassley creates an even greater need for support of Senator Leahy's alternative (S. 714). If the Senate rejects Senator Leahy's alternative, it will pass either the Exon bill or the even more draconian Dole/Grassley proposal, and the net as we know it will never be the same again.

Please also sign the petition (URL and instructions at the end of this post)SUMMARY OF DOLE/GRASSLEY PROPOSAL---------------------------------The Dole/Grassley bill would create new penalties in Title 18 for all operators of electronic communications services who knowingly transmit indecent material to anyone under 18 years of age.  The bill would also create criminal liability for system operators who willfully permit minors to use an electronic communications service in order to obtain indecent material from another service. The Dole/Grassley bill would impose criminal liability on online service providers, electronic bulletin board operators, as well as any other entity that uses computer storage to deliver information to users, including video dialtone services, cable television video on demand services, etc.  The degree of knowledge required to impose liability is unclear, but it appears that an entity could be said to have the requisite knowledge if it is merely informed by a third party that some material on its system is indecent. The text of the proposal is available below.------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) SEN. LOTT (R-MISS) TO OFFER AMENDMENT TO STRIKE 'DEFENSES' SECTION     OF EXON CDA.Senator Lott is preparing to offer an amendment to strike the service provider defenses from the Exon language already approved by the Senate Commerce committee.Analysis:  Holding service providers such as America Online and Internet access providers liable for the content on their system over which they have no control will stifle the free flow of information in cyberspace and create major business risk for the private companies that are building the National Information Infrastructure.  Furthermore, placing criminal liability on service providers poses a serious risk to the privacy of individual users by forcing service providers to monitor communications in order to limit their own liability.Status:  Lott plans to offer this amendment when the on the Senate floor when the telecommunications bill is being considered.------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) LEGISLATIVE UPDATE -- STATUS OF EXON CDA With the Senate telecommunications reform bill poised to go to the floor this week, proposals to censor the Internet are proliferating beyond just the Exon language.  The most sweeping and threatening proposals come from the Senate leadership and other Republicans.  The provisions of the Exon proposal that are already in the telecommunications bill contain restrictions on indecent communications which would apply to all parts of the Internet, commercial online services, and all other interactive media including interactive television, etc.  We believe these provisions to be unconstitutional and continue to oppose them.  CDT continues to work with members of the Interactive Working Group in urging support for the Leahy study bill as an alternative.The Exon proposal now part of the Senate telecommunications bill stillposes serious risks to free speech online.  The Exon proposal contains restrictions on "indecent" communications, which could ban all sexually-explicit communications on the Internet, along with all uses of the "seven dirty words."Analysis:  CDT continues to argue that the indecency restrictions in the Exon bill are unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Status:  Senator Leahy plans to offer an amendment to strike the Exon provisions and replace them with his study bill (S.714) as an alternative.CDT continues to work with members of the Interactive Working Group in urging support for the Leahy study as an alternative to the Exon bill, which we still believe to be unconstitutional.For more information, see CDT's Communications Decency Act Archives: http://www.cdt.orgftp://ftp.cdt.org/pub/cdt/policy/freespeech/00-INDEX.FREESPEECH------------------------------------------------------------------------(4) TEXT OF THE DOLE/GRASSLEY PROPOSAL104th Congress: First Session.

CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman testified before the panel. Berman's testimony is available on CDT's online archives (URL's below).The bombing in Oklahoma City has brought the Internet under new scrutiny by Congress and the Clinton Administration. In his opening statement, Subcommittee Chair Arlen Spector (R-PA) made clear the First Amendment issues raised by government efforts to censor certain material in cyberspace. However, Spector acknowledged that the availability of so called "mayhem manuals" (one of which he displayed before the hearing) raises concerns about public safety and national security.Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), in his opening statement, urged caution and careful consideration of the benefits new communications technologies can bring before Congress rushes to restrict and limit its use."Before we head down a road that leads to censorship, we must think long and hard about its consequences. The same First Amendment that protects each of us and our right to think and speak as we choose, protects these others as well. The rule of this free society has long been that it is harmful and dangerous conduct, not speech, that justify adverse legal consequences", Leahy said.Senator Leahy, an opponent of Senator Exon's Communications Decency Act (S. 314), and strong advocate of freedom of speech and the free flow of information in cyberspace, recently introduced S. 714, an alternative to Senator Exon's bill (the text of Leahy's bill is available from CDT, URL below).Witnesses on the panel included:* Jerry Berman, Executive Director, Center For Democracy and Technology* Rabbi Marvin Hier, Dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center * Robert Litt, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, US Detp. of Justice* William Burrington, Assistant General Counsel. America Online* Prof. Frank Tuerkheimer, U. of Wisconsin Law SchoolWhat Does It Mean To "Shout Fire In Cyberspace?"-----------------------------------------------CDT's Jerry Berman acknowledged the availability of bomb-making instructions and terrorist manuals on the Internet, but argued that such materials deserve the same degree of protection as identical materials available in bookstores or libraries.   "As an open society, governed by the democratic principles of the First and Fourth Amendments, we tolerate and even encourage robust debate, advocacy and exchange of information on all subjects and in all media of expression, without exception.  Prior restraint or any government action which might chill speech have long been labeled intolerable, expect in the few circumstances in which that speech advocates imminent violence and is likely to produce such violence.  Even in these cases, Constitutional law and long-standing law enforcement policy have dictated great restraint in order to avoid chilling legitimate speech activity.""Justice Holmes taught that the First Amendment does not protect a person from punishment for "falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic,"  Schenk v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919), but what does it mean to "shout fire" in cyberspace?  We believe that shouting fire in cyberspace is actually far less threatening, and thus less deserving of censure, than the equivalent act in the physical world.  Though one can shout fire in an email message or on an Internet newsgroup, the likelihood that it will incite readers to imminent, criminal action is much reduced because the readers are dispersed around the country, and even around the world."Berman added,"The Center for Democracy and Technology believes that any prosecutorial or investigative activity must be predicated on speech **plus** a reasonable indication that the speech will lead to imminent violence.  Speech alone is not enough to prosecute or investigate in other media, and it should not be sufficient in interactive media.  Moreover, we assert that current law and the FBI's strict interpretation of the existing Attorney General investigative guidelines are adequate to serve both law enforcement purposes and First Amendment interests.In the sharpest exchange of the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), expressed strong concern about the ability of children to access bomb-making material on the Internet. Visibly outraged by the testimony, Feinstein said, "I have a problem with people who use the First Amendment to teach others how to kill [other people]" Protecting such speech, "... is not what this country is about."CDT's Jerry Berman responded, "Excuse me, Senator, but that *is* what this nation is all about."  Feinstein countered that she believes that there is a " difference between free speech and teaching someone how to kill others", and suggested that the government should take a greater role in preventing the availability of such materials.Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Litt, agreeing with CDT's assertion that the First Amendment protects bomb-making manuals and other such material regardless of the medium of distribution, added that the Justice Department has the authority under current law to prosecute individuals who use the Internet to commit crimes relating to  "extortion, threats, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting the violation of other federal laws".  But Litt emphasized that such prosecutions must be predicated by **conduct**. Litt said:"We can, therefore, clearly act to punish conduct that falls within the scope of existing laws. But when we address not conduct but possibly protected speech, the power of law enforcement is restricted by the First Amendment. As the Committee well knows, we must guard the public's right to free speech even while protecting the public from criminal activity. The Constitution imposes stringent limits on our ability to punish the mere advocacy of principals or the mere dissemination of information, without more, even if the communications in question are utterly repugnant".However, the Justice Department staked out a more aggressive line on the issues of encryption and anonymity. On anonymity, Litt acknowledged the necessity of confidentiality for whistle-blowers and informants, but argued that the availability of complete anonymity on the Internet is of serious concern to law enforcement. In his prepared testimony, Litt echoed FBI Director Louis Freeh's recent comments that "... unless the encryption issue is adequately addressed, criminal communications over the telephone and the Internet will be will be encrypted and inaccessible to law enforcement even if a court has approved electronic surveillance," and pledged to continue to work to find solutions to this issue.In a statement which appears to dredge up previous arguments from the Department in support of the Clipper Chip government key escrow proposal, Litt said:"We believe that it is possible to deal with both of these issues -- encryption and anonymity.  Privacy rights should generally be protected, but society should continue to have, under appropriate safeguards and when necessary for law enforcement, the ability to identify people and hold them accountable for their conduct. In the case of encryption, the appropriate balance can be achieved by the widespread use of reliable, strong cryptography that allows for government access, with appropriate restrictions, in criminal investigations and for national security purposes. The federal escrowed encryption standard issued last year is designed to achieve this delicate balance for voice telephony."Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, argued that the  nature of the Internet, including its broad reach and the veil of anonymity, provides a fertile ground for hate-groups and other potentially dangerous organizations. While stressing the importance of the First Amendment, Hier recommended that:* Law enforcement should have the ability to monitor hate  groups and other organizations that clearly advocate an  intention to commit violence that use the Internet to  distribute information;* Online service providers (particularly the commercial  services such as AOL and Compuserve) should take steps to  prevent their networks from being used to distribute material  from these organizations;  and* To look at the uses of these communications technologies and  to examine what legal limits can be placed on it.William Burrington, Assistant General Counsel and Director of Government Affairs for America Online, stressed that AOL does take steps to address violations of its terms of service agreement, and has removed users who use the network to post inappropriate material to public forums.  However, Burrington cautioned that it is impossible and illegal under ECPA for a service provider to monitor every communication that travels across their network. Burrington further noted that, while it is possible for America Online to exercise limited control inside its own networks, monitoring and controlling content on the Internet is beyond the reach of any one because of the decentralized nature and global reach of the network.Speaking from direct experience, University of Wisconsin Law Professor Frank Tuerkheimer stressed that the government should not attempt too prevent or censor the publication of bomb-making manuals or other such materials -- not only because such action is clearly contrary to the First Amendment, but also because the material would inevitably be published in another forum, rendering the government's argument moot.This is precisely what occurred in 1979 in United States v. Progressive, Inc (476 F. Supp 990 (W.D. Wisc. 1979). In this case, the government, sought to prevent the publication of instructions on how to make a hydrogen bomb.  Professor Tuerkheimer was the federal prosecutor in the Progressive Case.  The article was ultimately published and the case became moot because the information was found to be available in a number of public libraries.Tuerkheimer noted that it would be futile for the government to attempt to prosecute someone for distributing bomb making material on the Internet, since information on how to build an ammonium nitrate bomb similar to the device used in the Oklahoma City tragedy can be found in encyclopedias and in publications available from the US Department of Agriculture.NEXT STEPS:Although the issue of the availability of bomb-making manuals and the use of the Internet by malitia and hate-groups has received considerable attention in the press and on Capitol hill in recent weeks, as of this writing there has been no legislation introduced, and so far none of the counter-terrorism proposals specifically address this issue.  CDT will closely track this issue, and will alert you to any developments as soon as they become available.Paths to Relevant Documents---------------------------CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman's testimony is available at the following URL's:http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb.test.htmlftp://ftp.cdt.org/pub/cdt/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb.testAdditional hearing documents, including the Department of Justice testimony can be found at the following URL's http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/May11_hearing.htmlftp://ftp.cdt.org/pub/cdt/policy/terrorism/00-INDEX.terrorismThe Text of S. 714, Senator Leahy's Alternative to the Communications Decency Act, can be found at:http://www.cdt.org/policy/legislation/s714.htmlftp://ftp.cdt.org/policy/legislation/s714.bill---------------------------------------------------------------(2) ABOUT THE CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOLOGYThe Center for Democracy and Technology is a non-profit public interest organization.

CDT commends Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue and his efforts to ensure a detailed public discussion of the necessity of the FBI's request. CDT believes that Congress should not appropriate any funds to cover the costs of capacity modifications until the FBI justifies its need for the proposed surveillance capacity. The FBI's proposal, published in the October 16 Federal Register, has sparked a great deal of concern from privacy advocates and the telecommunications industry that the FBI is seeking to expand its ability to wiretap digital telecommunications networks beyond its current activity the analog environment. In response to this concern, Senator Leahy sent the attached letter to FBI Director Freeh calling on the FBI to disclose two critical pieces of information used by the Bureau to determine its capacity needs: a survey of historical surveillance activity and an analysis of that activity.  The FBI's announcement of the proposed surveillance capacity did not contain this information.Under CALEA, the FBI is required to publish requests for surveillance capacity in order to ensure public oversight and accountability over law enforcement surveillance activity.  In addition, CALEA requires that the government reimburse telecommunications carriers for any modifications made to meet the capacity requests. If the government fails to reimburse telecommunications carriers for capacity modifications, carriers are not required to make any changes to their networks.  Congress is currently considering legislation to appropriate funding for the proposal.These provisions of CALEA were specifically designed to ensure a public debate over the necessity and costs of law enforcement surveillance capacity.  CDT will continue to work closely with Senator Leahy, other members of Congress, and representatives from the public interest community and the telecommunications industry to ensure that the public accountability provisions of the law are followed, and that Congress carefully examines the basis of the FBI's request before approving funding for the proposal.----------------------------------------------------------------------(2)  LETTER FROM SENATOR LEAHY TO FBI DIRECTOR FREEHNovember 3, 1995The Honorable Louis J. FreehFederal Bureau of InvestigationJ. Edgar Hoover Building9th Street and Pennsylvania AvenueWashington, D.C.  20035Dear Director Freeh:Congress took the important step in the last Congress of passing the "Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act" (CALEA) to ensure that in cases of significant criminal activity, ranging from terrorism to kidnapping, law enforcement would continue to be able to execute court-authorized electronic surveillance.  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies are loosing their capability to use that important tool in the face of new and advanced telecommunications technologies.Just as significantly, this new law also brings decisions affecting the privacy of our Nation's telephone system under statutory guidance and into the sunshine.  CALEA requires that law enforcement's demands regarding the number of wiretap orders that telephone companies must be able to service simultaneously, are published in the Federal Register and scrutinized in a public procedure.The process set up in CALEA is working.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently published in the Federal Register a proposed notice of law enforcement's capacity demands predicated upon an historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity and an analysis of that activity.  The Federal Register notice did not include publication of those two documents.Please provide me with copies of those two documents, which I also urge you to release to the public and publish in the Federal Register to ensure the fullest dissemination of the information.I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.Sincerely,[signature]PATRICK J. LEAHYUnited States Senator----------------------------------------------------------------------(3) REVIEW OF DIGITAL TELEPHONY PROCESS TO DATEFBI Must Address Critical Questions About The Proposed Capacity NoticeOn October 16, 1995, the FBI published in the Federal Register its proposed notice of surveillance capacity, as required by CALEA.  The FBI has requested that telecommunications carriers, depending on the geographic area served by their network and the frequency of surveillance orders in those areas, reserve up to 1% of the capacity of each switch, feature, or service for law enforcement to conduct simultaneous electronic surveillance pursuant to proper legal authorization. CDT hopes that the publication of the basis of the FBI's surveillance capacity request will help to answer several critical questions about the proposal.  These include:* ARE THE PROPOSED SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT WITH  LAW ENFORCEMENT'S REAL NEEDS?Is the FBI seeking to expand its surveillance capacity in digital telecommunications networks beyond its current activity in the analog environment?The FBI has requested that, at a minimum, all telecommunications carriers nationwide ensure that .05% (.25% after 1998) of the "engineered capacity" of their networks be reserved for simultaneous surveillance activity, including wiretaps, trap and trace, and pen-registers (devices used to capture dialed number information).  Greater capacity would be required in some areas (up to 1% by 1998 in the most populated parts of the US). Although there is some dispute about what is meant by the term "engineered capacity", the proposed notice appears to allow law enforcement the ability to conduct a great deal more surveillance activity than they currently undertake (estimated to be between 850 and 1,000 per year nationwide).* WHAT ARE THE REAL NUMBERS?How much capacity is being asked for and how does it compare with today's surveillance levels?The proposed surveillance capacity requirements are based on a percentage of the "engineered capacity" of the telecommunications network.  In the notice, the FBI defines "engineered capacity" as "the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by that equipment, facility, or service".  There is some dispute over the meaning of this term.Taken on its face, the FBI's definition of "engineered capacity" appears to grant the FBI the capacity to conduct up to 1 wiretap for every 100 telephone subscribers in densely populated areas.  The FBI disputes this number, and has stated that "engineered capacity" refers to the number of subscribers who can be serviced *simultaneously* by a particular facility, equipment, or service.  The FBI maintains that by this definition, the actual number of simultaneous wiretaps would be far lower than some have estimated.Making public the basis of the FBI's surveillance capacity requests will help to clarify this issue.  However, regardless of the actual number, the FBI must demonstrate that it is not requesting unnecessary surveillance capacity.* DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS WITH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS FOR SURVEILLANCE   CAPACITY ABOVE THE NATIONAL MINIMUM?The FBI has proposed to undertake direct negotiations with telecommunications carriers for surveillance capacity beyond the proposed national minimum standard requested in the notice.  When Congress passed CALEA last year, it created a public process to bring law enforcement's electronic surveillance ability under public scrutiny in order to balance the new authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks.  The public accountability provisions of CALEA require the FBI to publish *all* surveillance capacity requests.  Congress must take a critical look at this aspect of the FBI's proposal, and should not appropriate funds until the FBI agrees to disclose all capacity requests, as required by the law.NEXT STEPS Public Accountability Requirements Of The Statute Must Be MetCDT will work closely with Senator Leahy and others to ensure that the FBI discloses the basis for its recent surveillance capacity request.  Once the information is made available, we will work with Senator Leahy, other interested members of Congress, public interest groups and the telecommunications industry to ensure that the FBI does not receive unnecessary surveillance capacity.  We will also work to ensure that no funding is made available until the public accountability provisions of the law are satisfied.

By a margin of 2 votes, the House Judiciary Committee failed to remove a provision of the House Immigration bill establishing a national registry of Social Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service data. The Committee instead agreed to limit the scope of the system and to require Congressional authorization before large scale implementation. Excerpts from the Committee debate and the vote breakdown are printed below.The effort to remove the national identification system provision is being led by Representative Steve Chabot (R-OH). Chabot offered an amendment to strike Section IV of HR. 2202, the "Immigration in the National Interest Act" (sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-TX) which would establish a national computer registry by combining Social Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service data. The 'Employment Eligibility Mechanism' as the provision is called in the legislation, would be used to monitor and track all hiring decisions made by employers nationwide. As a result, the ability of every American to work would be conditioned on the accuracy of the information in this national data system.Chabot's effort to remove the Employment Eligibility Mechanism was narrowly defeated 15 - 17. The committee instead approved an amendment offered by Rep. Martin Hoke (R-OH) to limit the scope of the program and require additional congressional authorization before a nation-wide system could be created. Debate now moves to the floor of the House, where another attempt to remove the provision altogether is likely. The 'Employment Eligibility Mechanism' has been vigorously opposed by a large and diverse coalition, including organization such as the ACLU, Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and individuals such as William Kristol (Project for the Republican Future), Jeff Eisenach (Progress and Freedom Foundation), and Jack Kemp (Empower America), among others (for more information, see CDT Policy Post No.15 URL:http://www.cdt.org/publications/pp150531.html).Representative Chabot's amendment to remove the Employment Eligibility Mechanism provision had broad bi-partisan support and the support of civil liberties advocates, ethnic organizations, business leaders, and labor and religious organizations. Chabot, who referred to the Employment Eligibility Mechanism as "1-800-BIG-BROTHER, deserves credit for bringing this issue to the forefront of the debate. Chabot has indicated that he will continue to press for the removal of the provision as the bill moves to the House Floor.Although the Committee did not remove the Employment Eligibility Mechanism provision, Rep. Hoke (R-OH) offered an amendment to limit the Employment Eligibility Mechanism to a pilot program which would be conducted in at least 5 of the 7 states with the largest number of unauthorized workers.   Under the Hoke amendment, the pilot projects sunset on October 1, 1991, and the system may not be established in non pilot states without additional action by Congress.  In addition, Rep. Becerra (D-CA) added language directing the Attorney General to include an analysis of the system's: 1) ease and reliability; 2) impact on job loss due to inaccurate or unavailable data; 3) effect on discrimination; 4) impact on privacy; and , 5) cost and administration to employers.  Both the Becerra and Hoke amendments were approved by a voice vote.CDT is pleased that the Committee moved to limit the scope of the Employment Eligibility Mechanism and that Congressional approval would be required to expand the program. However, CDT remains vigorously opposed to government efforts to establish large scale national computer registries to track and verify personal information about US Citizens. Such proposals clearly violate the privacy rights of Americans, and create the potential for large scale surveillance by law enforcement agencies and discrimination by employers. CDT will closely monitor the progress of this issue and will update you on its progress as the House moves forward.For More Information Contact:Deirdre Mulligan, Staff Councildeirdre@cdt.org----------------------------------------------------------------------(2) Breakdown of the Judiciary Committee vote to remove the Employment       Eligibility Mechanism (EEM) section form the House Immigration     legislation (HR 2202)In Favor of Removing the EEM              Opposed to Removing the EEM-----------------------------------------------------------------------Jim Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-WI)             Henry J.

Chabot's (R-OH) statement in favor of his amendment:The system has been referred to as dialing 1-800-BIG-BROTHER.  It will be costly to operate; it won't work; and it will send exactly the wrong message as to whether the government is to be the master or the servant of the people.  Our focus should be on illegal immigrants and the people who smuggle them in, not on innocent, law abiding American citizens.Now, some people argue that we should oppose this system because it will lead inevitably to a national ID card. . . But I believe that this system is tremendously misguided even if one does not believe that it will evolve into a national ID.  We should stop this habit of turning to the private sector and forcing small business to act more and more as an arm of the federal government.  And we should get the federal government out of the face of innocent citizens.Would this 1-800 number system even work?  I suppose that depends in part on your assumptions about whether those bad employers who now rely on undocumented labor would even call the number in the first place.  And it depends, of course, on your assumptions about the infallibility of government data and government employees.  Is everyone's name in the system now?  No.  Would every keystroke entered into the computer be perfectly executed?  Perhaps, but an error rate of only one percent would at the very least cause great heartache for about 650,000 Americans each year.  And while we may believe that government is perfect (I confess I don't), would the employer always record the correct verification number? Personally, I worry about getting those verification numbers wrong every time I order some ticket by telephone.                               *    *     *Would government be able to resist the temptation gradually to expand the uses of this new system once the set-up costs have been incurred?  Will we use it to track people, or to store more and more information on them?  The answer again depends on your view of government, informed perhaps by your view as to whether use of the social security numbers has up to now been limited to their initial function.But let's just consider the system at hand.  I just don't think I was sent here to establish this sort of bureaucracy.  And I'm not surprised that the spectrum of people opposing these provisions is extremely broad and encompasses folks who are all over the lot on other immigration issues. My amendment will strengthen the bill, Mr. Chairman, for I do not believe that this legislation will be able to carry the weight of 1-800-BIG-BROTHER when it comes to the floor.  I urge adoption of the amendment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------(4) HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CDT POLICY POST LISTCDT Policy Posts, which is what you have just finished reading, are the regular news publication of the Center For Democracy and Technology.

Weitzner, Deputy Director on behalf of the Center for Democracy and Technology On Privacy and Security Policy Issues Raised by Commercial Key Escrow Systems September 7, 1995 National Institute of Standards and TechnologyGaithersburg, MD I. Introduction My name is Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology.  The Center is pleased to have opportunity to provide comments on the Administrations proposed private key escrow policies.  The Center for Democracy and Technology is an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization in Washington, DC. The Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital communications media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building.  CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG), an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations and associations working on communications privacy issues.  In the past, members of the Working Group have strongly opposed the Administration's Clipper Chip and worked on the Digital Telephony bill now passed into law. CDT is pleased that the Administration has made the commitment to develop a comprehensive communications security policy.  The original announcement to base such a policy on the private key escrow principles espoused in the Vice President' letter of July 1994 had great promise.  As we will illustrate below, however, the policy announced in September 1995 falls far short of the goals outlined by the Vice President and the needs of individual users and the industry.  Indeed, without substantial modification, the policy offers little to users, the market, or privacy advocates.  However, we remain committed to working with the Administration and the Congress to develop a comprehensive and balanced encryption policy that will meet user privacy needs and the legitimate interests of law enforcement agencies.  We continue to believe that the Gore letter contained the road map for such a policy and hope that the current efforts can be redirected along those lines. II.	The Promise of the Gore Letter:  Potential for policy breakthrough to meet the needs users, industry, and law enforcement With the explosive growth of the Internet and other interactive media, United States encryption policy has gone from a relatively unnoticed backwater of national security policy, to a highly visible and highly contentious area of technology policy of great concern to many industry groups and privacy advocates alike.  In this transition, there have been some missteps, including the Clipper Chip initiative.  After an unsuccessful effort to build support for the Clipper Chip in the market and the policy arena, the Clinton Administration announced its intention to develop a new encryption policy that would strike a more reasonable balance between the needs of users, the demands of the computer and communications marketplace, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement.  The move away from reliance on the Clipper Chip marked an important turning point in the development of encryption policy.  First announced in a letter from Vice President Al Gore to Congresswoman Maria Cantwell on July 20, 1994, the Administration made a commitment to develop a policy framework that would promote the development of encryption systems that would meet the following criteria: Implementation in hardware or software:  After the hardware-only Clipper solution, the Administration recognized that any system must, according to the Gore letter, be "implementable in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof." Public, unclassified algorithms:  In order to assure users that their communications are truly secure, systems must employ encryption algorithms that are public, and thus subject to scrutiny by the broadest possible technical community.  Thus, the Vice President promised that the new policy "would not rely upon a classified algorithm." Voluntary:  Although the Clipper Chip was always described as a voluntary technology, considerable fears arose that its use might one day become mandatory.  The Gore letter asserted that any new policy must be based on purely voluntary standards. Fourth Amendment privacy safeguards:  Electronic surveillance constitutes an invasion of the most private realms of individual activity.  In order to protect individuals from unnecessary or excessive invasions by law enforcement agencies, Congress and the courts have instituted careful safeguards in the realm of traditional electronic surveillance through the telephone.  The Vice President's letter called for the extension of these protections in the form of "safeguards to provide for key disclosure only under legal authorization and should have audit procedures to ensure the integrity of the system." Statutory liability rules to protect users:  In order to encourage users to trust private escrow systems, "escrow holders should be strictly liable for releasing keys without legal authorization," according to the Gore letter. Multiple escrow agents:  Users must be free to chose their own escrow agents, unlike the Clipper proposal, so the Vice President declared that "a new key escrow encryption system must permit the use of private-sector key escrow agents as one option.... Having a number of escrow agents would give individuals and businesses more choices and flexibility in meeting their needs for secure communications." III.	Current Administration Proposal Fails to Meet High Standards Set out by the Vice President The policy announced by the Administration in its September 1, 1995 paper, unfortunately fails to meet many of the criteria that the Vice President himself announced just one year ago in the above mentioned letter.  On hearing that the Administration had set out to develop a new encryption policy based on the principles outlined in the Gore letter, the Center for Democracy and Technology was guardedly optimistic that a genuine policy breakthrough was possible.  However, having had the opportunity to review the current proposal, every principle, except the first (software implementation) and second (public algorithms), thoughtfully outlined in the July 1994 letter is violated or, in one case, left in doubt, by the September 1995 policy statement. The September 1995 policy statement diverges from the July 1994 letter in the following critical respects.  In our view, these divergences represent fundamental defects in the proposed policy and must be corrected. Not Voluntary:  The current proposal effectively compels all domestic users to use key escrow systems if they ever intend to communicate internationally.  Point 6 of the export criteria requires that an exportable system must not interoperate with any system that non-escrow systems.  Thus, in order for a user in the United States to communicate with anyone who uses a United States-made system on the Internet but outside of the United States, the American user must employ a key escrow system.  Domestic users are not legally compelled to use key escrow products, but the proposed policy forces, in practice, all but the most insular Internet user is propelled toward a key escrow system.  A policy based on such compulsion can hardly be called voluntary. Inadequate Security:  Point 1 precludes export of systems with key lengths beyond 64 bits.  Though this key size is larger than what is currently exportable, it is a level of security already judged inadequate for some applications.  Given the rate at which computing power increases, even a 64 bit key would be subject to attach before long.  The premise of the key escrow policy is to provide law enforcement and national security agencies a "front door" to be used to decrypt messages when the agency obtains proper legal authorization. Yet, the architects of the current policy apparently are not willing to trust that key escrow systems will meet law enforcement needs inasmuch as the key length limit suggests that the Administration is intent on maintaining an extra-legal method of decrypting communications. The Gore letter contains no suggestion that key escrow systems would also be subject to key length limits but the Administration seems to have lost faith in its own proposal. Such a half-hearted effort cannot be the basis of a long-lasting policy. No privacy protection for users of escrowed systems:  The ten export principles make no mention of privacy safeguards which the Vice President previously recognized as necessary to safeguard individual privacy and Fourth Amendment principles.  Any escrow policy must contain safeguards against abuse and statutory liability provisions for the operators of private escrow systems. Fails to Promote International Interoperability:  Points 6 and 10 of the export criteria raise grave doubts as to the likelihood that the current proposal will give rise to a secure global communications environment.  Point 10 forces users in other countries (and their governments) to accept United States-based escrow of all keys until bilateral access agreements are entered into.  Such tactics seem unlikely to produce satisfactory international agreements, and hold global communications security hostage to the completion of such agreements. IV.	Recommendations to Restore Current Process to Principles of Gore Letter The Administration's September 1 paper leaves many privacy concerns unanswered or simply rejected, and falls far short of the goals set in the Gore letter of July 1994.  However, CDT still believes that the Administration has embarked on a serious process which, along with appropriate Congressional involvement, can lead to a long-lasting resolution to the encryption policy morass that exists today.  CDT recommends the following steps be taken immediately to supplement the September 1 policy framework. A.	Legislation to protect user privacy, address legitimate law enforcement needs, and guarantee voluntariness Encryption is now a key enabling technology in the development of the National and Global Information Infrastructure.  The growth of electronic commerce, the protection of intellectual property, and the very viability of cyberspace as an economic, social, cultural and political arena depend on the widespread availability of strong encryption.  As such, encryption policy can no longer be made in the closed halls Executive Branch national security policy.  Like the Clipper Chip before it, the proposed key escrow policy framework places the National Security Agency in control of private sector computer security policy.  Such a role for the NSA is both detrimental to the growth of the information infrastructure and contrary to the principles of the Computer Security Act of 1987.  The Computer Security Act clearly established that neither military nor law enforcement agencies are the proper protectors of personal privacy.  When considering the law, Congress asked, "whether it is proper for a super-secret agency [the NSA] that operates without public scrutiny to involve itself in domestic activities...?"  The answer was a clear "no." As important as the principle of civilian control was in 1987, it is even more critical today.  The more individuals around the country come to depend on secure communications to protect their privacy, the more important it is to conduct privacy and security policy dialogues in public, civilian forums. If encryption policy is to be based on private key escrow as proposed by the Administration, legislative action is required to assure: Complete voluntariness:  No government action should compel individuals or corporations to use key escrow systems; User choice of among multiple private escrow agents:  Any entity that meets statutory criteria should be allowed to be an escrow agent.  Free market mechanisms should be allowed to meet the varying needs of users; User choice of encryption algorithm: Different users with different applications will need varying degrees of security and should be allowed to chose the level and type of encryption appropriate to their needs.  Individual choice and market innovation, not government fiat, should guide choice of encryption algorithm; Statutory framework for law enforcement access and agent liability for improper disclosure:  Under law, a private escrow agent could only legally disclose a users to those who are approved by the user, or to an authorized law enforcement agency, upon presentation of a 4th Amendment warrant. Private escrow agents (PEAs) would operate under a statutory framework which requires a PEA to hold private keys for users under a special standard of care and creates remedies in the event of unauthorized disclosure.  In providing assistance to enable law enforcement to decrypt communications, the PEA may not disclose the target's private key to law enforcement. However, as stated in the ten criteria and as much as is technically feasible, law enforcement should be assured speedy, uninterrupted access to decrypted communications once the surveillance is judicially approved. Audit trails for law enforcement access: PEA's would be legally required to configure their systems in such a way to create a trusted and complete audit trail of all key access events.  This audit function would provide key holders with the ability to seek damages from the PEA if necessary and could act as a check on law enforcement activity. B.	Export Control Reform Full Export Authorization:  Private key escrow systems that meet these principles should be fully exportable, under Commerce Department jurisdiction. End key-size limitations:  All properly escrowed encryption systems must be eligible for export, regardless of key size.  Since escrow systems would give law enforcement and national security agencies access to all communications, there can no longer be any justification for limiting key size. V.	Conclusion As measured by the demands of privacy and security, and by the standards set out in the 1994 Gore letter, the current key escrow policy proposals fall short of the mark.  However, CDT remains committed to working within the process set out by the Administration, and with the Congress, toward a speedy resolution of all of these critical encryption policy issues.

Weitzner, Deputy Director on behalf of the Center for Democracy and Technology on NIST's Proposed Key Escrow Export Criteria and the Search for a National Cryptography Policy December 5, 1995 National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg, MD I. 	Introduction Good afternoon, my name is Daniel Weitzner, Deputy Director of the Center for  Democracy and Technology ("CDT"). The Center is pleased to have this opportunity to  comment on the Administration's proposed private key escrow export criteria. CDT is  an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization in Washington, D.C. The Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance  individual liberty and democratic values in new digital communications media. The  Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition  building. CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group  (DPSWG), an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, and public interest organizations and associations working on communications privacy issues. In the past, members of the Working Group have strongly opposed the Administration's Clipper Chip proposal and have worked on the Digital Telephony bill passed into law last fall. CDT is pleased to be here again as part of the Administration's continuing efforts to engage industry and the public in a discussion of U.S. cryptography policy.   We are particularly concerned that the voice of Internet users be heard in this forum.  Unfortunately, today we must once again deliver the same message that civil liberties organizations, industry groups, and the cryptography user community have been repeating with increasing urgency over the last several years: this is the wrong approach to cryptography policy.  A cryptography policy based upon a narrow national security perspective that ignores the security needs of individual users is unlikely to form the sound basis for a secure worldwide communications infrastructure.  A cryptography policy without explicit privacy protections will never gain the trust of users or be embraced by the international marketplace. 	CDT believes that the Administration's proposal fails to meet the needs of the  user community.   Our chief concern is that the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) be a safe and secure place for those who use it. The Administration's proposal will not give users the security and privacy they need, and will keep the market from giving it to them as well. The NIST proposal will not provide adequate security, promote secure communications worldwide, or guarantee user privacy: Inadequate security in the near-term -- Does not provide any short-term liberalization of the insecure 40-bit key length limits on exports. No viable policy framework for the long-term -- Limits exportable key escrow systems to 64-bit keys lengths that many anticipate will soon be vulnerable; has little to offer in a market where 56-bit non-escrow products are readily available. Hinders the deployment of globally interoperable secure systems -- Delays the development of standards for secure communications due to its strict interoperability requirements. Not necessarily voluntary -- In practice, could act to coerce both the domestic and international markets for cryptography. Not viable in the marketplace -- Given that overseas users are unlikely to adopt its restrictions when strong, non-escrowed foreign cryptography products are readily available. No constitutional privacy protections -- Provides no standards for the release of escrowed keys, for certifying key agents, or for liability for the improper release of keys. Will not meet the needs of law enforcement -- Will not deny criminals or terrorists access to strong encryption, the stated objective of the policy. The firestorm of protest that greeted the introduction of the Clipper Chip proposal suggests the pitfalls of a policy approach driven largely by national security and law enforcement concerns. The latest NIST criteria continue to make policy within this narrow framework. The failure of this approach suggests that a broader view is appropriate. Forty participants in CDT's Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) have written to Vice President Gore protesting this latest cryptography initiative and committing to a six month collective policy development process, aimed at framing a more comprehensive cryptography policy that better recognizes the realities of the global marketplace and the privacy concerns of users. We look forward to working with the Administration in this process over the coming months. II.	Users Urgently Need Security, Privacy, and a More Comprehensive Approach to Cryptography Policy A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of Information Age society.  Developing that secure and trusted GII will require strong, flexible, widely-available cryptography. Individuals need to have confidence in the GII if they are to realize its full democratic potential for promoting free association and personal communications. Competitive businesses need to protect proprietary information as it flows across insecure global communications networks. To realize that democratic potential, individual users need the privacy protections that cryptography offers; to protect their proprietary communications, business users need the security only strong encryption can provide. In recent months, however, the public has been made increasingly aware of the dangers of computer crime and the vulnerability of current cryptography implementations. Rapid advances in the speed and sophistication of hardware and software have already laid siege to the 40-bit key systems currently approved for export, as well as the popular 56-bit DES algorithm. If we are to maintain the trust of the public and realize the full potential of the GII, a more comprehensive long-term approach to cryptography is needed -- one which particularly reflects the impact of technological change, of a global economy,  and of the increasingly important information infrastructure. The GII will simply not continue to develop without such a global approach to cryptography. The lack of any international standard for strong cryptography has already hindered the deployment of highly secure systems worldwide. Moreover, national and regional governments are increasingly considering regulations on the use of cryptography, just as the Council of Europe recently did.  Such actions threaten to create a patchwork of international regulations which would hinder the deployment of secure global communications and leave users without the security and privacy they need. In this context, the sole focus on national security needs embodied in the Administration's cryptography proposal is unlikely to meet the needs of GII users.  By maintaining the 40-bit key length restrictions on exports, it leaves users hamstrung with insecure systems. By proposing unattractive interoperability restrictions and minimal privacy protections for key escrow systems, it discourages the deployment of secure systems in U.S. products. Rather than being seamlessly incorporated into popular products, secure communications will remain out of reach for less sophisticated GII users. The resulting loss of security can be expected to have a chilling effect on the development of electronic commerce and the information infrastructure as the privacy and security needs of users are not met. III.	The NIST Criteria Have Been Widely Criticized by Industry, Public  Interest Groups, and the User Community For Not Meeting GII Security and Privacy Demands The vast majority of individuals and organizations who have expressed an opinion on the recent Administration initiative have been overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the proposal.  The NIST criteria have met with increasing criticism concerning security, privacy, technical feasibility, and marketplace viability.  In a series of letters this fall, individual companies, trade associations, and citizens groups, from an array of industries and across the political spectrum, have expressed their concern that the Administration's proposal will not meet the needs of GII users.  Some of the public interest groups critical of the NIST criteria include --  Conservative and taxpayer reform groups, including Americans for Tax Reform and officials from the Cato Institute, the Institute for Justice, the NRA, and Reason magazine -- "The Administration's approach is the wrong policy for today's marketplace. . . . It's anti-consumer", "anti-marketplace", "anti-American business", and "anti-progress." (Ad Hoc Taxpayer Coalition for Computer Privacy Letter to House Speaker Gingrich, Nov. 8, 1995) American Civil Liberties Union -- "The Administration should abandon its fruitless and unconstitutional efforts to control the export of encryption technology." (ACLU's Position on the Administration's Current Key Escrow Proposal, Oct. 4, 1995 Cyber_Liberties Alert) The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Electronic Privacy Information Center, and Voters Telecommunications Watch -- All have issued online statements critical of the NIST criteria. The NIST criteria have also been criticized by industry trade associations representing  dozens of companies directly involved in providing the goods and services that form the basis for the GII.  Some of the organizations expressing their concern that the criteria will not allow them to meet the needs of GII users include-- Business Software Alliance -- "After careful and serious deliberation by our members, we have concluded that the Administration's approach is fatally flawed and cannot be the basis for progress in this area." (BSA Letter to Vice President Gore, Nov. 9, 1995) Software Publisher's Association -- "There are severe and fundamental flaws in the criteria proposed for exportable key escrow systems." (SPA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 26, 1995) Information Technology Industry Council -- "ITI believes the proposal does not adequately meet the needs of industry or users, not does it sufficiently recognize the importance of information security to economic growth and industrial society in the information age." (ITI Letter to Vice President Gore, Oct. 10, 1995) The Information Technology Association of America -- "[I]ts restrictive policies on the export of encryption technology has created a major barrier to realizing the Administration's vision. . . [T]he Administration's key escrow encryption proposal .announced on August 17, 1995 has some fundamental flaws." (ITAA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 27, 1995) Finally, a broad group containing forty members of the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG), including companies, trade associations, and public interest groups, together wrote to the Vice President: Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG) -- "[T]he proposed initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute for a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering the development of a secure and trusted GII." (DPSWG Letter to Vice President Gore, Nov. 8, 1995) This letter was signed by individual companies from across several industry groups, and included America Online, Apple Computer, AT&T, Dun & Bradstreet, MCI, Microsoft, Oracle, Sybase, and Tandem, along with public interest groups such as CDT, EFF, and the Media Institute. These DPSWG members also pledged to commence "a process of collective fact-finding and policy deliberation, aimed at building consensus around a more comprehensive cryptography framework." A copy of the DPSWG Letter to Vice President Gore is attached as an Appendix to this testimony. IV.	The NIST Proposal Will Not Meet the Cryptography Needs of Users,  Such as Adequate Security, Privacy, International Acceptance or Voluntary Use The 40 DPSWG participant companies, trade associations, and public interest groups who together wrote to Vice President Gore in November also presented a set of goals for a more comprehensive cryptography policy.  These goals included: Robust security:  access to levels of encryption sufficient to address domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less secure. International interoperability: the ability to securely interact worldwide. Voluntary use: freedom for users to choose encryption solutions, developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs. Acceptance by the marketplace: commercial viability and ability to meet the expressed needs of cryptography users. Constitutional privacy protections: safeguards to ensure basic Fourth Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and interceptions. Respect for the legitimate needs of law enforcement and national security, while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will have access to virtually unbreakable encryption. Many of these organizations and companies have argued individually that various aspects of the NIST criteria do not meet these goals.  Taken together, these arguments provide a compelling critique of the Administration's cryptography policy: A.	The NIST criteria will not provide adequate security. Widely-accessible strong cryptography is the cornerstone of a secure and trusted GII, and is essential to promote electronic commerce and communication.  The provisions of the Administration's proposal that impose a 64-bit key length limit for key escrow systems, and retain 40-bit key length limits for non-escrowed systems, present a real challenge to user needs for adequate security both in the short- and long-term. The NIST proposal provides no immediate liberalization of the insecure 40-bit key length limit The 40-bit key lengths widely available and exportable today have proven increasingly insecure. Stories in the popular press continue to point out network and application vulnerabilities. As a result users remain distrustful, hindering the development of the nascent but important economic promise of the GII. Moreover, domestic hardware, software, and communications companies remain hamstrung by the export criteria in the face of competing foreign products that already contain the sorts of security valued in the marketplace. Even if the NIST criteria were to be adopted, it will take some time before the details of key escrow systems can be worked out -- including the technical development of systems meeting the NIST criteria, the standards for and certification of escrow agents, the adoption of privacy guidelines, and the integration of such systems into widely-used software products. Individuals and industry need immediate relief to allow for a much-needed upgrade of security on the GII and the development of competitive products that meet security needs today. As the SPA recently stated, "The key escrow policy process will necessarily be protracted. Meanwhile, there remains -- more strongly than it did in 1992 -- an immediate commercial need for the exportability of non-escrow encryption that can complete in the global marketplace. . . ." (SPA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 26, 1995) 64-bit key escrow is not a secure long-term policy. The popular 56-bit DES algorithm has proven increasingly susceptible to brute-force attack. Advances in computational power have led experts to question the security of 64-bit keys beyond the near term. As the ITAA noted, "[E]nd-users' confidence in 56-bit encryption is weakening and even DES may soon be obsolete. . . . Even [decontrol of 64-bit encryption] will have to be addressed again in the not too distant future given the march of technology and rapid increases in computing power." (ITAA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 27, 1995) Users are unlikely to choose 64-bit key escrow systems when non-escrow 56-bit DES and stronger foreign products are readily available. As SPA noted in it's letter to the Vice President, "[K]ey escrow systems will simply not be marketable in a world in which non-escrow encryption is widely available at strengths stronger than 40 bits." (SPA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 26, 1995) B.  The NIST criteria will hinder international interoperability and the development of an international cryptography standard. Under the NIST criteria, exportable key escrow systems would not be permitted to interoperate with strong systems that do not meet the criteria. These restrictions impede international interoperability in several ways. The interoperability restrictions would immediately create a barrier between those who obey the criteria and those who use some other form of strong encryption.  In addition, the continuation of a U.S. export control policy similarly creates a two-tier market with a barrier between products available in the U.S. and products available outside of it. Finally, it is unlikely that foreign users will embrace the NIST criteria as a standard when there is conveniently available non-escrow encryption of similar or greater strength available. All of these, taken together, will serve to hinder the development of global standards for the use of cryptography. C.	The NIST criteria act to use export controls to coerce the domestic cryptography markets. Interoperability restrictions and other criteria may function as an attempt to use export restrictions to influence the domestic market in an effort to solve domestic law enforcement problems. Domestic users will be forced to meet the export criteria if they wish to communicate with systems outside of the U.S. that also meet the criteria. If, for example, a domestic corporation using Eudora mail software with strong encryption wanted to communicate with a foreign affiliate using the same U.S.-made software, both versions of the software would have to meet the NIST export criteria. Furthermore, the desire of companies to sell product lines that interoperate with each other, taken together with NIST's interoperability restrictions and export limits, could work to force the adoption of a cryptography standard based on the NIST criteria. As BSA noted in its letter to the Vice President, "The Administration appears to be trying to leverage our companies' desire to export their programs in order to force those companies to include features in the programs they sell abroad and in the U.S. . . .  Thus, in the name of 'national security,' it appears that the Administration really is attempting to satisfy domestic law enforcement concerns -- without industry input, public debate, or congressional involvement." (BSA Letter to Vice President Gore, Nov. 9, 1995) D.  Products meeting the NIST criteria will not be viable in the international marketplace. The NIST criteria fail to recognize that equally secure, non-escrowed foreign encryption products are readily available overseas.  Foreign products are already adopting 56-bit or better encryption, without having to meet the NIST requirements.  (For example, Trusted Information Systems, Inc. has documented the availability of 179 foreign products incorporating the popular 56-bit DES.)  Moreover, international users are much more likely to adopt products without the NIST criteria. Requirements such as NIST-imposed interoperability restrictions, or key escrow criteria that provide no due process and privacy guarantees, will make U.S. products less attractive than foreign products with similar or better security. E. 	The NIST criteria do not include any constitutional privacy protections. The export criteria contain no explicit provisions for constitutional  privacy safeguards to govern the use of key escrow systems. The criteria do not offer any guidelines for obtaining escrowed keys, nor are there any requirements for notifying users whose keys have been accessed. No standards are presented for how key escrow agents will be "certified by the government", or what redress will be available against escrow agents that improperly release keys. Moreover, the criteria provide no explanation of how the standards will be applied to foreign citizens, or by foreign countries that support individual privacy in ways that may be radically different from the protections guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution. F.	NIST criteria may not actually promote the needs of law enforcement. Any system which expects to solve law enforcement problems must be attractive enough to users to be adopted widely.  Interoperability restrictions, weak security, and missing privacy protections make it less likely that users will adopt a U.S. key escrow system. As the ITAA also noted,  "[E]xport restrictions that do not reflect marketplace realities may drive U.S. companies to move their encryption work off shore . . . defeating the very purpose of the restrictions." (ITAA Letter to Vice President Gore, Sept. 27, 1995) Moreover, the international nature of the Internet makes it virtually impossible to ever guarantee that determined individuals will not have access to strong cryptography. While criminals will always have privacy, the users with insecure networks will be individuals and organizations forced to adopt the NIST criteria. IV. 	Conclusion: The Urgent Need for a More Comprehensive Approach A comprehensive approach to cryptography policy -- one that provides real security, is truly voluntary, contains explicit privacy protections, and is acceptable to the international market  -- is greatly needed to smooth the emergence of a secure and trusted information infrastructure. Unfortunately, the Administration's proposal does not meet this need.  This most recent NIST proposal comes at a time of great urgency in the development of electronic commerce, digital communication, and the GII.  GII users are searching for tools to provide the privacy and security they need to realize the full democratic, and commercial, potential of the emerging information age society.  Last year, Vice President Gore's letter to Representative Maria Cantwell held out hope for the user community by laying out a set of guiding principles for a more comprehensive approach to national cryptography policy. Perhaps these goals can form the starting point for a renewed look at cryptography policy.  In their November letter to Vice President Gore, members of the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group pledged to work together over the next six months to seek a consensus around just such a more comprehensive cryptography policy. CDT invites all who are interested to participate in this open process of collective fact-finding and policy debate over the next several months. We thank NIST for continuing this dialogue, and look forward to working with the Administration in the months ahead.

Excerpts may be re-posted by permission (editor@cdt.org)------------------------------------------------------------------------(1) FBI Surveillance Capacity Request Fails to Meet Public Accountability     Requirements of Digital Telephony BillThe Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) and the Center for National Security Studies (CNSS), in comments filed Tuesday (1/16), argued that theimplementation of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, a.k.a the 'Digital Telephony legislation") cannot proceed because the FBI has not justified its proposal for surveillance capacity, as required by law. CALEA, enacted in October of 1994, granted the FBI an unprecedented new role in the design of telecommunications networks to accommodate electronic surveillance. In order to protect against abuse, and to ensure that privacy and security are not compromised, Congress balanced the FBI's new authority with a detailed public process to ensure oversight and accountability.  Thus, CALEA also created an unprecedented opportunity for those concerned about privacy to have their say over law enforcement's surveillance ability.CDT and CNSS argued that no funds should be appropriated by Congress or spent to fund the implementation of the Digital Telephony law until the FBI meets these public accountability requirements.PUBLIC OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF CALEAThe public accountability provisions of CALEA, which created a detailed public process for determining law enforcement surveillance capacity requirements, require the Bureau to disclose the factual basis for its recent capacity request. Without such data, it is impossible for the public and other interested parties to determine whether the proposed surveillance capacity is reasonable.As Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), co-author of CALEA, emphasized during the August 11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:   "To allay public concern over the breadth of wiretapping in     America, the entire [compliance] process remains subject to     public scrutiny, oversight, and accountability. This bill     accomplishes this by requiring any standards or technical     requirements that industry adopts to ensure wiretap capability     be publicly available." (House/Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing     on CALEA, August 11, 1994, S. HRG. 103-1022, page 111)As a result, CALEA contains several mechanisms to bring law enforcement's surveillance ability under public scrutiny, including the creation of a public process for determining law enforcement's surveillance requirements and a requirement that government reimburse telecommunications carriers for all modifications required to meet the requirements. These provisions were intended to allow privacy advocates and other concerned individuals to have a substantive voice in the compliance process.  The publicaccountability provisions of CALEA are essential to ensuring that law enforcement and does not take actions that expand surveillance authority or jeopardize the privacy and security of telecommunications networks.  The comments filed by CDT, CNSS, EPIC, and industry associations such as the United States Telephone Association (USTA) and the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), and other interested parties, are the strongest example yet of the public accountability mechanisms in action. CDT & CNSS ARGUE FBI NOTICE FAILS TO COMPLY WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS OF CALEAIn joint comments filed January 16, CDT and CNSS told the FBI that its October 16, 1995 proposal does not contain critical information necessary for interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's request. Among other things:* The notice does not disclose the historical baseline data that the FBI     itself used to determine the proposed surveillance capacity   requirements. Without this information, it is impossible for the   public to determine whether the proposed surveillance levels are   reasonable.* Has not disclosed certain details that CALEA itself requires to be   published, including the actual number of expected future   surveillances and the geographic locations where such capacity will be   necessary;* Has not clearly defined "engineered capacity", a key term. The scope   of surveillance capacity available to the FBI varies greatly depending   on the definition of this term;Until the FBI meets these public accountability requirements, no funds should be appropriated by Congress or spent to fund the implementation of the Digital Telephony law.CDT stands ready to intervene as necessary before Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards bodies charged with setting technical standards for implementing the requirements, and at other points necessary to ensure that privacy is protected and the public accountability provisions are strictly enforced.  We will continue to update you on developments on this issue as they occur.

Competitive businesses need cryptography to protect proprietary information as it flows across increasingly vulnerable global networks. Individuals require privacy protection in order to build the confidence necessary to use the GII for personal and financial transactions.  Promoting the development of the GII and meeting the needs of the Information Age will require strong, flexible, widely-available cryptography.  The undersigned groups recognize that the Administration's recently articulated cryptography initiative was a serious attempt to meet some of these challenges, but the proposed initiative is no substitute for a comprehensive national cryptography policy.  To the extent that the current policy becomes a substitute for a more comprehensive policy, the initiative actually risks hindering the development of a secure and trusted GII. A number of the undersigned organizations have already written to express concern about the latest Administration cryptography initiative. As some of us have noted, the Administration's proposed export criteria will not allow users to choose the encryption systems that best suit their security requirements.  Government ceilings on key lengths will not provide an adequate level of security for many applications, particularly as advances in computing render current cryptography systems less secure.   Competitive international users are steadily adopting stronger foreign encryption in their products and will be unlikely to embrace U.S. restrictions.  As they stand, current export restrictions place U.S. hardware manufacturers, software developers, and computer users at a competitive disadvantage, seriously hinder international interoperability, and threaten the strategically important U.S. communications and computer hardware and software industries. Moreover, the Administration policy does not spell out any of the privacy safeguards essential to protect individual liberties and to build the necessary public trust in the GII. The current policy directive also does not address the need for immediate liberalization of current export restrictions. Such liberalization is vital to enable U.S. companies to export state-of-the-art software products during the potentially lengthy process of developing and adopting a comprehensive national cryptography policy. Without relief, industry and individuals alike are faced with an unworkable limit on the level of security available and remain hamstrung by restrictions that will not be viable in the domestic and international marketplace. Many members of the undersigned groups have been working actively with the Administration on a variety of particular applications, products, and programs promoting information security.  All of us are united, however, by the concern that the current network and information services environment is not as secure as it should be, and that the current policy direction will delay the secure, private, and trusted environment that is sought. Despite the difficulties of balancing the competing interests involved, the undersigned companies, trade associations, and privacy organizations are commencing a process of collective fact-finding and policy deliberation, aimed at building consensus around a more comprehensive cryptography policy framework that meets the following criteria:  Robust security: access to levels of encryption sufficient to address domestic and international security threats, especially as advances in computing power make currently deployed cryptography systems less secure. International interoperability: the ability to securely interact worldwide. Voluntary use: freedom for users to choose encryption solutions, developed in the marketplace, that meet their particular needs. Acceptance by the marketplace: commercial viability and ability to meet the expressed needs of cryptography users. Constitutional privacy protections: safeguards to ensure basic Fourth Amendment privacy protection and regulation of searches, seizures, and interceptions. Respect for the legitimate needs of law enforcement and national security, while recognizing the reality that determined criminals will have access to virtually unbreakable encryption. In six months, we plan to present our initial report to the Administration, the Congress, and the public in the hopes that it will form the basis for a more comprehensive, long-term approach to cryptography on the GII. We look forward to working with the Administration on this matter. Sincerely, American Electronics Association America Online, Inc. Apple Computer, Inc.

One of the most egregious of      these has been the governmentally set limits on so-called "encryption"      technologies.  Today I am introducing a bill to address this major      problem for businesses and users of the Internet.           If the telecommunications law enacted this year is a vehicle to      achieve real changes in the ways we interact with each other      electronically, my bill is the engine that will allow this vehicle to      move forward.  The bill would promote the growth of electronic      commerce, encourage the widespread availability to strong privacy and      security technologies for the Internet, and repeal the out-dated      regulations prohibiting the export of encryption technologies.          This legislation is desperately needed because the Clinton      administration continues to insist on restricting encryption exports,      without regard to the harm this policy has on American businesses'      ability to compete in the global marketplace or the ability of      American citizens to protect their privacy online.  Until we get the      federal government out of the way and encourage the development of      strong cryptography for the global market, electronic commerce and the      potential of the Internet will not be realized.          The last thing the Net needs are repressive and outdated regulations      prohibiting the exports of strong privacy and security tools and      making sure that the government has copies of the keys to our private      communications.  Yet this is exactly the situation we have today.          My new bill, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era      (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996, would:          - Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or      "public-domain" encryption programs, including such products as Pretty      Good Privacy and popular World Wide Web browsers.          - Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export      of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are      generally available outside the United States.          - Prohibit the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow      encryption policies on the domestic market and limit the authority of      the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.          Removing export controls will dramatically increase the domestic      availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security products and      encourage the use of the Internet as a forum of secure electronic      commerce. It will also undermine the Clinton Administration's      "Clipper" proposals which have used export restrictions as leverage to      impose policies that guarantee government access to our encryption      keys.          The Pro-CODE bill is similar to a bill I co-authored with Senator      Patrick Leahy of Vermont, except that it highlights the importance of      encryption to electronic commerce and the need to dramatically change      current policy to encourage its growth.  My bill does not add any new      criminal provisions and does not establish legal requirements for      key-escrow agents.          Over the coming months, I plan to hold hearings on this bill and      encourage a public debate on the need to change the Clinton      Administration's restrictive export control policies.  I will need      your support as we move forward towards building a global Internet      that is good for electronic commerce and privacy.  I look forward to      working with the Internet community, online activists, and the      computer and communications industry as this proposal moves through      Congress.          I'd like to hear from you, so please join me on two upcoming online      events to talk about the new bill.  The first is on America Online in      the News Room auditorium at 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 6.       The second will be on Hotwired's Chat at 9 p.m. EDT on May 13.          In the meantime, I need your help in supporting the effort to repeal      cryptography export controls.  You can find out more by visiting my      web page http://www.senate.gov/~burns/.  There you will find a      collection of encryption education resources that my Webmaster has      assembled.  I trust that the entire Internet community, from the      old-timers to those just starting to learn about encryption, will find      this information useful.          This bill is vital to all Americans, from everyday computer users and      businesses to manufacturers of computer software and hardware.  I very      much look forward to working with you on this issue.

While this development is obviously good newsfor Zimmermann, who was the undeserved target of a long and arduousinvestigation, criminal threates against those who seek to protect theirprivacy remain in place.The Justice Department had been investigating Zimmermann for possibleviolations of Arms Control Regulations of after PGP was posted to Usenetnewsgroups and subsequently distributed through the worldwide Internet inthe spring of 1991.CDT wishes to extend heartfelt congratulations to Phil, who hasdemonstrated remarkable patience and perseverance in the face of harassmentand intimidation by the Federal Government.  Instead of laying low andwaiting for the outcome of the investigation, Phil took the offensive andbecame the leading figure in the effort to provide easy to use, strongcryptographic applications to the masses. CDT hopes that Phil will remainactive in the fight to encourage the relaxation of export restrictions andaccess to strong cryptography.FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES REMAIN -- EXPORT OF STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHY STILLPROHIBITED, FUTURE PROSECUTIONS OF CRYPTOGRAPHERS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTSTILL POSSIBLEAlthough the announcement by the Justice Department is a tremendouspersonal victory for Phil Zimmermann, government restrictions on encryptionexports remain firmly in place. As such, the current Administration policyis a major roadblock to privacy and security, as well as the future ofcommerce, on the Internet. The Clinton Administration continues to push fora national cryptography policy based on key-escrow and limited key lengths.In addition, the Administration's current policy proposal seeks to useexport controls as a means to influence the domestic marketplace forcryptographic applications.The decision to drop the case against Zimmermann also leaves unresolved thequestion of whether posting materials on the Internet could result in theviolation of export control regulations.  Although Zimmermann's defense wasbased in part on the argument that the First Amendment protects suchpostings, that question remains undressed.  As a result, developers ofstrong cryptographic applications who make their programs available on theInternet may in the future face harassment and indictments from the FederalGovernment.  This issue is currently pending before Federal Judges in theKarn and Bernstein cases.BACKGROUND ON THE DISPUTEThe export of cryptographic applications with key lengths above 40 bits iscurrently illegal under the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations(ITAR).  The Government maintains that these restrictions are necessary inorder to protect national security, and has successfully fought efforts torepeal or relax the export controls (including efforts by fmr. Rep. MariaCantwell (D-WA) in 1994).  Privacy advocates and the computer hardware andsoftware industry argue that the export controls stifle the development ofstrong cryptography both domestically and internationally, underminingprivacy and security on the global information infrastructure.When Zimmermann published PGP in 1990, it was among the first widelyavailable and relatively easy to use cryptographic applications, and forthe first time provided the average citizen with the ability to protectsensitive information on the relatively insecure Internet. In the eyes ofthe Government however, PGP represented a threat to national security andlaw enforcement. Although the government has announced that it will notprosecute Zimmerman, government efforts to restrict the distribution ofstrong cryptography will no dobut continue.As privacy advocates, we must not allow Zimmermann's victory to conceal thelarger issues.  Privacy, security, and commerce on the Internet remainhostage to export restrictions, the National Security Agency, and ClintonAdministration efforts to impose an unworkable key-escrow regime.For more information on the Administration's current cryptography policyinitiative and what CDT is doing to fight it, visit CDT's cryptographyissues web page.

Excerpts may be re-posted by permission (editor@cdt.org)------------------------------------------------------------------------(1) TEXT OF LATEST VERSION OF THE CDA -- STILL UNCONSTITUTIONALThe House/Senate telecommunications reform conference committee has released a preliminary draft of the final telecommunications reform bill, which includes provisions which would impose broad government regulations on constitutionally protected speech online. The text of these provisions is attached below.The attached version of the CDA contains the changes approved at the December 6, 1995 conference committee meeting, where members voted to adopt Rep. Rick White's proposal but with significant changes, including a return to the unconstitutional "indecency" standard (See CDT Policy Post No. 32, 12/6/95). The conferees have made several important changes to the legislation, none of them are particularly favorable to cyberspace-rights advocates. Among other things, the latest draft:* Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency"   standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c))* Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making   indecent material available for display in a manner available to a   minor (including world wide web pages, ftp sites, or usenet   newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)).* No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill   prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the    Internet or other interactive media.* Contains weaker protections for content providers who label content   and enable others to block it (e.g., PICS) have been weakened (Sec 502   (e)(5).* Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial   activities such as free-nets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers   (Sec 502 (h)).* Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer,   the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec   508).The full text of the new proposal is attached below.CDT believes that this proposal threatens the very existence of the Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political discourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.  NEXT STEPS: FINAL AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED, VOTE COULD OCCUR SOONAs you know, the CDA is part of the massive telecommunications reform legislation, which is currently being considered by a House/Senate conference committee. The conference committee has not reached agreement on several key  issues, including whether the FCC should be permitted to regulate the Internet, broadcast ownership rules, and other issues. Reps. Rick White, Chris Cox, and others are currently fighting to retain the provisions baring the FCC from regulating online content. A final vote by the conferees to send the bill to the full congress will not occur until an agreement is reached on this and other outstanding issues.As of Thursday January 4, 1996, the conferees have NOT yet voted to send a version of the legislation to the Full House and Senate for a final vote. No vote has been scheduled, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich has stated that no vote will occur until Congress finishes work on the Budget. CDT will continue to fight these provisions, and will work to remove them from the final telecommunications bill. We are also preparing to fight this issue in court, if necessary.

Bliley, Jr.  ChairmanCommittee on CommerceUnited States House of RepresentativesWashington, DC 20515 The Honorable Larry Pressler, ChairmanCommittee on Commerce, Science, and TransportationUnited States SenateWashington, DC 20510  Re: Computer Pornography Provisions in Telecommunications Bill Dear Mr. Chairmen: We are writing to urge the conference committee seeking to reconcile thetelecommunications bills passed by the House and Senate include in thefinal bill the strongest possible criminal law provisions to address thegrowing and immediate problem of computer pornography without anyexemptions, defenses, or political favors of any kind accorded to thosewho knowingly participate in the distribution of obscenity to anyone orindecency to children. While there is no perfect solution to the problemof computer pornography, Congress could not hope to solve this problem byholding liable only some who are responsible for the problem. The recent Justice Department prosecution project targeting those whoviolated federal child pornography law using America On-Line isinstructive in this regard. More than ninety individuals were targeted forprosecution although many others, perhaps as many as 3,000 according toone press report, were originally targeted by the Department of Justice aspotential violators of child pornography laws. Apparently due to ashortage of investigative and prosecutorial resources, the project waslimited. Since there are insufficient resources to investigate andprosecute but a fraction of those that are trafficking in childpornography by computer, then there will likely be even fewer resourcesavailable to investigate and prosecute those involved in obscenity andindecency. Thousands of individuals both in this country and abroad are regularlyplacing obscenity and indecency on the Internet. It is not possible tomake anything more than a dent in the serious problem of computerpornography if Congress is willing to hold liable only those who placesuch material on the Internet while at the same time giving legalexemptions or defenses to service or access providers who profit from andare instrumental to the distribution of such material. The JusticeDepartment normally targest the major offenders of laws. In obscenitycases prosecuted to date, it has targeted large companies which have beenresponsible for the nationwide distribution of obscenity and who have madelarge profits by violating federal laws. Prosecution of such companies hasmade a substantial impact in curbing the distribution of obscenity, withmany such offenders going out of business altogether. So too willprosecution of access providers which _knowingly_ traffic in obscenityhave a substantial impact, a far greater impact than just the prosecutionof a person who places one or a few prohibited images on the Internet.Such a person could not traffic in pornography without the aid orfacilitation of the service or access providers. Indeed, if Congressincludes provisions protecting access or service providers in whateverbill is finally passed, it is likely that most in this country who aretrafficking in indecency to children or obscenity would continue to do sosince the threat of prosecution would be minuscule, given the numbers ofthose currently involved in this activity. It is also likely that thoseoutside our country who are engaged in these activities would continue todo so since it would be nearly impossible to extradite them to the UnitedStates for prosecution. Thus, unless all who knowingly participate in suchmatters are subject to the law, the Internet will remain the same andCongress will have failed in its responsibilities to the children andfamilies of America. Federal law has traditionally assigned equal liability both for those whocommit a crime and those who aid and abet a crime. See Title 18 U.S.C.Code Section 2: "(a) whoever [sic] commits an offense against the UnitedStates or aids, abets, councils [sic], commands, induces, or procures itscommission, is punishable as a principle [sic]." Service or accessproviders who knowingly participate in the distribution of indecency tochildren or in obscenity to anyone are aiders and abettors in thecommission of those crimes and thus should have liability under any lawCongress passes. Current federal law on child pornography provides no noexemption or defense for access providers. Thus, the child pornography lawprovides a strong deterrent against trafficking in child pornography forthose who would otherwise knowingly participate in its distribution bycomputer whether pedophile or access provider. The changes in law which we support would not hold an access providercriminally liable for all illegal pornography on the Internet which theirservices may be used to obtain. Nor would it require that access providerscheck all communications to ensure that no violations of the law areoccurring. They would simply be required to avoid knowing violations ofthe law. This is an obligation imposed on all citizens. Technology existstoday for access providers, through a simple process, to target or flagand remove files containing objectionable material. We support the House-passed language insofar as it addresses obscenity byamendment Title 18, Sections 1462, 1465, and 1467 of the United StatesCode. The provision restricting transmission of indecency in the House-passedbill, an amendment to Section 1465, is inadequate, and we urge that it besubstantially revised. Attached is the specific language we support which includes the Housepassed language on obscenity and includes revisions on both the Housepassed language on indecency, which would amend Title 18 and theSenate-passed language on indecency, which would amend Title 47. Thecombination of these provisions, we believe, would provide effective lawsto curb obscenity and indecency on the Internet by establishing that allwho knowingly participate in the distribution or facilitation of obscenityto anyone or indecency to children would be subject to the law.

March 28, 1995, TuesdayMORALITY IN MEDIA CALLS FOR REJECTION OF SENATOR EXON'S 'COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT'Robert Peters, president of Morality in Media, today called for rejection of Senator Exon's "Communications Decency Act Of 1995," which was reported out of the SenateCommerce Committee on March 23.  Mr. Peters said:"A Communications Decency Act of 1995 is needed and, clearly, Congress can control 'cyberspace' to prohibit obscenity entirely, irrespective of a commercial purpose and irrespective of whether 'consenting adults only' are involved, and to restrict indecency."Obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, and is already prohibited on broadcast, cable and satellite TV and by means of telephone.  Restrictions on indecency have also been upheld in the broadcast media and by means of telephone.  "But Senator Exon's bill has serious constitutional problems and does adisservice to the American people.  It is a giant step backwards"Among the bill's defects cited by Mr. Peters are the following:* It may very well prevent the United States, or any state, from   prosecuting much non-commercial computer obscenity in that a person   who makes obscenity available cannot be held responsible if it is the  recipient who "initiates" the transmission (even if that recipient is   a child).* By attempting to ban non-commercial indecent telephone calls and other    telecommunications transmissions to adults, the bill violates the 1989   united States Supreme Court Sable case, thus rendering  unconstitutional any protections for children.* It reduces the protection of the existing Dial-A-Porn law by among   other things requiring that commercial violators have actual knowledge   of the content of obscene or indecent communications -- a condition   easily evaded -- and providing a new "defense" for some commercial   providers of obscene telephone communications.* A provision of the bill aimed at pornography on cable TV speaks to  programs "unsuitable for children" -- a vague standard suggested to be  unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its Erzoznik case, in which  the Court said: "Speech that is neither obscene to youths or subject   to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to   protect the young from ... images a legislative body thinks unsuitable     for them."    Mr. Peters added:"Yet other provisions in this bill send a clear message to America'stelecommunications industry that the new Congress will place little ifany responsibility on it for the obscenity available on its systems,even in circumstances where it 'knows' that such material is availableand has 'editorial control.' "On-line services are not common carriers but despite lip service tothat fact in the Exon bill, on-line services are provided withprotections which should only be available, if at all, to commoncarriers."

Re-printed with permission. From Communications Daily, Thursday June 1 1995 DRAFT BILL WOULD GIVE FCC ROLE IN REGULATING ON-LINE SPEECH Civil Liberties Groups Opposed FCC could become involved for first time in efforts to keepindecent speech off on-line services under new draft proposal forlegislation circulating in Congress.  Proposed changes would bemade in language sponsored by Sen. Exon (D-Neb.) that's included inS-652.  Newest version further attempts to limit exposure ofchildren to indecent material, while providing new defenses foron-line operators.  However, civil liberties groups charge thatattempt at compromise falls short. New draft is aimed at information providers who transmit ormake available "any indecent comment, request, suggestion,proposal, image or other communications to any person under 18years of age."  Additional language would provide new defenses foron-line providers, including that they didn't have "editorialcontrol" over material;  however, provision wouldn't apply toprovider that gave up editorial control with knowledge that companywith control intended to violate law. Proposal also would allow FCC to prescribe by regulationprocedures or reasonable steps to prevent transmission of indecentcommunications.  According to draft bill:  "Such steps and FCCprocedures may include enabling the user to restrict or preventaccess to communications described in this section." Jill Lesser of People for the American Way said that civilliberties groups "are still not satisfied" with new draft and thatdraft language, proposed by on-line service providers, JusticeDept. and American Family Assn., isn't acceptable.  She said therehave been talks to try to replace Exon's language with billproposed by Sen Leahy (D-Vt.) calling for study of on-lineobscenity, but Exon hasn't agreed to withdraw his wording.  Draftwas put together by Exon staff after consultation with industry,groups concerned with social issues, DoJ.  Officially,Administration officials said new draft hadn't changed theirposition as outlined in letter to Leahy in May that said Exon billcould pose hazards for law enforcement in addition to harm to civilliberties.  Senate is expected to take up telecommunications billnext week after finishing work on terrorism legislation. ACLU said in analysis of draft that new language "in itsexisting or revised form, violates both free speech and privacyrights."  It added:  "The Exon amendment cannot be 'fixed.'  Itmust be rejected."  Among ACLU's objections:  (1) There's nodefinition of obscenity.  Group said govt. has "chosen to stageprosecutions" to take advantage of community standards, in case ofTenn. postal inspector downloading material from Cal. bulletinboard.  (2) It would extend liability for obscene or indecentcommunications to noncommercial providers, change that would be"more restrictive" than original Exon bill.  (3) It would providenew defenses for on-line operators, but ACLU said smaller systemoperators probably couldn't afford court case to prove innocence. (4) Involvement of FCC should be eliminated:  "Giving federalregulators the authority to determine the rules for distributingon-line content will radically affect the freedom of cyberspace andwill have a severe direct effect and an equally severe chillingeffect on on-line speech." Center for Democracy & Technology said bill still would beunconstitutional because regulation of indecency has been approvedby courts only in very limited cases.  It would be impossible todetermine what's indecent, Center said, and prohibited items wouldinclude rap music lyrics or novel Lady Chatterly's Lover, althoughthose would be available in other locations.  On question of FCCinvolvement, Center said:  "Instead of just passing this criticalquestion off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify bothlegal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more andmore flexible and accessible user control techniques." Center also said noncommercial information providers would beput at disadvantage by preempting some state laws, but leavelibraries, schools and others subject to more regulation:  "We findno valid public policy argument which would accord greaterprotection to commercial speech than is granted to noncommercialusers of the net."

The amendments, incorporated as part of the "managers amendment" to the telecommunications reform bill (HR 1555), seek to clarify that current federal law applies to computer networks. These new provisions are inconsistent with the Cox/Wyden amendment, and are opposed by several prominant members of both the House and Senate, including Representatives Cox and Wyden as well as Senators Leahy and Finegold. CDT believes that these amendments are unconsitutional and overly broad. They would criminalize constitutionally protected speach and would make service providers laible merely for providing access to the Internet to a minor. CDT will work vigoursly to ensure that these provisions are removed from the final telecommunications reform bill. Below are the statuates as amended by the House bill: NOTE: additions are noted in UPPERCASE, deletions are in [brackets].** 18 USC 1462.

I urge everyoneto check out the bill (should be online on thomas.loc.gov sometime soon);on balance, I think the bill is a huge step forward and deserves support.- -matt						Matt Blaze, Ph.D.						600 Mountain Avenue						Murray Hill, NJ 07974						March 1, 1996Hon. Patrick LeahyUnited States SenateDear Senator Leahy:Thank you for introducing the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of1996.  As a member of the computer security and cryptology researchcommunity, I have observed firsthand the deleterious effect that thecurrent regulations governing the use and export of cryptography arehaving on our country's ability to develop a reliable and trustworthyinformation infrastructure.  Your bill takes an important first steptoward creating regulations that reflect the modern realities of thisincreasingly critical technology.Unlike previous government encryption initiatives such as thetechnically-flawed and unworkable ``Clipper'' chip, your billre-affirms the role of the marketplace in providing ordinary citizensand businesses with a full range of choices for securing their privateinformation.  In particular, by freeing mass-market cryptographicsoftware and hardware from the burdensome export controls that governthe international arms trade, the bill will help the American softwareindustry compete, for the first time, in the international market forhigh-quality security products.Law enforcement need not fear the widespread availability ofencryption; indeed, they should welcome and promote it.  Encryptionthwarts electronic predators by preventing unauthorized access toprivate data and computer systems, and the use of strong cryptographyto protect computer networks is becoming as natural and necessary asthe use of locks and burglar alarms to protect our homes andbusinesses.  While criminals, too, might occasionally derive someadvantage from the use of cryptography, the benefits ofwidely-available encryption technology overwhelmingly favor the honestuser.  By recognizing that those who hold decryption keys on behalf ofothers are in a special position of trust, your bill is respectful ofthe privacy of law-abiding citizens without introducing impediments tothe government's ability to investigate and prevent crime.I have also examined the new provision designed to discourage the useof cryptography by criminals in the furtherance of a felony, and hopeto see your carefully-worded language reinforced by a narrowinterpretation in the courts, consistent with your intent.Again, thank you for your continued leadership in this area, and Ilook forward to doing whatever I can to help you bring encryptionregulations in line with the fast-changing reality of this emergingtechnology.

HERB KOHLHEARING BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEEON "CYBERPORN"JUNE 24, 1995Thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you for calling a hearing on this important issue and focussing attention on the need to protect our children.We are all increasingly and distressingly aware of the dark back alleys along the information superhighway. Within the last month, the U.S. Attorney in Milwaukee accepted a plea bargain from a man who travelled those alleys. He was a convicted pedophile and was using the Internet to meet his victims. That man "met" someone he thought was a teenager over the Internet. He sent her lewd photos of himself. And then, he travelled to Milwaukee from his home in Las Vegas thinking he was going to meet her at a hotel. Instead, he met the FBI. This story should serve as warning -- the Internet can be used by sick people. And it should serve as a lesson -- those people can be caught and prosecuted.However, in dealing with this issue, we face two dangers. On the one hand, overzealous defense of freedom of the Internet may lead us to ignore the real need to protect our children. On the other hand, our concern for our children should not provoke unthinking and reckless regulation of an important forum for free speech and vital business enterprise.When the Internet first began expanding into the mainstream, we were inundated with stories about the wonders available through this system. In the last few months, however, horror stories have dominated the news. Yet no one -- absolutely no one -- has conducted a systematic and balanced study of the extent of obscenity, pornography or indecency on the Internet. And no one can quantify the presence of Internet predators. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong. Despite the lack of hard evidence on this issue, no one can deny that there is a problem. And the problem is scaring parents and children away. Defenders of the Internet rightly point out that it does not produce these perverted users any more than the U.S. mail system or the telephone created pornography and indecency. The Internet is simply a new means of communication and transmission that pornographers have begun using. It has unique qualities that make it slightly more dangerous for children. The Internet is not just a breeding ground for perversion. It is a booming, entrepreneurial enterprise -- and fantastic environment where ideas can be exchanged around the world in a matter of seconds. So we must be careful that the Internet's future is not sanitized beyond value. I am pleased that in response to this problem, the computer industry is taking some initiative. Numerous companies are developing techniques for screening or filtering out inappropriate material, and some products are already available.The video game industry should serve as a model for our approach to this problem. The video game industry has created a rating system for its games that help parents control what their children are exposed to. That approach has not yet been perfected. But we should move forward along these lines.Those that profit from the Internet have a responsibility to ensure that graphic violence or sexually-explicit material does not find its way into children's hands. Many entertainment industries employ some level of self-policing -- this industry should be no different. The Senate's vote earlier this year during the debate on the telecommunications bill indicated that lawmakers are serious about seeing this problem addressed. It was a signal, in effect, to those in the industry: either make certain that children cannot get easy access to pornography or we will do it for you.On the Internet, preventing the problem and empowering parents through screening technology should be our top priority. Every parent in America would rest easier knowing that action is being taken to prevent a crime against their children, rather than simply devising a solid penalty after the fact.Anyone who purposefully sets out to abuse, hurt or tamper with our children must be punished. No amount of "wonders" on the Internet can excuse a single person who uses it to go after a child. I am not yet entirely certain that Senator Grassley's approach works best, since it attempts to penalize not just pornography or obscenity but also "indecency." But some legislative action may be needed, as the stories you will hear today demonstrate.Mr. Chairman, we have a careful balancing act to perform. We must protect the integrity of the Internet. We must resolve any practical and constitutional concerns before we enact legislation. But we also must protect our children. This hearing will help us achieve all these goals. Thank you.

Early this summer, my thirteen-year old daughter went to her friend's house to play on the computer. They were in the neighborhood; they were properly supervised; and I knew they were safe. It was shocking to discover later what they had experienced that afternoon. The girls were in a teenage chatroom on America OnLine, and were propositioned for "cybersex". Initially, they thought it was funny, giggling as you'd expect thirteen-year olds would, but as the requests became raunchier, they were frightened.I, too, am frightened, and appalled at how I am not able to protect my children on the Internet. As I continued to research this topic, and speak with other children and parents, I have discovered that almost seven out of ten have been victimized on the Internet. I speak openly with my children, so my daughter was not afraid to come to me with this experience. My daughter's friend, however, insisted that I could not reveal what happened to her parents. She felt almost guilty, as if she were responsible for what happened to her. When does a victim become the guilty party in this? Only when the victim is confused and happens to be a child. Children as young as ten years old have related stories to me of how they were propositioned, and of nude pictures sent to them on their computer so they could recognize the sender, who wanted to set up a face-to-face meeting.I understand that I have responsibilities as a parent to protect my children. I am in the communications field myself, and am aware of the wonderful benefits of using the computer for research, communications, creativity, and entertainment. What is disconcerting to me as a parent is the fact that I was unaware of the dangers of chatting on-line, and of the amount of pornographic material available to anyone with a computer and a modem. I've learned that you can download hard-core pornography; you can search the Internet to talk to anyone with the same interests as yours, be it common or perverse, and that all this can be accessed by children free of charge.I am aware of software and other "lock-out" features that I can download into my computer. But what happens when my children are at a neighbor's house? What happens if peer pressure builds, and a normal sleep-over party of teen-age boys becomes an opportunity to read and view pornographic material, material they may not have access to otherwise? What happens in multi-cultural homes that own computers? Parents may not be literate, but with children who have been educated here and have access to this indecent and obscene material. Children today have grown up with the computer, and I can safely say they are more computer literate than the majority of their parents. An education process has to start immediately to help protect our children. I am working with Enough is Enough, a wonderful group based in Fairfax, Virginia dedicated to protecting children against pornography. I have concerned parents and businesses in my community involved in starting grassroots organizations to educate both the children and parents on this issue.I believe in freedom of speech. I also believe in responsibility; responsibility by the providers of the online service companies to protect the innocence of children. If hard-core pornographic materials are illegal in the mainstream distribution channels, it should also be illegal on the Internet. If society has laws to protect children against child molesters, then there should be laws against these child molesters looking for victims on the Internet, too. They may have looked on school playgrounds yesterday, but the playground for the Children of the Nineties is the Information Superhighway.

VIENNA, VIRGINIA                               AND            CHAIRMAN OF THE ONLINE POLICY COMMITTEE                 INTERACTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION                     SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND         HEARINGS ON S. 892 AND INDECENCY ON THE INTERNET July 24, 1995Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am William W. Burrington, Chairman of the Online Policy Committee of the Interactive Services Association and Assistant General Counsel and Director of Government Affairs for America Online, Inc. in Vienna, Virginia. I appear before you today on behalf of the Interactive Services Association ("ISA") and its Online Policy Committee.1As the oldest non-profit North American association serving businesses that deliver telecommunications-based interactive services to consumers, the ISA has been responsive to concerns about the social and political impact of this new interactive medium that millions of Americans use every day. ISA's 300-plus members (see Appendix A) represent the full spectrum of industries now active in delivering personal interactive services. ISA's membership includes companies from the advertising, broadcasting, cable, computer, financial services, marketing, publishing, telephone, and travel industries. We understand that the purpose of these hearings is to discuss the responsibility of interactive online services, including those that provide access to the Internet, for the act of transmitting material to minors that is deemed to be indecent. Our industry is concerned about children's access via online services to materials that their parents believe to be inappropriate. We also want to ensure that Congress creates an effective response that will not devastate the myriad benefits to our country that will result from active participation in the National Information Infrastructure. We want to work with Congress to protect children, empower parents to screen out unwanted material, and preserve constitutional guarantees of free speech, free press, and individual privacy.In its zeal to "clean up" the content of a small portion of electronic communications, S.892 would target for liability online service providers while ignoring content providers and subscribers who create, control, and upload indecent material onto networks. For example, although access by minors to Playboy magazine may be restricted in some states, it is not restricted under federal law. This legislation, however, creates the anomalous result of punishing online service providers for permitting the electronic distribution of Playboy to minors although federal law does not punish the publisher. This is not to say that the publisher should be punished; we simply cannot agree that the constitution would permit computer distribution to be criminalized when the publishing of the same material is not.What's more, the online providers would be liable under S.892 for indecent communication regardless of any measures they may take to limit access or to screen content providers on their system. Statutory defenses for providers who make good faith efforts to screen and block indecent materials to minors would provide an industry incentive to develop effective blocking and screening devices. The lack of such defenses in S.892 would serve as a disincentive for investing in such efforts.ISA is also concerned about the criminalization of indecent speech, given that this speech is protected by the Constitution and can be restricted only in a few narrowly defined situations. The Supreme Court's Sable decision mandates that regulations on indecent speech must be narrowly drawn to protect minors without unnecessary interference with the First Amendment. The regulation proposed by S.892 is not the least restrictive alternative. It prohibits any "communication that contains indecent material" as well as indecent material itself directed at minors. This type of regulation is not likely to pass constitutional muster. Rather than criminalizing the mere transmission of certain materials, Congress should support and encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of the interactive services industry to build parental empowerment tools and encourage the industry to make such solutions widely available to consumers. Even without any legislation, the market is already acting to address the concerns of parents, educators, and others who are interested in controlling the flow of information accessible via computer. Just last week, companies such as America Online Inc., Webster Network Strategies, SurfWatch Software, and Netscape announced new products and services that allow users to screen from their online systems content they find offensive.In my testimony today, I would like to address several issues: 1. Constitutional guarantees of free speech and press should be    cautiously guarded. We urge Congress to consider the least    restrictive alternatives in achieving the goal of protecting minors    from indecent materials;2. The online service provider industry should be encouraged to provide     voluntary editorial control over its services and to continue its    research and development of parental empowerment technology tools.    This industry should not be cast in the role of national censor,    determining which information may be fit for children, but    nonetheless subject to criminal liability if it guesses incorrectly    in any given instance; and 3. The ISA agrees with the Department of Justice and the American Family    Association that existing laws suffice to punish the use of computer    networks for obscenity and child pornography. We believe that current    law negates the need for new legislation, either federally or at the    state level.Before I address these points, I would like to provide an overview of the online service industry.INDUSTRY OVERVIEWOnline service providers offer interactive services to millions of subscribers across the United States. In fact, there are presently over 8 million subscribers to computer-based online services. "Interactive services" are easy-to-use, telecommunications-based services designed for information exchange, communications, transactions, and entertainment. These services can be accessed by a personal computer, telephone, screen telephone, or television. Online service providers may simply transmit the communications created by others, or they may additionally offer content such as "bulletin boards" or "home pages." Interactive services are unlike any previous communications media. When an individual listens to the radio or watches television, the Supreme Court has recognized that the individual may be "surprised" by an indecent message; that is, by the time the viewer has seen the message, it is too late to avoid it or look away. This is the rationale behind some time, place, and manner restrictions on speech communication through such media. In the online medium, it is much less likely that a user will be surprised by indecent or obscene material. The online medium generally requires that a user take affirmative steps, such as using electronic mail or accessing a particular service through the click of an icon or typing in a particular address, prior to receiving communications. Although random online assault by indecent images or messages is possible, it is certainly not the norm.I really can't talk about interactive services without mentioning the Internet. The Internet is a world-wide phenomenon available in over 90 countries, connecting some 5 million different computer systems, and accessed by an estimated 10 - 30 million people. These connected computer systems are operated by universities and other nonprofits, research institutions, governments, businesses, and individuals. There is no central governing body or policy governing worldwide user behavior. Further, some obscene and indecent material originates in countries other than the United States, and is therefore beyond the practical reach of American law.The vast majority of all communication available over the Internet and other online services, however, is educational, informative, or entertaining. The ability to access and successfully use a variety of information will increase the productivity and enjoyment of American life. For example, American students have vast educational opportunities literally at their fingertips via the Internet. The majority of educational databases currently originate in the United States. Should Internet access be cut off because of the threat of criminal liability, students across the globe will have access to information that is withheld from American students. Not only would this handicap our future by denying educational opportunities to students, but it would handicap America's international competitiveness as well by decreasing access to productivity-enhancing services.Finally, interactive television services will bring video and other programming into households on demand. Currently, online services enable millions of people to communicate with each other and to access news, weather, sports, and financial information through the touch of a keyboard. These services enable personal communication across America as well as around the globe.Interactive services empower their users. Since the beginning of consumer online services in the early 80s, one key fact has emerged and is often overlooked. Tools provided by interactive services can act as an extension of the person, compensating for differing abilities related to, for example, age or physical health. Electronic grocery shopping can be both a convenience to many, and a lifeline to a homebound individual who is seeking to stay independent. Communities, too, will experience increasing social and political empowerment through electronic communication, forums, information sharing, and collaborative planning. Perhaps more than any other medium that has been used by American citizens, interactive services support the fundamental principles of our democracy. And as services evolve to multimedia presentation, so, too, will applications tailored to those of us with hearing, speech, sight, mobility or other challenges. This empowerment of the public offers a unique opportunity for individuals, parents, and families to make conscious choices about the types of material they wish to receive via their computer terminals.With this basic overview in mind, I will now address the first of the issues:I. S. 892 IS NOT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR LIMITING ACCESS    TO CERTAIN SPEECH. Let me clarify that S.892 applies to online service providers only to the extent that they are transmitting material. That is, for the purposes of this bill, it is not relevant whether the online provider was the source of the indecent communication to a minor or if it merely transmitted an indecent communication that originated elsewhere. S.892 is simply unworkable because it is not narrowly focused on the bad actors; online service providers cannot police and be aware of the specific content of each communication, and yet they are penalized for transmitting certain communications. Conspicuously absent from S.892 is any mention of the creator of the offending materials.Online services are entitled to at least the same level of First Amendment protection accorded to other news disseminators, such as newspapers. See Miami Herald Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974). In fact, online service providers are likely entitled to even greater protection because of the virtually infinite capacity of the medium to accommodate all speakers and points of view. It is precisely for this reason that legislators must use an abundance of caution prior to regulating and criminalizing online speech activities. As the Supreme Court cautioned in its landmark decision New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279 (1964), such a limitation on speech "dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate... [and] is inconsistent with the First Amendment."As the U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged, expression that is indecent but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment. Consequently, to regulate indecent expression in a constitutional manner, "[i]t is not enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends." Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. F.C.C., 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). S. 892 is not a narrowly tailored effort to serve the compelling interest of preventing minors from being exposed to indecent communications on computer networks. Furthermore, it fails to encourage industry to develop further measures that will improve user control over online services. S. 892 would depart from the federal criminal law's general rule that the originators of obscene material are liable for its distribution, not the entities who unwittingly carry out the distribution, such as a telephone network, a trucking company, or a courier service. See, e.g., 18U.S.C. $$ 1462, 1465. Without a federal law that prohibits a person from using a computer to transmit an indecent communication to a minor, S.892 proposes to impose criminal liability on access providers who permit others to use their computer network facilities to transmit indecent communications to minors. That is, the bill proposes to punish access providers for permitting others to do something that federal law does not prohibit. It is, in the words of the Supreme Court in Sable, "another case of 'burn[ing] the house to roast the pig.'" The new S.892 approach is not likely to survive constitutional scrutiny. Moreover, the so-called dial-a-porn regulations that evolved after nearly a decade of constitutional attack contained "safe harbor" defenses for industry. See Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 938F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991). S. 892 provides no such defenses, again rendering it constitutionally vulnerable on the grounds that there are other approaches less restrictive but just as effective in achieving its goal of denying access by minors to indecent communications on computer networks. Finally, in the context of private communications such as electronic mail, S.892 places online providers in an impossible position: it holds them criminally responsible for indecent communications to minors while the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 ("ECPA") forbids them from monitoring electronic mail. See 18 U.S.C. $$ 2701, 2702. The bill would treat online providers differently than other communications carriers: even with regard to communications that rises to the level of criminal activity, neither the Postal Service, Federal Express, nor Bell Atlantic is expected to know the contents of hand-written mail or of telephone conversations between persons conspiring in a criminal enterprise, nor are they held liable for failing to prevent any harm that may result.II. VOLUNTARY EDITORIAL CONTROL AND USER EMPOWERMENT TOOLS ARE THE MOST     EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACH TO PREVENTING ACCESS BY CHILDREN      TO INDECENT MATERIALS. As a matter of public policy, Congress should rely on the entrepreneurial spirit of the interactive services industry to build parental empowerment tools and encourage the industry to work together to ensure that such solutions are widely available. Technological relief is currently available and more is under way. Prosecutors appear to have the prosecutorial tools they need, too. The Justice Department certainly has not asked for new criminal laws to combat smut on the Internet. While industry has demonstrated its willingness to serve an editorial function, a current obstacle to wide implementation of measures to block or filter out offensive materials is the threat of liability for any offending material that may fail to get screened. Two months ago in New York, for example, Prodigy was found to be a "publisher" of libelous statements made by a subscriber on one of its online bulletin boards "in large measure" because of measures that Prodigy took to be "a family oriented computer network." Prodigy was liable even though it was (and is) unable to control the content of user communications and was unaware of the particular offending statement. Congress should not now legislate another disincentive -- criminal liability -- rather, it should continue to let the market respond to the demand for editing functions and screening tools.In addition, the online service provider industry has developed a broad array of technological screening devices, with the promise of more to come. It is sad and ironic that S.892 intends to reward industry for its efforts with criminal liability. The current industry initiatives include the following:First, providers can control the audience. At America Online, for example, we require a credit card or checking account to open an online account, which, like the dial-a-porn regulation's credit card requirement, presumes that the new subscriber is an adult. Second, providers can help the subscribers control the audience. For example, at Prodigy, the registered head of each household, using a credit card for verification, must activate an Internet connection for each family member. America Online within two months will expand its existing parental control offerings with a new feature that will enable parents to block access to all but the "Kids Only" area of the service with content targeted and programmed specifically for kids. This will allow parents to have access to all America Online features, but limit their children's access to the Kids Only area.Third, providers can exercise control over the topics of the chat lines and conferences that they sponsor and, consistent with federal law, monitor many of these activities. On these chat lines and conferences, online providers enforce rules that require that messages transmitted for posting be relevant to the subject of these activities. Fourth, while online operators cannot legally monitor e-mail, they act on complaints brought to their attention by subscribers who receive offensive material by e-mail. All that a subscriber needs to do is forward the e-mail to the provider; at that point, the provider can take appropriate action based on the message. If, for example, the sender is a subscriber of CompuServe, CompuServe can act against the sender if he or she has breached the operating rules. If the e-mail message indicates possible unlawful activity, the online provider will forward the material to law enforcement officials for investigation. Fifth, particularly with regard to the Internet, many providers are incorporating powerful new blocking and filtering technology to empower parents to make choices -- consistent with their own particular values -- about the material that their children can access. Currently at America Online, for example, parents are able to block their children's access to Internet newsgroups while permitting them other access to the Internet. In addition, America Online last week announced a relationship with SurfWatch Software, Inc. that will provide its adult subscribers with easy tools to block unwanted inappropriate material on the World Wide Web. SurfWatch, which also is available to families who do not subscribe to commercial online services, incorporates a roster of sites known to carry sexually explicit content that is automatically updated each month. NET NANNY and CYBERsitter are among other affordable products for controlling children's access to the Internet that are currently available. Another software product, WEBTrack School Edition (SE), which its developer recently announced would be provided at no charge to primary and secondary schools, gives school administrators the capability to restrict access to five categories of Internet sites (sex, drugs, hate speech, criminal skills, and online gambling) while allowing full access to the rest of the Internet's resources.Among the more innovative proposals on the drawing boards is "KidCode," currently being developed by Internet standards developers. KidCode would establish voluntary labeling systems that identify Internet information that is inappropriate for children. These labels could then be used in new ways to empower parents and educators to select the Internet content that children could access.The attention that content on computer networks has recently received continues to spur industry to invest in technologies that will further empower parents to protect their children from access to inappropriate materials.But all of the empowerment tools in the world will not work unless we educate parents about their existence and use. Consequently, in conjunction with the efforts to deploy new empowerment tools, the ISA will launch an online and off-line Parental Empowerment Program next month. Even preceding this effort, which may include information kits that parents can request via an 800-number service and World Wide Web Home Page, the ISA and seven major online operators teamed with the National Center for Missing Children to publish a pamphlet entitled "Child Safety on the Information Highway." (See Appendix B). The pamphlet is available at no charge by calling 1-800-THE-LOST and over all the major online services. This pamphlet advises parents in setting rules and guidelines for their children's online activities, and helps parents understand the risks involved on the information superhighway. Our goal is to educate parents better about the tools available to keep indecent and other inappropriate materials out of the hands of computer-literate minors.The goal of empowering and educating parents is to allow them to make their own choices and to customize those choices depending upon the age of their children and their own family values, not those of some monolithic government or special interest group. Finally, we realize that parents may not be as computer savvy as their own kids. For that reason, we have made all of our parental empowerment tools very simple and easy to implement with the click of a mouse. Our goal -- to make these technology features easier for parents to use than setting the clock on their VCR.Technology is one solution; parental awareness is another. These will work far better than cold words in a criminal statute to protect America's children from inappropriate material on the Internet. Indeed, the new technological tools will permit parents who wish to do so to block out a whole lot more than just material that online providers, if they permit its transmission, will go to jail for. III. NEW LEGISLATION IS UNNECESSARY TO MEET CONGRESSIONAL GOALS. Law enforcement agencies and prominent pro-family groups agree that current laws already authorize prosecutions of constitutionally unprotected speech on computer networks.2 Illegal conduct over computer networks has been punished under existing federal laws concerning trafficking in obscenity, child pornography, harassment, illegal solicitation or luring of minors, and threatening to injure someone. The desire to create additional legislation in this area is somewhat curious in light of the ability to prosecute wrongdoers under current laws and of the prosecutions that have taken place. To the extent that particular gaps may appear in the future, or if any obstacles arise to prosecution of those who make obscenity or indecency available to minors, Congress should examine whether there is a need for additional training or additional resources for enforcement of the current laws. No less an authority than the Department of Justice, the agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting these crimes, has requested not precipitous action but rather an in-depth analysis of the complex legal and policy issues surrounding the goals of protecting children while respecting First Amendment and privacy rights of computer users.3 It is also critical that Congress preserve a uniform national standard governing the behavior of online service providers. During the past year, at least five states -- Connecticut, Georgia, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Virginia -- have enacted laws aimed at obscenity or harassment on computer networks. These statutes may create standards that are inconsistent with the goal of incenting industry to create technological tools to block and screen particular communications. Again, industry should be encouraged to continue to work with communities to develop tools that allow the appropriate levels of access to and control of online services.Multiple regulations would be more than burdensome for online service providers; they may be impossible to satisfy for technical and economic reasons. Moreover, state requirements could conflict with one another, creating a situation in which compliance in one state could create culpability in another. Finally, because service providers are unable to accommodate varying standards, they would be forced to meet the content and activity standards of the most restrictive state. In this way, one state legislature, rather than the federal government, would control the content of our country's contribution to the global information superhighway.Permitting every state to adopt its own standard would lead to uncertainty for business and drive away market participants, thereby severely undermining our nation's ability to develop and make use of the National Information Infrastructure to promote national economic, educational, and social goals.CONCLUSIONPerhaps more than any other medium that has ever been used by Americans, online services support the fundamentals of our participatory democracy. Our government's role should be to facilitate -- not inhibit -- the development of the National and Global Information Infrastructure. And that is what government has done to date. The Congress has begun making congressional information available online; the White House and some federal agencies have set up sites on the World Wide Web; and federal agencies have established advisory committees to make recommendations on policies for the NII. We believe that for every child empowered by the Internet's benefits there should be a parent empowered to protect his or her children from the risks that exist on the Internet, as elsewhere in life. We believe that empowering technology, and education not cumbersome regulation, is the most effective and least intrusive means for serving the public interest in protecting minors.Any changes in federal law should seek to remove any disincentives for creating "child safe" areas rather than to impose criminal liability upon online providers for permitting others to engage in conduct not prohibited by federal law or S. 892 -- the transmission by others of indecent materials to minors.footnootes:--------------------------------------------------------------------1 ISA's Online Operators Policy Committee is comprised of: America Online, Inc.; Apple e-World; CompuServe; Delphi Internet Services Corp.; GEnie; Interchange Network Company; MCI; Microsoft Network; Prodigy Services Company; and Ziff Davis Interactive. 2 For example, in his May 6, 1995 letter to Rep. Thomas Bliley, the American Family Association's Patrick Trueman, the Section Chief during Bush and Reagan Administrations of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Justice Department's states: "[T]he federal criminal code currently prohibits distribution of both child pornography and obscenity by computer."In the Justice Department's May 3, 1995 letter to Sen. Patrick Leahy, Kent Markus, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, states:"[W]e have applied current law to this emerging problem. . . .

Patrick Leahy, Kent Markus, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, states:"We recommend that a comprehensive review be undertaken of current laws and law enforcement resources for prosecuting online obscenity and child pornography, and the technical means available to enable parents and users to control the commercial and noncommercial communications they receive over interactive telecommunications systems." In the Justice Department's June 13, 1995 letter to Sen. James Exon, Acting Assistant Attorney General Markus states: "Again, we are committed to protecting children while also respecting First Amendment and privacy rights. While substantial progress has been made in your revised proposal, it still raises a number of complex legal and policy issues that call for in-depth analysis prior to congressional action."

The Challenge of a New MediumMy name is Mike Godwin, and I am staff counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. I'd like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, on behalf of my organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, for allowing EFF to submit testimony concerning the important issues, and significant problems, we believe are raised by S. 892. One of our goals at EFF is to assist policymakers and legislators in developing a framework to understand the legal and social significance of what is, in effect, a wholly new medium -- computer communications. EFF is dedicated to expanding and preserving the democratic potential of this new medium, whose social and political significance may ultimately exceed that of the very first mass medium, the printing press. The issues raised by computer communications transcend partisan politics and require of us all that we stretch our imaginations -- the worst mistake we can make on the threshold of this revolution is to assume that this new medium is, so far as the Constitution and laws of the United States are concerned, essentially the same as broadcasting, or more or less similar to telephony. Computer communications -- and especially those communications that depend on computer networks of national or global reach, raise new problems and questions for lawmakers. At the same time, this medium promises to be the fulfillment of our oldest First Amendment values. But I come here not just as a lawyer who is concerned about the First Amendment. I'm also a father. My little girl will be the first person in my family to have grown up with the Internet. As a parent, I'm deeply concerned with protecting Ariel from bad material and from bad people. And this concern is the other reason for my being here -- I want to help ensure that whatever legislation or policy comes from Congress regarding the Internet will help me as a parent in protecting my little girl, while at the same time ensuring that she's able to benefit fully from access to the Net.While I do want to talk a bit about some of the Constitutional issues raised by S. 892, I don't want to duplicate the thoughtful, thorough analysis submitted to this committee by Jerry Berman of the Center for Democracy and Technology. Instead, I want to focus on giving you a better historical and technical understanding of why computer communications are fundamentally new and different from previous communications media. Now, figuring out the proper legal framework for the Net is tricky. Even if you didn't know anything else about computer communications, you'd know it's tricky from one simple fact: you've got Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich and the ACLU on one side of the issue, and Senators Robert Dole and Dianne Feinstein on the other side. What this tells us, I think, is that one's approach to making policy about computer communications derives less from one's political affiliations than it does from how one sees it in relation to traditional communications media. You see, the more you know about computer networks and the Internet, the clearer it becomes that the these networks are different in several respects from traditional communications media such as print, broadcasting, and the telephone. And these differences, once grasped, entail that top-down, government-centered approaches to protecting children will be ineffective. They also entail that the "least restrictive means" test of First Amendment jurisprudence will lead to different results in this medium from those results we've seen in traditional media, such as telephony. (See, e.g., Sable Communications v. FCC, 1989). We begin with what I promise will be a short history of the Internet. II.	The Humble BeginningsIn spirit, at least, the Internet--the global "network of networks" that is increasingly the link among commercial online providers, businesses, government, computer bulletin-board systems, and other modes of computer communications -- was conceived 30 years ago by Paul Baran, a RAND Corporation researcher. In a highly theoretical paper, Baran addressed a quintessentially Cold War problem: How could U.S. authorities successfully communicate in the aftermath of a nuclear war? The problem was that traditional communications network designs were vulnerable to strategic attacks. Hubs and main arteries could be destroyed, isolating whole sections of the country. And any central control authority would be a particularly enticing target for a surgical strike.Baran developed a theory of a truly decentralized, "distributed" communications network, with no central authority, and no main hubs or arteries. Any given communication on the network was sliced into what later were called "packets," and each packet was separately addressed, then thrust by the network in the general direction of the communication's destination. Each packet might take a separate route across the network, and some of those routes might involve serious detours (a packet might travel from Chicago to Seattle by way of Texas, for example). If a particular route had been damaged by natural disaster or military attack, a given packet would simply continue trying new routes until it found one that worked. The recipient computer on the far end would collect each packet as it arrived and assemble it in the correct order. This kind of network design probably sounds highly inefficient. That's because it is -- but it is also highly robust, and it turns out to be very difficult to guarantee that you've stopped a given message from reaching its destination.Baran's theoretical design remained just that -- theory -- for several years. Then, in 1969, a group of engineers working for ARPA (the federal government's Advanced Research Projects Agency), actually planted the first seeds of what later became known as the Internet. Although these engineers had never heard of Paul Baran or his paper, they'd brought his theory to fruition anyway. And once the RAND Corporation and other early participants in this network recognized that ARPA had implemented a working version of Baran's concept, they lost no time in playing up the military value of the new network (which turned out to be a plus when seeking appropriations under the constraints of the Mansfield Amendment). At first it was called the ARPAnet -- only later was the term "Internet" coined. The new network grew quickly: in late 1969, there were only four computers on the network, but by 1972 there were 37 sites. By the 1990s, the number of computer sites on the Internet had grown exponentially -- in 1992, Internet sites numbered in the hundreds of thousands; this year they number in the millions.One reason the Internet grew so rapidly is that one doesn't have to construct special wires or conduits to connect to it -- connectivity depend on software standards, and not on hardware. And connecting to the Internet cost the taxpayer little or nothing, since each node was independent, and had to handle its own financing and its own technical requirements. It is no wonder that communications traffic on the Internet has increased 1000 times between January 1988 and October 1994. Also fueling the explosive growth of the Internet was the increasing availability and decreasing price of desktop computers. Any one of the desktop (or even laptop) computers commonly sold today can become part of the Internet.III. Democratic and Economic Opportunities But the cheapness of computing power these days tells only part of the story. The rest lies in the answer to the question of why so many people want to be connected to the Internet. While there are many uses of the Internet --e-mail, long-distance computing, file transfers, searches of remote databases -- there is no doubt that one of the most compelling reasons people are excited about the Internet is freedom of speech. You see, unlike every other mass medium that has ever existed, the Internet (and similar computer networks) has no central authority. There is no person in charge of the "printing press," no "editor-in-chief," no holder of a broadcast license. Americans have discovered that one can reach a large audience on the Internet without having to assemble a lot of capital or seek the approval of an editor. In this the Internet is similar to the telephone (no one tries to edit your phone conversations while they're happening), but the potential scope of the communications are far greater. While it might take millions of dollars to start on urban newspaper or TV station, it takes only a few hundred dollars to reach large audiences. If, as A.J. Liebling once commented, freedom of the press belongs to those who own one, the Internet suggests that we all may someday own one.In short, the First Amendment's free-press clause, which many citizens still take to be a right reserved to the highly capitalized media establishment, has suddenly become a meaningful right for every individual American.This kind of empowerment of individuals is something new under the sun, and it blurs traditional distinction between "content producers" and "consumers" (everyone on these computer networks can produce "content"). This may blur the line between reporter and reader -- to take only the most recent example: it was an ad-hoc group of individual Internet users who assembled the material that demonstrated the flaws in the Martin Rimm/Carnegie Mellon pornography study that you may have heard about. And while the mainstream media might have taken months to discover the study's flaws, these individuals uncovered them in mere weeks. To touch briefly on some other things that make this medium different: since computer hardware and software are ubiquitous and less expensive all the time, the medium cannot be considered a "scarce" resource in the way the Supreme Court characterized the broadcasting spectrum in Red Lion. And since content is primarily "pulled" by user choices rather than "pushed" by content producers, the medium lacks the "pervasive" character of broadcasting that was central to the Court's decision in the Pacifica case.Finally, the relatively low cost of acquiring access to the Internet means that would-be entrepreneurs face relatively low barriers to entry into this new market. Now that the government no longer plays even a nominal role in administering the Internet, the international network of networks is becoming a playing field for pure capitalism. To start a successful business on the Internet, you don't need to be a millionaire, and you don't need venture capital -- all you need is a good idea. Ill-considered regulation, however, could thwart both the democratic and the economic promise of computer communications. S. 892, with its clear intent to impose new duties and broader legal risks for service providers, would simultaneously chill freedom of speech and distort the market for services by raising barriers to entry. What exacerbates this problem is that a provider's liability for content hinges not on legal obscenity, but on the far broader, far vaguer concept of "indecency," a term imported from the realm of broadcasting regulation whose meaning has never been defined by either Congress or the Supreme Court. And even if the term had been defined, it would be inapplicable to a medium that is neither "scarce" nor "pervasive" in the Constitutional senses of those terms. Our federal government's special role in regulating the content of the broadcast media and of the dial-a-porn services is grounded in particular factual findings about the characteristics of those media. There have been no such findings with regard to computer communications, and, given the nature of the medium as discussed above, it is difficult to see how there could be.Compounding the "chilling effect" this legislation would have on lawful speech is the sheer ineffectiveness of the measure when it comes to willfully illegal communications. Because of the decentralized, "bomb-proof" nature of the Internet, an individual provider's decision to censor certain content may have no effect at all with regard to its general availability. This is especially true when one remembers that an increasing number of Internet sites are operated in foreign countries, and their owners, while theoretically extraditable and prosecutable in the United States, would rarely be meaningfully deterred -- they know that only a very few foreign offenders will ever be pursued by a U.S. attorney. In general, a foreign criminal using computer networks to commit a crime in the United States can dodge both the providers' attempts at monitoring and the law-enforcement agencies' attempts at policing by originating message traffic offshore or by routing illegal information through a chain of intermediate sites that obscures its origin. S. 892 would not even pose a meaningful threat to those who prey on children -- no limit on "indecency" prevents the solicitation of innocent children with nonobscene, nonindecent speech.IV.	A Better Approach.As a parent who happens to be a lawyer, I know that federal and state laws already define a framework for the prosecution of those trafficking in obscenity, those who possess or distribute child pornography, and those who prey on children. It is clear that the legal tools are in place, but Senator Grassley's instincts are right when he perceives that there is still a gap in the defense of children that needs to be filled. One thing we know about those who engage in child sexual abuse, for example, is that they are rarely deterred by legal risks -- even in the face of likely prosecution they are driven by their sickness to continue preying on children. And as a parent I can assure you that it is little comfort to me to know that if such an offender harms my child, that person may be caught, prosecuted, and imprisoned at some point -- the damage, which may last a lifetime, has already been done.This is why I believe that the right role for Congress to play is to encourage the development of software filters that prevent my child and others from being harmed in the first place. Recall that the basic technology we're talking about here is the computer -- the most flexible, programmable, "intelligent" technology we build and market. Filtering software enables parents to screen certain language, certain kinds of content, certain people, or certain areas on the networks from their children.Such an approach does no damage to First Amendment values (it does not, for example, put a nonlawyer hobbyist who operates a tiny computer bulletin-board system in the position of having to determine what is "indecent"), yet it does solve the problems (e.g., solicitation through nonindecent communications, or offenders who conceal the origin of their harmful communications) that S. 892 has no hope of addressing. Furthermore, since such tools are designed to be customizable, parents are empowered to set their own standards of what is acceptable for their children, rather than relying on what the nonelected officials at the FCC choose to include under the definition of "indecency." For example, even if the FCC determines that detailed information about safe-sex techniques is not indecent, a parent who believes that her children should receive all their sexual information from her and not from the Internet could customize the family computer's "filters" to block that information. V. ConclusionsWe already have the laws in place. Federal and state laws prohibit the distribution of obscenity, every state I know of has laws prohibiting the exposure of children to inappropriate or harmful material. Federal and state laws prohibit child porn and child abuse, regardless of the medium used to facilitate it.Speaking as a concerned parent and a lawyer, I believe the question isn't "Do we need more criminal laws?" -- it's "What can we do to supplement the legal framework with policies and tools that empower parents to protect their children and preserve the values of their families?" And answering that question will require the Congress to draft laws and support policies that are grounded not in simplistic analogies to old media, but in a thorough understanding of this new medium and of what makes it different. Members of the committee, you are at a crossroads. Down one road lies a future in which parental rights are supported by a Congress that has abandoned the outdated, big-government approach to solving social problems. Like the parents and children whose letters to you follow my statement here, we hope for a Congress that does not set the First Amendment and welfare of families against other, but that instead chooses policies that strengthen both.LETTERS FROM MAMIE AND HOWARD RHEINGOLDTo the Members of the Committee,I am Mamie Rheingold. I am ten years old, and I have been using e-mail since I was eight years old. I also use the World Wide Web sometimes to help with my homework.When I started using e-mail, my dad told me to use good sense. Like when somebody calls my house on the telephone and asks me whether I am home alone, I know I don't have to answer that person. And my parents taught me that if somebody calls on the telephone and I don't know them, and I feel funny about something they say or ask, I should talk to my mom and dad and not say anything. The same thing with e-mail. If people ask me personal questions and I dont know them, I ask my dad. I like to send e-mail to my dad when he travels, and get e-mail from him. And I have a few penpals. It really isnt a problem.Sometimes, I can use the World Wide Web for homework. My dad found a place where I can type in the name of what I am looking for and then I can click on what it finds and see pictures from outer space or other things. It's like having an encyclopedia that has movies, too. I think kids need to learn how to use things and parents need to trust us to use them the right way and not use them the wrong way. Mamie Rheingoldmame@well.com----------To the United States Senate and the Members of the Committee: I am a parent, a PTA member, and an active volunteer in our daughter's public school. I believe very strongly that parents have an obligation to teach our children values, to give them the opportunity to make their own moral choices, and to help them understand the media such as television and internet that are so important in their lives today. I would like to be able to have control over the information my daughter receives through the television or the internet, but I don't believe it is right to give the State the power to exercise that control. Parents and teachers, not the government, are the ones who ought to determine what information and values are appropriate in our homes and schools. Democracy in America was founded upon freedom of expression. Communications technologies have made it possible to spread objectionable material. I know that tools for FILTERING information that comes into the home, rather than CENSORING it at the source, are much more practical, easier to administer, and most importantly, do not erode our liberties. I support filtering tools for parents, including rating systems. Most importantly, I feel that parents need to understand that we have a responsibility to instill good sense in our children, to sit down with them in front of the television and in front of the computer screen, to ask them questions, and to answer their questions. Taking that responsibility out of the hands of parents is going to further weaken the family, and create a censorship bureaucracy that we might later come to regret.I personally paid for an internet and WWW link to my daughter's 6th grade classroom. I spoke to the students and told them that there are indecent pictures out there on the net, and that I trust that they will use this tool responsibly. I said: "If you do anything that you wouldn't want your parents to know, then probably you will get caught at it and you won't have the Internet in your classroom any more. And there probably won't be Internet in any other classrooms around here. But if you are responsible pioneers, you will show the other classrooms and teachers in this school, and in this school district, that kids and teachers can use this new tool. I'm counting on you to be pioneers." That's what I told them, and they didn't fail me. If we don't give our kids the opportunity to make moral choices, and yes, the chance of failing, then how are they going to learn?

Mom showed me how to do things on the net to do research on papers and things when I was about 10; I've done papers on the Holocaust, plant growth under differing lights, absorbency of paper diapers, Hero symbolism in Indiana Jones, Nuclear waste and radiation's affect on the body, and looked for clip art to put on papers and charts.My mom and dad are divorced, and I've used email to keep in touch with the one I'm not living with since 4th grade. I also talk to my cousins in England every day by email, and some of my aunts and uncles. Email is a really good thing.This year I discovered Mudding, and it's really cool. I've met loads of people all over the world and have talked with them and worked with them. Mom has always been really firm that I shouldn't tell my phone number or address to people on the net, and I don't. It's like not giving it to people you meet at the Mall until you know them better. I feel like the Net's a pretty safe place if you take care of yourself and pay attention to what you're doing.There's a lot of really cool stuff on the net. Restricting what people can put up isn't the way to go: parents and school should do what they do now: make rules and agreements, with consequences if you break them. Jennie Brown (jbrown@spider.lloyd.com)------------To the Members of the Committee,I worried for a long time about letting Jen go "out" mudding by herself, but she seems to be paying attention to our basic ground rules and keeping herself safe from unwanted attention. I worry when she and her friends go out for a day to the local shopping strip, too. ;-) Jennie uses the Net like she uses other research tools --and sometimes she finds out weird and unusual stuff in the library at school, too. To our minds (her parents) the Net is an unparalleled communication tool, and it's helped us stay close to Jennie when she's been in the custody of one or the other of us.The computer that Jennie uses is in the living room, and we all talk about what we find online. Jennie asked about porn on the net after the discussion erupted this spring: we talked about what sort of stuff was available and she said, and I quote, "Yuch." Parents who set up sensible guidelines and communicate with their children are the best filtering technology for the Internet.

My name is Brad Neuberg. I am 19 and currently live in South Texas.I grew up using bulletin board systems and the internet. As a matter of fact, I learned how to read and do mathematics on an old Texas Instruments computer! In my high school, the Science Academy of South Texas, I communicated with professors, educators, and children from all over the world using internet access which my school provided. Currently, I use the internet to keep in touch with breaking news, congressional legislation using Thomas, and vast discussion groups on many different topics. My life has been very enriched due to computers and online networks.Today you will probably hear convincing legislation that the internet is full of a massive amount of pornography. You will be told that a recent Carnegie Mellon research report, used by Time magazine in an article, documents that 85% of the internet is pornography. A large number of experts have disputed this article, and have shown, in fact, that there is an extremely small amount of pornography available on the internet, more around 0.5%.Some people here today may not truly understand what the internet is. One important part of the internet, called newsgroups, is like a huge cork bulletin board, such as the bulletin board inside the entrance of a common super-market. People with their home computers call up, using their telephone line, onto this huge cork bulletin board from all over the world, where they can put up messages. So just as at the super-market I can put up a message saying, "I lost my little dog; if you have seen it call 631-2142," someone on the internet can type a message on their keyboard and post it to this huge bulletin board, accessible by people from all over the world. Now, there can be millions of these huge bulletin boards on the internet, so instead of only having one bulletin board at the super-market, imagine if there were thousands in the store, and each bulletin board had a different topic. Let's say one bulletin board at the super-market had a sign on top with the word "Agriculture" on it, or another bulletin board with a sign saying "Movies." Well, on the "Movies" bulletin board people who are interested in movies could post message, or even sounds clips, because one of the special things about the internet is that you can post many different kinds of data, from text, to voice, to pictures. And so, all over the world, through the internet, communities are forming, where people are discussing, every imaginable topic, from scientists talking about lasers, to kindergarden teachers talking about the techniques they use to teach their class. So many people talking is truly a phenomenal thing (well, unless it's a talk show :).There are about ten-thousand of these "cork-bulletin" boards on the internet, filled with every imaginable topic, from kids talking about a particular video game to Chinese dissidents discussing how to create a democracy in China. What the Time magazine article was talking about was roughly about 15 of these=7F bulletin boards. These fifteen bulletin boards are discussing mostly sexual topics, such as pedophilia or homosexuality, and=7F are the "cork boards" where there are a great deal of dirty pictures. When the author of the Time magazine article wrote that 85% of the internet was filled with dirty pictures, what he=7F was really saying was that 85% of the messages on these fifteen sexual bulletin boards were actually pornographic pictures. Keep in mind that this is 85% of the ten sexual bulletin boards of the ten-thousand bulletin boards available on the internet. In other words, a very small amount. With other factors included this means that only one-half percent of the internet contains pornographic images! This is almost like the two dirty books at a library with tens of thousands of books. A parent would still like to prevent their children from seeing these pictures, even if only 0.5% of the internet contains this pornography. In spite of the fact that it actually takes quite complex software to see these dirty images, there are already companies who see a need for software that can prevent children from seeing the bad 0.5% of the internet. These pieces of software scan for dirty words, block access to the sexual bulletin boards, record the locations children visit, or use other techniques to help parents monitor what their children are doing. This software, without government censorship, without government control, can help keep children from accessing the bad portions of the internet, and allow adults to continue to communicate their thoughts. If one of the reasons for the Republican sweep of Congress was to help remove government from our lives, and to restore our free-market economy, then why should we allow the government to have more control over what we say by censoring our thoughts on the internet? We should empower parents by letting the free- market provide solutions for the pornography problem; let's keep government out of our lives.Thank you very much,Brad NeubergMcAllen, TxP.S. - Don't forget the oath you took at the beginning of your term to uphold the Constitution of the United States -- as well as the Bill of Rights.LETTERS FROM CHRISTOPHER O'CONNELL AND CHRISTINA O'CONNELL To the Members of the Committee,I am a seventeen year old who has been using BBSs, America Online, and the Internet for 7 years. It has been an educational and priceless experience for me. From the start on local Bulletin Board Systems I have made friends and learned skills that will help me when I enter the workplace. Because of my experiences online I was able to assist my fellow students at my high school with the library's computers and CD-Rom system. I have learned programming languages, computer skills, and played chess with a former Semi-Grand Master. In fact, many of my friends are in occupations and areas that I am considering studying in college, and much of my interest is due to their support and help. And their support went beyond that. During my parents divorce I had them to talk to, and it was an immeasurable aid during that trying time. During my seven years online, I have never felt anything but safe, and have never been made uncomfortable in any way. Sure, there is pornography available, but it is just as available in magazine or book form to my friends at school who are not online and don't even own computers.Through the online discussion forums, I have been able to discuss everything from religion to politics to computers to science fiction to poetry. It has given me a chance to speak my mind, develop my thoughts, and be heard in a way that most teenagers never have. It has developed my thinking and reading skils, and has helped my writing ability in a way that no high school english class could hope to match, despite the very high quality of the local public school that I attend. I have also become a staff-member of one of the online games I frequent, where I am learning the value of helping and aiding others. All of this has also made me aware of the issues facing our nation today. In a day and age when legislators are stressing the value of putting religious education, and many other values and moral concerns, back in the hands of the family and not the government, why are the same legisators proposing to take away a clear right of the parents? The idea of laws to censor the Internet ignores not only the first amendment but the very basic rights of Americans to govern what their children see and raise them as they see fit. My mother, who is a single-parent to my sister and myself, has always governed what we see and read. From a young age she imposed limits on the amount of television viewing and what I was allowed to watch. This has made me an avid reader of books who would much rather take in a book of poetry or literature than a sitcom any day. This has not made me hate her or get angry, it has brought us closer together as a family. All of us spend evenings over dinner conversing about our reading, whether it be a science fiction book that I am reading, one of my mother's favorite mystery novels, or the books on horses that my 9 year old sister, soon to get her own Internet account, has begun to read. For that matter, we also spend hours discussing what I see on the Internet, ensuring that I understand and am not harmed by anything I see. The very idea that this would be taken away from us is not only abhorrent and disgusting, but insulting to myself, my mother, and every other American family. It says that you do not trust parents to do their jobs. Christopher O'ConnellRindge, New HampshireVulpine@gold.mv.net---------------To the Members of the Committee,I'm the mother of two chidren, a son 17 and a daughter 9. My son has been online via BBSs, AOL and the Internet from age 10. We have always discussed his time online, what he was doing, who he was talking with. His experiences have been overwhelmingly positive - he's had the chance to learn chess from a state champion, discuss authors with both friends from several online games and the rec.arts.* newsgroups he follows, debate politics with people of all ages, learn a new programming language, and more. But perhaps most importantly, he has found a genuine community of friends online, from many countries, backgrounds and age groups who have helped him through some rough times and who he has helped in return. As a parent, I am very angry at the attempts to censor the Internet in the guise of protecting children. I have seen firsthand the value of being online in my son's life. On the rare occasions when he has run into questionable material, he has not suddenly lost his good sense nor the morals he has been raised with -- just as with tv, music, books, we discuss things which bother him. Just because material is on the Net, it does not somehow magically destroy the relationship we have built nor the strong inner sense of right and wrong he has developed over the years. And to those who somehow feel that the government must interfere here because "parents are too busy" let me just note that I am a divorced mother raising my children alone - I work long hours to support myself and my children, but that does not stop me from parenting them! My daughter has had several internet penpals, an activity which is encouraging her writing skills. I have just gotten her her first separate net account and she is joining a mail list for young riders. In fact, we are planning on using this list in September as part of the activities of our local 4H group.>From my experience, I'd say that the proponents of net censorship should learn more firsthand about what is available on the Net. I know that there is material online which does not fit my morality - but I'm not forced to look at it and neither are my children. I know that there are some sick people online as well - but there are sick people in my small rural town too - I've taught my children to take proper precautions with strangers and that teaching stands online or at the local shopping center. And while I've seen a lot of scandal-sheet type headlines about kids and the net, in over 7 years of experience, as a mother and a net reader, I have yet to see anything that remotely reflects those over hyped headlines. Christina O'Connell, parent [of Christopher O'Connell] Rindge, New Hampshirecoco@gold.mv.netLETTER FROM SHARON HENDERSONTo the Members of the Committee,I felt it was important to tell you about my son, Brian. Brian is 12 years old, almost thirteen. When he was a little tot, he was diagnosed as neo-autistic: "sort-of, kinda autistic, but not really, so we don't know what else to call him." Until he was almost four, he did not speak at all--only tears and laughter, with far more laughter. He was a bright, responsive baby and toddler, charming, funny, and fascinated by technology. When he finally learned to talk, he was entirely echolalic for almost three more years--a condition which essentially boils down to his ability to repeat back to you, verbatim and in your vocal intonation, anything you have said to him. Or anything he has heard on TV. Or anything he has heard .... at all. This made him a fine mimic--and gave him, as a kind of compensation for his disability, a spectacular memory. He may not always pay attention--but when he does, you only need to tell him something once. He remembers it forever. His language is now age-appropriate--and then some; he expresses himself like the learned young man that he is.His intro to technology came through the family's Atari game system and the TV. He comes of a long line of engineers on his Dad's side--folks who like to take things apart and put them back together. Computers have always fascinated him, and this remains the case to this day. Games, programming, email, the WorldWide Web, you name it, he loves it. Other people memorize mathematical theorems; Brian memorizes the Gopher and FTP sites where he can find information on history, maps, railroad trains, collectible card games, and metal gaming miniatures. His peers can name all the Power Rangers and their abilities; Brian can tell you which Web sites will grant you access to pictures from the American Civil War, which ones will tell you about the re- enactment of Revolutionary War battles, and where you go to find out the history of armored vehicles as used in the armies of the world, since armored vehicles existed. Does he know there is pornography on the Internet? Sure, he does. He can read as well as anyone else. But because he is an American citizen, and knows the Constitution better than many of our Congresspeople, he knows there is freedom of speech, expression, and pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness. He knows these things are (and I'm quoting him, here) "ucky, gross stuff for people with little imagination," and he knows how to stay away from them. If he did not know how, I would do my parental duty and teach him--and I would probably put software on our home computer that would keep him from involuntarily running across anything my husband and I didn't want him to see.This child, who uses the local libraries to the hilt, realizes there are libraries and archives and universities all over the world to which he will probably never get in person. But he knows the Internet can reach them, and a lot faster and cheaper than an airplane flight could get him to the exact same place. So he comes to work with me on weekends, and helps beta-test software by using it. He looks to see what new card collectibles there are. He checks stock quotes on his Mom's work benefit stock plan. He looks at pictures of old trains. He reads the history of the great air, sea and armor battles of WW2. He goes to movie sites and checks to see whether "Braveheart" or "First Knight" would be a better choice. (he chose "First Knight," because: "Well yeah, the history stinks and nobody ever wore stuff like that, but it's got Sean Connery, Mom, and he played Indiana Jones' Dad!!") He has recently downloaded pictures of parts of England and Germany from which his ancestors came, and a really neat map of the Chicago railway transportation system that was found online. He has printed out PICTs and JPEGs of US Navy vessels, and old British steam trains. Do we supervise his use of the Net? Sure we do. That's the kind of parents we are. We try to live our religion and our belief in love, democracy, and learning. A world has opened up to this terrific, intelligent child who, because of lingering bits of his "neo-autism," is shy among people his own age. He learns things that he can tell his friends about, and so seem less "different" and separate from them. He can sit for hours in front of the computer, surfing the 'Net, having a grand exploration for himself--and then he goes out to play, excited, happy, his mind engaged in a way that television rarely affects him, and delighted to live in such a diverse, wonderful world. He lives daily with the InterNet, since I develop software for it, and he is a good citizen of the Net because he was first a good citizen of his country, and a good Virginia gentleman. Do you flame people in email or on the newsgroups, or use bad or nasty language? "Nope. That's really tacky manners." Do you mass-mail advertisements to newsgroups you've never read? "Uh-uh. That's invasion of privacy." Do you look at things your parents don't want you to? "No, that would be wrong." So should that stuff be there? "Yes, because not everybody likes what I like."You know what I like?I like my kid. I like his style. I like his sense of history, his understanding of the laws of his democratic country, his tolerance of other people, and his love of learning. I like the fact that, when it comes my time to face St. Peter, I can do so with a mother's humble pride: I can say yessir, my life had one overwhelming worth, besides what I was able to accomplish on my own: my husband and myself worked together to create, raise, and teach the wonderful, marvelous, honest, honorable young Virginia Gentleman and American, Brian Henderson. He doesn't misuse the Net, because he doesn't misuse anything else. Good rearing, good manners, and proper adult supervision can, after all, produce some real, tangible results. I wish people would stop blaming the faceless entity known as the Internet, and start looking in their own mirrors. I wish the Powers that Be would wake up and realize that regulating the Internet won't change a single, solitary thing--because change is only effective when it is learned from home. For too long, we have all lived by the credo of "don't do as I do, do as I say." And our kids today are far too intelligent to swallow that old dog. If we raise them right--if we actually do the things we tell them they should do--they will be good people who love their country, understand and obey its laws, worship the deity of their choice, and behave the way they have been taught to, whether they are interacting with their friends at school, colleagues at work, or with computer systems all over the world on the Internet. It's that simple. It always has been. It always will be. So the legislatures need to wise up, no? Thanks for letting me use your soapbox.

When Christopher Reeve had his riding accident, we searched the web and found a frequently asked questions (FAQ) file on spinal cord injuries that contained some excellent information. We also found a graphic that illustrated the relationship between level of injury and loss of function. The web was also very useful for one of her school projects on UFOs where we searched and found information and graphics. She has also used the web to find information about her favorite music groups. We live in Oklahoma City and have also used the web for keeping current on information about the OKC bombing.We keep hearing via the media how easy it is for children to find sexually related images and had discussed this with her (Quotes like "Your children probably already have found this information."). We discussed this with her and she told us that as a result of our conversation, she'd looked for over FOUR hours and had only found the Playboy magazine home page. We then initiated a discussion with her about how we believe the images she found tended to portray women as objects and why we object to this type of thing. Her difficulty in finding what she was looking for validates my experience (of six years) and my husband's experience (of 5 years) with the internet. Sexually related images do not just appear on your computer, you have to 1) know what you are looking for, 2) understand how the net is set up and know how to use the various tools (FTP, gopher, etc) to find what you are looking for and 3) you have to spend time searching. If the child is spending this amount of time on the computer, the parent should be aware of it and should be participating and guiding the child's efforts in healthy directions. It is the parent's place to control their children's access to the internet, just as they should in regards to other sources of information and entertainment (e.g., books, movies, radio, and television).From what we've read on current legislation designed to address access to information on the net, we do NOT support the Communications Decency Act, or the Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act. We DO support the Leahy study, because we believe that when making decisions that could have quite serious ramifications regarding freedom of speech on the internet, we need to consider carefully the possible alternatives and choose alternatives that provide the best outcomes (protecting children) with the fewest adverse effects (more restrictions on freedom of speech). Our local internet service providers (ISP) have already initiated procedures requiring proof of age (e.g., photo identification) prior to allowing access to clearly adult areas such as the adult Usenet news groups. We suspect that software developers and service providers will be able to come up with creative solutions to restrict children's net access to domains that their parents are comfortable with. For us, the combination of parental supervision and voluntary ISP cooperation is more than adequate to protect our daughter from any potentially adverse effects of the internet, while allowing her to reap great benefits from the diversity of information and people available on the internet. We use the internet, just like we use TV and the other media--we attempt to restrict access to age-appropriate content and use these sources to initiate discussions of what's right and wrong to help our daughter develop her own code of ethics.Thanks for your time,Betty Harris & Jim GloverPSYCHE@drycas.club.cc.cmu.eduOklahoma City, Oklahoma Return to the index of testimony from the 7/24 hearing Return to the CDT Home PageWT02-B07-78IA095-001027-B020-353http://www.cdt.org:80/policy/freespeech/hart72495.html 205.177.10.31 19970215015439 text/html 8692HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:53:22 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Testimony of Michael Hart, Project Gutenberg Three points are all I would like to make: Point 1.We have the technology to bring Millions of books to Billions of people, so let's do it! Even if we have to put them behind a computer "firewall." Point 2.We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide Internet On-Ramp services to the rest of the country, besides the large metropolitan areas.Point 3.We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide the means to talk to the rest of the world, otherwise only those who can hire an expensive code writer can have a World Wide Web Page anyone will want to read.If you put undue regulations on these Information Providers, then you will keep these wonderful things from happening, and you will further increase the distance between the Information Rich and the Information Poor. A rich person will ALWAYS be able to get a copy of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," but the Information Poor won't be able to get it at all, unless we make it incredibly easy.Only 1 1/2 out of 10 people have college degrees, and many of these manage to graduate without EVER reading a Shakespeare play. I would like to see this country more well read. Last year's Adult Literacy Report showed that the division between literate and illiterate adults in this country was about 50/50, 53/47, to be exact.I would like to fix this.Point Number One:1. We have the technology to bring millions of books to billions of people, so  let's do it!1. Project Gutenberg IS doing it, and HAS BEEN DOING IT for 25 Fourth of July's now: the Declaration of Independence was the FIRST ELECTRONIC TEXT EVER POSTED ON THE INTERNET, in July of 1971; and this month, a World Wide Web Page containing a Hypertext edition of the Declaration of Independence marks our 300th Etext on the 25th Fourth of July  that has seen Electronic Books on the Internet. Project Gutenberg is ALL volunteers, has NO budget, has NEVER received a government grant, NOR a grant from any foundation other than computers and programs from computer and software companies, NOTHING that would provide for a First Amendment lawyer to proofread an entire book every day of the week. Point Number Two:2. We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide Internet On-Ramp services to the rest of the country, besides the large metropolitan areas.2. I have brought you an exhibit of a Mom & Pop shop that provides Internet access in the middle of the the Corn Belt: Christina Heal is from Shelbyville, Illinois, and has met Senator Simon three times. Point Number Three:3. We need Mom & Pop Shops to provide the means to talk to the rest of the world, otherwise only those who can hire an expensive code writer can have a World Wide Web Page anyone will want to read.3. I have brought another exhibit of a Mom & Pop shop, Jolea Sampolesi is from Arkansas, and is now in Illinois, making Web Sites,  public and private. She has met President Clinton a number of times, and it is she and her husband, Steve Weintz, who made the Declaration of Independence Web Page. On the first point:Here is the first hard drive disk-pack we ever used in Project Gutenberg, it did  not have enough space to hold EITHER the Bible OR Shakespeare, and the multi-million dollar computer we used had only two of these; so the concept of putting BOTH the Bible AND Shakespeare on the Internet sounded totally out of reach in 1971. Only half as long ago, in 1983, the size of most hard drives had only doubled, and your $10,000 XT computer came with only a 10 megabyte hard drive, STILL not enough to hold BOTH Shakespeare and the Bible. Yet, this much smaller, and much less costly hard drive will hold 1,000 books the size of Shakespeare or the Bible, and as this trend continues, which it is, we will have a drive that will hold A MILLION books in only another 10 years. That amount of storage is called a Terabyte, and equals one trillion characters of text.This is what a terabyte looks like now >> Here is a stack of 1984 style CDROMs, enough of them to hold ONE MILLION books, each with 300 pages full of text. This stack is as tall as some of the people in this room. The new style CDROMs hold about 6 times as much and thus a stack of these less than a foot tall will still hold a million books; you could put them all in your brief case. Yet, we will NEVER find a MILLION books that EVERYONE is going to agree on, because even the greatest books listed in the Britannica Great Books Series have been censored: from Socrates, to Plato, to Aristotle; and from Chaucer, to Milton, to Shakespeare; just one call to University of Illinois reference librarians revealed that ALL of these authors have been censored and banned, and more of them in THIS century than you would imagine.On the second point:There are about 500 million computers in the world, with perhaps an average of two people using each one, totalling about 1 Billion computer users in the world. Yet only about 5 million of these computers are on the the Internet.that is ONE PERCENT.Even counting PEOPLE and not computers, the total number of people subscribed to CompuServe, America OnLine and Prodigy, is still only a fraction of 1% of the total number of people using computers.We NEED these little Mom & Pop Internet On Ramps. Nobody else is going to bring On Ramps into the corn fields. On the third point:The Information Superhighway MUST BE A TWO WAY STREET. Everyone should be able to speak.The World Wide Web is currently the way to be heard on the Internet, but less than 1% of the 1% of the computer users who ARE on the Internet, would have ANY IDEA HOW to put their ideas on a World Wide Web Home Page. Jolea Sampolesi and her husband, Steve Weintz, have made personal Web Pages a reality for the masses, but they, and Christina Heal, cannot possibly stay in business, which they are just barely doing now, if they have to police all the content of their hardware and software for an indecency that is so ill-defined that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet could be labeled as child pornography, simply because they were 15 years old in an era when that made them middle-aged, as the life expectancy was much shorter than it is today. Can we really expect to rewrite history and not to lose it at the same time.The phone companies don't have to monitor for content, the corner grocery is not liable for what you pin up on their bulletin board, and none of these  Mom & Pop Shops can afford to have a First Amendment lawyer read over everything that is posted.Project Gutenberg publishes an Electronic Text every other day, and half our effort is spent doing copyright searches. If we have to spend the other half reading for what anyone, anywhere, might deem "indecent" we will never have time to achieve our goal of putting 10,000 books on the Internet by the end of the year 2001.Our company designs, constructs and maintains Web sites for a wide range of clients, from Fortune 500 corporations to small local firms and even individuals. As a small business ourselves, we are not in a position to turn away business, nor can we afford to accept liability for creating an image,  sound, movie or body of text in accordance with a client's specifications. Were we to incur the liabilities set forth in S892 the costs of legal defense alone would bankrupt us. It is my opinion that the cost of my freedom of speech could easily cost me my livelihood. I would like to point out that our clientele and audience are global. Therefore, how are the Japanese or British definitions of obscenity, for example, to be reconciled with the intent of this bill? Why should our foreign clients use the services of a U.S. company, however talented, when that firm might be subject to irrelevant restrictions on its activities? American Internet content providers could wind up at a significant competitive disadvantage, and our dominance of the field could go the way of our leads in other fields.This bill has potentially dreadful long-term effects. By subjecting an entire nascent industry to the discipline of an arbitrary and culture-bound standard, that of decency, we risk crushing the richest entrepreneurial arena of our times.

I am also a parent who is enthusiastic about the positive changes and opportunities new forms of communications technology can offer to my children.Interactive computer networks have clearly changed the way Americans, and indeed people throughout the world, communicate with one another. While individuals carry on conversations in cyberspace much like they do over traditional telephones, the use of the Internet goes far beyond that characteristic.* On the Internet, one can act as a publisher and a writer   simultaneously by posting their works on various bulletin boards,    newsgroups, and on a World Wide Web page.* One can search out just about any information they wish without   leaving their home. Students can access books and other research   materials simply by sitting at a personal computer properly outfitted   for Internet access. There is a wide range of literature available   through the Internet, and with efforts such as Project Guttenberg,   which we'll learn more about today, there will soon be many more books   available on-line. * Individuals can participate in political, academic and scientific   forums without being an expert in a particular field. * Entrepreneurs can market and sell their products simply by   establishing their own home page on the World Wide Web. * And now, people throughout the United States will be able to   participate in Senate Committee hearings through the Internet.   Committees will not be limited to hearing the comments and opinions of   those who are part of more organized coalitions and who can afford to   make the trip to Washington D.C. The U.S. Senate, more than ever   before, has the opportunity to have true grass roots participation in   the political process through the Internet. That is an incredibly   positive development for this country and emphasizes the potential of   decentralized interactive communications networks.In short, this new world of communications is virtually open to anyone with access to a computer with a modem and an Internet connection and who is also willing to take a little time to learn how to retrieve all the types of information out there.In fact, there are a number of discussion groups on the Internet debating the very issue we are addressing today in this hearing. Those on-line debates are very heated, but they provide a positive outlet for the exchange of ideas.While it is doubtful that, at least in the near term, interactive computer networks will completely replace more traditional forms of communications, it is clear that they have found at a minimum a lasting place within our society. The potential of this technology is virtually without bound.However, with these new opportunities come new challenges -- the most important of those protecting our children as they use the Internet to communicate with others. As tragic as it may be, there are those in this country who will try to harm our children, either for profit for even more perverse reasons. Unfortunately those individuals, who prey off the vulnerability and innocence of children will use whatever means they can to commit their crimes, including communications technologies. In trying to protect our children, we must recognize the Internet for what it is, simply a new way of communicating. My concern in recent months, as I have participated in this debate, is that the discussion has become so sensationalized that we may fail to react appropriately in areas where on- line dangers actually exist. I don't want to see this Congress respond to existing problems by creating new legal and constitutional dilemmas. That is what I believe happened when we passed telecommunications legislation last month. Members of the Senate reacted as any parent would when they were confronted with the "blue binder" filled with pornography downloaded from the Internet. What members weren't told was where the graphics and text came from --whether from public on-line chat groups or for-pay adult bulletin boards -- and how difficult they were to access. Senators reacted as most of us would in that situation, they voted for an amendment they thought penalized pornographers and sexual predators and which purported to protect children. In my opinion, that legislation duplicated existing prohibitions for on-line obscenity and created new restrictions on speech which is protected by the First Amendment.In a well-intentioned attempt to protect children, we trampled on one of the most fundamental rights we have in this country -- to speak freely and without reservation independent of prevailing views of what is offensive and unconstrained by a frequently changing political environment.I am concerned that the Senate will take further legislative steps that will stifle the growth of interactive communications technology and ultimately censor communications on the Internet while not truly solving the problem.I think we need to look very carefully at the following questions: Where do the fundamental problems exist with abuse of the Internet --on newsgroups, on for-pay bulletin boards, within electronic mail, or elsewhere?What is the nature of the problem -- sexual predation, obscenity, pornography, indecency, profanity, or harassment? What laws -- federal, state and local -- exist currently to address those problems?And finally, where do those laws fall short of protecting our children? It is incumbent upon Congress to restore some rationality to the debate by trying to answer these questions. In addition, those participating in this debate need to stop using terms with very different meanings interchangeably, such as obscenity, pornography and indecency. We must learn how interactive communications systems differ structurally from existing types of communications technologies as well as how they are similar. Supreme Court decisions on content regulation and the First Amendment have always weighed heavily on the nature of the medium in question.Hopefully, we will have some of these questioned answered in today's hearing. However, I want to caution my colleagues that one hearing alone cannot adequately address the complexities of this issue nor will it lead us to the proper solution without further study. I strongly urge my colleagues to exercise caution and restraint when considering legislative attempts to regulate free speech. We must look for solutions that empower parents to exercise more control over the types of information their children receive over computer networks. Free- market remedies, where they are possible, are almost always preferable to heavy handed content regulation and criminal penalties imposed by the federal government.I look forward to learning more about all of these issues from our witnesses, and I thank them from participating in this hearing.

I logged on to Bill's bbs "Beyond the Sound Barrier" and at this time was required to give him my name and address. After doing this I logged on with my usual handle "She Devil" and for the first couple of days he seemed really nice. He welcomed me to his bbs and tome me to look around at what the channel had to offer. The next day he asked me if I would be co-sysop and watch over the teleconference when more phone lines were installed. I said yes. and then after a couple of days he started asking me personal questions such as "do I shave besides my legs, "what bra size do I wear", would I go out with him", and " would I blow him". When I would not answer, he kept asking me so I logged off and went o the other bbs "the Zoo".He followed me to that channel and logged on and kept telling me he was going to come to my house. After telling him 20 times not to come over he finally agreed and I though that was the end of it. That night at about 1:30 a.m., three days after I became co-sysop, he came over and I told him not to come back again. It said "it's late and he was going to have to leave" and he did as I asked. The next day he came to my house and sat outside for four hours and my mother was forced to call the police and then he left. The next day he came back and sat outside my house again and when I went to the front window to see what the dog was barking at, he saw me and left. That Saturday I went to the bowling alley to meet a few friends and he followed me around all night but didn't say anything to me.A couple of days later when I logged on to this bbs he emulated me and took me to some pornographic pictures [emulate is a term that refers to using a computer at a remote location to act as though it were my computer, in so doing, the remote user can "appear" to others in the cyber world as though he is me. This is a procedure which, with certain software, can be done with out my permission, and sometimes, without my knowledge]. When he did that he I had no way of getting out of them and I turned my computer off. The next time I logged on his bbs he attempted to down load pornographic pictures to me but was having trouble doing it. He allowed me to download one to myself and I did so I could give one to the detective. I have not called his bbs since then.

That is correct, the first.In spite of the action taken by the Senate Commerce Committee when it added the Communications Decency Act to its telecommunications bills last year and this, they held no investigative or legislative hearings into this important and complex matter. Indeed, when the Senate passed a restrictive version of the Exon-Coats Communications Decency Act on June 14, over my objection and those of Senator Feingold, it did so without the benefit of hearings or anything approaching a thorough examination of the matter. I am old-fashioned enough to remember when we used to hold hearings first and pass legislation after--after we got the facts, had analyzed the problem and had worked with the Administration and the public to craft a legislative solution to the public's legitimate concerns.With all the magazine articles, talk show babble, and furor that has surrounded this issue, I am glad the Judiciary Committee is holding this hearing in order to begin to set the record straight. I want to commend Chairman Hatch and Senator Grassley for convening this hearing and look forward to the testimony of our witnesses this afternoon. These are issues that greatly concern me: the future of the Internet; the best ways for parents to control their children's access to the Internet and to protect against inappropriate and offense materials; the appropriate role of law enforcement.I had asked the Attorney General of the United States as well as a coalition of private and public interest groups known as the Interactive Working Group to look at these issues and provide recommendations on addressing the problem of children's access to objectionable online material in a constitutional and effective manner. I look forward to receiving the report of the Department of Justice as promptly as their study can be concluded.Today the Interactive Working Group is releasing its report describing some of the technology available today to help parents supervise their children's activities on the Internet and protect them from objectionable online material. Some of this technology was demonstrated last week in a meeting hosted by Representative Cox, who will testify here today.We are finding that software entrepreneurs and the vibrant forces of the free market are providing tools that can empower parents' to restrict their children's access to offensive material. We can address the problem of online pornography by empowering parents, and not the government, to screen children's computer activities. This is the best way to police the Internet without unduly restricting free speech or squelching the growth of this fantastic new communications medium. It is parents, not the government, who should decide what restrictions to place on their children's access to that which they consider objectionable: whether it is beer advertising, or fantastic card games that some parents believe promotes interest in the occult. Available blocking technology can make pornographic Usenet news groups or World Wide Web sites off-limits to children. Other commercially available products limit children's access to chat rooms, where they might be solicited, and limit children's ability to receive pornographic pictures through electronic mail. Yet other products allow parents to monitor their children's usage of the Internet. Interested organizations, like the Christian Coalition or Mothers against Drunk Driving, could provide parents that use blocking technology with lists of sites these groups consider inappropriate for children. On the other hand, government regulation will stifle this new industry. The Internet has been growing at an exponential rate and new uses for it are devised daily. Overly restrictive bans against indecency on the Internet will prove not only unconstitutional but will also hamper the growth of this new communications medium. The Internet does not function like a broadcast or a newspaper where a station manager or editor chooses which images or stories to send out in public. The Internet is like a combination of a great library and town square, where people can make available vast amounts of information or take part in free and open discussions on any topic. It has provided great opportunities for our disabled citizens and has enabled our children the ability to discuss issues with some of society's greatest minds. With this technology, I conduct electronic town meetings with Vermonters, post information about legislative activities, and hear back from Vermonters about what they think. To impose the government regulation of broadcasters to the Internet is inappropriate. Anyone with a computer and a modem can send something out on the Internet, but unlike a broadcaster, potential listeners must seek out this information and download it. Any legislative approach must take into consideration online users' privacy and free speech interests. If we grant too much power to online providers to screen for indecent material, public discourse and online content in cyberspace will be controlled by the providers and not the users of this fantastic resource. On the other hand, we want our laws should encourage and not discourage online providers from creating a safe environment for children.Even worse would be discouraging online providers from allowing children onto their services altogether. If online providers are liable for any exposure of indecent material to children, people under the age of eighteen will be shut out of this technology or relegated by the government to sanitized "kids only" services that contain only a tiny fraction of the entire Internet. That would be the equivalent of limiting today's students to the childhood section of the library or locking them out completely. This is not how this country should face the increasingly competitive global marketplace of the 21st century. What are we doing if we discourage the Project Gutenberg from placing online the works of Charles Dickens, Geoffrey Chaucer or D.H. Lawrence for fear of prosecution because someone, somewhere on the Internet, might find the works indecent? Would the Internet still be the great electronic library and setting for open discussion it now promises? Parents know their children better than any government official, and are in the best position to know the sort of online material to which their children may be exposed.Finally, we must recognize that existing laws and what they provide by way of protection. Our criminal laws already prohibit the sale or distribution over computer networks of obscene material. We already impose criminal liability for transmitting any threatening message over computer networks. We already proscribe the solicitation of minors over computers for any sexual activity, and illegal luring of minors into sexual activity through computer conversations. Indeed, a only a few months ago under Senator Grassley's leadership we increased the penalties for many of these offenses. We need to work with law enforcement to make sure they have the resources and training to track down computer criminals. I look forward to working with all members of the Committee as we move forward on these important matters.

Comments regarding this initial notice will be considered in the development of the final capacity notice.DATES: Written comments must be received on or before November 15, 1995.ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to the Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit (TILU), Federal Bureau of Investigation, P.O. Box 220450, Chantilly, VA 22022-0450.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:Contact TILU at (800) 551-0336. Please refer to your question as a capacity notice question.I. Background    On October 25, 1994, the President signed into law the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) (Public Law 103-414; 47 U.S.C. 1001-1010). This law presents law enforcement's requirements for the surveillance of wire or electronic communications. The primary purpose of the CALEA is to clarify a telecommunications carrier's duty to assist law enforcement agencies with the lawful interception of communications and the acquisition of call-identifying information in an ever-changing telecommunications environment. To ensure that law enforcement agencies can continue to conduct authorized surveillance of wire or electronic communications, the CALEA states that telecommunications carriers must meet the assistance capability requirements set forth in section 103 of the Act (and restated in Appendix A of this notice).    Section 104 of the CALEA mandates that the Attorney General of the United States provide notice of estimates for the actual and maximum number of pen register, trap and trace, and communication intercepts that law enforcement agencies may conduct and use simultaneously.    The definitions for ``actual capacity'' and ``maximum capacity'' are included below:    Actual Capacity--``notice of the actual number of communication interceptions. pen registers, and trap and trace devices, representing a portion of the maximum capacity that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously by the date that is 4 years after the date of enactment of the CALEA'' (CALEA, section 104(a)(1)(A)).    Maximum Capacity--``notice of the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is [[Page 53644]]4 years after of enactment of the CALEA'' (CALEA, section 104(a)(1)(B)).    This Federal Register announcement serves as the initial notice of the government's actual and maximum capacity requirements. These requirements will aid telecommunications carriers in developing and deploying solutions to meet the assistance capability requirements set forth in section 103 of the CALEA. A final notice will be issued in accordance with the CALEA requirements after considering comments to this initial notice.    The actual and maximum capacity requirements were developed by the FBI in coordination with law enforcement. By order of the Attorney General of the United States, as codified in 28 CFR 0.85 (o), government implementation responsibilities under the CALEA were delegated to the FBI. The FBI, in turn, is establishing TILU to carry out the government's implementation responsibilities, including the publication of capacity notices.    For the purposes of this document, the terms defined in section 2510 of title 18, United States Code, and section 102 of the CALEA (section 1001 of title 47, United States Code) have, respectively, the meanings stated in those sections. Additional clarification of terms is provided in Appendix B of this notice.II. Introduction    The capacity figures in this notice reflect the combined number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions that law enforcement may conduct by October 25, 1998. All telecommunications carriers must, within 3 years after the publication of the final notice of capacity requirements or within 4 years after the date of enactment of the CALEA, whichever is longer, ensure that their systems are capable of accommodating simultaneously the number of pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions identified in the actual capacity requirements. Furthermore, all telecommunications carriers shall ensure capabilities exist to expeditiously accommodate any increase in the actual number of pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions that authorized agencies may seek to conduct and use, up to the maximum capacity requirement. Some carriers may not need to make modifications to their equipment, facilities, and services in response to this notice because they currently meet all law enforcement capacity and capability requirements for electronic surveillance.    The capacity requirements are not intended to specify, required or prohibit adoption of any particular system design or configuration by a telecommunications carrier, equipment manufacturer, or support services provider. These entities must develop an appropriate solution to comply with the capacity requirements set forth in this notice and with the assistance capability requirements found in section 103 of the CALEA. In developing solutions, carriers should consider the effect that particular services and features may have on capacity requirements. For example, the required number of ports, lines, or other network resources may vary depending upon the use of particular services and features by an intercept subject. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, will be available, through the consultative process, to discuss these engineering issues.    In accordance with the intent of the CALEA, carriers must ensure that their equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications are capable of meeting the capability and capacity requirements mandated by the CALEA. These requirements apply to existing and future telecommunications carriers.III. Capacity Requirements Derivation    The capacity figures that are presented in this initial notice were derived as a result of a thorough analysis of electronic surveillance needs. Information regarding electronic surveillance activities for a specific time period was obtained from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement, U.S. District Courts, State Courts, State Attorneys General, and State District Attorneys to establish a historical baseline of activity.    The historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity was determined after examination of both the location and occurrence of each electronic surveillance reported. The historical baseline was then analyzed to derive the total and simultaneous electronic surveillance activity by switch and within specific geographic areas. Future capacity needs were then determined after consideration of the impact of demographics, market trends, and other factors on the historical baseline.    The analysis indicates that electronic surveillance activity varies by geographic area. Therefore, the capacity requirements will vary by geographic area. The capacity requirements are reported by category, with each geographic area being assigned to one of three distinct categories. The use of categories enables capacity requirements to be stated in a manner that reasonably represents law enforcement electronic surveillance needs in all geographic areas, yet does not overburden the telecommunications industry by holding all carriers to the same level of capacity.    Category I (the highest category) and Category II (the intermediate category) represent those geographic areas where the majority of electronic surveillance activity occurs. Only a few of the most densely populated areas, which have historically been areas of high electronic surveillance activity, are grouped into Category I. Other densely populated areas and some suburban areas, with moderate electronic surveillance activity, are grouped into Category II. The numbers for these categories were derived based on the analysis described above. Category I and Category II apply to approximately 25 percent of the equipment, facilities, and services covered by the survey over the time period.    Category III (the lowest category) represents law enforcement's minimum acceptable capacity requirements for electronic surveillance activity. This category covers all other geographic areas. The numbers for Category III were derived by analyzing areas of historically low electronic surveillance activity and projecting future needs in order to establish a requirement for a minimum level of capacity for electronic surveillance.    All telecommunications carriers are expected to meet the minimum capacity requirements of Category III. Carriers will be individually notified of those specific geographic areas within the areas they serve that exceed Category III and warrant a Category I or Category II capacity requirement. The individual carrier notifications will occur contemporaneously with the publication of the final notice. It is anticipated that the majority of the area served by a carrier will fall into Category III; however, if Category I and Category II capacity requirements are necessary, they are likely to affect only a small portion of their area served.    This initial capacity notice includes the actual and maximum capacity requirements for Categories I, II, and III. After considering comments to this initial notice, a final notice will be published. Future changes to the maximum capacity requirements issued in the final notice will be published in the Federal Register, as necessary, in accordance with section 104(c). [[Page 53645]]IV. Initial Statement of Actual and Maximum Capacity    The actual and maximum capacity requirements are presented as a percentage of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, and services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications. Engineered capacity refers to the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by that equipment, facility, or service. Frequently, the percentage is applied to the engineered subscriber capacity of a switch, however, the percentage can also apply to nonswitch equipment (i.e., network peripherals) involved in the origination, termination, or direction of communications. Percentages are being used rather than fixed numbers due to the dynamics and diversity of the telecommunications industry. The use of percentages allows telecommunications carriers the flexibility to adjust to changes in marketplace conditions or changes in the number of subscribers, access lines, equipment, facilities, etc., and still know the required level of capacity.    As a result of extensive consultation with federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, providers of telecommunications support services, and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, the FBI proposes the following capacity requirements for Categories I, II, and III:Category IActual Capacity    Each telecommunications carrier must provide the ability to meet the capability assistance requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions equal to 0.5% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.Maximum Capacity    Each telecommunications carrier must ensure that it can expeditiously increase its capacity to meet the assistance capability requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions equal to 1% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.Category IIActual Capacity    Each telecommunications carrier must provide the ability to meet the capability assistance requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions equal to 0.25% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.Maximum Capacity    Each telecommunications carrier must ensure that it can expeditiously increase its capacity to meet the assistance capacity requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions equal to 0.5% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.Category IIIActual Capacity    Each telecommunications carrier must provide the ability to meet the capability assistance requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions equal to 0.05% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.Maximum Capacity    Each telecommunications carrier must ensure that it can expeditiously increase its capacity to meet the assistance capability requirements defined in section 103 of the CALEA for a number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions equal to 0.25% of the engineered capacity of the equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications.    When translated from percentages to numbers, capacity requirements should be rounded up to the nearest whole number.V. Carrier Statements and Consultation    As set forth in section 104(d) of the CALEA, each telecommunications carrier is required to provide within 180 days after publication of the final capacity notice a statement identifying any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity to meet the assistance capability requirements stated in section 103 of the CALEA. These carrier statements will be used in conjunction with law enforcement priorities and other factors to determine the specific equipment, facilities, and services that require immediate modification and that may be eligible for cost reimbursement. The FBI will consult with telecommunications carriers to establish a template for responding to the capability and capacity requirements.Appendix A--CALEA, Sec. 103 (Pub. L. 103-414; 47 U.S.C. 1002) Assistance Capability Requirements    (a) Capability Requirements.--Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section and sections 108(a) and 109(b) and (d), a telecommunications carrier shall ensure that its equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications are capable of--    (1) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to intercept, to the exclusion of any other communications, all wire and electronic communications carried by the carrier within a service area to or from equipment, facilities, or services of a subscriber of such carrier concurrently with their transmission to or from the subscriber's equipment, facility, or service, or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government;    (2) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to access call-identifying information that is reasonably available to the carrier--    (A) before, during, or immediately after the transmission of a wire or electronic communication (or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government); and    (B) in a manner that allows it to be associated with the communication to which it pertains, except that, with regard to information acquired solely pursuant to the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices (as defined in section 3127 of title 18, United States Code), such call-identifying information shall not include any information that may disclose the physical location of the subscriber (except to the extent that the location may be determined from the telephone number);    (3) delivering intercepted communications and call-identifying information to the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, in a format such that they may be transmitted by means of equipment, facilities, or services procured by the government to a location other than the premises of the carrier; and    (4) facilitating authorized communications interceptions and access to call-identifying information unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with any subscriber's telecommunications service and in a manner that protects--[[Page 53646]]    (A) the privacy and security of communications and call-identifying information not authorized to be intercepted; and    (B) information regarding the government's interception of communications and access to call-identifying information.    (b) Limitations.--    (1) Design of Features and Systems Configurations.--This title does not authorize any law enforcement agency or officer--    (A) to require any specific design of equipment, facilities, services, features, or system configurations to be adopted by any provide of a wire or electronic communication service, any manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, or any provider of telecommunications support services; or    (B) to prohibit the adoption of any equipment, facility, service, or feature by any provider of a wire or electronic communication service, any manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, or any provider of telecommunications support services.    (2) Information Services; Private Networks and Interconnection Services and Facilities.--The requirements of subsection (a) do not apply to--    (A) information services; or    (B) equipment, facilities, or services that support the transport or switching of communications for private networks or for the sole purpose of interconnecting telecommunications carriers.    (3) Excryption.--A telecommunications carrier shall not be responsible for decryping, or ensuring the government's ability to decrypt, any communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer, unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication.    (c) Emergency or Exigent Circumstances.--In emergency or exigent circumstances (including those described in sections 2518 (7) or (11)(b) and 3125 of title 18, United States Code, and section 1805(e) of title 50 of such Code), a carrier at its discretion may comply with subsection (a)(3) by allowing monitoring at its premises if that is the only means of accomplishing the interception or access.    (d) Mobile Service Assistance Requirements.--A telecommunications carrier that is a provider of commercial mobile service (as defined in section 332(d) of the Communications Act of 1934) offering a feature or service that allows subscribers to redirect, hand off, or assign their wire or electronic communications to another service area or another service provider or to utilize facilities in another service area or of another service provider shall ensure that, when the carrier that had been providing assistance for the interception of wire or electronic communications or access to call-identifying information pursuant to a court order or lawful authorization no longer has access to the content of such communications or call-identifying information within the service area in which interception has been occurring as a result of the subscriber's use of such a feature or service, information is made available to the government (before, during, or immediately after the transfer of such communications) identifying the provider of a wire or electronic communication service that has acquired access to the communications.Appendix B--Glossary    Communication Interceptions--Regarding a wire or an electronic communication, communication interceptions include any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication. Communication interceptions apply to any type of wire or electronic communications (i.e., any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature).    Call-Identifying Information--Dialing or signaling information that identifies the origin, direction, destination, or termination of each communication generated or received by a subscriber by means of any equipment, facility, or service of a telecommunications carrier.

That simply is not so.            Court-ordered wiretapping is the single most effectiveinvestigative technique used by law enforcement to combat illegaldrugs, terrorism, violent crime, espionage and organized crime. The majority of wiretapping is conducted by state and local lawenforcement.  Last year there were 1,154 wiretap court ordersnationwide for all of law enforcement but these court-orderedwiretaps are critical to saving lives and solving the very worstcrimes suffered by the public.  Moreover, that number is notexpected to increase in any significant manner when the lawalready passed by Congress is fully implemented.           Congress last year overwhelmingly passed legislation topreserve this ability in the face of advancing technology.  Thelaw neither expands authority nor ability, it merely maintainsthe status quo, that is, only maintains the ability of lawenforcement to conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance. Without this, the public safety would be severely jeopardized. The simple facts are: Congress last year did not expand the FBI's authority to conductwiretaps nor did the FBI ask Congress to do so. The FBI and the telephone industry are working together -- as thelaw Congress passed last year requires -- to find reasonable and affordablesolutions in the face of advancing technology. The initial public requestfor comment is part of that process. We have not and are not asking for the ability to               monitor one out of every 100 telephone lines or               any other ridiculous number like that.  To obtain               that many court orders and conduct that extent of               wiretapping would be nearly impossible.  Information supplied by the FBI was simply applied in               a manner not intended to reach erroneous               conclusions. Without this law, adequate funding and reasonable               technical solutions, the Nation's public safety               and national security are unquestionably               jeopardized.  Merely maintaining without expanding    the ability of law enforcement to conduct court-ordered wiretaps is the single most important               problem law enforcement faces today.           The new law requires the FBI, on behalf of all of lawenforcement, to work with the telephone industry to identifytechnical design requirements for industry to build into theirsystems.  The public notice mentioned in The Times article ispart of that process and we are working with the telephoneindustry to define workable requirements and reasonablecapacities. Deputy Attorney General Gorelick said this morning:"Let me make it perfectly clear, there is no intention to expandthe number of wiretaps or the extent of wiretapping."  Those whoare using the public comment notice to argue to the contrary arewrong. Sincerely yours, Louis J.

Burns upon introduction of S. 1587 STATEMENT BY SENATOR CONRAD BURNSRE:  INTRODUCTION OF THE "ENCRYPTIONCOMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF 1996DATED MARCH 5, 1996	I believe that one of the biggest concerns that folks have in my home State of Montana is the increasing level  of governmental regulation and intrusion into their daily lives.  There is no question that this legislation will have a direct impact on the federal government's abiliy to monitor folks communications or review their personal computer files.  I gotta tell you, I don' know too many people who feel that he IRS doesn't have enough power as it is, and the last thing we want to do is give the IRS essentially free access to folks tax records.   	However, my primary interest in offering this legislaion is that it has profound and far-reaching impacts on both America's economy and upon individual Americans.	First,  let me talk about the bill's impact upon the American economy.  	--  This bill, by eliminating the outdated export restrictions that are presently in place, frees up American companies to compete in the global market.   This will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, it will translate intot $100 billion in increased revenues for our country over the next couple of years, and it will insure that America will remain the world leader as we make the transition to the Global Information Infrasructure.	--  I've explained these impacts in greater detail in my Statement introducing the bill, copies of which are floating around the room.	Next, and more importantly, I want to focus today upon what this legislation means to individual Americans.	--  Aside from protecting American's personal files and communications from unauthorized "hacking." I believe that the most profound impact of this legislation will be upon the growth of the Inernet.	--  For the past seven y ears while I've been doing telecommunications work here in Congress, I've watched he Internet flourish.  I see unbelievable opporunity for all Americans, both financially and personallly, if we allow the Inernet to continue to grow.	(1)	Folks will be able to use the Internet to conduct banking and other financial transactions from their home over the Inernet;	(2)	They'll be able to purchase an unlimited array of products and services directly from their homes;	(3)	Furthermore, the Net will play a vital role in the development of Telemedicine. 	(4)	The possibilities are endless.  They are bound only by American's imagination.	HOWEVER,  all of these opportunities will be lost if we don't allow companies to use adequate encryption capabilities.  We've witnessed over the past couple of months examples of this very fact:	--  There's the case of the doctor in West Virginia who wanted to save his patients money  and increase the quality of medical care they receied by putting their records on the Internet so that other physicians could review them for consultation purposes.  He decided not to do it because the Net didn't have a high enough level of security because of these outdated governmental export restrictions to insure that these records wouldn't become immediately accessible to the public.	--  Then there's the case where a couple of Russian students "hacked" into the Citibank system and stole several million dollars.  The only way they caught the guy is because his girlfriend  turned him in after he broke up with her.	--  The list goes on and on.	I believe that this legislation will  allow American companies to develop computer technology that will create consumer confidence in the security of transmissions over the Internet which will create unlimited opportunity for both businesses and the American consumer.	Finally, this legislation will allow the Telecommunications Bill which we recently passed here in Congress to work; without it, I question whether much of our work was in vain. 	--  For example, the Teleco bill allows the cable companies, and utility companies to compee against one another to provide a comprehensive package of services to the consumer across one line.  Over this line, folks will be able to watch television, call their children, access the Internet,  insure that their home is protected by an alarm system while they're away, and have utility services.  But if this line isn't secure, who's going to want to purchase such a package in the first place?	It is for these reasons that I am pushing forward with this legislation.  I believe that it will not only take  the handcuffs off our American companies to compete in the world market, it will more importantly open up unprecedented opportunities for both businesses and individual consumers.  I look forward to holding a series of hearings on these issues in the Subcommittee on Science, Space and Technology of the Commerce Committee this Spring.

Leahy on Introduction of S. 1587         STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHY ON INTRODUCTION OF        ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF 1996             March 5, 1996             I am joined today by Senators Burns, Dole, Pressler and Murray in      introducing a bill that is pro-business, pro-jobs and pro-privacy.              The "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996" would enhance      the global competitiveness of our high-tech industries, protect the      high-paying good jobs in those industries and maximize the choices in      encryption technology available for businesses and individuals to      protect the privacy, confidentiality and security of their computer,      telephone, and other wire and electronic communications.             The guiding principle for this bill can be summed up in one      sentence:  Encryption is good for American business and good business      for Americans.              FBI Director Louis Freeh testified last week at a hearing on      economic espionage and quoted Secretary of State Warren Christopher as      saying that "our national security is inseparable from our economic      security." I could not agree more. Yet, American businesses are      suffering a double blow from our current encryption policies.  First,      American firms lose billions of dollars each year due to the theft of      proprietary economic information, which could be better protected if      strong encryption were more widely used. Second, government export      restrictions tie the hands of American high-tech businesses by barring      the export of strong encryption technology.  The size of these      combined losses makes encryption one of the critical issues facing      American businesses today.              Moreover, the increasing use of and dependency on networked      computers by Americans to obtain critical medical services, to conduct      research, to be entertained, to go shopping and to communicate with      friends and business associates, raises special concerns about the      privacy and confidentiality of their computer transmissions. I have      long been concerned about these issues, and have worked over the past      decade to create a legal structure to foster privacy and security for      our wire and electronic communications. Encryption technology provides      an effective way to ensure that only the people we choose can read our      communications.             A leading encryption expert, Matt Blaze, told me in a recent letter      that our current regulations governing the use and export of      encryption are having a "deleterious effect... on our country's      ability to develop a reliable and trustworthy information      infrastructure."  It is time for Congress to take steps to put our      national encryption policy on the right course.              The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act would accomplish three      goals:             First, the bill encourages the use of encryption by legislatively      confirming that Americans have the freedom to use and sell here in the      United States any encryption technology that they feel is most      appropriate to meet their privacy and security needs. The bill bars      any government-mandated use of any particular encryption system, such      as a key escrow encryption system.              Second, for those Americans who choose to use a key escrow      encryption method, the bill establishes privacy standards for key      holders and stringent procedures for how law enforcement can obtain      access to decoding keys and decryption assistance. These standards      would subject key holders to criminal and civil liability if they      released the keys or divulged the identity and information about the      user of the encryption system, without legal authorization.       Commenting on these provisions, Bruce Schneir, who has literally      written the textbook on encryption, said in a recent letter to me that      the bill "recognizes the special obligations of keyholders to be      vigilant in safeguarding the information entrusted to them, without      imposing hurtles on the use of cryptography."             Finally, the bill loosens export restrictions on encryption      products. Under the bill, it would be lawful for American companies to      export high-tech products with encryption capabilities when comparable      encryption capabilities are available from foreign suppliers, and      generally available encryption software, including mass market      products and encryption that is in the public domain. According to Mr.      Schneir, the bill "removes the strangle-hold that has encumbered the      development of mass-market security solutions" which are so vital to      the development of our information infrastructure.              Senator Murray took a leading role in the last Congress on      reforming our export restrictions on encryption, and I commend her for      continuing to give this important issue her committed attention again      in this Congress.              Current export restrictions allow the export of primarily weak      encryption software programs.  So weak, in fact, that a January 1996      report by an ad hoc group of world-renowned cryptographers and      computer scientists estimated that it would take a pedestrian hacker a      matter of hours to break and a foreign intelligence agency a matter of      nanoseconds to break.  No wonder that foreign buyers of encryption      products are increasingly looking elsewhere for strong security.  This      hurts the competitiveness of our high-tech industry.              A recent report by the Computer Systems Policy Project, which is a      group of major American computer companies estimated that U.S.      companies stand to lose between $30 and 60 BILLION in revenues and      over 200,000 of high-tech jobs by the year 2000 because U.S. companies      are handicapped in the global market by outdated export restrictions.             Even the Commerce Department reported in January that U.S. export      controls may have a "negative effect on U.S. competitiveness" and "may      discourage" the use of strong encryption domestically since      manufacturers want to make only one product for export and for use      here.             Although American companies account for almost 75 percent of the      global market for prepackaged software, the rest of the world is      competing strongly in the market for encryption software.       Short-sighted government policy is holding back American business.      Almost two years ago, I chaired a hearing of the Judiciary      Subcommittee on Technology and the Law on the Administration's      "Clipper Chip" key escrow encryption program. I  heard testimony about      340 foreign encryption products that were available worldwide, 155 of      them employing encryption in a strength that American firms were      prohibited from exporting.               In two short years, those numbers have increased.  According to a      survey of cryptographic products conducted by Trusted Information      System, as of December 1995, 497 foreign products from 28 countries      were available with encryption security. Almost 200 of these foreign      products used strong encryption that American companies are barred      from selling abroad.  This study draws the obvious conclusion that "As      a result, U.S. Government restrictions may be succeeding only in      crippling a vital American industry's exporting ability."             At the Clipper Chip hearing I chaired in 1994, I heard a number of      reports about American companies losing business opportunities due to      U.S. export restrictions.  One data security company reported that      despite its superior system, it had been unable to respond to requests      from NATO and foreign  telecommunications companies because it cannot      export the encryption they demanded. This cost this single American      company millions in foregone business.  Another major computer company      lost two sales in Western Europe in a single year totaling about $80      million because the file and data encryption in the integrated system      they offered was not exportable.              Our current export restrictions on encryption technology are      fencing off the global marketplace and hurting the competitiveness of      this part of our high-tech industries.  While national and domestic      security concerns must weigh heavily, we need to do a better job of      balancing these concerns with American business' need for encryption      and the economic opportunities for our high-tech industries that      encryption technology provides.              American businesses are not only suffering lost sales because of      our current export restrictions, but are also suffering staggering      losses due to economic espionage. FBI Director Freeh testified that      the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy puts the      amount of that loss at $100 billion per year. At a hearing last week      on economic espionage, we heard from one witness who had to close down      his software company, with a loss of 25 jobs, after China bribed an      employee to steal the source code for the company's software.             We have bills pending before Congress to enact new criminal laws to      punish people who steal trade secrets or other proprietary information      and who break into computers to steal sensitive information.  But new      criminal laws are not the whole answer. Criminal laws often only come      into play too late, after the theft has occurred or the injury      inflicted.              We must encourage American firms to take preventive measures to      protect their vital economic information. That is where encryption      comes in.  Just as we have security systems to lock up our offices and      file drawers, we need strong encryption systems to protect the      security and confidentiality of business information.              The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that, without strong      encryption, financial losses by the year 2000 from breaches of      computer security systems to be from $40 to $80 billion.      Unfortunately, some of these losses are already occurring.  One U.S.      based manufacturer is quoted in the Project's report, saying:             "We had a multi-year, multi-billion dollar contract stolen off our      P.C. (while bidding in a foreign country). Had it been encrypted, [the      foreign competitor] could not have used it in the bidding time frame."             New technologies present enormous opportunities for Americans, but      we must strive to safeguard our privacy if these technologies are to      prosper in this information age.  Otherwise, in the service of law      enforcement and intelligence needs, we will dampen any enthusiasm      Americans may have for taking advantage of the new technologies.             I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important      matter, and ask unanimous consent that my full statement, the bill, a      summary of the bill and three letters of support from Matt Blaze,      Bruce Schneir, and Business Software Alliance, be included in the      Record.

Patrick LeahyUnited States SenateDear Senator Leahy,    I would like to thank you for introducing the EncryptedCommunications Privacy Act.  As a member of the computer and informationsecurity research community, I am keenly aware of the vital role ofcryptography in fostering the development of our information infrastructure.    As the author of the book, "Applied Cryptography", I have unusualinsights into the absurdity of cryptography export restrictions.  It isnot without irony that one may export my book in paper format, but notelectronically.  Presumably no rational person believes that thecurrent restrictions actually prevent the spread of cryptography.  Ibelieve you recognize this, as evidenced from the strong stance takenin your bill.    As the bill recognizes, we can no longer afford to hold on to theobsolete notion that cryptography is the sole province of governmentcommunications; the growth of modern networks has irrevocably pushedit into the mainstream.  I applaud you leadership towards codifyingthese principles in a balanced and responsible way.  In particular,the bill:      o Removes the regulatory strangle-hold that has encumbered        the development of mass-market security solutions;       o Recognizes the futility of applying regulations intended to        control the international arms trade to even the most         mundane and commonly available software;      o Encourages public confidence in encryption by allowing        the marketplace to provide a full range of choices for        privacy and security needs;      o Recognizes the special obligations of keyholders to be        vigilant in safeguarding the information entrusted to        them, without imposing hurtles on the use of cryptography;      o Allows the United States to continue its leadership role as        a technological innovator;      o Acknowledges the pivotal role of cryptography in electronic        commerce.    I continue to have concerns that the new criminal obstructionprovision will discourage law abiding citizens from using cryptography.I hope that legislative history and further discussion will demonstratethe narrow intent of this crime.    Overall, your bill takes very necessary strides towards ensuring thatthe protections we take for granted in traditional media keep pace withtechnology, and I commend your efforts.                                Sincerely,                                     /s/                                Bruce Schneier Return to CDT Cryptography Page Return to CDT Home PageWT02-B07-88IA095-001027-B026-48http://www.cdt.org:80/policy/legislation/exon-coats.html 205.177.10.31 19970215003344 text/html 8401HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 00:31:56 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act as passed by the US Senate 6/14/95 This strikes all of Title IV of S. 652 and replaces it with the following:Sec.___ OBSCENE OR HARASSING USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES UNDER        THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934Section 223 (47 U.S.C. 223) is amended --   (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting in lieu thereof: ``(a) Whoever--       ``(1) in the District of Columbia or in interstate or      foreign communications       	``(A) by means of telecommunications device knowingly--                ``(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and          ``(ii) initiates the transmission of,     any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other      communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or      indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass      another person;      	 ``(B) makes a telephone call or utilizes a      telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or      communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and      with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person      at the called number or who receives the communication;     	  ``(C) makes or causes the telephone of another repeatedly      or continuously to ring, with intent to harass any person at      the called number; or      	 ``(D) makes repeated telephone calls or repeatedly      initiates communication with a telecommunications device,      during which conversation or communication ensues, solely to      harass any person at the called number or who receives the      communication; or      	 ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility      under his control to be used for any activity prohibited by      paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for     such activity,     shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more      than two years, or both.''; and   (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:      ``(d) Whoever--       ``(1) knowingly within the United States or in foreign      communications with the United States by means of      telecommunications device makes or makes available any     obscene communication in any form including any comment,     request, suggestion, proposal, image, regardless of whether the      maker of such communication placed the call or initiated the      communications; or       ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility      under such person's control to be used for an activity      prohibited by subsection (d)(1) with the intent that it be      used for such activity;     shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more      than two years or both.       ``(e) Whoever--       ``(1) knowingly within the United States or in foreign      communications with the United States by means of      telecommunications device makes or makes available     any indecent comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image     to any person under 18 years of age      regardless of whether the maker of such communication placed      the call or initiated the communication; or       ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility      under such person's control to be used for an activity      prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used      for such activity,     shall be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned not more      than two years or both.       ``(f) Defenses to the subsections (a), (d), and (e),      restrictions on access, judicial remedies respecting      restrictions for persons providing information services and      access to information services--        (1) No person shall be held to have violated subsections (a),     (d), or (e) solely for providing access or connection to or     from a facility, system, or network over which that person     has no control, including related capabilities which are     incidental to providing access or connection.

In my capacity as President of "Enough is Enough!"--a non-profit, non-partisan women's organization opposing child pornography and illegal obscenity, I am very familiar with the issue of contemporary pornography--its content, availability and its harms. I speak not only on behalf of "Enough is Enough!" but, on a personal level, as a woman and as a grandmother of nine. Although we have many caring men involved in our work, our organization focuses primarily upon educating and mobilizing women, because women speak with a special authority on the issue of pornography--for we, and our children are its primary subjects...and its primary victims. Pornography demeans and degrades women, victimizes children and ruins men. It contributes to domestic and spouse abuse, rape, incest and child molestation. And a great share of it is not protected speech, any more than libel, slander or false advertising are protected speech; therefore, it is not a 1st Amendment issue. It is not legal material. Many Americans do not realize this fact.Today, America finds itself at a point of serious reassessment. Americans are coming rapidly to the awareness that the moral fabric of our country has become badly frayed. The consequences have become apparent. Due to the recent media focus upon "cyberporn," and consequent growing public awareness of computer pornography and its availability, especially to children, pornography has been thrust into prominence on America's reassessment agenda. The problem of pornography is an issue whose time has come.From all sides more and more voices are proclaiming that our culture is in crisis--a crisis of character. A second White House Conference on Character was convened. Organizations to promote character have been formed. For over a year, Bill Bennett's book, The Book of Virtues, has been near the top of the New York Times best-seller list. Traditional family values are being touted in nationwide political campaigns, by both parties. The entertainment industry is being challenged "to clean up its act." And while Congress and the Administration are wrestling with how to balance the budget and reduce the deficit so our children and grandchildren will not inherit our debts, there is another issue they must address as well...how to provide a protected space in which our children and grandchildren can grow up. As our common culture has become coarser, children have been robbed of their childhood. A time of innocence has been stolen away from today's children. It is time that adults of this nation take responsibility to combat the predators who are polluting the minds of our nation's most valuable resource--our children. The Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995 is a step in that direction, and is needed.Recently, PRIME TIME did a television program on children and sex, starkly revealing that children 10 and younger are being "sexualized" due to constant exposure to sexually-oriented materials. In an interview with Oprah, discussing sensational TV talk shows, First Lady Hillary Clinton asserted, "I'm tired of folks saying we can't change it because that's censorship." I, and many other Americans, would agree that tired excuse, which is now also being used in reference to any legislation or regulation of computer pornography, will no longer work in this country. Moms and dads, grandmothers and grandfathers--all responsible citizens, will not accept this feeble defense of doing nothing to protect the well-being and safety of children.Clinical studies and life experiences attest to the fact that pornography numbs the moral conscience, stunts moral growth and encourages anti- social behavior. In our organization's work with victims, we continually look into the eyes and hear from the hearts of those that have been bruised and broken by the effects of pornography. When we allow pornography to be freely available to children, pornography is not only an attack upon the present, but an attack upon the future as well. Once pornography has been viewed by young, vulnerable children, it can start a chain of abuse that carries over into their adult and family lives. You cannot simply push the delete button and eliminate those pornographic images from their memories; they will continue to play over and over again in the theater of their minds...perhaps for life.Over the years the pornography industry has had two basic business goals. To remove as much of the social stigma as possible from consuming pornography; secondly, to use every advance in technology to lessen the difficulty of purchasing and consuming pornography. Until the late 1970's, pornography was primarily available in magazines and 8mm film loops. It was distributed through the mail, street stalls and pornographic bookstores in the "bad part of town." The distasteful locations limited the market.In the 1980's the advent of the VCR was exploited by pornographers. Consumers could purchase videos and watch pornography right in their own homes. In addition, the ability to charge customers for special phone numbers led to the development of dial-a-porn. Satellite technology and the growth of cable led to further inroads by pornographers world-wide. Then came the advent of personal computers (PCs), and a whole new world of pornography access rushed in through its floodgate. Computer related developments will shape how the pornography industry seeks to market its products over the next quarter-century. And who will suffer the most?...the children!Today, we face an insidious threat---hard-core, child pornography and "indecent" material, which is harmful to minors, are being transmitted over the Internet directly into our homes. The Information Super Highway has been invaded by morally-irresponsible, reckless drivers, who travel the Highway with total disregard for the damage inflicted on young minds through the pornography they provide. Children are usually more adept than adults at operating computers, and today, with little effort, a child with a computer and a modem can download the most vile and perverse, often violent, hard-core pornography ever produced. This material includes such themes as incest, rape, bestiality (actual sex with most of the animals in Noah's Ark), torture and mutilation. This material can be accessed in full and clear color with just a few computer key clicks. This is pornography that the Supreme Court has ruled not to be protected speech, and is illegal for adults as well as children. There is federal legislation outlawing it. We need S.892, however, to provide federal legislation outlawing "indecent" material. This material is not protected speech and is already legislated against in most states and many local communities under the rubric of "material harmful to minors." With the advent of computers which send indecent material across state lines this federal legislation is needed.Pornography is harmful and destructive in the following ways: * it plays a major role in the molestation of children, serving as an  instruction manual for these crimes;* it exposes children at an impressionable age to attitudes and   behaviors that warp and twist their view of human dignity and   sexuality; * it shapes negative, degrading attitudes about women, erotizing   inequality;* it encourages rape and the rape myth, that women say "no" but mean   "yes" and they like violence;*  it erotizes violence and then fuels sexual violence; *  it holds an addictive and fatal attraction for many men and teenage    boys, it invades their thoughts and manipulates their behavior; *  it encourages the transmission of STD's (sexually transmitted    diseases) and*  it lowers community standards, which has a denigrating affect upon    our entire culture.Some say that pornography is a victimless crime; this is a myth perpetrated by those profiting through this multi-billion dollar industry and pornography consumers. What we see, and what we hear and read affect how we think and how we act. That is why companies spend millions of dollars on advertising each year...it works. And, of course, this premise is the very basis of all education. Not only is any child with a computer and a modem at risk of exposure to pornography on the Internet, but they are at risk of being exposed to pedophiles there as well. Pedophiles are those adults who have a sexual appetite for young children. They now electronically lurk on the Information Super Highway, as in schoolyards, to stalk their prey, unsuspecting children. Let me give you a real life example. A friend of one of the "Enough is Enough!" staff members tells how her husband intercepted a suspicious letter from a distant state addressed to their 16-year-old daughter. The letter proved to be from an adult man to whom the young girl had given her real name and address over her computer.This electronic predator began his letter by asking the girl to describe her fantasies, and then described his. He went into graphic, vulgar sexual detail. At first the teen-ager laughed about it, but quickly realized that it was no laughing matter, for her obscene "pen pal" could show up on her doorstep one day to fulfill his fantasy. She had made the dangerous mistake of giving out her real name and address to an unknown person through her home computer.As the public debate about computer pornography has intensified in recent weeks, there has often been misinformation, or partial information appearing in print. The detractors of efforts to address the issue legislatively have taken to various forms of attack in defense of electronic pornography. Their desperation is apparent as the truth about this situation has been brought to light. Seldom, even in these times of hyper-scrutiny and scathing criticism, does the level of viciousness reach the level it has on this issue. These detractors have tried to discredit and "beat-up" the messengers when they haven't liked the message. They have contested the exact percentages of various types of computer pornography available and how many people consume it. For those of us who are battling this vile and degrading material, that is exactly where we would like to stage the debate. Does it really matter what the exact percentage is of material that is available by computer, to children as well as adults -- material that degrades and tortures women, sexually uses children and debases human beings (and, in the view of animal lovers, even animals). Any is too much. One child's life misdirected into unhealthy sexual behavior is too much.If we do nothing to stem this flood of pornography available to children by computer, we will be changing the base line on the availability of illegal material. It will be comparable to inviting children to have free access into adult x-rated bookstores and theaters. In reality, we will never be able to eliminate all illegal pornography and protect all children from exposure to pornography. It is, however, imperative that we do all we can and we should do it in a reasoned, reasonable, yet responsible manner. It will take everyone working together to produce the best answer, or answers, to the problems of cyberporn.Some are saying that this problem is totally the parents responsibility. Parents must become educated about the dangers present in unmonitored computer use by their children. Parents also need to learn more about computer technology in order to do so. But to place all the responsibility upon the parents not only is unfair, it is inadequate to protect children. Parents can't be present 100% of the time to monitor their children, and they certainly cannot monitor what happens when they are at the homes of friends, whose parents may not be as informed or vigilant. Bringing a computer into your home for your child's use under this proposed solution is like having them bring home a rabid dog for the kids to play with, sitting him in a corner and then having to watch them constantly so the dog won't bite them.Some suggest technical screening "fixes". There are some developed now and more are being worked upon. These are goods ideas, but to say that this is the total answer is once again unfair and inadequate. Prior to this time those who wanted to consume pornography had to pay for it. Are we now going to say those who do not want pornography for their kids have pay not to get it? This would be a major shift of policy and approach. In addition, those who have in-depth computer understanding acknowledge that there is no way to screen all pornographic material. It is often asked that if much of this material is illegal (not protected speech) isn't it up to law enforcement to simply enforce the law? There should be aggressive enforcement of the pornography laws in the area of computer porn. The reality is, however, that law enforcement resources are limited and it is difficult to monitor and enforce this electronic outlet.To find effective solutions to the pornography problem, it will take the combination of education, legislative action, public policy initiatives and aggressive law enforcement, as well as the exercise of corporate and individual responsibility. The answer is everyone working together-- parents, individual citizens, schools, legislators, law enforcement and the corporate electronic business community. We must all take the responsibility to protect the welfare of our nation's children. Those in the technology community should be encouraged to work diligently to find every way possible to protect children from destructive pornographic material via computer. Yet we must all be committed to protecting both the free flow of material on the Information Superhighway and the children of the country. The Grassley bill does not place an unfair burden upon the access providers, but it does place responsibility upon them to do what they can do to protect the nation's computer-using children. Serial killer Ted Bundy said just hours before he was executed in 1989 for his heinous, sex crimes against women and children, "...I take full responsibility for what I've done...My experience with pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality you become addicted to it...the barriers to really doing something were being tested constantly, and assailed through the kind of fantasy life that was fueled by pornography...pornography, which was an indispensable link to the chain of behavior, the chain of events that led to the behavior, to the assaults, to the murders. I have met a lot of men who were motivated to commit violence just like me. Without exception, every one of them was deeply involved in pornography..."I am urging the passage of the Grassley Bill S.892, The Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995 because it will help to protect children from exposure to pornography and suffering its life- changing impact. I am hopeful that members of both parties will check their other differences at the door and join ranks on this issue...for the sake of the children.

Gingrich said: "I think that the Amendment you referred to by Senator Exon in the Senate will have no real meaning and have no real impact and in fact I don't think will survive. It is clearly a violation of free speech and it's a violation of the right of adults to communicate with each other. I don't agree with it and I don't think it is a serious way to discuss a serious issue, which is, how do you maintain the right of free speech for adults while also protecting children in a medium which is available to both? That's also frankly a problem with television and radio, and it's something that we have to wrestle with in a calm and mature way as a society. I think by offering a very badly thought out and not very productive amendment, if anything, that put the debate back a step."

Overview II.  Current Status of Appropriations Process III Outline of Compliance Process IV. Reporting Requirements V. New Privacy Provisions VI. Conclusion M E M O R A N D U M To:		Interested Persons From:	The Center For Democracy And Technology Date:		May  1995 Subject:	Public Accountability, Privacy, and Cost Reimbursement in Digital 	Telephony Implementation I.	 Overview In October of 1994 Congress enacted the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) (PL 103-414), also known as the "Digital Telephony" legislation.  The statute requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that their systems contain sufficient capability and capacity to permit law enforcement to conduct electronic surveillance.   Although law enforcement officials must still obtain a search warrant in order to conduct a wiretap, the statute granted law enforcement new authority to influence the design of telecommunications networks. This authority must be closely monitored to ensure that law enforcement does not abuse the powers granted to it under the statute. The statute also contains specific new statutory privacy protections for transactional records generated by online electronic communications services, prohibitions on pen register authority to gather location information, and greater protection for cordless telephones. Furthermore, the statute contains provisions which require public accountability and oversight over government design authority, telecommunications carrier liability, standards setting, and cost reimbursement. The expanded law enforcement authority granted by this statute requires diligent use of the provisions designed to protect privacy and ensure public accountability.   The Center for Democracy and Technology both on its own and with the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (a coalition of public interest organizations, representatives from the telecommunications, computer, online services, and software industries and associations, coordinated by CDT) will vigorously monitor the implementation of the Digital Telephony statute. CDT stands ready to intervene before the Federal Communications Commission, the telecommunications industry standards bodies charged with setting technical standards for implementing the requirements, and at other points as necessary to ensure that privacy is protected and public accountability is enforced. This document will describe the provisions of the statute that specify obligations on government and telecommunications carriers. Among the these points, perhaps the most critical is that the statute is specifically not self implementing.  No tax-payer funds can be spent under the statute until the government completes specific procedures (detailed below), each of which provides an opportunity for public oversight and intervention.  In addition, the statute contains other important public oversight and accountability provisions. Among these: Requirements for notice and public comment before and after law enforcement requests surveillance capacity from telecommunications carriers, Technical standards for meeting the requirements of the statute must be set by industry standards setting-bodies, not the government, Technical standards developed under the statute can be challenged by the public for any reason in a proceeding before the FCC, Detailed reports by the Attorney General and Comptroller General of the costs and scope of compliance, Finally, the statute requires the government to reimburse telecommunications carriers for capacity upgrades, as well as capability upgrades where compliance is not "reasonably achievable."   The legislation authorized, but did not appropriate, $500 million for this purpose.  If Congress fails to appropriate funds to cover reimbursement, telecommunications carriers will not be required to comply with all the requirements of the statute. These procedures must be closely monitored to ensure that the privacy is protected and that law enforcement does not abuse the powers granted to it under the statute. II.	Current Status of Appropriations Process The specific method of financing CALEA implementation, as well as the total 1996 outlay, have not yet been determined.  However, regardless of Congressional Appropriations decisions or the sum of appropriated funds, no funds can be spent under the legislation until the Attorney General determines which telecommunications carrier's networks require upgrades or changes in order to comply with the statute. In determining how appropriated funds will be spent under the statute, the Attorney General must complete a series of studies and consultations, and provide notice to telecommunications carriers and to the public. These provisions of the statue are outlined below. The statute separates compliance into two categories: capacity (i.e., the ability of a system to accommodate a specified number of intercepts, pen register and trap and trace devices), and capability (i.e., the ability to meet the capability requirements of the statute (sec. 103, see below)).  The process for telecommunications carrier compliance with the capability requirements, and the obligations on law enforcement will be discussed first. A.	Capability Requirements Section 103 of the statute requires telecommunications carriers to meet four functional requirements to enable law enforcement to conduct electronic surveillance.  These requirements are to: expeditiously isolate and enable the government to intercept all wire and electronic communications within a carrier's network; expeditiously isolate and enable the government to access call-identifying information; deliver intercepted communications and call-identifying information to a location specified by the government (but only with the affirmative intervention of the telecommunications carrier). Remote monitoring is explicitly prohibited; to meet these requirements in a way that protects the privacy and security of communications and call-identifying information not authorized to be intercepted. Compliance with Capability Requirements Telecommunications carriers have four years to comply with the capability requirements. However, before a carrier is responsible for making any changes to its network, the government must first determine what specific capabilities it needs, and consult with the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications industry, through standards bodies, must develop technical standards to meet the capability requirements, and these standards can be challenged before the FCC if any person believes they do not adequately protect privacy or fail to meet other requirements. Below is an outline of the capacity compliance process, including a detailed accounting of the obligations on the government and telecommunications carriers. Government Prohibited from Requiring Specific Design of Features or Services: The statute specifically prohibits the government from requiring a telecommunications carrier to adopt specific design features or systems configurations, or to prohibit a carrier from deploying any feature or service that does not meet the requirements (section 103 (d)). Technical standards developed to meet the requirements outlined above must be created by telecommunications trade associations or standards setting bodies, in consultation with the Attorney General (sec 107 (a)(1)). Consultation Required before Standards Setting Process: The consultation process required under section 107 (a) must occur before any standards are developed. The beginning stages of the consultation have begun through the TILU process described above. Telecommunications carriers have 4 years to comply with the capability requirements, and then only subject to reimbursement for modifications which are not "reasonably achievable" under section 109 (a). Public Accountability and Privacy Protecting Provisions With Respect to Standards Setting The statute provides several opportunities for public intervention with respect to standards setting, including a requirement that standards be publicly available and an opportunity for any person to challenge a standard before the FCC. Public Oversight of Standards Setting Process: A telecommunications carrier is in compliance with the statute if it is in compliance with publicly available standards set by trade associations or standards-bodies (section 107 (a)(2)). Because these standards must be publicly available in order for a carrier to be in compliance (section 107 (a)(2)), the public will have the opportunity to examine these standards. Public Intervention before FCC: If the standards are deficient, particularly in terms of privacy protection, network security, cost to ratepayers, or for any other reason, any person can petition the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to hold a rulemaking to establish standards. In setting standards under this provision, the FCC must ensure that the standards: Protect the privacy and security of communications not authorized to be intercepted, and Minimize the cost of such compliance on residential ratepayers. This provision provides a lever of public accountability for the assistance requirements of the statute (sec 103), and, if properly utilized, will help to ensure that technical standards for meeting these requirements to not unnecessarily diminish privacy or increase costs to consumers. Privacy Protections Must be Considered at Design Stage: Technical standards set under the assistance capability requirements (section 103) must "protect the privacy and security of communications not authorized to be intercepted" (sec 103 (a)(4)(A)). This provision requires telecommunications carriers, and telecommunications industry standards bodies, to consider privacy protection at the design stage and enshrine those protections into technical standards. Before this legislation was enacted, telecommunications carriers were not required to consider privacy protection when designing their networks. Because carriers and standards bodies are required to consider privacy protection during the standard setting process, and because standards set through this process can be challenged before the FCC for any reason, these provisions (if properly implemented) will enable the public to: ensure that privacy is not compromised by technical standards developed to meet the requirements of the statute know what law enforcement's surveillance capability is, and have the opportunity to challenge law enforcement's capacity requests before they are implemented by telecommunications carriers. Funding for Capability Requirements The government is required to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all costs associated with meeting the capability requirements for upgrades of equipment deployed before January 1, 1995, and for costs where modifications are not "reasonably achievable" (based on a determination by the FCC), for features and services deployed after January first 1995. Features and services deployed before January 1, 1995 -- Government Reimbursement for all compliance costs: The statute requires the government to reimburse carriers for reasonable costs directly associated with modifications necessary to meet the requirements (section 109 (a)). However, these modifications will not be made, and no funds will be spent, until the government consults with telecommunications carriers to facilitate the development of technical standards as specified under section 107. Features and services deployed after January 1, 1995 -- Government Reimbursement for modifications not 'Reasonably Achievable': The statute requires the government, subject to a request from a telecommunications carrier or other interested person, to reimburse a carrier for the costs of modifications which are not "reasonably achievable" (section 109 (b)). The FCC will determine whether compliance is reasonably achievable based on an analysis of whether compliance would impose a significant difficulty or expense on the carrier or the users of its network, and shall consider: the effect on public safety and national security the effect on rates for basic residential telephone service the need to protect the privacy and security of communications not authorized to be intercepted the need to achieve the capability assistance requirements of section 103 by cost-effective methods and other factors. Interested parties, including privacy and consumer advocates, will have an opportunity to intervene in these proceedings. Furthermore, these proceedings will be public record, providing an important level of public accountability to law enforcement's surveillance requests. This will ensure that law enforcement is not making unreasonable demands for unnecessary capability, or force the public to incur the costs of compliance as a hidden surcharge on their monthly bill. Instead, the entire process, both the requests for capability and the cost of compliance will be available to the public with an opportunity to intervene. B.	Capacity Requirements The statute also requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that their system possesses sufficient capacity to accommodate a specified number of simultaneous intercepts, pen register, and trap and trace devices.  The statute requires the Attorney General to consult with telecommunications carriers, then publish specific capacity requirements in the federal register for notice and comment by the public. The Government is required to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all reasonable costs associated with capacity upgrades. Determination of Capacity Needs: Before making any requests to telecommunications carriers under this provision, the government must determine what its capacity needs will be. This process, headed by the FBI's Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit (TILU), has begun soliciting information from telecommunications carriers as well as state and local law enforcement agencies. The statute requires that this process be completed, and notice provided to telecommunications carriers and to the public, on or before October 25, 1996 (sec 104 (a)(1)). Consultation with State and local law enforcement agencies and telecommunications carriers and general public required: Section 104 of the statute requires the Attorney General to consult with state and local law enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, manufacturers of telecommunications equipment in order to determine where capacity upgrades will be required and what those upgrades will be. After an opportunity for public comment (required in section 104 (a)(1)), the Attorney General must publish in the federal register and provide to telecommunications carriers: Notice of Actual Capacity: The actual number of intercepts, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that will be necessary 4 years from the date of enactment (sec 104 (a)(1)(A)); and Notice of Maximum Capacity: The maximum capacity required to accommodate all intercepts, pen registers and trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies will be authorized to conduct simultaneously after the date 4 years after enactment (sec 104 (a)(1)(B)). Publication of Capacity Requirements: Based on the results of the TILU survey, the Attorney general will then publish capacity notices as described above (and as required under section 104 of the statute). Telecommunications carriers will then have 3 years to comply with capacity notices, subject to government reimbursement (sec 104 (b) and (e)). Public Accountability Provisions There are two separate opportunities for public oversight of the Capacity compliance process. Notice and Comment Required: Section 104 (a)(1) of the statute requires notice and comment before the Attorney general publishes the final capacity notices. Thus, the law request that the results of the TILU survey of telecommunications carrier capacity and the recommendations for capacity upgrades must be made available to the public for comment. If the FBI is believed to be making unreasonable demands for surveillance capacity based on the TILU recommendations the public will know and will have an opportunity to challenge the recommendations. Publication in Federal Register: The notices of capacity needs, as required under section 104 (a), must be published in the Federal Register, providing the public with a second opportunity to ensure that law enforcement is not making unreasonable capacity demands. Funding for Capacity Upgrades                          The entire process outlined above, including the public accountability opportunities, must occur before the government can spend any tax-payer funds to reimburse telecommunications carriers. Government Reimbursement for Capacity Upgrades: Section 104 (e) requires the government to reimburse telecommunications carriers for all reasonable (*as defined in Section 109 (a), described below) costs associated with capacity upgrades required by the statute.   If the government fails to reimburse a carrier, that carrier will not have to modify any feature or service.  This provision is intended to ensure that the government prioritizes capacity  requests and does not demand unnecessary surveillance capability financed by hidden charges to subscribers. V.	Reporting Requirements Finally, section 112 of the statute requires the government to issue several reports on the costs of meeting the capability and capacity requirements of the statute.  These reports will provide the public with a detailed accounting of law enforcement surveillance expenditures, as well as an accounting of law enforcement surveillance capability and capacity, including capability and capacity for which law enforcement did not reimburse telecommunications carriers. Starting on November 30, 1995 and for every year after, the Attorney General will report: Government Costs: a detailed accounting of the amounts paid to each carrier and the equipment, facility, or service for which the amounts were paid; Future Cost: projections of the amounts expected to be paid in the current fiscal year, the carriers to which payment is expected to be made, and the equipment, facilities, or services for which payment is expected to be made. In addition to reports by the Attorney General, the Comptroller General, after consulting with the Attorney General and the telecommunications industry, will issue a report every 2 years describing: Extent of Network Design Changes Made as a Result of CALEA: the type of equipment, facilities, and services that have been brought into compliance under the statute; Cost-Effectiveness of Government Reimbursement: an analysis of the reasonableness and cost-effectiveness of the payments made by the Attorney General to telecommunications carriers for modifications necessary to ensure compliance under the statute. This report will also include a description of the costs to be incurred by  telecommunications carriers to comply with the capability requirements after the effective date, including projections of the cost and a description of the equipment and services for which cots will be incurred. VI.	New Privacy Protections  The statute adds several new statutory privacy protections. In addition to monitoring the implementation of the capability and capacity requirements and cost reimbursement provisions, these new privacy protections must be vigorously enforced. Increased Protection for Online Transactional Information:  Section 207 (a) amended 18 USC 2703 to increase the standard for law enforcement access to transactional data generated by electronic communications services from a mere subpoena to a court order based on "specific and articulable facts" that such records are "relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation" (sec 207 (a)(2)). By enacting this provision, Congress recognized that transactional information generated by electronic communications networks such as the Internet, electronic bulletin boards and commercial online services (such as America Online and Compuserve) reveal a great deal more about the content of a specific communication than do telephone toll records.  Because online transactional records are personally identifiable, this provision raised the standard for law enforcement access to require the affirmative intervention of a Judge, a standard similar to (although not as strong as) that required for law enforcement access to the content of a communication. Limitation on Pen Register Authority to Preclude Location and other Transactional Information: Section 207 (b) amended 18 USC 2516 to limit the design of pen register devices (devices which identifies numbers dialed) to prevent the use of pen registers to track individuals throughout the network or to reveal information beyond numbers dialed.  This section prohibits the authority for pen register devices to be used to obtain tracking or location information, other than that which can be determined from the telephone number.  This provision is particularly important in wireless networks, where transactional data that can be obtained through a pen register device can reveal location information. The section further creates a "technical minimization requirement", requiring law enforcement to use reasonably available technology to minimize the ability of pen register devices to generate any information beyond numbers dialed. Expanded Protection for Cordless Telephones:  Section 202 extends the privacy protections of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) to cover cordless telephones.  Specifically, sec. 202 brings the radio portion of a cordless telephone communication (the transmission between the handset and the base unit) under section 2510 of ECPA. No Prohibition on the Use of Encryption:  Section 103 (b)(3) explicitly affirms the right of subscribers to use encryption, and places no obligation on a telecommunications carrier to have the ability (or to ensure  the government's ability) to decrypt a communication, unless the encryption product is provided by the carrier or the carrier has the information necessary to decrypt it. VII.	Conclusion If properly adhered to, these statutory privacy protections, combined with the public accountability provisions outlined earlier provide the public with a significant degree of oversight over law enforcement surveillance capabilities. However, in order to ensure that the privacy protections are properly implemented and adhered to, the compliance process must be closely monitored and, when necessary, the provisions allowing intervention and public oversight must be utilized.

SUSAN ELLIOT, MOTHER FROM MCLEAN VAI am a parent of three teenage children - a girl, age 17, and boys age 14 and 12. Our brush with CyberPorn was, happily, not devastating or dramatic, but it was disturbing. It was, I think, an experience shared by many families before the public became aware of pornography on the Internet.First, I must say that my children are normal, intelligent, well- adjusted individuals. They get good grades, participate year-round in sports activities, and have never been involved with drugs or alcohol. Their sexual experiences have, I hope, been limited to viewing the swim suit issue of Sports Illustrated and thwarted attempts at making out. In short, they were not predisposed to search for pornography on the Internet, nor are they computer hackers. A respected teacher suggested that they might benefit from information sharing in the Internet. Our household had been inundated by promotional discs from America-On-Line and so we logged on line. At first the boys, along with many classmates, participates in the public chat rooms. I sat with them while the "chatted" and found it harmless, if somewhat silly. However, one cannot sit with teenagers twenty-four hours a day and soon, without my knowledge, the boys ventured into the more exciting realm of the "private" chat rooms, Many of these rooms are private because they are specialized or technical, but some are private because they pertain to human sexuality. Being normal boys, my children were curious about these rooms. While "chatting" they were offered "pictures" by other participants. They accepted a few of these, as did their classmates. With great ease these children were able to E-Mail hard core pornography in full color back and forth to each other. This might have gone on for some time if my husband had not noted that the memory of our computer was rapidly filling up. We opened up the "trash" file and found the graphics in question. They portrayed varying numbers of humans and animals engaged in a horrifying gamut of sexual activities. The pictures were lewd and obscene by any standards. We immediately confronted the children with questions about the pictures and they confessed all. We shared out experience with many of our friends and severed our relations with America On-Line. Many long discussions about sexuality and appropriate expectations and behavior have ensued and our family has benefitted from these talks. That, in a nutshell, was our experience with pornography on the Internet. Was any lasting damage done? My boys would say "Yes." They were asked to pay $38 from their allowances for on-line time. (Color graphics are expensive). I, too, would say "Yes" - not because my children have become victims or sexual predators - but because on of their early sexual images will, forever, be something which is not tender, or beautiful, or even harmlessly titillating; but something which is coarse, vile, and ugly.

July 24, 1995IntroductionMy name is Stephen Balkam and I am the Executive Director of the Recreational Software Advisory Council. Thank you for the opportunity to give testimony to this Committee on what is an increasingly important issue as the span and breadth of the Internet continues to grow. I would like to request, Chairman, that the record be left open so that I and others may supplement my testimony after the hearing . The RSAC is an independent, not for profit organization established in September 1994 with the help of the Software Publishers Association and five other trade associations. The rating of computer software is too important an issue to be left to a trade association, so our independent constitutional status and our Board of Directors (made up of a majority of those from outside the industry) is free from any undue outside or commercial influence.RSACs very existence is a direct result of the legislative initiative taken by Senators Lieberman and Kohl last year that raised the issue of excessive violence in video and computer games. During Senate hearings last year, the case was made for the establishment of an industry sponsored ratings board for recreational software in order to give parents and consumers accurate information regarding the games and educational software they were buying for their children and for themselves. The Computer Games Working Group, a coalition of six trade associations, parents, pediatricians and academics, enlisted the help of Dr. Donald Roberts, Chairman of the Communications Department at Stanford University to develop the RSAC rating system. RSAC and the InternetThere are many ways in which the RSAC rating system could be used to empower parents and consumers with the information they need to make choices about the material they and their children see on their computer screen. The output of the Internet is vast and would far outstrip any one agencys ability to fully review everything on it before it was posted on a home page or downloaded onto a hard drive. Through the RSAC system, however, many hundreds if not thousands of web sites and home pages could be rated and regulated. And, together with the emerging technology, such as what SurfWatch has developed, parents could block all Internet sites that were not already rated. And of those, they could block out any site with a high violence or sexual content or vulgarity content. Content labeling is essential for the new screening technologies being developed for the Internet and television. The software needs code to read to enable it to do more than just simply block out entire sites. RSAC anticipated this eventuality when we devised display standards for the RSAC labels to be used in digital format at the beginning of a piece of software.The screening technology used together with the RSAC rating system would not be censorship by government or by an outside agency. It would simply be a mechanism for choice. If increasing numbers of parents and guardians exercised their choices, then market forces alone would encourage web site providers to rate their material and in some cases, reduce or withdraw what would be seen to be highly sexual or violent in nature.The RSAC content labeling system is most appropriate for static sites such as home pages, documents, games, picture galleries and libraries. It would not be able to deal with interactive chat groups or bulletin boards as the nature of such sites is highly fluid and instantaneous. In this case, however, the new screening software packages, such as SurfWatch, could simply deny access to these chat groups. Unique Rating SystemIn the early days of RSACs creation, the founder members decided not to develop an age-based rating system. The Working Party frankly acknowledged that not all families are the same and instead, looked to devise a system which would give parents the information they needed to choose the software they thought was appropriate for their children. The FDA food labeling system was used as a model, as it provides objective and quantifiable measures of various ingredients within a product without making a judgment as to who should or should not purchase it. The new system would be a content-labeling system which would be as objective as possible, open and accessible to the public, non-judgmental and regularly reviewed and developed. A methodology was created which included an integral algorithm that branches the applicant to a series of questions to determine the levels of violence, nudity/sex and vulgarity. Because of the nature of recreational software, full prior review of every title was not a feasible option. Whereas a movie takes two hours to view, interactive software can take upwards of one or two hundred hours of playing and the viewer may still not have opened all the doors or reached every level. In addition, there are an estimated 2,000 new titles published each year which would make full prior review virtually impossible unless a vast army of reviewers were employed, making the system extremely expensive and unwieldy. It was essential that the rating system include a self-disclosure questionnaire as the basis for reaching the rating levels and descriptors in each category together with tough sanctions for any willful misrepresentation by a software publisher. The three categories of the RSAC rating system are: Violence; Nudity/Sex; and Language. Within these categories are four levels: 0-4. The higher the level, the greater the objectionable content to be found in the software product. In addition, there are brief descriptors that give further information about the title, such as: Blood and gore or Explicit sexual activity. If a title has no objectionable content it receives an All rating, i.e., Suitable for All Audiences. These labels are then placed on the front of the boxes or on the opening screen of the software. Examples of these rating labels can be seen below:Checks and balancesIt was imperative that the RSAC system had a strongly regulated series of controls to ensure that software publishers and other media providers were not able to cheat the system. The RSAC application includes a three page legal contract that is signed by the producer stating that he or she has fully disclosed all the potentially objectionable material within the product. The software publisher also agrees to adhere to the RSAC regulations regarding the display and use of the trademarked icons and logos. Further, the contract lays out stiff penalties for non conformance, including fines of up to $10,000, removal of product from retail outlets and enforced re-rating. In addition, RSAC regularly audits a percentage of all products that have been rated by the RSAC system. These spot checks ensure that a software publisher is fully aware that their products are closely monitored and reviewed.StatisticsSince RSACs incorporation in September of last year, over 200 software titles have been rated with nearly 80 software companies. It is anticipated that some 500 titles will have been rated by the Christmas season. The current cost to rate a product with RSAC is $350 with a sliding scale for smaller companies who may only pay $25 per title depending on their size. Over 500 RSAC Self-Disclosure Questionnaires have been distributed to software publishers, the media, schools and individual consumers. Over one million RSAC educational postcards are being distributed by Wal*Mart and through software companies in their software packaging.RetailersA key part in making the RSAC system effective is the active involvement of major retailers in the scheme. Wal*Mart, the countrys leading retailer has announced that they will no longer accept titles unless they have been rated. Toys R Us has made a similar statement. Sears and Target strongly encourage software publishers to rate their products, though they have not, to date, set a time limit after which they will no longer accept unrated products. Senator Lieberman has taken a strong stance on this issue and together with Senator Kohl, continues to try to persuade more retailers to take the Wal*Mart line.It is our hope that many more of the top retailers in the country will announce their requirement of ratings on recreational software before the Christmas shopping season.Ratings and other mediaConsiderable research has shown that TV violence and images of explicit sex have a profound effect on children. In the recent Telecommunications Bill debate, Senator Kent Conrad successfully amended the Bill with a call to television manufacturers to install Choice Chips inside all television sets and for the networks to develop a ratings system to empower parents to make real choices about the programs that they and their children watch. On the floor of the Senate and in subsequent press conferences, Senator Conrad commended the RSAC system as an excellent example of what could be achieved in a short period of time. Senator Conrad was praised for his steadfast work on a rating system for television by both the President and Vice President at the recent Families and the Media conference in Nashville. At that conference, RSAC offered to work with the Coalition that Senator Conrad has developed over the past two years, to help the television networks to set up a system by July 1996. ConclusionThe Recreational Software Advisory Council is committed to providing parents and consumers accurate information about the recreational software and other media they purchase for themselves and their children. RSAC is opposed to censorship and respects the right of free speech and expression.While we have a number of reservations about the Act as drafted, we would like to invite any organization interested in the RSAC system to work together with us to find a practical solution to the necessary protection of children from objectionable material on the Internet and in other media.Testimony Summary Sheet1) RSAC is an independent, non for profit organization which provides, promotes and administers a content labeling system for recreational software and other media.2) The RSAC system could be adapted to rate Internet home pages, individual documents, on-line games, pictures and video. A content labeling system is essential for the new screening technologies to work effectively. SurfWatch, which has already developed software to block certain parts of the Internet, will be able to read the RSAC rating labels and provide parents with a way to block objectionable material being seen by their children.3) The ratings for Violence, Nudity/Sex and Language are determined by the Self-Disclosure Questionnaire developed by Dr. Donald Roberts, Chairman of the Communications Department of Stanford University. 4) Each rating category has four levels, 0 - 4, which indicate the level of objectionable material in the product. In addition, detailed descriptors give the parent or consumer further information about the software, e.g., Blood and gore; Explicit sexual activity. 5) RSAC has rated over 200 titles with 80 companies including LucasArts, Broderbund, Interplay and id Software, maker of Doom. The cost ranges from $25 to $350 per title depending on the gross revenue of the company.6) A series of checks and balances are used to ensure full compliance with the RSAC requirements including spot checks, stiff penalties for non- disclosure and enforced re-rating of products. 7) Senator Kent Conrad commended the RSAC system to the Senate last month in his successful amendment to the Telecommunications Bill. It calls upon the TV networks to develop a similar rating system for television linked to Choice Chips .8) RSAC is committed to providing parents with accurate information about the software and other media they and their children view. We are opposed to censorship and we respect the right of free speech and expression. RSAC invites any interested party to develop a practical solution to the problem of protecting children from pornography on the Internet.

Johnson writes thatwhile "it is essential for your committee to consider obscenity,harassment, and First Amendment concerns as well as over-all enforceabilitymatters ... it is my hope that you will hold hearings which permit allpoints of view to be heard before taking any action on this issue." The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance is currentlydrafting legislation to overhaul the Nation's telecommunications laws.  Amodified version of the Exon/Gorton "Communications Decency Act" (S. 314)was incorporated into similar legislation approved last month by the SenateCommerce Committee. HR 1004 is the House counterpart to the Exon/Gorton Communications DecencyAct, which would criminalize the transmission of any content deemed"obscene, indecent, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or harassing."   Unlike theSenate version, HR 1004 has not been modified since its introduction. The Letter April 3, 1995The Honorable Jack FieldsChairman Subcommittee on Telecommunications  and FinanceHouse Committee on Commerce2125 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, DC 20515Dear Jack:I am writing to you today relative to legislation which I have sponsored,HR 1004, a house counterpart to Senator Exon's S. 314, the CommunicationsDecency Act.  S. 314 was recently incorporated by voice vote into theSenate Commerce Committee's telecommunications reform legislation.  Theamendment attempts to update the Communications Act of 1934 by providingusers of digital communications the same protections telephone userscurrently have against obscene, indecent, or harassing telephone calls.I want to advise you that I have sponsored HR 1004 simply as a beginningpoint for hearings and discussion and not necessarily to propose that thisbill, or any bill for that matter, is necessarily the proper response toconcerns over obscenity. While it appears that the Exon provision asamended goes a long way to address the liability questions by exemptingcompanies or entities which merely provide transmission services for theInternet, I remain concerned that this issue needs a thorough examinationthrough the hearing process.It is essential for your committee to consider obscenity, harassment, andFirst Amendment concerns as well as over-all enforceability matters.  Forthat reason, it is my hope that you will hold hearings which will permitall points of view to be heard before taking any action on this issue.Hopefully, you and your committee will have an opportunity to consider thisimportant issue in a carefully deliberative fashion which will balanceconcerns for children and others from unwanted obscene material on theInternet with free and enhanced use of the Internet. It may very well bethat this balance is best achieved by voluntary means rather than by newlegislation, but I will be appreciative of your willingness to carefullyinvestigate this complex issue.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely, {sig}Tim Johnsoncc:     Ed Markey        Ranking Minority Member        Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance Return to the Communications Decency Act Page Return to the CDT Home PageWT02-B07-97IA095-001027-B019-70http://www.cdt.org:80/policy/digtel/leahy_freeh_ltr.html 205.177.10.31 19970215014505 text/html 2125HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 01:43:50 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Sen. Leahy Letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh November 3, 1995 The Honorable Louis J. Freeh Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover Building 9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, D.C.  20035 Dear Director Freeh: Congress took the important step in the last Congress of passing the "Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act" (CALEA) to ensure that in cases of significant criminal activity, ranging from terrorism to kidnapping, law enforcement would continue to be able to execute court-authorized electronic surveillance.  Our Nation's law enforcement agencies are loosing their capability to use that important tool in the face of new and advanced telecommunications technologies. Just as significantly, this new law also brings decisions affecting the privacy of our Nation's telephone system under statutory guidance and into the sunshine.  CALEA requires that law enforcement's demands regarding the number of wiretap orders that telephone companies must be able to service simultaneously, are published in the Federal Register and scrutinized in a public procedure. The process set up in CALEA is working.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation recently published in the Federal Register a proposed notice of law enforcement's capacity demands predicated upon an historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity and an analysis of that activity.  The Federal Register notice did not include publication of those two documents. Please provide me with copies of those two documents, which I also urge you to release to the public and publish in the Federal Register to ensure the fullest dissemination of the information. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Sincerely, [signature]PATRICK J.

The Center is pleased to have opportunity to address the subcommittee on one of the critical civil liberties issues of our day: the question of the most effective and constitutional means of protecting children from inappropriate material on the Internet.  We are pleased, therefore, the have the opportunity to offer our views on the proposed "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995." (S. 892)  The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) is an independent, non-profit public interest policy organization in Washington, DC.  The Center's mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building.        The Center is also the coordinator of the Interactive Working Group (IWG), an ad hoc working group of over 85 organizations from the computer and communications industries, and the public interest community.  Since January 1995, the IWG has been working to address the question of how to protect children from inappropriate material online in a manner which is consistent with Constitutional values and continued innovation in interactive media.I.  Broad reach and sweeping impact of the "Protection of Children from    Computer Pornography Act of 1995."The "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of 1995" (S.892) has been presented as a narrowly drawn statute, designed to target the "bad actors."  Unfortunately, based on CDT's analysis, the proposed statute is in fact strickingly broad.  In some senses, it is even more sweeping than the Communications Decency Act. A.  The Grassley bill creates broad criminal liability for online    services providers, video dialtone network operators, full service    network providers, schools, libraries, private businesses, and many    content providers        Notwithstanding the intent of the drafters, the Grassley bill sweeps a number of commercial and noncommercial entities into its ambit.  Covered entities include:*  commercial online service providers,*  schools,*  libraries,*  universities which offer access to the Internet,*  other public information resources, *  small and large businesses which provide their employees with access   to the Internet.  In addition, since the bill covers all "electronic communications service" providers (see �2(b)(1(B)), S. 892 also threatens criminal liability for:*  video dialtone networks operated by local telephone companies, and*  full service networks operated by cable television companies.Included as well would be any commercial or noncommercial provider of content which operates its own computer to distribute that content.  As a result, all of the individuals and institutions which publish through the World Wide Web and operate their own computers attached to the Internet would face liability under this bill.  To the extent that a content provider -- whether an individual or a large publishing company -- operates a computer which makes information available to others, that publisher would be subject to the provisions of S. 892.B.  Broad scienter requirements in S. 892 would force the segration of    the Internet into a children's network and a separate adult network       The scienter requirements in the proposed statute appear to have been designed in order to limit the scope of the statute.  However, as drafted, the statute is subject to broad, sweeping interpretation when applied by criminal courts.  These overly broad scienter requirements would force all who provide access to the Internet or other online services to create, in effect, separate networks for children and for adults.  Such a stark separation would likely be the only way to for online service providers and system operators to avoid liability under S. 892.The new proposed �(b)(2) of 18 U.S.C. �1464 would criminalize the "knowing" transmission of indecent material to minors by any electronic communication service provider.  According to one interpretation, the application of this knowledge requirement could apply to any provider who knows that a specific individual is a minor, and then transmits indecent material to that individual.  Or, another interpretation could hold that service providers know that minors are on their service and that there is indecent material on the Internet.  Thus, service providers -- including schools, libraries and private businesses -- would be criminally liable for merely providing minors with access to the Internet.  Nothing in the statute or relevant case law suggests that courts applying this law would be compelled to adopt the former, more narrow, interpretation.  Rather, it is perfectly plausible to read the proposed �(b)(2) as a punishment for any service provider or system operator who makes indecent material publicly available to an audience that may include minors.  The threat of a broad interpretation of this new statute would compel all who provide access to the Internet to restrict all public discussion areas and public information sources from subscribers, unless they prove that they are over the age of eighteen.  Under this statute, a service provider could not even provide Internet access to a minor with the approval of the child's parent.  Since every online service provider would have to similarly restrict access to minors, this proposed statute would create two separate Internets, one for children and one for adults.  Access by a child to the adult network would create criminal liability for the service provider.II.  The vagueness of the "Protection of Children from Computer        Pornography Act of 1995" will create a chilling effect on all forms     of speech on the Internet and great confusion among schools,      libraries, businesses, and online service providers who offer      access to the Internet.A.   Application of "willful" standard is unclear in the bill as drafted      and will lead to confusion among service providers and users        The 'willful' standard also creates the possibility for significant confusion, given the widely divergent readings of the 'willful' requirement.  In some instances, 'willful' is read as a so-called "tax standard," implying that to be convicted one must manifest a voluntary and intentional act which is violation of a known legal duty.  Cheek v. United States, 111 S.Ct 604 (1991).  However, courts have also found that willfulness means nothing more than a person acted knowingly and deliberately.  United States v. Peltz, 433 F.2d 48, 54-055 (2d Cir.1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 955 (1971).  The drafters of the Model Penal Code define willful as merely knowing action,  and do not require specific intent to violate a known legal duty.   Recent Supreme Court jurisprudence in the area of money laundering, on the other hand, has required that the defendant's actions demonstrate knowledge that his or her conduct is, in fact, a violation of the law.  United States v. Ratzlaf, 114 S.Ct 655 (1994).  A broad reading of "willful," requiring primarily purposive action leading to a minor's access to indecency, but not knowledge of the fact that such actions constituted violations of the law, would subject many service providers to liability under � 1464.  A more narrow reading of this requirement, could diminish the overreaching impact of the statute, however, such an interpretation is by no means guaranteed.  While Ratzlaf may offer some support in this regard, the Court also noted that " 'Willful,' ... is a 'word of many meanings,' and 'its construction' [is] often ... influenced by its content.' " Id. at 659 (citations omitted).  The context was supplied, in part, by the statute in question, which had previously construed "willful" as knowing violation of a known legal duty. Id.  No such context is available in 18 U.S.C. � 1464 to aid a court in intepretation.          Confusion as to providers legal duty will create a tremendous chilling effect on all online communications.  In order to minimize their risk, service providers will be forced to adopt rules governing their users behavior that are likely to be highly restrictive.B.  Heavy-handed content regulation will squander the democratic    potential of interactive media        As the popularity and accessibility of the Internet and commercial online services grows, and as the medium becomes easier to use, the political uses of the net have flourished.  Political discourse is facilitated by a variety of different communications techniques possible online, including newsgroups, mailing list discussion groups, chat sessions, and a host of electronic publishing capabilities.  Any regulation creating criminal penalties for communication of indecent material would have a substantial chilling effect on all who use interactive media.  Such a chilling effect would severely inhibit the growth of the Internet as a political forum.          Political groups left,  right,  and center are using the Internet to communicate, to organize, and to advocate their own views.  Advocacy organizations have found World Wide Web services are critical to political education activities, and an increasing number of grass roots and community groups are coming to rely on the Internet to keep in touch with members and constituents.  In fact, even some Senators offices are using the World Wide Web to communicate with and solicit feedback from constituents.   As a nation we should be encouraging political discourse in this new medium, because of its potential to raise the level of political discussion beyond the sound bite and to involve more citizens in the political process.  One aspect of encouraging political discourse in interactive media is to assure all users that their First Amendment and privacy rights will be respected fully.        Indeed, the Internet and other online services are fast becoming a new public forum for political discourse for American citizens.  In order to preserve the freedom and openness of this new political arena, it is critical to avoid creating a chilling effect on individual expression.III.  The "Protection of Children from Computer Pornography Act of       1995" is unconstitutional under the First Amendment for failure to       adopt the least restrictive means       The proposed statute extends indecency restrictions enacted to apply to the broadcast radio and television media to new interactive communications media such as the Internet, commercial online services, and electronic bulletin board systems.  Though indecency restrictions have been applied to broadcasting for some time, reflexive extension of the same restrictions to new interactive communications media is simply unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court has long held that "each medium of expression presents special First Amendment problems."  In light of the substantial control that users and parents have over content that enters their homes via interactive media, government restrictions on indecency as proposed by the Grassley bill are unconstitutional.A.   Censorship of indecent, but not obscene, communications for the      purpose of protecting minors must employ the least restrictive      means available to accomplish their goal        Indecent communications are protected by the First Amendment, unlike obscenity which is altogether unprotected.  Sable Communications of California v. FCC, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 (1989). Indecent communications, which do not rise to the level of obscenity,  can only be limited in order to serve a compelling state purpose and must be done using the least restrictive means possible.  Id. at 125.  The Sable court found that the protection of minors from access to indecent material is a compelling state purpose, but that "it is not enough that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends." Id.           As a threshold matter, the Sable court found that the constitutional basis for upholding indecency regulations in broadcast media articulated in Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 438 US 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed. 2d 1073 (1978), were inapplicable in any other media besides over-the-air broadcasting.   492 U.S. at 127.  Pacifica accepted that the FCC had authority to enforce content regulation based on the dual finding that 1) radio was a "uniquely pervasive medium"  that intruded (dirty words and all) into peoples homes, and 2) the only way to protect children from exposure to objectionable content was to keep it off the air altogether.   Sable rejects this finding of "pervasiveness" as "emphatically narrow" and irrelevant to other media such as telephone audiotext services. 492 U.S. at 127        Thus, the Sable "least restrictive means" standard became the test by which all regulations on access to constitutionally protected indecent material were judged.  Nearly ten years of litigation along with adjustment of the statute and regulation were required before the current statute was found constitutional under this standard.  See Dial Information Services v. Thornburg, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir., 1991)(finding FCC regulations implementing � 223(b) constitutional).  During the course of the dispute over the application of � 223 to audiotext services, courts considered and rejected a number of means by which carriers were required to shield minors from access to indecent information.  First, time channeling rules, requiring that services only be accessible during hours when children were asleep, were found to violate the First Amendment because they had the effect of denying access to adults as well as children.  Carlin Communications v. FCC, 749 F.2d 113, 121 (2d Cir. 1984) (Carlin I).  Next, the courts rejected a requirement that carriers provide access to indecent services only once customers entered access codes or passwords, which were to be issued after verification that the customer was over 18.  Carlin Communications v. FCC, 787 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 1986)(Carlin II).        The finding of the Dial court, approving the constitutionality of � 223 and associated regulations depended on the legislative determination that the telephone company blocking of service pending age verification or use of a credit card are the only means to enable parents to restrict their children from access to indecent audiotext services.   B.  Background on dial-a-porn rules: lack of user control leads to     indecency restrictions        As was the case for broadcast indecency restrictions considered in Pacifica, the dial-a-porn restrictions were only found constitutional because of the uniquely intrusive and uncontrollable nature of the audiotext services.  A key legislative motivation for imposing these rules during the 1980s was that indecent information available through audiotext services in the telephone system were openly available to children in such a way that it was difficult for parents to control access by their children.  The views of Congressman Bliley recounts the prevailing view of the need for the legislation: "It constitutes an attractive nuisance in every home in America where children are present. There is no completely effective way to prevent children from being exposed to "indecent" or "obscene" dial-a-porn so long as it is lawfully and commercially marketed. . . ."  Bliley continues:"Telephones are precisely like radio and television because of their easy accessibility to children and the virtual impossibility for parents to monitor their use . . . . [D]ial-a-porn is presently in the home whether the homeowner wants it or not.  Today one cannot have telephone service in the privacy of one's family environment without being required to [have] dial-a-porn with it. Families with children must give up telephone service to be "left alone" from exposure of their children to this intruder."         The current statute and Federal Communications Commission regulations promulgated thereunder were found constitutional only after nearly ten years of litigation and efforts by Congress and the Commission to bring the statute within constitutionally acceptable bounds. Indecency restrictions applied to interactive media would require a wholesale review of the constitutionality as applied to new media such as online services and the Internet.  Interactive media operates in such a different manner that the constitutional issues must be considered afresh given the new factual backdrop.C.  Reliance on government censorship to restrict access to indecency     fails to take into account the fact that interactive media offers     parents a much greater degree of control then broadcast services or     900 number services.        Indecency restrictions in interactive media would presumably be motivated by the same goal of protecting minors as the existing statute.   However, the means adopted for achieving the goal are impermissible under the First Amendment because they are not the least restrictive means of accomplishing the legitimate government purpose.  Interactive media is materially different than analog telephone and audiotext technology in that it offers users the ability to exercise control over precisely what information one accesses.  Given the dramatic difference between telephone technology and interactive services such as the Internet and other interactive media, we believe that blocking by the carrier as demanded by � 223 would not meet the "least restrictive means" test.  Just as the Sable court found broadcast indecency regulations inapplicable to the telephone system because of differences in the medium, regulations designed for audiotext services in the telephone system are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media.  Indeed, indecency restrictions on material transport by US Mail have also been struck down by the Supreme Court precisely because "the receipt of mail is far less intrusive and uncontrollable"  than broadcast information that was the subject of the Pacifica case.        Technologies already exist that enable users to access certain information based on a variety of characteristics, or, to exclude certain types of information from access.   With such filtering technology, users, instead of the government or network operators, can exercise control over the information content that they receive in an interactive network environment.  User control could be exercised in two ways.  First, one could screen out all messages or programs based on information in the header.  If a parent wanted to prevent a child from seeing a particular movie or from participating in a particular online discussion group, then the computer or other information appliance used by the child could be set by the parent to screen out the objectionable content.  Such features can often be protected with passwords which would be assigned, for example, by the responsible adults in the house.  Second, the same systems can be used to enable blocking of content based on third-party rating systems.          Given the flexibility of interactive technology, we need not rely on just one rating system.  In fact, a single rating system or a single set of filters would merely replace a single government censor with a single private censor, with no real gain for the free flow of information.  Properly implemented, interactive media can accommodate multiple filtering systems, giving users and parents the opportunity to select and block information based on a true diversity of criteria.  The national Parent Teachers Association or different religious organizations could set up rating systems which would be available on the network to those who desired them.  Rather than relying on the judgment of the government, or of the service provider, viewers can limit access to content based on the judgment of a group whose values they share.        Interactive media can enable individuals and parents to prevent themselves or their children from using their PCs or TVs to access certain kinds of content.  With such control mechanisms within the practical reach of parents, the governmental purpose generally cited for indecency regulations -- the protection of children -- could be accomplished without government content restrictions.  In particular, the reasoning of Pacifica (intrusion of the indecent message into homes) and Sable (inability of parents to exercise control) would no longer justify most content regulation.          To date, Congress has made no finding that a law such as that proposed by Senator Grassley is the "least restrictive means" to protect children from indecent material.  Indeed, we believe that parental empowerment technology and public education would be far more effective and far less restrictive of adult's right to receive indecent material.  The very fact that the Grassley bill proposes that the Justice Department study blocking and filtering technology  suggests that the issue should be investigated further before Congress can be said to have concluded that it has found the "least restrictive means" to protect children.IV.  Criminalizing behavior of service providers is not an effective      means of protecting children from indecent materialA.  Regulating decentralized interactive media following the pattern of    old-style, centralized communications media such as broadcasting is    impractical        The Internet and other interactive communications media are fundamentally decentralized media.  Unlike centralized broadcast radio and television services, there are no central control points through which either a single network operator or government censors can control particular content.  On the Internet there are literally millions of speakers and publishers.  This proliferation of individual speakers stands in sharp contrast to broadcast television or even cable television, where one may count five, ten, or perhaps one hundred speakers, each of whom controls a channel.  Federal broadcast content regulators can direct their regulations at the operators of a particular channel in order to enforce their regulations.  However, content control on the Internet would have to be targeted at each and every one of the millions of US and international citizens that speak daily online.  Any attempt to impose centralized content control in a bureaucratic manner on this fundamentally decentralized medium is bound to stifle the growth of the medium, squander the democratic potential of the Internet, and may even cut the United States off from the growing global information infrastructure.        As a decentralized medium, the Internet and other interactive services have flourished in a largely unregulated environment.  Indeed, recent Congressional decisions to commercialize the Internet have lead to a tremendous increase in the number of users who have access to the Internet and great innovations such as the World Wide Web.  Indeed, the innovative, entrepreneurial Internet marketplace has even produced a variety of software and services that help protect children from inappropriate material online.  Imposition of content regulations would seriously retard the growth of the Internet marketplace.  What's more, content control is unlikely to be effective in protecting children.B.  The global nature of the Internet makes control by the user or    parent the only effective means of restricting access to indecent     material         While the vast majority of content on the Internet is intended for legitimate educational, cultural, political, or entertainment value, some material on the Internet may not be appropriate for children. Moreover, much of this material is accessible from the United States but transmitted from other countries, beyond the practical reach of U.S. law.  In order to protect children we must rely on powerful blocking and filtering technology to empower parents to make choices about the material which their children can access.        Entrepreneurial effort has already produced blocking and filtering products for families and schools.  The vast majority of the content on the Internet is labeled or identified in some manner.  If information is not labeled, intended users cannot find it.  Therefore, the inherent power of computer software allows the creation of computer programs which enable parents to block material from the reach of their children automatically, without the need for constant parental supervision.  Affordable software such as SurfWatch and NetNanny already enable parents to allow their children to "surf the net" freely, but keep them away from objectionable material.  The Netscape Proxy Server, WEBTrack, and the Apple Communications Server can be installed in schools or other institutions to open their institutions to the Internet without allowing their students to have access to objectionable sites.        The global and decentralized nature of interactive media requires new approaches to child protection.  Censorship of centralized media such as radio and television may be effective at keeping the "seven dirty words" off the airwaves.  However, on the Internet, with hundreds of thousands of content creators all over the world, US law, no matter how tough, will never be able to keep offensive material out of the reach of kids.        Industry-wide initiatives are developing standard label and blocking conventions to increase the effectiveness of blocking.  Microsoft, Netscape and Progressive Networks have announced efforts to develop blocking and label conventions.  The Internet technical standards developers are now considering a proposal called "KidCode", which would establish voluntary labeling systems that identify Internet information which is inappropriate for children.  The flexibility of interactive media allows multiple rating systems to co-exist so that individuals and families can chose a rating system that best reflects their own values.        Parental choice assures full respect for the free speech rights in interactive media.  Relying on parents, not the government, to make choices about the content that they and their families receive assures maximum respect for First Amendment rights of adults to receive and transmit constitutionally-protected material, and allows families, not federal bureaucrats, to determine what information is most consistent with their own moral values.V.      Conclusion        Again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear and offer the views of the Center for Democracy and Technology on this very important issue.  We look forward to working with you toward a resolution of this issue which empowers parents, protects children, and preserves full First Amendment freedoms in new, interactive communciations media.

Dempsey RE:             Capacity Requirements under CALEA Introduction The FBI has issued a notice  of proposed capacity requirements for telecommunications carriers under the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, sometimes referred to as the "digital telephony" law).  The notice is intended to set forth "the combined number of simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions that law enforcement may conduct" four years from now.  At that time, under the law, telecommunications carriers are required to ensure that their systems can accommodate the stated level of electronic  surveillance activity.  The federal government is required to pay for any capacity installed to meet law enforcement requirements.  The FBI proposes to require telephone companies and other telecommunications common carriers to establish maximum surveillance capacities equal to 1.0% of "engineered capacity" in some densely populated urban areas, falling off to 0.5% in other cities and 0.25% in the rest of the country.  Despite CALEA's intent of ensuring maximum industry and public input into a decision that is vitally important for law enforcement, privacy and technology, the FBI's notice of proposed capacity requirements is lacking in key details.  (1) "Engineered capacity" is not clearly defined.  (2) The notice does not include the data on which the projection of law enforcement needs was based.  (3) While the notice sets different capacity requirements for different geographic areas, it does not indicate what those areas are.   (4) Requirements are stated in percentage terms, without a clear indication how those percentages would translate into numbers of intercepts. An administrative decision based on a notice that lacks supporting data may be vulnerable to judicial challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act.   Legal vulnerability aside however, decisions under CALEA that are reflected only in cryptic notices and that are based on information not disclosed to the public are likely to generate more concern and more suspicion about government surveillance practices.  Interested parties have until November 15 to file written comments with the FBI, although that deadline may be extended. What This is NOT About The FBI is not seeking authority to randomly wiretap any percentage of telephones.  CALEA did not change the legal requirement that law enforcement obtain a court order for wiretaps and other forms of electronic surveillance.   One Intercept per 100 Lines or per 100 Lines in Use?  Engineered capacity was defined in the FBI's notice as "the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by that equipment."  On first reading the notice, I and others, including some in industry, assumed that engineered capacity was equal to the number of installed lines served by a particular piece of equipment, such as a switch.  Subsequently, the FBI has indicated informally  that it meant to define engineered capacity as the maximum number of subscribers that can be served "simultaneously" by a piece of equipment.  The FBI has pointed out that most systems can handle only a percentage of installed lines at one time.  The FBI has said that some switches have an engineered capacity equal to 10% of the total number of installed lines.  With that understanding of engineered capacity, the maximum surveillance capacity of 1% is equal to 0.1% of lines installed.           Under the latest interpretation, for example, assuming New York City has 2,000,000 telephone lines (probably a fair estimate considering residential, business, fax, modem, cellular, etc.), and assuming that switches in New York can handle 10% of those lines simultaneously, the notice would require the telephone companies in New York City to ensure that they could service 2000 law enforcement interceptions simultaneously.  It seems, however, that even with the FBI's clarification, the approach taken in the notice may be oversimplified.  A generalized definition of engineered capacity may be impossible.  Part of the difficulty here may be due to the FBI's decision to express its projected needs in terms of a percentage, without use of absolute numbers.     Did Law Enforcement Used to Have 100% Capacity? It is sort of true that in the pre-digital world the FBI had the capacity to monitor 100% of calls.   But the point is that law enforcement never needed to use but a tiny fraction of the capacity it had.  CALEA is based on law enforcement needs.  The existence of nearly 100% capacity in the old environment was due to features inherent in the system, which cost nothing.  As those features are disappearing, Congress has imposed on the carriers an obligation to build in new features based on demonstrated law enforcement needs. The concern now is that law enforcement has not demonstrated what its needs for the future will be. Does Law Enforcement Intend to Increase the Number of Wiretaps? On November 2, both Deputy Attorney General Gorelick and FBI Director Freeh said, "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the extent of wiretapping."  This statement cannot be literally true, of course, since the number of wiretaps has increased yearly in recent years (18% from 1993 to 1994, 43% since 1984) and would be expected to continue to increase, with or without CALEA.  Moreover, the Gorelick and Freeh statements referred, perhaps colloquially, to "wiretaps," when the largest rate of growth in government surveillance has been in the area of call identifying information captured through pen registers and trap and trace devices.  Justice Department agencies alone in-creased their use of such techniques by 45.5% from 1992 to 1993. Indeed, the deployment of advanced communications technologies was expected to accelerate these trends, again regardless of CALEA.  As the FBI said in its authorization and budget submission for fiscal year 1992, long before CALEA was adopted, "In the long term, digital telephone technology will enhance the FBI's ability to collect, share and analyze information.  Many of these enhancements will come without any FBI development effort, driven by consumer demand." The FBI's Notice Lacks Key Information At an important level, the question now is not whether the FBI notice covers one line per 100 or 1 per 100 in use.  The capacity notice is supposed to be based on a calculation of future surveillance "needs."  The question that must be answered now is what level of future intercept capacity is supported by the data on current usage and projections from those data.  In other words, how many communications interceptions, pen registers and trap and trace devices does law enforcement expect will be needed four years from now?   The FBI's notice states that the proposed capacity requirements were based on a "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity," derived from reports from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement agencies, and other government entities.  This data has never been collected before.  It provides a critical basis on which to evaluate the proposed requirements.  Yet the notice does not disclose the baseline data.  Therefore, carriers, privacy organizations and the public have no way of knowing whether the FBI's projections of need are appropriate.  Publication of much of this statistical data of surveillance activity would in no way jeopardize law enforce-ment's future operations, yet it is critical to a reasonable public assessment of the need that the FBI is asserting.  The notice states that capacity requirements will be based on geographic area, and that each geographic area in the country will be assigned to one of three "distinct" categories.  While this may or may not be appropriate from a technological standpoint, the notice fails to adequately inform interested parties of the nature of the proposal by failing to indicate what the geographic areas will be.  We are told that they are called Category I, II and III.  We are also told that "only a few of the most densely populated areas" are grouped in Category I.  But we are not told what locations fall in Category I or II or III. Will Category I include, for example, any areas in the Midwest, so that carriers serving the Midwest might know how they are affected? (They should not find out in private communications.) Does the designation of geographic areas match the technical considerations of switch coverage? How does the designation of geographic areas match the baseline and the projections from it? There is no basis on which these questions can be addressed. Other concerns could be raised, but there is no way to evaluate them, given the lack of data in the notice.  The maximum capacity requirement of 1.0% of engineered capacity for Category I areas seems high, especially as a matter of simultaneous capacity, but it may not be.  All courts nationwide, state and federal, issued about 1500 call content intercept orders in 1994 (Title III's and FISA's).   That number has been increasing  yearly.  In 1993, U.S. Justice Department components alone obtained about 5500 pen register and trap and trace orders covering the facilities of 11,907 persons.  Those numbers, too, have been increasing yearly, and do not include state and local agencies.   Still, without the baseline data, it is hard to understand how the FBI derived a projected need for 2000 simultaneous intercepts in New York City alone, assuming New York is a Category I area with 2,000,000 access lines. It appears that the FBI has lumped together pen register, trap and trace and call content interceptions, setting a single capacity requirement for all three types of surveillance activity, even though they may pose different technical solutions.  Indeed, CALEA treats call identifying information separately from call content and sets different capability requirements for them.  Why were they not treated separately in the capacity notice?  In its projections, did the FBI assume that some percentage of investigative interests now handled by subpoena for stored transactional data would in the future be handled contemporaneously, thus increasing the amount of real-time monitoring? More Information is Needed For the public to evaluate better the FBI proposal, the FBI should release promptly two additional categories of information: The "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity" and the four year projections based on it.        For purposes of improving public trust in the process of setting capacity requirements, it may not be necessary to release this information down to the switch level.  At least, though, the baseline data and projections from it should be made available on a city by city, state by state basis. The names of the geographic areas proposed to be included in Category I and those proposed to be in Category II.  (The remainder of the country, of course, will be Category III.)  By issuing these designations now, the FBI is not bound by them; based upon the comments submitted and other information it collects, the Bureau may revise these designations in it final notice.  But during the comment period, the proposed designations should be available. How could this be accomplished?  The FBI could issue a supplemental notice in the Federal Register containing the foregoing information, simultaneously extending the comment period.  While this results in some short-term delay in the process, it would produce more informed comments, help avoid public challenges to the capacity requirements, and produce a better result. Indeed, it might shorten the time it takes the FBI to respond to the comments and produce the final notice, since the comments would be more focused.  Adequacy of Notice Under Administrative Procedure Act  More research would have to be undertaken, but there appears to be at this point serious grounds for concern that the notice fails to satisfy the Administrative Procedure Act.  While an agency need not publish all the data on which a proposed rule is based, "[v]alid notice must provide sufficient information to adequately disclose an agency's reasons and bases for formulating a proposed rule."  3 Stein, Mitchel, & Mezines, Administrative Law, sec. 15.03[2] (1995). Background on CALEA CALEA (Public Law 103-414) was enacted in 1994 in response to concerns that new and emerging telecommunications services and technologies were interfering with law enforcement's ability to carry out electronic surveillance.  The law requires telecommunications common carriers to design their equipment (and in some cases retrofit existing equipment) to ensure that they can expeditiously isolate and intercept all the communications of a particular target.  The law responds to the growth of digital and fiber optic transmission modes, the increasing computerization of call routing, the widespread use of services such as call-forwarding, and other concerns. The law contemplates a cooperative effort between industry and law enforcement, with public oversight by privacy and consumer advocates and other interested members of the public.         CALEA established a series of procedural mechanisms intended to provide telecommunications carriers, privacy organizations and members of the public opportunities for input into the implementation of the statute's requirements.  The first of these opportunities for public oversight and involvement is the law's requirement that the capacity requirements be established through a process of notice and comment rulemaking. CALEA is Working It is important to recognize that the current controversy is in a way precisely what Congress intended.  Before CALEA, decisions about how to accommodate law enforcement interceptions were made solely in private negotiations between law enforcement and the telecommunications industry.  The FBI and the industry had created a committee to develop solutions to meet law enforcement's stated needs.  All participants in those meetings were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. In adopting CALEA, Congress expressed a judgment that decisions about designing telecommunications systems to accommodate government surveillance should be made with maximum public knowledge and involvement.  Congress, recognizing that it could not resolve the digital issues in one piece of legislation, created a process that required the FBI to make its case at each step in the process and created opportunities in more than one forum -- the Congress, the FCC, the courts -- in which the industry and the public could challenge the FBI to make its case.  That process is just beginning.

No comprehensive protection currently exists at the federal level to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of such information, and existing state laws are incomplete and inadequate.  Under this bill, personally identifiable health information is ensured strong and consistent privacy safeguards  whether the information is in paper or electronic form. TITLE  I - INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS This title requires health information trustees (defined as health care providers, health care plans, and others who create, receive or use health information), to allow individuals access to any health information pertaining to the individual and to give individuals the opportunity to correct such information.  Trustees must provide clear written notice to all individuals of the right to access their personally identifiable health information.  The bill also requires that trustees develop safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable health information they maintain.    TITLE II - RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION 	This title establishes a system in which an individual's personally identifiable health information may not be disclosed without the individual's permission except in limited circumstances (described below). Disclosures Requiring Consent: This title requires that trustees obtain an individual's authorization to disclose personally identifiable health information for purposes of payment or treatment.  In addition, this title allows personally identifiable health information to be disclosed to an individual's next of kin, and the individual's name or general health status to be disclosed for directory information, as long as the individual has not objected to such disclosure.  Exceptions To Consent: Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed, without the individual's consent, in the following situations: Emergency Circumstances: Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed in emergency circumstances when necessary to protect the health or safety of an individual from serious, imminent harm. Oversight: The bill provides for broad disclosure of personally identifiable health information for use in any public entity investigation or enforcement of health care fraud or abuse.  This information, however, may not be used against the individual in any action unrelated to the fraud or abuse. Public Health: Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a public health authority for use in legally authorized disease or injury reports, public health surveillance, or public health investigations or interventions. Health Research: Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a health researcher only if a certified institutional review board (IRB) determines the information is necessary for the research project.  Judicial and Administrative Purposes: Where required by the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure, personally identifiable health information may be disclosed in cases in which an individual has placed his or her health condition at issue in a lawsuit.  Non-Law Enforcement Subpoenas: Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed in response to a subpoena that has been issued in a civil lawsuit.  The bill establishes a set of access requirements that the person requesting the subpoena must follow, and provides an opportunity for the individual who is the subject of the information to challenge the subpoena.  Law Enforcement:Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a law enforcement authority pursuant to a subpoena or warrant where probable cause to believe that such information is relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry has been demonstrated.  The bill provides procedures for an individual who is the subject of the information to challenge the subpoena or warrant. Certified Health Information Services: Personally identifiable health information may be disclosed to a certified health information service for the purposes of removal of personal identifiers from the information and for the subsequent creation of nonidentifiable health information.  TITLES III & IV - REMEDIES AND PREEMPTION Remedies : The bill creates a private right of action for violations of this Act, and provides for civil and criminal penalties.  Preemption: In general, the bill preempts State law.  Exceptions exist in certain limited cases where the state or federal law may provide greater privacy protection.

Bliley, Jr. Chairman House Committee on Commerce United States House of Representatives Washington, DC, 20515 The Honorable Ernest F. Hollings Ranking Democrat Senate Committee on Commerce United States Senate Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable John D. Dingell Ranking Democrat House Committee on Commerce United States House of Representatives Washington, DC, 20515 The Honorable Henry Hyde Chairman House Judiciary Committee United States House of Representatives Washington, DC, 20515 November 9, 1995 Dear Senator Pressler, Senator Hollings, Representative Bliley, and Representative Dignell: For the past year, Congress has struggled with the question of how best to protect children from inappropriate material online. As the telecommunications conferees work to reconcile competing approaches to this issue we urge a consensus policy that empowers families, places liability on creators of illegal content instead of passive service providers, and avoids constitutionally suspect new laws that will only delay enforcement. We write as a broad coalition of representatives from the online service, computer hardware and software, and telecommunications and electronic industries, the advertising industry, newspaper and library associations, and public interest organizations, who believe that the interests of children, free expression, and the continued viability of the Internet and interactive media can best be served by combining a deregulatory approach to encourage the development of parental empowerment technology along with vigorous enforcement of criminal laws that are crafted according to settled constitutional principles. A comprehensive and effective policy approach to this issue should be based on the following principles: Parental Empowerment: Maximum reliance on, and encouragement of, private sector innovation to produce technologies that enable parents, not government regulators, to choose what is best for their own children. No vicarious liability: Due to the tremendous flow of information through both public and private networks, holding service providers, systems, access software providers, or any other third parties liable for the content of illegal messages created by persons not under their authority or control will be ineffective at protecting children as well as a threat to the privacy of users. Groups such as the United States Chamber of Commerce have expressedconcern on this issue, as well. Enforceable, narrowly tailored, and constitutionally sound criminal laws: Any new criminal laws should be focused on bad actors and based on constitutionally sound standards. Existing proposals, which rely on the vague and untested indecency standard, do not fall into such a category. Uniform national policy: Given the national, and even global, nature of online services, uniform national rules governing liability are essential. Permitting state regulation of content in interactive media would force service providers and systems to conform to inconsistent and contradictory regulations and undermine the national interest. Recognizing the power of interactive technology to help solve the problem of protecting children, the House passed the Cox-Wyden-White bill on a 420-4 vote in order to encourage the market to provide parents screening and filtering options to protect minors. Even since the Congress began considering this issue this year, great advances have been made in parental empowerment technologies. Thus, the Interactive Working Group, with the support of its members, would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate these technologies as well as to brief the conferees on additional cooperative efforts now underway in the private sector. Relying on parents, not the government, to make choices about the content that they and their families receive assures maximum respect for First Amendment rights of adults to receive and transmit constitutionally-protected material, and allows families, not bureaucrats, to determine what information is most consistent with their own moral values. Recent FBI child pornography arrests demonstrate that vigorous law enforcement efforts are already working to punish illegal behavior online. We would welcome the opportunity to brief you on ongoing efforts to assist law enforcement in cases where criminal activity has occurred. To the extent new criminal laws are needed, they must be drafted in a constitutionally sound manner, both to avoid enforcement delays and to assure respect for the free speech and privacy rights of Internet users. We believe it is possible to craft a criminal statute that punishes those who provide truly harmful material to children in a manner that both targets the serious offenses about which some conservative family groups are most concerned, and that also will withstand constitutional scrutiny. In particular, rather than relying on the vague and constitutionally suspect "indecency" standard, Congress should instead consider the "harmful to minors" standard within the framework of Title 18 of the United Sates Code. This standard is used in numerous state statutes and has been found constitutional by the United States Supreme Court. We look forward to working with all of you in an effort to identify a solution to this problem that assures maximum protection for children, while relying on the innovative energy of the high technology market to meet evolving needs of parents online.

SHORT TITLE.  The Act may be cited as the "Encrypted      Communications Privacy Act of 1996."          SEC. 2.  PURPOSE.  The Act would ensure that Americans have the      maximum possible choice in encryption methods to protect the security,      confidentiality and privacy of their lawful wire and electronic      communications.  For those Americans who choose an encryption method      in which another person, called a "key holder," is voluntarily      entrusted with the decryption key, the Act would establish privacy      standards for the key holder, and procedures for law enforcement      officers to follow to obtain assistance from the key holder in      decrypting encrypted communications.           SEC. 3.  FINDINGS.  The Act enumerates fifteen congressional findings,      including that a secure, private and trusted national and global      information infrastructure is essential to promote citizens' privacy      and meet the needs of both American citizens and businesses, that      encryption technology widely available worldwide can help meet those      needs, that Americans should be free to use, and American businesses      free to compete and sell, encryption technology, programs and      products, and that there is a need to develop a national encryption      policy to advance the global information infrastructure and preserve      Americans' right to privacy and the Nation's public safety and      national security.          SEC. 4.  FREEDOM TO USE ENCRYPTION.               (a) Lawful Use of Encryption.  The Act legislatively confirms      current practice in the United States that any person in this country      may lawfully use any encryption method, regardless of encryption      algorithm, key length or implementation selected. The Act thereby      prohibits any government-mandated use of any particular encryption      system, such as a key escrow encryption system.             The Act further makes lawful the use of any encryption method by      United States persons in a foreign country. This provision is      consistent with, though broader than, the Department of State's new      personal use exemption published in the Federal Register on February      16, 1996, that permits the export of cryptographic products by U.S.      citizens and permanent residents who have the need to temporarily      export the cryptographic products when leaving the U.S. for brief      periods of time. For example, under this new exemption, U.S. citizens      traveling abroad will be able to take their laptop computers      containing copies of Lotus Notes software, many versions of which      contain an encryption program otherwise not exportable.             (b) General Constructions.  Nothing in the Act is to be construed      to require the use of encryption, a key escrow encryption system, or a      key holder if a person chooses to use a key escrow encryption system.          SEC. 5.  ENCRYPTED WIRE AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS.  This section      of the Act adds a new chapter 122, entitled "Encrypted Wire and      Electronic Communications," to title 18 of the United States Code to      establish privacy standards for key holders and to set forth      procedures that law enforcement officers must follow to obtain      decryption assistance from key holders.             (a)     In General.  New chapter 122 has five sections.              § 2801. Definitions. Generally, the terms used in the new chapter      have the same meanings as in the federal wiretap statute in 18 U.S.C.      § 2510. Definitions are provided for "encryption", "key holder",      "decryption key", and "decryption assistance". A "key holder" may, but      is not required to be, a Federal agency.             This chapter applies only to wire or electronic communications and      communications in electronic storage, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2510,      and not to stored electronic data. For example, encrypted electronic      mail messages, encrypted telephone conversations, encrypted facsimile      transmissions, encrypted computer transmissions and encrypted file      transfers over the Internet would be covered, but not encrypted data      merely stored on computers.               § 2802. Prohibited acts by key holders.               (a)     UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF KEY.-  Key holders will be subject      to both criminal and civil liability for the unauthorized release of      decryption keys or providing unauthorized decryption assistance.              (b)     AUTHORIZED RELEASE OF KEY.-  Key holders are authorized to      release decryption keys or provide decryption assistance with the      consent of the key owner, as may be necessary for the holding or      management of the key, or to investigative or law enforcement officers      upon compliance with the procedures set forth in subsection (c).             (c)     REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OF DECRYPTION KEY TO INVESTIGATIVE      OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.- To obtain access to a decryption key or      decryption assistance from a key holder, an investigative or law      enforcement officer must present to the key holder the same form of      lawful process used to obtain access to the encrypted content. For      example, to obtain the decryption key to, or decryption assistance      for, an encrypted telephone conversation that is the subject of a      court-ordered wiretap under 18 U.S.C. § 2518, a law enforcement agent      must present a court order to the key holder to obtain the decoding      key. Likewise, to obtain the decryption key to, or decryption      assistance for, an encrypted stored wire or electronic communication,      a law enforcement officer must present a court warrant, order,      subpoena or certification, depending upon what process was used to      obtain access to the stored communication.              Key holders may only provide the minimal key release or decryption      assistance needed to access the particular communications specified by      court order or other legal process.  Released keys or other decryption      assistance may only be used in the manner and for the purpose and      duration expressly provided by court order or other legal process.              A key holder who fails to provide the decryption key or decryption      assistance called for in the court order, subpoena or other lawful      process may be penalized under current contempt or obstruction laws.             (d)     RECORDS OR OTHER INFORMATION HELD BY KEY HOLDERS.-  Key      holders are prohibited from disclosing records or other information      (not including decryption keys) pertaining to key owners, except with      the owner's consent or to an investigative or law enforcement officer,      pursuant to a subpoena, court order or other lawful process.              (e)     CRIMINAL PENALTIES.-  Key holders who violate this section      for a tortious, malicious or an illegal purpose, or for direct or      indirect commercial advantage or private commercial gain, will be      subject to a fine and up to 1 year imprisonment for a first offense,      and fine and up to 2 years' imprisonment for a second offense. Other      reckless and intentional violations would subject the key holder to a      fine of up to $5000 and up to 6 months' imprisonment.             (f)     CIVIL DAMAGES.-  Persons aggrieved by key holder violations      may sue for injunctive relief, and actual damages or statutory damages      of $5,000, whichever is greater.                (g)     DEFENSE.-       A complete defense is provided if the      defendant acted in good faith reliance upon a court order, warrant,      grand jury or trial subpoena or statutory authorization.              § 2803. Reporting requirements. The Attorney General is required to      include in her report to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts      under 18 U.S.C. § 2519(2), the number of orders and extensions served      on key holders to obtain access to decryption keys or decryption      assistance.  The Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S.      Courts is required to include this information, and the offenses for      which the orders were obtained, in the report to Congress under 18      U.S.C. § 2519(3).             § 2804. Unlawful use of encryption to obstruct justice.     Persons who willfully use encryption in an effort and for the purpose      of obstructing, impeding, or prevent the communication of information      in furtherance of a federal felony crime to a law enforcement officer,      would be subject to a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment for a first      offense, and up to 10 years' imprisonment for a second or subsequent      offense.             § 2805. Freedom to sell encryption products.               (a)     IN GENERAL.- The Act legislatively confirms that it is      lawful to sell any encryption, regardless of encryption algorithm, key      length or implementation used, domestically in the United States or      its territories.              (b)     CONTROL OF EXPORTS BY SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.-      Notwithstanding any other law, the Act vests the Secretary of Commerce      with control of exports of hardware, software and technology for      information security, including encryption for both communications and      other stored data, except when the hardware, software or technology is      specifically designed or modified for military use.              No export license may be required for encryption software and      hardware with encryption capabilities that is generally available,      including mass market products (i.e., those generally available, sold      "as is", and designed for installation by the purchaser) or encryption      in the public domain and generally accessible. For example, no      licenses would be required for encryption products commercially      available without restriction and sold "as is", such as Netscape's      commercially available World Wide Web Browser, which can not be      exported.  Similarly, no license would be required to export software      and corresponding hardware placed in the public domain and generally      accessible, such as Phil Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy program,      which has been distributed to the public free of charge via the      Internet.             In addition, the Secretary of Commerce must authorize the export of      encryption software to commercial users in any country to which      exports of such software has been approved for use by foreign      financial institutions, except when there is substantial evidence that      the software will be diverted or modified for military or terrorists'      end-use or re-exported without requisite U.S. authorization. Finally,      the Secretary of Commerce must authorize the export of computer      hardware with encryption capabilities if the Secretary determines that      a product with comparable security is commercially available from      foreign suppliers without effective restrictions outside the United      States.             Significantly, the government is authorized to continue controls on      countries that pose terrorism concerns, such as Libya, Syria and Iran,      or other embargoed countries, such as Cuba and North Korea, pursuant      to the Trading With the Enemy Act or the International Emergency      Economic Powers Act.             (b)     Technical Amendment.  The Act adds new chapter 122 and the      new title in the table of chapters in title 18 of the United States      Code.         SEC. 6.  INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.  The Act does not authorize the      conduct of intelligence activities, nor affect the conduct by Federal      government officers or employees in intercepting (1) encrypted or      other official communications of Federal executive branch or Federal      contractors for communications security purposes; (2) radio      communications between or among foreign powers or agents, as defined      by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA); or (3) electronic      communication systems used exclusively by foreign powers or agents, as      defined by FISA.

The proliferation of child pornography trafficking has created an anonymous "Pedophile Superstore." As a result, the de facto decriminalization of child pornography is taking place. The demand for child pornography is also a demand for innocent children to be abused. Child pornography is not protected speech. It is crime evidence. The on-line service "America OnLine" (AOL) has become an integral link in a network of child pornography traffickers. It cannot claim that it is not aware of this. If AOL just put a percentage of the effort it makes to spin-doctor away its culpability for these problems into solving them, inexpensive and effective solutions could be found. AOL has been unresponsive and arrogant when approached in a good-faith effort to solve these problems. This testimony is the result of over six months of research. It documents something the American people need to know: not only are their children unsafe on America Online, their children are unsafe because of it. Testimony Before the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on Child Pornography on the Internet24 July, 1995Barry F. CrimminsMr. Chairman, members of the Committee: Thank you for this opportunity to use my first amendment right to speak out today about some very dangerous criminal activity that is proliferating unabated via computer throughout our nation. My name is Barry Crimmins. I am a writer and a children's rights and safety activist residing in Ohio. I am also an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse. Since this is a public hearing, I hasten to add that my abuse was not perpetrated by a member of my family. Last September, I purchased a new computer with a modem in order to communicate "on-line." I joined the service America OnLine (AOL) because I wanted to be able to quickly access and computerize information that was of interest to me.Among the services available on AOL is something called the "People Connection." People Connection is a three-tiered structure. The first two tiers or areas are accessible to anyone using the service unless the parental control software is utilized to limit a child's access. These tiers are the "public" or AOL-sponsored rooms and the "member" rooms created by the users of the service. A room is a place where someone who has signed-on can meet and interact live with others by exchanging typed messages that appear in a large window or screen that everyone else in the room can read and respond to. These rooms are listed on a scroll and a user may browse the list, select a room to enter, and join a discussion or debate with other members. The third tier consists of private rooms. These are not publicly listed and are often used to rendezvous with other members without providing the rest of AOL's members access to the private electronic gathering. For several months, I did not discover the member rooms until I was informed that there was a regular meeting of Abuse Survivors in this area.Before I could find the Abuse Survivors' room on the member scroll, I came upon numerous atrocious rooms. Many were obviously created by, and for, pedophiles. There were rooms promoting rape, incest, the exchange of child pornography, hate crimes, and every possible, and in some cases impossible, sexual activity. If one could imagine it, it was there. The first time I found the Abuse Survivors' room, it was located between a room called "DadsNDaughtrs" and another entitled "lilboypix." I discovered that people enter these rooms and mainly communicate by "Instant (or private) Message" with other people who are in the room (there is a constantly updated roster of who is in the room available at the push of a button). It is in these private messages that most of the trading of graphic image files or "GIFs" (Computerized transmittable photographs) is negotiated. It is, however, not unusual for people to just send unsolicited GIFs to everyone in the room on the "good faith" that they will have similar files returned to them. The rooms that I have investigated have been almost exclusively child pornography exchanges, but I have followed some of the traders of such material into adult porn rooms where they continued to solicit and exchange child pornography. When AOL closes one of the particularly egregious rooms, they often suggest that the participants re-create the room as a "private room." This, for all intents and purposes, says "you may continue to conduct your illegal activity on our service, just do it in private." My first response was to turn to the "service" and demand that they take immediate action to prohibit such activities. After several weeks of communicating my outrage to them, it became clear that for whatever reason, AOL was not going to do anything to remedy the situation. Since then, I have sought the assistance of various local, state, and federal authorities. As I write this, much of the investigative work I have done is in the hands of said authorities. I hope this will result in the arrests of numerous traffickers in child pornography. I also hope that it establishes that AOL has had a great deal of prior knowledge as to how its service is being misused, and therefore, AOL facilitates and profiteers on these dastardly crimes. It is not hyperbolic to state that AOL is the key link in a network of child pornography traffickers that has grown exponentially over the last several months.Child pornography is easily accessed on AOL. Working both under my own name and undercover (often with a profile that clearly stated I was 12 years old), I have been sent over a thousand pornographic photographs of children via AOL. I have seen every possible type of sexual degradation of children, from toddlers to teens. I have forwarded all of this material to both AOL and the proper authorities. AOL does not suggest that such files be forwarded to anyone but its Terms of Service department (which may, in and of itself, be a crime). If AOL has not sent every single file of child pornography it has received to the authorities, then AOL has committed felonies. Because if this is the case, AOL is a receiver of child pornography. At one point a particularly sick individual sent me (in my guise as a 12-year-old) so much child pornography that it took eight and a half hours to download it. AOL did not even e-mail me back to acknowledge receipt of it. I wrote and asked for a credit to my account for the time it took me to gather this astonishing amount of crime evidence. AOL did not respond to this either. Ten weeks later this criminal was still on-line and actively exchanging child pornography in AOL's member rooms. Much of the controversy surrounding the problems of online pedophiles centers on "parental controls." This issue completely disregards a serious reality: in many cases the parents themselves are the perpetrators of these crimes. AOL constantly has rooms entitled "family fun," "Nudist families," "Incest is best," "Have hot stepdaughter," and so on. In these rooms, child pornography is exchanged, and incest is discussed and celebrated. Many of the photos that are exchanged are purportedly of people's own children. So, the myth that parents should be the sole entity that should protect children on-line, or anywhere else, is once again exploded.This committee also is concerned with children being enabled to access pornography on-line. Children accessing pornography is most serious when it is used by pedophiles to arouse their curiosity. Once they gain the child's attention, he or she is much more vulnerable to exploitation by a pedophile. The worst possibility is that pedophiles will use the childrens' curiosity and vulnerability to gain physical access to them so that they might sexually and/or physically abuse these children. It is extremely probable that a number of missing children have disappeared because of such contacts. In my investigation, many pedophiles, believing that I was a 12-year-old, attempted to woo me in this fashion. But, of even more dire (quantitative) consequence is the easy access adults now have to child pornography. The development and growth of the Internet and on-line service providers has enabled exploiters of children to distribute child pornography to the masses. Computers and modems have created an anonymous "Pedophile Superstore." The law of supply and demand is kicking in. The increased demand for child pornography directly translates into an increased number of sexually abused children. You cannot have child pornography without abused children. People, who may have never acted on such impulses before, are emboldened when they see that there are so many other individuals who have similar interests. What has recently taken place is nothing short of the de facto decriminalization of child pornography. As a result, countless innocents are being abused and having their lives destroyed. This is a full-scale emergency and if the well-being and safety of any group other than children were threatened, we would never hear the end of it. Nor, should we. Unfortunately, for the exact same reason that children are the victims of these crimes, children are not being heard. They are weak, economically powerless, and generally not taken seriously.What is needed right now is funding to create a task force of computer and legal experts to enforce Zero Tolerance for Child Pornography. As early as 1983, use of computer networking for pedophiles was being advocated in the North American Man Boy Love Association Journal. The pedophiles have a huge head start. People need to see their neighbors (who have participated in these criminal acts) taken away, jailed, and stigmatized as "perverts." If this is done in a public, no-nonsense manner, it should seriously reverse the crisis that is destroying countless innocent children.This crackdown must also include serious punitive measures against companies like AOL. The profit must be removed from "looking the other way." If AOL put a fraction of the effort into dealing with this problem that they put into spin doctoring their culpability, things would improve rapidly. Kids cannot hire lobbyists and publicists with the profits derived from their exploitation to influence you. It galls me to think that I have paid AOL more than enough money to pay for the appearance of their attorney here today.In the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's excellent report: "Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis," the gravity of trafficking child pornography is addressed when the author aptly summates, "Any individual, however, who collects or distributes child pornography actually perpetuates the sexual abuse or exploitation of the child portrayed. It is no different than the circulation of sexually explicit pictures taken by a rapist of his victim during the rape. Such collectors of child pornography are, in essence, child molesters." This report is a must- read for all interested in this problem and is an accurate checklist of the types of perpetrators I have encountered on AOL. I have met encounter many child pornography traffickers on AOL who were touting their first amendment right to possess and exchange whatever material they care to. These people are deluding themselves if they think child pornography is protected speech. It is not. It is crime evidence. Response to AOL's Corporate AlibisAOL has consistently claimed that most of th ese problems are occurring in private e-mails. And therefore they are helpless to do anything about it, without violating the rights of all members. The actual transfer of illegal materials takes place via e-mail, but the genesis of these transactions is easily traced to publicly accessible member rooms. Without these rooms, the perpetrators of these crimes would be unable to network with other faceless criminals. AOL maintains that it could never police the problem, but it would be simple and relatively inexpensive to have all member- created rooms cleared by properly trained staffers. Under AOL's present system, only easily fooled software stands between a pedophile and the creation of an egregious room. A slight misspelling and the most brazen of rooms is on-line and in business.AOL frequently claims that there are minimal problems on its service because all members are required to understand and conform to its Terms of Service (TOS). I doubt that these compli-cated rules are read or understood by members. Terms of Service contains strict guidelines for on- line conduct. For example, profanity, harassment, and the exchange of illegal files are all TOS violations. If AOL enforced these rules, their service would be a much safer and genuinely "family friendly" place. But since these rules are not enforced, AOL is an unsafe place for many people.AOL maintains that only a small percentage of its members are involved in illegal activities. This is probably true. However, it would be interesting to determine what percentage of its income is derived from such persons. It takes a lot of time to up and download Graphic Image Files (GIFs). This results in very high AOL bills for the traders of such files. Time and again, AOL has told me that as soon as they close one room, another opens. Exactly. Under the current system there is always somewhere for child pornography traffickers and pedophiles to go. This problem would be easily solved with the use of live staff members to approve or disap-prove of rooms. But this, of course, would mean there would no longer always be another egregious room opening. The expense of hiring a few more staffers would be a pittance to such a going concern (AOL added 500,000 customers between Christmas 1994 and early March of 1995). Additional staffing would be a minimal expense, unless AOL is including in its cost the loss of a "small percentage of customers" who just happen to have inordinately high monthly bills. America Online is a publicly owned business. There are stockholders to whom the management is accountable. If I were one of those stockholders, I would seriously question the vision and judgment of those currently in power. They are conducting business in a very questionable fashion. They have a thriving and dynamic company with unlimited potential to be a valuable asset to the American people. Unfortunately, their current business practices do not indicate that the company's future is necessarily rosy. The customer is not always right at AOL, as a matter of fact, the customer is generally ignored or dismissed with an impenetrable bureaucracy and treated as if they are impertinent and a petty bother in the process. Time constraints preclude me from including much of the printed documentation of my correspondence with AOL in this oral testimony. But I have made copies of some of the more telling exchanges for distribution to the committee and the press. In particular I ask that you review the 17 questions in Attachment C. that I sent to AOL's media relations director Pam McGraw and the woefully inadequate response I received from her (Attachment D.). Also, I have included a list of several dozen of the rooms about which I have complained to AOL. Their very titles provide a brief, yet shocking, illumination of the depravity that is publicly exhibited on a daily basis on AOL's member room scroll. I would also be happy to make this material available to other on-line services, including the new Microsoft Net, as a template of what not to do. In closing, I am here to tell the American people that not only are their children unsafe on AOL, their children are unsafe because of it. AttachmentCorrespondence Between Barry Crimmins and America Online 2-2-95 To: the Tosadvisor,Last week I forwarded child pornography to aol that was sent, unsolicited, to me through your service. After 7 days I received a response that told me that even though I was an offended party I had no right to be informed of the actions (if any) that were taken against the criminal who offended me. This is a completely unsatisfactory response. That aside, the problem I have with private rooms is not that I'm harassed in them. I never frequent these rooms except to follow obvious pedophiles into them. My problem is that aol has a policy of suggesting that offensive member rooms become private rooms when the tos advisor shuts them down. I have seen this happen (and have a record of this) when the suggestion was made in a room full of people exchanging child pornography. As far as I'm concerned, this announcement was a formal facilitation of child pornographers by aol. I have written and asked for a clarification and all you suggest is I hit the ignore button. Well ignoring child pornography does not stop its spread, nor does it relieve aol of its responsibilities when its service is being used as a "safe harbor" for such criminals.It took one week to receive a completely unsatisfactory response from aol about these matters. I have tried to give aol a fair chance to take appropriate action or to even say, "Now that you bring that up, perhaps we need a more specific policy about ....", Instead all I received was a corporate suggestion to "ignore" pedophiles. Well I will not bury my head in the sand about this, nor will I be silent about my dissatisfaction with your service. Please let me know who I should address formal journalistic inquiries to at aol and kindly include a telephone number. Thank you. Very truly yours,Barry F. Crimmins1-29-95 To TOS Staff, I am a journalist as well as a children's rights and safety advocate. I have filed dozens of complaints w/aol about pedophile chat rooms. Lately, to your credit, there has been an improved vigilance by tos staff on these matters. However, I have been sent child pornography without solicitation (when I was just checking out child pic exchange), I forwarded it to aol and never had it acknowledged. Also I cannot complain severely enough about aol's practice of suggesting (when they shut down obvious pedophile rooms) that the occupants continue their endeavor in a private room. This results in the formal sanctioning by aol of "safe harbors" for pedophiles, child pornographers etc.I hope that the piece I'm writing has a happy ending. I hope it is the story of how aol used some of its massive profits to assure itself and the world that the safety and innocence of children are your service's utmost priority. If this is the case please contact me as I think I can be of assistance.	Very truly yours,Barry CrimminsDate: Thu, Feb 2, 1995 3:50 PM ESTFrom: TOSAdvisorSubj: Re: Terms Of ServiceTo: [Barry Crimmins]Dear Member:Thanks for reporting the adult graphics file you received. We'll look into it and take the appropriate action.America Online takes the transfer of this material very seriously, and will cooperate with investigations by local, state or federal law enforcement agencies in order to curb this activity. For confidentiality reasons, we cannot disclose information on actions we've taken against other members, however, the resources available to us include written warnings and account termination. If the situation merits, we may bring charges against the senders. Actions within a private room do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Terms of Service. We strongly suggest that if you are being harassed by someone in a private room, you use the "ignore" button to block their dialogue from your screen.Regards, Terms of Service Staff America Online, Inc.

Dear AOL Officials, There seems to be no improvement with these type of rooms, no matter how many complaints and reassurances. The guide pagers are not getting the job done. I in no way am questioning AOL's intentions but as these two scrolls of chat rooms 4 hours apart indicate, there is a serious problem that has yet to be resolved.

I have been on-line for dozens and dozens of hours researching on-line pedophiles. It is rare for there to be less than ten rooms that are serious problems. If I had to put a figure on it I would say the average number of offending chat rooms per scroll is at least 15. There have been times lately when there are only three or four of these rooms but there has never been 24 straight hours when the problem hasn't risen to previous levels.Although it seems to me that some sincere efforts are being made by AOL, much more needs to be done. I am going to be writing and/or producing a story about this situation. I would prefer that it be the story of how AOL is truly setting standards not only as the best on-line service but the most conscientious. From the thoughtful notes I received from both you and Mr. Hypolite, I know that there are people in authority at AOL who are willing to make that happen.I have many, many documents that verify what is going on in the chat rooms. I have been sent child pornography on six occasions. I also have a considerable amount of correspondence with AOL guides, advisors etc. that illustrate a rather naive approach to dealing with this problem. I would be glad to make portions of this material available to AOL in hopes that it would increase awareness about the problem of pedophiles on-line. I also have a number of suggestions that may be helpful as AOL revamps the procedure for closing these offensive rooms. I would like to speak to you about these matters as soon as possible. I can be reached at**********. I will also try to call you at AOL. Thank you for your time.Very truly yours,Barry F.

Room names such as the one you are referring to are created by members. Room names are scanned on a regular basis, but rooms at one end of the list are frequently recreated by the time the other end of the Rooms list is reached. The TOS staff is currently in the process of revamping the procedure for closing such rooms so that this problem can be better handled. If you have any questions or comments regarding a specific room name, you can contact the Terms of Service staff via Keyword: TOS, or by selecting the Terms of Service option from PC Studio (either the PC Studio icon on chat screens, or Keyword: PC Studio).Thank you for your understanding. :)Guide JAL	Attachment CQuestions from Barry Crimmins to America Online Sent: 95-02-14Dear Pam,I in no way want to ambush anyone I speak to about this story (except of course pedophiles). So here are some of the questions I will be looking to have answered:1- What is AOL's assessment of the problem of on-line pedophiles? 2- In a letter from a Tos guide, I was informed that AOL is "revamping its procedure" for closing offensive rooms. If true, what does this procedure entail?3- Has AOL brought in any consultants who are experts on pedophiles? If so, who?4- Has AOL ever considered segregating "adult chat rooms"? (For example nobody with a profile that says they are a minor is permitted) 5- Would AOL consider creating a different chat area for teens? 6- Does AOL realize that if abuse survivors want to search for a chat room to discuss their lives with other survivors, they are often subjected to scrolling through any number of rooms that celebrate sexual abuse? 7- Just recently AOL stopped suggesting that participants in offensive rooms, closed for TOS violations, consider just moving their gathering in a private room. Why and when was this policy changed? Why was it ever in place?8- Is it possible for AOL to restrict access to certain areas to any account (not screen name but entire accounts) that has been used repeatedly to participate in obvious pedophile chat rooms? 9- Would AOL consider giving a cyber-hub (if that's what you call it) to a consortium of pro-child non-profit organizations? 10- Would AOL consider placing an Email address for the FBI on its service so that people, sent illegal files (child pornography in particular), could instantly transfer them to the federal authorities? 11-How is the AOL on-line staff selected and trained? Are these people all paid employees?12-Why doesn't AOL have the equivalent of broadcasting's "kill switch"? In other words as soon as someone creates a room it would have to get through AOL's "goalie". If it is in obvious violation of TOS it is closed before it opens.13- How does AOL feel about its service being misused to the point where it has become an integral part in a network of child pornographers? 14- In the past AOL has assured users that it could handle the burgeoning problem of on-line pedophiles "in-house". However the incidence of such criminal activity has grown dramatically in the past year. What changes in policy, implementation etc., has AOL adopted to transform current assurances into a workable and consistent program of enforcement of your services own TOS policies? 15- How many AOL staffers are currently assigned to policing member created rooms? How many worker hours per week does this entail? 16- What is AOL's take on the Baker BBS Rape fantasy case in Michigan? 17-Some legislators are already looking into on-line abuses. Does AOL expect the government to get involved in the regulation of on-line services?I am certain that in the course of any interviews I conduct, several extemporaneous questions will also occur. I hope that this advance list will be considered as a show of good-faith on my part. I am also sending Mr. Hypolite a copy of this letter because I feel many of the questions are about matters that are under his jurisdiction. Thank you for your time. Very truly yours,Barry F. CrimminsAttachment DAmerica Online's Response to Questions Posed by Barry F. Crimmins Sent: 95-02-21 09:46:20 ESTDear Barry,Thanks for your letter pertaining to the problem of pedophiles online. I hope the following answers clearly indicate where America Online stands on this issue and what is being done to combat the trafficking of child pornography on the service. Throughout these answers we refer to TOS -- Terms of Service -- which are guidelines for using the AOL service. I trust you are aware of these and you can access TOS by using keyword: TOS.1. AOL has been forthright about the issue both with its members and with law enforcement agencies (see Steve Case letter dated 1/695). Unfortunately, the gravity of such offenses can sometimes leave the mistaken impression that they are much more commonplace than is true. With more than 2 million subscribers - the largest online service in the U.S. - the number of pedophiles using America Online represents a tiny fraction of our member community. |2. America Online is considering a number of tools to make the jobs of TOS and AOL Guides easier. However, at this point in time, it would be premature to discuss the details.3. Child pornography is illegal. When the transmission of child pornography through private communications is brought to AOL's attention, once it is deemed illegal, the proper authorities are notified. 4. America Online expects all members to follow its TOS guidelines. To segregate rooms based on behavior in those rooms would imply that AOL sanctions different rules and regulations for different rooms. AOL has one community and one set of rules for the members of that community. 5. There is an area on AOL for teenagers called "Teen Chat" in the People Connection.6. While we are aware that there are chat rooms that offend the sensibilities of some of our members, unless the rooms violate TOS we cannot remove them from the service. If the rooms, as you suggest, "celebrate sexual abuse," TOS should be notified and the offending rooms will be removed.7. Rooms terminated for TOS violations are removed from the service. TOS may suggest members create private rooms in instances where participants are scrolling or otherwise creating a nuisance and disturbing other members.8. If a member violates TOS, he or she may be warned or, depending on the severity of the infraction, be removed from the service. 9. AOL has conducted a number of conversations with various non-profit organizations, some of them dealing with children's welfare. 10. Members who receive illegal information through the service can forward that information to TOS and, if it is deemed illegal, the proper authorities are notified.11. Members of the TOS staff are internal, paid employees who are trained in TOS rules and procedures. AOL Guides are remote volunteers who use overhead accounts. They are also trained by TOS staff and are screened before becoming Guides.12. Online is a real-time, interactive service. America Online is considering a number of tools to make the jobs of TOS and AOL Guides easier.13. While we acknowledge such activities do take place, with more than 2 million members they are the exception rather than the rule. 14. While the number of such incidents may be going up in your eyes, so is the number of AOL members. We have added more than 500,000 members since December alone.Child pornography is illegal. When the transmission of child pornography through private communications is brought to AOL's attention, once it is deemed illegal, the proper authorities are notified. We've had a growing problem with member-created rooms whose title and discussion violate our Terms of Service. As more and more members abuse the privilege and establish rooms that suggest illegal activity, or detract from the enjoyment of others with offensive titles, we are faced with looking at a higher level of safeguards as it relates to member-created rooms. America Online is considering a number of tools to make the jobs of TOS and AOL Guides easier.15. AOL staffs its service 24 hours a day and staffs according to growth. 16. AOL does not comment on specific cases. 17. Overall, the online services industry is a making concerted effort to police their own services.I hope these answers have been of assistance.

FCC.----------------------------------------------------------------------        Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an en banc decision in the case of  Alliance forCommunity Media v. FCC, (Docket #93-1169).  That decision clearlyestablished that, if enacted, the Communications Decency Act wouldbe held unconstitutional.  The court stated that a ban onindecency would be unconstitutional and that any regulation ofindecent speech must be accomplished in the least restrictivemanner possible, as established by a legislative record.  Whilethe court upheld the FCC's regulations, the decision was narrowlybased on the fact that there was no state action in the statute. However, it is indisputable that the proposed ban in theCommunications Decency Act constitutes state action. We believethat members of  the Senate should reject the CommunicationsDecency Act and refuse to engage in the futile charade of enactinglegislation that would undoubtedly be held unconstitutional. The Facts of the Alliance Case==============================        The Alliance case concerns a challenge to the FCC's implementing regulations of  Section 10 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. That section permitted cable operators to refuse to carry PEG and leased accessprogramming that the operator "reasonably believes describes ordepicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patentlyoffensive manner as measured by contemporary community standardsfor the cable medium." (sections 10(a) and 10(c)).  Theregulations authorized cable operators to refuse to carry"indecent programming on leased access.  Section 10(b) and theimplementing regulations then required a cable operator thatdetermined to carry indecent programming, to segregate on a singlechannel and block the programming and satisfy a subscriber'srequest to received such a blocked channel within thirty days of awritten request.Unlike the Communications Decency Act Sections 10(a) and (c) doNot Constitute State Action===========================         Judge Randolph, writing for the majority, upheld theconstitutionality of Sections 10(a) and 10(c) and theirimplementing regulations based upon the determination that thepermissive language in the statute did not constitute stateaction, and therefore was not subject to any First Amendmentscrutiny.  The Court found that Congress, in giving cableoperators editorial discretion, was merely shifting the editorialcontrol over leased and PEG access programming to cable operatorsfrom cable programmers.  While the Court therefore did not have topass on the constitutionality of an indecency ban, it nonethelesstook the opportunity to state the following quite specifically:While the government may [ ] restrict the showing of indecentprograms, it may do so only in a manner consistent with the FirstAmendment.  See Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC,492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989)[setting forth the least restrictive meanstest and striking down legislation totally banning indecentinterstate commercial telephone messages].  If decisions of cableoperators not to carry indecent programs on leased or PEG accesschannels, decisions section 10(a) and 10 (c) permit, were treatedas decisions of the government, the Commission and the UnitedStates would be hard put to defend the constitutionality of theseprovisions (emphasis added).        This language confirms the long-standing constitutional principlethat a wholesale ban on indecency is unconstitutional.  As thiscourt emphasized, "[o]bscenity has no constitutional protection,"but indecency is constitutionally protected.  Thus theCommunications Decency Act, which seeks to establish a governmentmandated prohibition on indecent communications, would clearly beheld unconstitutional. The Constitutionality of Section 10(b) Upheld Based on Nature ofthe Technology and Least Restrictive Means==========================================        The D.C. Circuit then went on to consider the constitutionalityof the requirements established in subsection 10(b) and itsimplementing regulations.  The question here was not whether thiswas considered government regulation of speech, but whether inregulating non-obscene speech, the FCC's regulations withstood theexacting level of scrutiny required.  The court first compared thedecision in Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) withthe Sable decision and made two important observations: "First, the constitutionality of indecency regulation in a givenmedium turns, in part, on the medium's characteristics.  Second,in fashioning such regulation, the government must strive toaccommodate at least two competing interests: the interest inlimiting children's exposure to indecency and the interest ofadults in having access to such material."        While the court found that under the record established byCongress and the FCC the cable medium had much more in common withthe broadcast medium than the telephone medium, it made no suchdetermination for other media.  In fact, in the context of theon-line computer networks that the Communications Decency Actseeks to reach, no such congressional finding has been made andthere has been no examination of the unique nature of  the mediumat all.  The lack of such a record would make it impossible for acourt to do anything but strike down any regulation on non-obscenecomputer based communications.          In the second observation above, the court emphasized theimportance of the rights of adults to have access to indecentmaterial, and it therefore applied the least restrictive meanstest to the FCC's regulations pursuant to subsection 10(b).  Whilesome might disagree with the court's determination that thesegregation, blocking and waiting period established by the FCCwas the most effective and therefore "least restrictive means" forprotecting children from access to indecency on cable television,it is indisputable that the Communications Decency Act indicatesno attempt to establish a least restrictive system that wouldpreserve the rights of adults to have access to certain material.Exon Bill Fails Least Restrictive Means Test Because Congress hasnot Explored Alternatives=========================        The Communications Decency Act attempts to amend existing rulesrelating only to telephone and audiotext services, while adoptingthe same goal of protecting minors.  However, interactive media ismaterially different than analog telephone and audiotexttechnology in that is offers users the ability to exercise controlover precisely what information one accesses.  Given the dramaticdifference between telephone technology and interactive servicessuch as the Internet and other online services, blocking by thecarrier as demanded by � 223 and the Communications Decency Actwould not meet the "least restrictive means" test.  Just as theSable court found broadcast indecency regulations inapplicable tothe telephone system because of differences in the medium,regulations designed for audiotext services in the telephonesystem are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media.        Technologies already exist that enable users to access certaininformation based on a variety of characteristics, or, to excludecertain types of information from access.  With such filteringtechnology, users, instead of the government or network operators,can exercise control over the information content that theyreceive in an interactive network environment.  User control couldbe exercised in two ways.  First, one could screen out allmessages or programs based on information in the header.  If aparent wanted to prevent a child from seeing a particular movie orfrom participating in a particular online discussion group, thenthe computer or other information appliance used by the childcould be set by the parent to screen out the objectionablecontent.  Such features can often be protected with passwordswhich would be assigned, for example, by the responsible adults inthe house.  Second, the same systems can be used to enableblocking of content based on third-party rating systems.  Forexample, those parents who accept TV Guide's judgment about thepresence of nudity and/or violence in particular programs, couldprogram their interactive TV sets to screen out all programs thatTV Guide has classified as violent.  The Senate has made noattempt to review the existence or sufficiency of these technicalcapabilities or their empowering characteristics for parents.  Conclusion ==========        The Alliance for Community Media decision has already beenreported widely in the press as a defeat for the civil libertiescommunity and a broadening of the government's ability to restrictindecency in the media.  This, unfortunately, is true. However,the decision also clearly establishes the unconstitutionality ofthe Communications Decency Act and makes a good case for the studyproposed by Senator Patrick Leahy -- S. 714 The Child Protection,User Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive Media StudyBill.  That provision would permit a study of the means availableto protect children while maintaining a commitment to the FirstAmendment rights of adults.         The two attached letters include lists of organizations that havetaken a position against the Communications Decency Act and insupport of the Leahy alternative.For more information contact:People For the American Way: (202) 467-4999Jill Lesser -- jlessern@counsel.comLeslie Harris -- laharris@tmn.comCenter for Democracy & Technology: (202) 637-9800Daniel Weitzner -- djw@cdt.orgJerry Berman -- berman@cdt.org====================================================================                                        April 27, 1995Dear Senator:        We write on behalf of a diverse coalition of civil liberties,education, library,  other civic organizations, as well ascommercial producers and distributors of entertainment, information and works of art and journalists to express our strongbelief that the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (the "Act")(currently sections 401 through 408 of S. 652) violates the FirstAmendment rights of all Americans.  In the name of protectingchildren, the Act which was added as an amendment totelecommunications reform legislation, criminalizes the exchangeof First Amendment-protected material between adults and restrictsthe broad range of material available by computer to only thatwhich is deemed appropriate for children.        We agree with the sponsors of  the legislation that there aremany  problems inherent in allowing access by our nation'schildren to material that may be physiologically or emotionallyharmful.  And we recognize that the computer age has brought withit many new questions about the ways in which parents can protecttheir own children.  However, the Communications Decency Act willnot accomplish the goals of  protecting children, will stifle thedevelopment of new technology empowering users, including parentsto define their limits in cyberspace and, instead, will virtuallydestroy the exploding world of on line communications.          Grafted onto a twenty-five year old provision of theCommunications Act of 1934 which was designed for the specificpurpose of preventing children's access to dial-a-porn servicesand protecting people from harassing phone calls, theCommunications Decency Act  fails to accomplish the goals beingadvanced by its sponsors, and it is unconstitutional on its face. The Act makes it a crime to produce or distribute bytelecommunications device any "indecent" communications that maybe accessible by a minor.  It also bans the dissemination of  "anycomment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or othercommunications which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy orindecent."  These crimes are punishable by up to two years in jailand a fine of up to $100,000.        Contrary to the implications of much of the media coverage, theAct is not merely about sex and pornography.  It covers virtuallyall areas of speech.  It is also not just about cyberspace -- itcovers every "telecommunications device" and every organization,large or small, with e-mail.  It would affect much more thanchildren by restricting private e-mail communications betweenconsenting adults. The Communications Decency Act also violatesthe First Amendment rights of adults to see, hear and readmaterial -- as they choose -- that is not legally obscene.  Thereis a broad range of material with sexual content that isinappropriate for minors but important for adults, includingnovels, sex education material, movies, videos and recordings. Adults do not lose their First Amendment rights because theseworks are being transmitted in a new medium.                   We recognize that the rapid spread of computer technology hasmade it more difficult for parents to stop their children fromgaining access to inappropriate material, but computer experts arealready developing tools to help them.  This technology will putthe power to censor in the only place that it belongs -- in thehands of parents. In addition,  legislation already exists in all50 states, as well as on the federal level, to ensure thatmaterial that is harmful to minors does not get into the hands ofminors.  To the extent that any additional legislative tools areneeded to help enforce existing laws in the information age, theymust be the result of careful analysis and public debate.        The fast-paced development of the Internet and the immenseopportunities it holds for economic development, education andcivic participation have captured the nation's imagination.  Thefreedom with which ideas flow on the Internet is unprecedented inhuman history.  The Communications Decency Act attacks thisfreedom.  Like the United States, the Internet cannot survivewithout free speech.        We urge you to oppose the Communications Decency Act and todemand careful  consideration of the important issues it tries toaddress.Sincerely,ACLUAlliance for Community MediaAmerican Arts AllianceAmerican Association of Law LibrariesAmerican Association of University ProfessorsAmerican Booksellers Foundation for Free ExpressionAmerican Library AssociationAmerican Society of Journalists and AuthorsAssociation of American Publishers Inc.Association of Performing Arts PresentersAssociation of Research LibrariesAuthor's GuildCenter for Democracy and TechnologyCompetitive Enterprise InstituteCouncil of American Literary Magazines and PressesDance-USAElectronic Frontier FoundationFeminists for Free ExpressionFreedom to Read FoundationHuman Rights WatchIndex on CensorshipInstitute for Justice Literary NetworkMagazine Publishers of AmericaMedia Access ProjectMedia AllianceNational Alliance of Media Arts and CultureNational Association of Artist OrganizationsNational Campaign for Freedom of ExpressionNational Coalition Against CensorshipNational Federation of Community BroadcastersNational Writer's UnionOMNI MagazineOPERA AmericaPEN American CenterPeople for the American Way Action FundPeriodical and Book Association of America Inc.Recording Industry of AmericaSoftware Publishers AssociationTheater Communications GroupThe Society of Professional Journalists==================================================================Delivered to the U.S. Senate:                                                        May 22, 1995Dear Senator______:We write to urge you to support S. 714, the "Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Bill" (S. 714) introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT).  The legislation would require the Department of Justice and Commerce Departments to conduct a study of how to limit childrens' access to "violent, sexually-explicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted material" consistent with the First Amendment and the free exchange of ideas.As communications and computer firms, content providers, advertisers, trade associations and public interest organizations who have been working on various aspects of this issue, we believe that new interactive media raise many difficult, challenging issues regarding the protection of free speech, privacy, and access to controversial material.  Thus, we stand ready to work with the Administration and the Congress to explore all aspects of this issue as outlined in S. 714.Legislation affecting the Internet and other new media is difficult to craft because of the need to reconcile a panoply of competing interests.  Among the interests that we believe must be satisfied are:1.      Free speech and free press in interactive media  The First Amendment rights of both private individuals and commercial information providers must be fully protected;2.      Child protection technology means should be available to enable parents to control children's access to material which parents find inappropriate;3.      Service provider liability to assure the free flow of information and remove incentives to invade user's privacy, law must not force service providers into the position of being private censors.4.      Privacy Individuals have both a free speech and privacy right to conduct private communications that may be considered offensive to others.S. 714 identifies a number of critical questions that we believe deserve thorough study and  discussion.  First, is current law adequate to enable prosecution of child pornography and distribution of obscenity in online environments?  As has recently come to light, the Justice Department claims that it is vigorously prosecuting child pornographers and those who violate obscenity law.  Is more needed? Second, does law enforcement need more resources to investigate and prosecute under current law?Finally, how can interactive technology itself help to resolve the issue.  As you may know,  there are technological means and user controls to enable parents to block access to objectionable materials, including material that is "violent, sexually-explicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted."   Are such technologies and user controls available widely enough?  Are they easy enough for parents to use?  What steps can be taken to encourage the development of easy-to-use blocking technology.  We believe that interactive technology, in combination with voluntary industry standards, public education, and law, can resolve these access issues. For the above reasons, we urge you and others in the Senate to support S. 714. We believe the study will help both to develop broad understanding of the social, policy and technology challenges of new media as well as help policy makers formulate alternatives which best serve the public interest.  We are anxious to work with you to achieve these goals.Sincerely,American Advertising FederationAmerican Association of Advertising       AgenciesAmerican Library AssociationAmerican Society of Newspaper EditorsAssociation of National Advertisers, Inc.Association of Research Libraries Business Software AllianceCenter for Democracy and TechnologyComputer and Communications Industry    AssociationDirect Marketing AssociationElectronic Frontier FoundationFeminists For Free ExpressionMagazine Publishers of AmericaMedia Access ProjectNational Public Telecomputing NetworkNewspaper Association of AmericaPeople For the American Way Action FundRecreational Software Advisory CounselSoftware Publishers AssociationTimes Mirror      Return to the Communications Decency Act Page Return to the CDT Home PageWT02-B07-109IA095-001027-B025-43http://www.cdt.org:80/policy/freespeech/12_21.cdaanal.html 205.177.10.31 19970215002745 text/html 4243HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 00:26:30 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html CDT's Analysis of the 12/21/95 Conference Committee Draft CDT's Analysis of the latest Communications Decency Act (From CDT Policy Post No. 33, January 4, 1996) The House/Senate telecommunications reform conference committee has released a preliminary draft of the final telecommunications reform bill, which includes provisions which would impose broad government regulations on constitutionally protected speech online. The text of these provisions is attached below. The attached version of the CDA contains the changes approved at the December 6, 1995 conference committee meeting, where members voted to adopt Rep. Rick White's proposal but with significant changes, including a return to the unconstitutional "indecency" standard (See CDT Policy Post No. 32, 12/6/95). The conferees have made several important changes to the legislation, none of them are particularly favorable to cyberspace-rights advocates. Among other things, the latest draft: Relies on the vague and blatantly unconstitutional "indecency" standard (Sec 502 (a) - (c)) Prohibits sending "indecent" material directly to a minor or making indecent material available for display in a manner available to a minor (including world wide web pages, ftp sites, or usenet newsgroups) (Sec 502 (d)). No longer contains the provision of the Cox/Wyden/White bill prohibiting the FCC from imposing content or other regulations on the Internet or other interactive media. Contains weaker protections for content providers who label content and enable others to block it (e.g., PICS) have been weakened (Sec 502 (e)(5). Would allow states to impose additional restrictions on non-commercial activities such as freenets, BBS's, and non-profit content providers (Sec 502 (h)). Creates a new crime for the solicitation of minors using a computer, the US mail, or any other means of interstate or foreign commerce (Sec 508). CDT believes that this proposal threatens the very existence of the Internet as a means for free expression, education, and political discourse. The proposal is an unwarranted, unconstitutional intrusion by the Federal government into the private lives of all Americans.  NEXT STEPS: FINAL AGREEMENT NOT YET REACHED, VOTE COULD OCCUR SOON As you know, the CDA is part of the massive telecommunications reform legislation, which is currently being considered by a House/Senate conference committee. The conference committee has not reached agreement on several key  issues, including whether the FCC should be permitted to regulate the Internet, broadcast ownership rules, and other issues. Reps. Rick White, Chris Cox, and others are currently fighting to retain the provisions baring the FCC from regulating online content. A final vote by the conferees to send the bill to the full congress will not occur until an agreement is reached on this and other outstanding issues. As of Thursday January 4, 1996, the conferees have NOT yet voted to send a version of the legislation to the Full House and Senate for a final vote. No vote has been scheduled, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich has stated that no vote will occur until Congress finishes work on the Budget. CDT will continue to fight these provisions, and will work to remove them from the final telecommunications bill. We are also preparing to fight this issue in court, if necessary.

LANDSCAPE The era we have come to characterize as the "Information Age" is evolving into the "Interactive Age." The communications technologies that made possible the collection, storage, transmission, and linkage of enormous amounts of information are now expanding to engage the individual consumer in a variety of activities. More and more people are communicating by electronic mail; sites on the World Wide Web allow people to "browse," download information, and get linked to other sites; electronic malls invite people to window shop, inquire further about particular products and even make purchases; people are subscribing to newsgroups and participating in chatrooms to gather and share information on topics of interest to them. The potential benefits to society from these new digital media are undisputed and well-documented. Freedom of speech and the right to receive information may enjoy a nearly limitless opportunity to flourish. The commercial potential of the Internet is also vast. What is troubling, however, is that this same technology makes it possible to generate, capture, store, and reuse a tremendous amount of personal transactional information and communications from diverse media, over the course of a person's lifetime. The "womb-to-tomb dossier" that Arthur Miller warned of 30 years ago may now be real -- not collected in a mainframe computer, but through a distributed and largely unregulated network. More focused attention is being paid to addressing the privacy issues that threaten to undermine substantially both the First Amendment and the commercial potential of the Interactive Age, yet few concrete solutions have been proposed. While there seems to be general agreement that individual privacy must be preserved, and even enhanced, in cyberspace, we are just beginning to explore the means to make privacy work in this new media. 1 The recent deliberations, by both the government and the private sector, come at a time of increasing public concern with the loss of privacy. A recent survey revealed that 83% of Americans are very concerned about their privacy. This number has increased steadily over the years. A finding of even greater importance in our "Interactive Age," is that the publics' concern with privacy reaches new heights when computerization is mentioned. Disquieting fear and confusion over the lack of privacy rules and standards act as a barrier to the public's willingness to use new media. As information about the current practices of collecting and using personal information trickles out in news stories and in on-line discussion groups public concern will escalate. The recent revelation that a marketer was gathering hundreds of thousands of individuals' email addresses culled from use of the World Wide Web and usenet discussion groups, created a furor over the use of this transaction data.2 A dialogue must occur between privacy and consumer advocates, and the private sector, before privacy policies and practices can be identified. Once identified, privacy policies and practices can guide and influence the development and deployment of new technologies to our collective benefit. A consensus emerged last year among policy makers, businesses, and privacy advocates that personally identifiable transaction data deserves strong legal protection, akin to the protections we afford content.3 However, the consensus centered on limiting law enforcement access to transaction data, and failed to address the significant privacy issues posed by the private sector's use of this identifiable data. Before people will fully and openly take advantage of the new communications technologies and applications, they must have trust and confidence that their expectations of privacy and security are not undermined. As John Markoff concluded in the New York Times last month, "The recent rush to the Internet by companies seeking to exploit its commercial possibilities has obscured the fact that giving the system a new purpose has unearthed fundamental problems that could well put off true commercial viability for years."4 A recent poll conducted for CommerceNet found that even though Internet use is growing, "a wide variety of businesses selling goods on the Internet have been disappointed so far, hindered by security issues and a cautious attitude about commerce on the Internet among consumers. We must seize the opportunity to move beyond the current debate over the intrusive nature of technology to embrace the technology's capacity to empower individuals to exercise meaningful choice over the disclosure and use of personal information. In the traditional information privacy realm, various interests have wrestled with awkward, mechanistic, and largely unsuccessful approaches to allowing people some say over how and whether their personal information should be used by others. We debate the merits of "opt-in" over "opt-out," and how to categorize "sensitive" information. We argue over who "owns" information, and whether one is a privacy "fundamentalist" or a privacy "pragmatist." Essentially, privacy and consumer advocates have been engaged in a tug of war with the communications and information industries for control over personal information. This is not to say that these "tugs" have not produced results that benefit privacy and free speech, as well as commerce.5 However, interactivity provides us with the opportunity to fashion a truer privacy paradigm that promotes individual choice and empowerment, robust speech, more secure communications and transactions, and vigorous commerce. For instance, interactivity makes possible real-time notice and choice options that acknowledge a direct relationship between individuals and the companies with which they do business. Notice and choice options can be presented at varying levels of granularity, depending on the individual's desire at the time of a particular transaction. Interactions can once again be tailored by and for the individual. As the recent Department of Commerce report, "Privacy and the NII: Safeguarding Telecommunications-Related Personal Information," concluded: "The promised interactivity of the NII may diminish the need to make a policy choice between opt-in and opt-out. Such interactivity would make it possible for service providers to obtain consent to use [transaction-related personal information] from subscribers electronically before any services were rendered."6 Today, the privacy potential of interactive technology remains largely hidden and untapped. Unique facets of this new medium can be bent to advance privacy and encourage full and open participation. A range of policy and technical options will be discussed in greater detail in the "New Privacy Paradigm" section of this paper. II. WHY IS PRIVACY IMPORTANT? Before launching into a discussion of privacy, we must begin by defining the term. The difficulty of defining privacy and its underlying principles has stymied and paralyzed policy makers and philosophers. One privacy scholar who has written on privacy issues for decades resorted to defining it in these visceral terms: "You know it when you lose it." 7 Yet defining privacy and its value to individuals and society is essential if we are to develop cohesive, rational information privacy policies. We must understand why preserving and enhancing privacy is an ultimate "good" before we can expect policy makers, the private sector, and privacy and consumer advocates to reach some common ground on core privacy principles and their application. Information privacy is defined here as incorporating two components, at times distinct and at times inextricable. The first component is the right to retreat from the world; one's family, neighbors, community, and government. This component allows us to shield ourselves, physically and psychologically, from the prying eyes of others. We think of this privacy value, as it was initially described by Justice Louis Brandeis over a century ago, as "the right to be let alone." The second component of privacy is the right to control information about oneself, even after divulging it to others. This component acknowledges the critical value of being able to step forward and participate in society without having to relinquish all control over personal information. As Professor Alan Westin first defined it in Privacy and Freedom, to maintain privacy in modern times, individuals need to "determine for one's self when, how, and to what extent information about one's self is communicated to others."8 Privacy as defined here allows individuals to choose when to withdraw and when to participate. People must be able to seek solitude and isolation from others to develop a sense of one's self apart from others. Developing one's unique identity is critical to a person's ability to form his or her own thoughts and opinions, and to establish intimate connections with others. A society that preserves privacy for its people is one that acknowledges the individual's interest in maintaining control over his or her life. One aspect of this control is being able to determine the presentation of one's self, or various pieces of one's self, to others. A person who is unable to truly retreat feels constantly watched, dehumanized, and powerless to make fundamental decisions affecting his or her life.9 Equally important to having the capacity to retreat from society, is having the ability to step forward to participate in the affairs of society. It is axiomatic that an individual's willingness to engage in the activities of the community will be tempered by the degree to which he or she is able to maintain control over the development and presentation of one's self.10 In the absence of control over the development of one's self, individual autonomy and self-determination are eroded. An emblem of a vibrant, participatory democracy is the ability of people to develop as individuals, separate and distinct from one another, with the confidence to hold and express their own political opinions, beliefs and preferences. A free society tolerates -- even revels in -- such individuality, recognizing it as the bedrock of an open society. Once divulged, bits of personal information can reveal what we think, believe, and feel. Personal information, disclosed over a period of time in a variety of circumstances, can be culled to create a "womb to tomb dossier." As people lose the ability to control how others see them, and judgments are made about them based on information gathered third hand, people grow to distrust information-gathering entities. People become reticent to fully communicate for fear the information will be used for unintended purposes, and they may ultimately lose confidence in their ability to participate in a range of traditional and emerging settings.11 Buttressing these conclusions, a number of recent polls document peoples' growing concerns that their privacy is increasingly threatened as they lose control over personal information.12 In this context, privacy means controlling who can know what about us. It means that we, as individuals, can regulate the flow of personal information, whether we are alone, in social settings, business transactions and, to a less absolute extent, to the government. The following section is a brief review of the current state of privacy law and practice, which will serve as the foundation for a proposal for a new privacy paradigm for the interactive age. IV. CURRENT PRIVACY PARADIGM In the information age, neither prong of the privacy right (to be let alone and to control personal information) has developed in law or practice to preserve or advance individual privacy. In a paper-based, information-gathering society in which the individual lacks sufficient bargaining power, the notice and consent models have failed to provide people with the ability to make meaningful, uncoerced choices about how much personal information to divulge, and how and whether their information can be used for purposes unrelated to those for which it was initially collected. Over the past thirty years, the United States' information privacy policy has been loosely and unevenly patched from a series of Supreme Court decisions, federal statutes, executive branch reports, and industry self-regulation. The Code of Fair Information Practice Principles developed by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1973, has served as the basis for much of the information privacy legislation and policy in place today. The central principle is that information collected for one purpose shall not be used for a different purpose without the individual's consent. The principle is more extensively discussed than it is applied. Even where the private sector has voluntarily adopted such a consent principle, it has fallen short of empowering people to make informed, uncoerced choices about secondary information use. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that in theory, a general consensus has developed among many privacy and consumer groups, the private sector, and even the government, that individuals should be informed of and able to make choices about the secondary use of personal information.13 The challenge has always been how to craft workable and enforceable mechanisms to put the policy into practice.14 With few exceptions, industry representatives argue vigorously that "opt-out" must be the maximum privacy mechanism, which means that unless an individual affirmatively objects to a secondary use of information, the information gatherer is free to reuse and redisclose personal information. As privacy advocates have long argued, the opt-out approach places the burden of restricting information use on the individual, and thereby creates a presumption that ancillary, unrelated uses of personal information are acceptable. Another criticism leveled at the opt-out mechanism is that it insufficiently reflects peoples' true privacy values since such a small percentage of people actually exercise the option, attributable to a lack of notice, fear of negative consequences, and a reluctance to engage in one more step beyond what is minimally necessary to complete a transaction. Exacerbating the insufficiency of privacy law and practice is the weak state of constitutional jurisprudence in the area of information privacy. In one of its seminal privacy cases, U.S. v. Katz, the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment protects "people, not places" from unwarranted searches and seizures.15 In Katz, the Court found that what a person "seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected" provided the individual has a subjective actual expectation of privacy which the society will recognize as reasonable. The reasonable expectation is then weighed against the government's interest in access, and the extent of the intrusion. Although hailed as a landmark privacy decision, the Katz test has been applied in later cases to undermine privacy interests. In Katz's progeny, the Court has applied the "reasonable expectation" test as a relative standard informed by the technological and social realities of the day. As technology has advanced, and as societal demands for sensitive personal information have increased, the Court has increasingly circumscribed the "zones" one may justifiably consider private. Thus in California v. Ciraolo, the Court held that the use of a fixed-wing aircraft to observe marijuana on defendant's property from 1,000 feet did not violate his protected "zone of privacy" even though he had built a 10-foot fence around his backyard with the intent to shield it from passers-by.16 The Court stated that the defendant's subjective expectation of privacy was not one "that society is prepared to honor � [i]n an age where private and commercial flight in the public airways is routine." Similarly, in California v. Greenwood, the Court found that people have no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage once it is removed from the home and placed on the curb for pick-up, even if a county ordinance requires the trash to be placed on the curb and does not allow for disposal in any other way.17 The Court reasoned that the defendants deposited their garbage "in an area particularly suited for public inspection and ��for the express purpose of having strangers take it" and could not expect Fourth Amendment protection for items they "knowingly expose[d] to the public." The "reasonable expectation" test has proven particularly troublesome in the information privacy context. The Court has continually held that individuals have no privacy interest in information divulged to the private sector, even though modern society leaves citizens no option but to disclose to others (e.g., disclosure as a condition of participation in society and technology accumulating transactional data). 18 The distinction is blurring between the content of a communication and the transactional data generated in the course of a communication. In the nine years since the enactment of ECPA, society's patterns of using communications technologies has changed dramatically. Millions of people have electronic mail addresses; large numbers of businesses, nonprofit and political groups conduct their work over the Internet; and use of the World Wide Web is exploding. Detailed information about a person's visits to Usenet and World Wide Web sites are logged, and may be used without a person's knowledge. Records of all of these activities -- who sends a message to whom, where a given communications device is located, which political party one contacts for information, and which online discussion group or virtual community one associates with -- are available both in real time and in stored form as part of the transactional information generated by advanced computer and communications networks. This transactional information reveals almost as much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally followed us around on the street. To varying degrees, people expect that this transactional data is "private." There are content-like characteristics to transactional data that require it be afforded a level of legal protection akin to content. In the past year, there has been political consensus in support of raising legal protections for such increasingly sensitive and unprotected transaction data. However, so far, the legal limits on access apply only to the government. There is increasing urgency to address the private sector's use of transactional data. The NII Advisory Committee's Privacy Principles and the NTIA's recent report both conclude that transaction data is entitled to content-like safeguards from the private sector. IV. NEW PRIVACY PARADIGM New media presents us with the opportunity to more fully realize constitutional privacy principles, while fostering free speech and commerce in the digital environment. We must build in to the technology and its applications the capacity to move beyond "opt-in" and "opt-out" to mechanisms of meaningful individual choice. Widespread availability of choice options will also reverse the use of the Katz standard to undermine privacy protections. If technology can be a tool for people to more easily manifest their subjective privacy expectations, then those expectations are more likely to be recognized by the society (and the Court) as objectively reasonable. In the interactive sphere, technology may be designed to empower individuals to gain greater control over their lives by making decisions about the use of their personal information. Those decisions may vary from transaction to transaction, depending upon the nature of the transaction, the recipient of the personal information, the offers proffered, and a slew of other variables. For instance, some people consider their address to be sensitive information. Others may be unconcerned about disclosures of their phone numbers, ages, salaries, or travel patterns. In the interactive realm, technology has the capacity to be the individual's ally, not the intrusive, meglomaniacal villain, as it is often perceived. In fact, both privacy prongs can be more fully addressed by interactive technologies that allow people to filter out unwanted communications that may come into their home, as well as to make choices about the use of the personal information they are divulging. The Caller ID experience is instructive here in that technology can be designed to give people greater control over both the information they divulge and receive. Interactive technologies can be designed with features that empower individuals to control the flow of information. The initial point of contact is ideal for conveying information about the information practices and policies of an information user to the individual and providing them with the ability to make choices concerning the information use. Traditional opt-out/opt-in mechanisms for obtaining consent usually involve an "all or nothing" approach. The ease and economy of interactive communications offers an opportunity for more granular levels of choice. Information collectors and users can more easily ask specific questions, request more detailed information, and tailor their requests and responses. To some extent, exercising choice in the use of personal information may alleviate the fear of surveillance and abuse that makes many individuals reticent about using new technologies. An individual must be given clear and conspicuous (up-front) notice of information policies and practices in order to make informed choices about information uses. Transparency, a central principle of fair information practices, requires that individuals be told about the information that is being collected from them, and how it will be used and disclosed. Software can be designed that allows individuals to access additional information about information practices, and to actually see the amount of information they are revealing by engaging in a given activity. Choice functions that allow individuals to exercise a number of options regarding information flow can be used to gather consent to information use and to record limits on information use. Software can be designed to require the individual to take an action prior to engaging in a specific activity.19 Through such choice mechanisms, information users can educate consumers about information flow while empowering individuals to take a more active role in controlling the information they release and receive. As technology options are explored, a number of difficult questions must be resolved. Who in a particular transaction stream is responsible for providing the individual with notice and choice? Whose notice and choice decisions apply to whom? For instance, if an individual is using her America Online account to access LL Bean and uses her American Express card to buy long johns, which company's choice option applies? From a privacy and business standpoint, should the first choice exercised flow with the rest of the transaction or do the entities have a justifiable, independent interest in using the personal information for their own secondary uses if they have obtained consent in a different context? Will the individual's privacy preferences vary across entities? In addition, agents and contractors of the primary entity (such as Federal Express, or a billing company) should not be able to assert an interest in using the information beyond the purpose for which it was disclosed. V. DESIGNING, IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING USER EMPOWERING TECHNOLOGIES  Technology that empowers individuals to make choices about the use of personal information will benefit consumer privacy and ultimately commerce. Not only does a more informed, active citizenry breed a robust, participatory democracy, but voluntary, knowledgeable participation in the marketplace will lead to more confident consumers. The opportunity for entities to establish more direct relationships with the individual can lead to a more refined, detailed, useful awareness of the consumer. As people gain greater trust in the interactive environment, they will be less reticent to participate. As segments of the private sector already recognize, allowing people to make decisions about the use of personal information is an essential business practice. Good privacy practices are crucial to individuals, and necessary to foster free speech and commerce. Just as industry, researchers and the public interest community have joined together to design technologies to empower people to filter out objectionable material on the Internet through the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS), so too can the PICS model be harnessed or expanded to include a privacy focus. The key distinction between the drive to develop a non-regulatory solution in the free speech arena and efforts to devise privacy-enhancing technologies is that in the former instance we face the serious threat of censorship legislation. In the privacy arena, the private sector has a window of opportunity to be one step ahead of the Congress. However, as the NTIA report warned, and privacy advocates will demand, meaningful, enforceable privacy guidelines and mechanisms must be put in place industry-wide. VI. NEXT STEPS The Center for Democracy and Technology's Privacy Forum, a consortium of public interest and private sector organizations, is in the process of identifying and developing privacy models and guidelines for transactional data and interactive media. The Forum is convening a series of briefings and demonstrations to work towards technical and policy options that allow people to make choices about the use of their personal information and communications. At this early stage, the Forum is identifying the extent to which personal information is generated and stored in interactive media. The goal is to develop a set of privacy "rules of the road" that enhance individual choice, foster free speech and other democratic values, and support the continued development of a vibrant Global Information Infrastructure. Footnotes The Federal Trade Commission has been examining privacy issues and the GII this past year. The National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council issued its "Privacy and Security-Related Principles" early this year, followed by the inter-agency Information Infrastructure Task Force's Privacy Principles. Most recently, the Department of Commerce's NTIA released its report on "Privacy and Telecommunications-Related Data," which concluded that the private sector must implement privacy standards or face a legislative mandate.

Caller Intellidata packaged Caller ID information, including date and time of call, from Southwestern Bell, with caller address and demographic information compiled by Equifax. In addition to individual profiles of callers, this service would include a statistical profile of the businesses customers based on demographic information from census reports and Equifax. The Public Counsel for Missouri objected to the service calling it "Big Brother" and stating that "Consumers should not be forced to become statistics in a marketing study merely by placing a telephone call."

Miller , the Court found no reasonable expectation of privacy in personal information divulged to a third party even though individual had no choice but to divulge, 425 U.S. 345 (1976). Both Smith and Miller were later "overturned" by Congress through enactment of the Electronic Communications privacy Act, and the Right to Financial Privacy Act, statutes that created legally enforceable expectations of privacy.

Exon on MacNeil/Lehrer 6/22/95 CDT Executive Director Jerry Berman vs. Senator Exon MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour -- June 22, 1995 FOCUS - SEX IN CYBERSPACE? MS. FARNSWORTH: The debate over sex on the Internet is nexttonight. The Senate has passed a bill that would ban pornography incyberspace. But yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,Newt Gingrich, said the ban is a bad idea. REP. NEWT GINGRICH, Speaker of the House: [last night] Clearly aviolation of free speech and it's a violation of the right of adults tocommunicate with each other, but was I think seen as a good pressrelease back home so people voted for it. MS. FARNSWORTH: The Speaker was referring to a provision in thesweeping Telecommunications Reform Act passed by the Senate last week.Its sponsor, Senator James Exon, said it would protect children fromone of the pot holes on the information highway. SEN. JAMES EXON, [D] Nebraska: I had a remarkable demonstration ofwhat is readily available to any child with the basic Internet access.It is not an exaggeration to say that the worst, most vile, mostperverse pornography is only a few "click, click, clicks" away from anychild on the Internet. MS. FARNSWORTH: The Internet is a global network of smallercomputer networks. An estimated 25 million people are plugged into the Internet, and the number has been doubling every year. Until recently,access was only available through powerful computers at universities andgovernment research facilities. But now, dozens of companies offeraccess to anyone with a home computer and a modem connected to a phoneline. With that access, users can send E-Mail messages to other users orsearch the Internet for whatever interests them, the latest satellitephotos from NASA, digitized collections of fine art, information on afavorite rock band, or the latest medical information on any givendisease or treatment. And along with all the art and science has comepornography and chat rooms, where people can send messages on any numberof subjects, including sexually explicit ones, to other Internet users. Since the Internet is a network of users, nobody owns it, nobodyruns it, and up until recently, nobody tried to police it. REP. NEWT GINGRICH: I don't agree with it, and I don't think it's aserious way to discuss a serious issue, which is: How do you maintainright of free speech for adults while also protecting children in amedium which is available to both? MS. FARNSWORTH:The Senate's answer is a bill that would make it acrime to send obscene or harassing messages on the Internet. It wouldalso impose a $100,000 fine and a two-year prison term on anyone whomade indecent sexual material available to under-age Internet users.Should there be restrictions on the Internet? We have two views: Sen.James Exon, Democrat from Nebraska, and Jerry Berman, the executivedirector of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a non-profit civilliberties organization based in Washington. Thank you, gentlemen, forbeing with us. Sen. Exon, let's start with you. I know you can't beterribly specific on a show like this, but what did you see on theInternet that made you want to enact this bill? SEN. JAMES EXON, [D] Nebraska: [Capitol Hill] Elizabeth, I saw theopening of your show. If we could show on your program tonight what'sreadily available most unfortunately to children on the Internet, Ihad a book that was downloaded with pictures that I showed to many of mycolleagues in the United States Senate, they did not know this wasavailable. It's pornography at its worst. It's obscenity at its worst.And to say it's indecent is an understatement. I wish I could show thepictures, but you couldn't, and I wouldn't. I simply say the Exon-CoatsBill that passed the United States Senate 86 to 14 is a step in theright direction. It's not a cure-all, but it will provide a deterrent tostop the profiteering that's going on today that are polluting the mindsof our youth. We can't just sit idly by and say, oh, this is socomplicated we can't do anything about it. I believe maybe -- althoughnot very many people can tell Newt Gingrich anything these days -- evenI might be able to convince Newt, as I did many others, that sittingidly by and letting this happen on the Internet today is going to havea serious deterrent to other people getting on the Internet to takeadvantage of that vast new system to spread knowledge that I'm excitedabout. We've got to do something to protect the kids. MS. FARNSWORTH: Senator, the Speaker says it's a violation of freespeech. Isn't it? SEN. EXON: It's not a violation of free speech, and I called on alot of well-known lawyers to make sure that this bill could test -- tobe properly tested on the constitutional rights provision. We never knowwhat the courts are going to do. We based this on the law that has beenin effect and been approved constitutional with regard to pornography onthe telephones and pornography in the U.S. mail. We're not out inno-man's land. We're running on the record of courts' decisions thathave said you can use community standards to protect especially kids ontelephones and in the mails. We're trying to expand that as best wecan to the Internet. MS. FARNSWORTH: Mr. Berman, I surfed the Internet a little bittoday to see what I could find on it, and I also can't say exactly whatI found on this show, but one of the things I found was a solicitationfor pictures of eight to eleven year old girls having sex with adultmen. What, if anything, should be done about this? JERRY BERMAN, Center for Democracy and Technology: First of all, theyought to be rounded up and prosecuted. The Justice Department is outthere. It has a, a whole division that works on computer crimeprosecution. It should be pointed out that the Justice Department didnot ask for new legislation in this area. They are prosecuting undercurrent law. Child pornography, bestiality, the most perverse thingsthat Sen. Exon talks about, are violations of the criminal law. Whathe fails to point out is that his statute went much broader than thatand would ban the knowing, making available any materials which may beindecent to anyone under the age of 18. That not only covers pornographyand obscenity, which we all abhor, but it also would cover thecommunications between adults where they might be talking about"Ulysses" or talking about rap music or having a discussion about, abouttheir sexual preferences. The problem with the Internet, unlike theU.S. mails and the telephone system, is that it's not a closed system.It's not just two people communicating with each other through aclosed envelope or a closed telephone line. Here, when you communicateon the Internet, you make information available, you put it up, and youput it up and anyone can come and get it. And it's important in thistechnology to understand that you have to come and get it. I understandit may be a few clicks away but you have to come and get it. And thatmakes it very different because you know, just simply know that thereare children on the Internet, and, therefore, any information thatmaybe we would try to communicate between adults could get in the handsof a child and, therefore, it's a crime. So the only way to clean up theInternet is to make it safe only for children. MS. FARNSWORTH: What about that problem, Sen. Exon? Let's saythere's a discussion among adults about James Joyce's "Ulysses," whichmight be considered indecent, and a sixteen-year-old logs on. Won't thatbe against the law under your bill? SEN. EXON: I think Jerry tries to make a case, it's a false case.Certainly, it would have to be prosecuted by a prosecutor, and the judgewould have to so decide that watching that type of a program that I donot think under the definition that anyone considers would bepornographic. That's one of the problems we have with people like Jerry.They may be well intentioned, but they just don't seem to realize thatwe can't sit back and see what you saw on the Internet today and whatkids are seeing all over. The facts of the matter are that there isnot enough prosecution taking place today. MS. FARNSWORTH: But the -- SEN. EXON: The Coats-Exon Bill will assist in stopping this, butit won't be a cure-all. MS. FARNSWORTH: What about what Mr. Berman said, though, the worrythat only that which is good for kids or which kids can look at will beon the Internet if, if this bill passes? SEN. EXON: Well, that's obviously not true. The -- we have --hardly have a day goes by that what we don't have some case of a kidbeing lured away from home, taken advantage of. What you saw today isreplete on the Internet. There will be a study coming out very soonthat's going to be widely distributed next week that proves the caseonce and again that we've got a disease going on on the Internet today. I think that Jerry and his people should work with us to try andsolve this problem, rather than hiding behind the old constitutionalprotection once again that simply says anything can go and you dare notdo anything about it because you're going to run afoul of the Constitution. I think that's not reasonable. I think that is notrealistic. MS. FARNSWORTH: Mr. Berman, how would you solve the problem? MR. BERMAN: Two things. First of all, we tried to work with Sen. Exon, and we're still prepared to work with him and others in the Houseto draft narrow statute which if there's -- the Justice Department canshow that there's a gap in current law and going after materials thathe's described, but we do not want to leave it to the discretion ofprosecutors all over the United States to decide what may be indecent.And there are many times and there are places where "Ulysses" would beconsidered indecent material, and, therefore, adults will have to havethe chilling effect of not knowing what they can put up on the Net. Butlet's go to the real issue. I think that Sen. Exon has raised a veryimportant issue for the American public. The information highway Istipulate has a lot of material on it which is very troublesome andwhich our children should not get ahold of. The problem is that weshould not try to put forward solutions that are really fig leafs thatwill not solve the problem. For example, the worldwide Internet is aworldwide network. I don't know where Sen. Exon downloaded thematerials that he found abhorrent, but if they're downloaded from Swedenor they're downloaded from Denmark, which looks exactly like any U.S.site, any law that he passes will not reach it. If you want to -- whatthe Speaker is talking about is an approach which says let us reallylook at the user end of the Internet, what kinds of technologies canwe bring on line to make it possible for parents to screen out andcontrol what they see or what they interact with on the Net and whattheir children interact with? I have here, for example, a software[holding up "Surf- Watch"] which is available on the market whichscreens out adult sexual material. You just put it in with yourcomputer, and it keeps your kid out. America On-Line and otherinformation services are trying to put screening technology -- in fact,they have screening technology and lock-out technology bundled into theAmerica On-Line, and they are trying to update that. The industry reallywill respond. The problem, by bringing these technologies on board, whatRep. Cox and Widen in the House, along with the Speaker, realize thatwhile Sen. Exon's bill is well-intentioned, it was drafted in a waywhich creates disincentives for industry to do this kind of policing.Under his legislation, if an Internet provider like America On-Linetried to control information, they are -- they cannot rely on thedefenses in the legislation for prosecuting of someone other than themwho puts up content. MS. FARNSWORTH: Okay, let me ask the Senator about this. First ofall, Sen. Exon, on the question of user, policing this by policing theuser, by using a technology which can block it for the user, a parentcould put something in their computer and make it impossible to getPenthouse Magazine, which I read is the No. 1 site on the Internet now, what's wrong with that? SEN. EXON: There's nothing wrong with that. We didn't hear muchabout that until the Exon Decency Bill was widely considered anddebated. Yes, we have gotten the intention, and it may well be thateventually -- although I am convinced that there's no way to filter outall of this material. Let's take the case that Jerry just used. Let'ssay that Mom and Dad could lock out on their computer, which you can'tdo now, and Jerry knows you can't do it now, and there's nothingavailable on the market today that would begin to take out everythingthat is pornographic and obscene, but I'm certainly not saying that theyshouldn't try that. I don't believe that's going to work or beeffective. One of the problems that we have today is we tried to workwith Jerry, but we found out that basically Jerry goes back to the oldidea that I think is kind of foreign that Thomas Jefferson and all ofthe good people who wrote the Constitution worked overnight and plannedand plotted to make sure that the Constitution protected the most grosspornographers, pedophiles, those who are trying to lure children today.Children can get this information outside the home. They can get it inthe schools. They can get it in the libraries. They can get it at theneighbors. I wish that we could wake up, and maybe if I could get toNewt Gingrich, maybe if he would at least look at the material that Ihave and take a look at our bill that is not nearly as restrictive asJerry would like to believe it is, maybe we could solve the problem. MS. FARNSWORTH: Mr. Berman, we have just a few seconds for aresponse. MR. BERMAN: Yes. But I'm sorry if I'm -- if I am associated with thegang that goes back to Thomas Jefferson, I'm quite proud of thatassociation. We need to draft careful legislation here which is notthrown out by the Supreme Court. We need to look at these technologysolutions. We should not pass bandaids. We should not go for pressreleases, and I think the Senator has raised important issues. I thinkhe would -- it would behoove him to work with industry on the usercontrols. That is the only effective way to deal with pornography on theInternet. MS. FARNSWORTH: Senator, Mr. Berman, thank you for being with us.

Overview Part II. The Need And Demand For Federal Privacy Protection Part III. The Medical Records Confidentiality Act Part IV. Recommendations for Improving the Bill Part V. Conclusion Madame Chairwoman and Members of the Committee: I.  OVERVIEW My name is Janlori Goldman and I am the Deputy Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT).  I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on behalf of CDT in support of  the Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995, (S.1360).  CDT is a non-profit, public interest organization founded by civil liberties advocates to advance public policies protecting civil liberties and democratic values in the development of new media.  One of CDT s primary goals for the 104th Congress is the passage of federal legislation that establishes strong, enforceable privacy protection for personally identifiable health information.  We believe the need for such legislation is the most critical information privacy issue facing our country today. Further, the passage of a medical records confidentiality bill should be viewed as an essential stepping stone to achieving other health care reform goals. The public will not have trust and confidence in the emerging health information infrastructure if  their sensitive health data is vulnerable to abuse and misuse. We strongly support  S.1360, and applaud Senators Robert Bennett and Patrick Leahy, as well as the bill's co-sponsors for their strong leadership towards enacting medical confidentiality records legislation this Congress. 	At present, there is no comprehensive federal law to protect peoples' health records. However, a Louis Harris survey found that most people in this country mistakenly �believe their personal health information is currently protected by law.  And most people mistakenly believe they have a right to access their own medical information.  In fact, only 28 states allow patients access to their own medical records and 34 states have conflicting confidentiality laws.  A federal privacy policy is urgently needed to address the fact that the traditional doctor-patient relationship is being intruded upon by increasing demands for health information.  CDT believes Congress must act to protect personally identifiable health information so that the reality of our laws will finally conform, to some extent, with the perception and desires of the American public.  	To that end, CDT has been working with a diverse coalition of privacy and consumer advocates, health policy specialists and industry representatives, to develop a consensus on privacy policy for personally identifiable health information (see attached letter to Senator Bennett).  This consortium of groups has operated with a keen understanding of the advances in technology today. 	The societal impact of technological innovations,  including those that allow medical records, data and images to be transferred easily over great distances, is felt across our country in significant ways.  The development of a national information infrastructure and information superhighway are changing the ways we deal with each other.  Traditional barriers of distance, time and location are disappearing as information and transactions become computerized, and few relationships in the health care field will remain unaffected by these changes.  In the absence of any Congressional action on S.1360, the collection and use of personally identifiable health information will continue to occurr within electronic networked environments without privacy protections.  	  But while this information revolution may hold great promise for enhancing our nation's health, CDT and others who support S.1360 believe that personal health information, in both paper and electronic form, must be handled within enforceable privacy rules.  Even useful technologies  pose potential risks, as conflicts may arise between an individual's  need to keep health information confidential and the economic opportunities posed by the computerization of health records, from lowering the cost of processing insurance claims to selling personal medical records for marketing purposes. 	 	Confidentiality must not be an afterthought in the design and use of information systems.  A provision known as "administrative simplification" has been included in the House-passed budget reconciliation bill and mandates that certain personal health information be reported in standardized, electronic form.  Although"administrative simplification" fosters the development of networked health information databases, the provisioin is silent on privacy.  Without protections such as those incorporated in S.1360, CDT believes the "administrative simplification" section should not become law.  	CDT strongly supports the Medical Records Confidentiality Act as the most comprehensive and strong privacy bill the Congress has yet considered in this area.  Similiar legislation was widely supported by both Republicans and Democrats during last Congress' effort to enact health care reform.  We commend Senator Bennett,  Senator Leahy and this Committee for the leadership and commitment you have shown on this important legislation.  Our testimony today outlines the need for this legislation, discussion of S.1360, and our recommendations for strengthening and clarifying several sections of the bill. II.  THE NEED AND DEMAND FOR FEDERAL PRIVACY PROTECTION A. Consensus Exists A consensus exists that federal legislation is needed to protect the privacy of personal health care records.  At a conference in Washington, D.C. two years ago, co-sponsored by the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs, the American Health Information Management Association, and Equifax, nearly every panelist and member of Congress supported the need for making privacy an integral part of the health care reform effort underway at that time.  In agreement were panelists from the American Medical Association, CIGNA Health Care, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and IBM. 	At the conference, Louis Harris and Associates released their Health Information Privacy Survey, prepared with the assistance of Dr. Alan Westin, a privacy expert at Columbia University.  The survey found that the majority of the public (56%) favored the enactment of strong comprehensive federal legislation governing the privacy of health care information.  In fact, eighty-five percent (85%) said that protecting the confidentiality of medical records was absolutely essential or very important to them.  Most people wanted penalties imposed for unauthorized disclosure of medical records (96%), guaranteed access to their own records (96%), and rules regulating third-party access. 	A 1992 Harris survey showed that while a large majority of people recognize the benefits to society of innovative technology, nearly nine out of ten people believe computers make it easier for someone to improperly obtain confidential personal information.  Twenty-five percent of the public believe they have been the victim of an improper disclosure of personal medical information. 	In addition, a number of federal studies have concluded that a federal law is needed to protect peoples' medical records. In 1994, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) issued a report entitled  Protecting Privacy in Computerized Medical Information,  which addresses the effects of the computerization of medical records on people's privacy.  In recommending comprehensive federal legislation, OTA found that: [t]he expanded use of medical records for non treatment purposes exacerbates the shortcomings of existing legal schemes to protect privacy in patient information.  The law must address the increase in the flow of data outward from the medical care relationship by both addressing the question of appropriate access to data and providing redress to those who have been wronged by privacy violations.  Lack of such guidelines, and failure to make them enforceable, could affect the quality and integrity of the medical record itself.  (OTA Report, p.  44). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science released a study that focused on the risks and opportunities associated with protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personally-identifiable health data.  The IOM report recommended that Congress enact legislation to preempt state laws to establish a uniform requirement for the confidentiality and protection of privacy rights for personally-identifiable health data, and specify a Code of Fair Health Information Practices to ensure a proper balance between required disclosures, use of data, and patient privacy.  	Most recently, Professor Larry Gostin concluded that a federal preemptive statute based on fair information practices was necessary to protect personal privacy as networked health information databases are growing. (80 Cornell Law Review 451 (1995). 	 All these efforts represent a tremendous pulling together of the public and private sector to achieve a critical goal -- the passage of a health records confidentiality law.  Nearly twenty years ago there was similar pressure to craft a medical records privacy law.  In 1977, the federal Privacy Protection Study Commission issued a report recommending legislation to protect private sector records, including medical and insurance records.  The Commission's recommendations sparked a Congressional effort to enact a medical records privacy bill.  In 1980, due in part to pressure from the law enforcement community for unfettered access to health records, the legislative effort failed. B. Negative Consequences The unauthorized disclosure of personal health information can have disastrous consequences.  New York Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez won her House seat only after overcoming the results of an unauthorized disclosure.  Her medical records -- including details of a bout with depression and suicide attempt -- were faxed to a New York newspaper and television station during her campaign. 	More common, and in some ways more troubling than the well-publicized privacy invasions of public figures, are the consequences suffered by ordinary individuals whose privacy has been compromised by the disclosure of medical information. 	In one instance, a journalist disguised himself as a doctor, obtained an actress  medical record and published that she had been treated for a sexually transmitted disease.  In another case, a physician at a large New York City medical school logged on to a computer system, discovered that a nurse was pregnant, and proceeded to publicize that information.  Also, a Colorado medical student sold medical records to attorneys practicing malpractice law.  These are just a few of the more well known stories; undoubtedly there are millions of similar breaches that occur either without the knowledge of the individuals harmed or outside the media's spotlight.  	 	Further, errors in peoples  medical records have been difficult to correct and control.  For instance, Mary Rose Taylor of Springfield, Massachusetts went without health insurance for a year and a half because of a computer error at the Medical Information Bureau (MIB), a clearinghouse of medical information kept by insurance companies.  MIB reported that Ms. Taylor had an abnormal urinalysis, even though she had only undergone a blood test.  Ms. Taylor was forced to go to the insurance commissioner of her state to have the error corrected before she could finally receive health insurance. 	Despite the public and private horror stories, many Americans trust that the information they share with their doctor is kept private.  Indeed, the traditional nature of the doctor-patient relationship is intended to foster trust and to encourage full disclosure.  However, once a patient's information is submitted to a third-party payor, or to any other entity, the ethical tie between doctor and patient evaporates.  In fact, in a particularly telling statistic, 93% of those termed  "leaders"  in the Harris survey, including hospital CEOs, health insurance CEOs, physicians, nurses, and state regulators, believe that third party payors need to be governed by detailed confidentiality and privacy policies. 	Within our current health care system, many people try to protect themselves against potential privacy violations.  Some people routinely ask doctors to record a false diagnosis because they fear their employer may see their health records.  Some people don t even tell their doctors everything about their medical condition for fear of losing control over this sensitive information.  In psychiatric practices, it is common for many patients to ask doctors not to take notes during sessions for fear such notes could be leaked or even obtained legally with a subpoena.  And some people try to avoid the creation of a record altogether by paying for medical services out-of- pocket, even though they are entitled to insurance coverage. 	A few insurers have been candid enough to concede that their primary business relationship is with the employer/customer and not the employee/patient.  These insurers may be reluctant to disclose individually-identifiable health information if requested by an employer, but they will comply if pressed.  No federal law prevents disclosures by insurers to employers.  Most patients, of course, believe the fiduciary relationship is between themselves and their doctors, and don't realize that a third party with no direct relationship to their medical treatment  actually controls the information.  It is intolerable to support a system in which an employer's payment of a portion of employees  health care premiums, a normal part of most American employees  compensation packages, amounts to employers controlling their employee's  health records. 	The problems that arise because of a lack of uniform, federal privacy protection for identifiable health information are often exacerbated by advances in technology.  For example, at the state and local level today, employers, insurers, and health care providers are forming coalitions to develop automated and linked health care systems containing lifetime health histories on millions of Americans.  The primary goals of these projects are cost reduction and improved quality of care.  	Attempts are being made in some state coalitions to address the privacy, confidentiality and security of health data by crafting internal guidelines, regulations and contracts.  In addition, in those states where the automation of health care information is seen as a key component of a state's health care reform package, state legislatures and public agencies are attempting to enact legislation that establishes a right of privacy in personally identifiable health care information.  These states are also attempting to design effective enforcement penalties and oversight mechanisms to monitor the information practices of these newly created health data systems. 	The outcome of this piecemeal, state by state, approach to protecting the privacy and security of health care information will be conflict among the states and a setback for the overall goal of privacy protection.  Relegating the protection of health care information to the states'  different guidelines, policies and laws leaves individuals subject to differing degrees of privacy depending upon where they receive their health care.  In some instances, this means that individuals traveling across county or state lines to receive necessary medical treatment may lose their ability to control how their personal medical information is used.  Moreover, states and local governments with different rules governing the use of health care information may be prevented from sharing health care information contained in their systems with neighboring states that insufficiently protect privacy. 	Health care records, in both paper and electronic form, deserve privacy protection.  But the vulnerability of information to unauthorized use grows exponentially as the computer makes possible the instant sharing of information.  As a 1992 study by the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) pointed out:  "The paper medium is cumbersome and expensive . . . Ironically, it is the  negative  impact of the paper medium . . . that has minimized the risk of breaches of confidentiality.  Although a breach could occur, if someone gave access to health records or insurance claim forms, the magnitude of the breach was limited by the sheer difficulty of unobtrusively reviewing large numbers of records or claim forms. " 	Nevertheless, technology itself  is not the evil.  Information systems can actually be designed to promote the confidentiality and security of personal information.  For instance, a computerized system can sometimes be more closely guarded through technological devices than paper systems can sometimes be protected from prying eyes.  The key is to recognize technology's potential to enhance privacy, not simply to focus on the risks technology poses to undermine privacy. There is widespread agreement among privacy and security experts that protections must be built in on the front-end; it is too difficult and risky to try to add them after the fact.  Privacy and security must be viewed as the foundation on which health information networks are created. Only then can we acheive�the potential for enhancing privacy and security. III.  THE MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY ACT CDT strongly supports the Medical Records Confidentiality Act.  In particular, we support provisions in the bill that: Gives people the right to see, copy, and correct their own medical records; Limits disclosure of personal health information by requiring an individual's permission prior to disclosure of his or her health information by doctors, insurance companies, and other health information "trustees"; Requires the development of safeguards for the use and disclosure of personal health information; Creates a warrant requirement for law enforcement access to peoples' health records; Imposes strict civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of the Act, and provides individuals with a private right of action against those who mishandle their personal medical information; and Preserves state and federal laws that may be more privacy protective in certain areas, such as public and mental health.  Without protections such as those embodied in S.1360, the rise of patchwork regulation and the widespread electronic transmission of records will produce the worst of both worlds--confusion and red tape for legitimate data users, as�well as debilitating fear and mistrust for people seeking medical care.  IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS CDT  believes that the Medical records Confidentiality Act represents a vast improvement on current law. Nevertheless, we urge that the bill be strengthened and clarified in a number of area, most notably by 1)requiring consent for disclosure to health researchers; 2)heightening the warrant requirement for law enforcement access; and 3)narrowing the scope of the oversight section.  A. Health Research S.1360 currently allows researchers to receive protected health information without first obtaining an individual's authorization. We believe this is an unnecessarily broad exception and should be rewritten to incorporate a consent model. 	We acknowledge that in some instances the use of records for health research may be a legitimate exception to the bill's authorization requirements.  But CDT does not believe that the exceptions for research should be made broadly or routinely.  Research does not usually require the release of identifiable data; anonymous non-identifiable data are often sufficient.  In fact, research does not usually require the release of identifiable data without consent; it is often possible to get consent easily and prospectively.  	CDT recommends that the research section be amended to require an individual's authorization prior to disclosure of personally identifiable information. We urge the committee to consider an analagous situation in which federal regulations that apply to NIH-funded biomedical research presume that consent will be obtained for use of personal medical records.  Under those regulations, the nonconsensual release of records is only allowed when such records are required for the research to be effective, consent would be infeasible, and the project s significance outweighs the intrusion into privacy.  The regulations have worked well for years at institutions funded by the NIH.  Since they acknowledge an individual's privacy interest while recognizing the value of research, we would urge the Committee to review them and to incorporate similar provisions in the bill. B. Oversight We believe that the use of records for authorized oversight functions may be a legitimate exception to the general rule of nondisclosure.  However, we are concerned about the breadth of the exception currently in S.1360.  As drafted, the oversight provisions of the bill have an almost undefined reach and could be over zealously extended.  We recommend tightening this section by requiring oversight officials to obtain an administrative summons or subpoena for access to identifiable records. 	We want to emphasize the importance of the general and specific limitations that are already in the bill.  Under the general privacy rules of the bill, health oversight agencies cannot re-disclose identifiable information for other purposes not specially authorized.  In addition, a health oversight agency may not use the information gathered in its oversight role for any actions against an individual other than those arising out of receipt or payment for health care or fraud.  	With the inclusion of a legal process for access to identifiable information, CDT believes the bill will come closer to striking a fair balance between individual privacy and the government's legitimate needs to conduct audits and control fraud. C. Law Enforcement CDT strongly supports the creation of warrant requirement for law enforcement access to personal health records currently in S.1360. However, we urge that the proposed probable cause standard be heightened to equal the standard now in place for access to cable subscriber records. Under the Cable Communications Act of 1984, a warrant can not be issued for access to subscriber records until law enforcement can show "clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and the information sought would be material evidence in the case." We believe that federal privacy protection for peoples' medical records should be at least as strong-- if not stronger-- than we apply to peoples' cable records. V. CONCLUSION CDT believes the protection of personally identifiable health information is critical to ensuring public trust and confidence in the emerging health information infrastructure. Health care reform cannot move forward without assuring the American public that the highly sensitive personal information contained in their medical records will be protected from abuse and misuse. As the Harris surveys indicate, people are highly suspicious of large scale computerization and believe that their health records are in dire need of privacy protection. If people are expected to embrace and participate in a reforming health environment, the price of their participation must not be the loss of control of sensitive personal information. 	 In the end, any system that fails to win the public's trust will fail to win the public's support, and we risk having individuals withdraw from full and honest participation in their own health care. To allow people to fall through the cracks because their privacy is not fully protected is too serious a matter to continue to go unaddressed by the Congress. We urge you to continue your commitment to moving forward with this critical legislation. 	We have come a great distance in achieving broad consensus on the principles of health information privacy  and we look forward to working with you to refine and enact S. 1360.

The conferees are considering two sharply different proposals.  The Exon-Coats amendment adopted by the Senate requires the FCC to regulate cyber-speech -- policing all obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or indecent material.  Violators of this nebulous standard could receive fines as high as $100,000 and jail sentences of up to two years.  The Cox-Wyden-White amendment adopted by the House of Representatives explicitly bars the FCC from regulating in any way communications on the Internet.  Instead, it frees on-line service providers from legal obstacles that heretofore have prevented these companies from screening and filtering content as they see fit, or empowering their customers to do so. We are writing to express our strong support for the Cox-Wyden-White approach.  Intrusive content regulation of cyber-speech will unduly chill free expression and needlessly undermine the vitality of the on-line/Internet market at the very time that the marketplace is addressing the concerns that motivate the supporters of the Exon/Coats amendment. We believe that any new law in this area should: recognize the important societal interest in fostering free expression; clearly identify proscribed content; target and punish active wrongdoers, not passive actors such as access and serviceproviders; when in doubt, favor the market over government intervention; recognize that cyberspace is an evolving market with enormous potential to benefit allAmericans; and, build on strong market incentives for on-line and other firms to empower parents tocontrol the material their families receive. We urge all conferees to examine carefully the marketplace solutions that are available today or will be in the very near future before rushing headlong into regulating this nascent industry.  Software that blocks out obscene and indecent content is already available and is rapidly being improved.  It is offered to subscribers at no additional cost by companies such as America Online, Inc.  An industry consortium working with MIT will soon make available standard protocols that will permit individuals and third parties to screen and filter out any objectionable content on the Internet.  While we are all still discovering the true potential of the Internet and on-line services, there can be little doubt that intrusive regulation is unnecessary and will have unintended effects.  We urge the conferees to give due weight to First Amendment concerns as they grapple with these important issues.  The fundamental issues implicated in this first attempt to regulate content in cyberspace are not new.  The same balancing of interests in free speech against interests in suppressing obscene or otherwise unprotected speech have long been debated for print media.  There is no good policy reason, nor any principled legal justification, for treating closed electronic media like on-line services any differently. Sincerely, Robert W.

In comments submitted to FBI Jan. 16, several telecom industry organizations, as well as Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), which filed jointly with Center for National Security Studies, said that FBI's foray into notice-and -comment process was woefully unsuccessful because Bureau had failed to provide adequate information. USTA said: "Companies need to know precisely what is involved in complying with the law. They cannot afford a lack of specificity which could result in inadvertent non-compliance." FBI last fall sought comments on implementing Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). In Oct. 16 Federal Register notice, FBI asked for comment on how much switching capacity industry should reserve for wiretapping of advanced digital telephony systems. however, terms FBI used in expressing its needs in terms of percentages of "engineered capacity" puzzled telecom industry then, and do so today. USTA said that basis FBI used for its proposal wasn't related to network design principles used in telecom industry and as result industry couldn't respond adequately to FBI's proposals. Commenters told FBI that agency is required by law to set out actual and maximum numbers of wiretaps that will be needed, as well as providing historical data to back up requirements. FBI has complied with neither, commenters said. USTA noted that requirements for wiretaps, pen registers and trap-and-trace devices must be provided on a switch-by-switch basis so that engineers can design into each switch number of intercepts that would be needed. for that number to be accurate, historical information is needed, commenters said. USTA argued that FBI's Oct. 16 proposals "bear no rational relationship to past law enforcement needs. Some member companies report that the proposed percentage capacity requirement would require setting aside for law enforcement purposes several times the historic electronic surveillance needs." NTCA said FBI proposal could put unfair burden on small telcos. CDT said that Bureau promised to make available historical data, but hasn't yet done so. Agency must make public basis for its request before law can be implemented, CDT said, adding that data are necessary for public accountability. Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) said that FBI had promised to make available records of its meetings with industry to help clear up questions and to provide information on standard being developed with Bellcore for electronic surveillance. Neither of those has been published, TIA said, and FBI should consider making separate requirements for each type of wiretap it needs, with capacity for each. Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) said FBI proposal didn't adequately define responsibilities for existing wireless services, such as cellular networks, or emerging services such as PCS, and hadn't responded to CTIA requests for clarification.

Enactment of legislation to protect children from being exposed to pornography on the Internet Pornography, both soft core and hard core, is freely available on the Internet to virtually anyone with a home computer. Several magazines post pornographic images that can be viewed by anyone, including children, for free. There are also numerous sites on the Internet where hard core pornography depicting a variety of explicit acts, even rape scenes and bestiality, are available free and can be accessed with a few clicks of a computer button. Christian Coalition urges Congress to enact legislation to protect children from being exposed to pornography on the Internet. Criminal law should be amended to prohibit distribution of, or making available, any pornography,, soft core or hard, to children, and to prohibit distribution of obscene hard core pornography to adults. 2. Enactment of legislation to require cable television companies to completely block the video and audio on pornography channels to non-subscribers. Many children throughout the country are exposed to pornography, often hard core, on cable television because of incomplete scrambling of the signal on pornography channels. Cable companies have asserted that it is the parents' responsibility to guard their children. Christian Coalition believes that the responsibility should be on the cable companies to help parents keep pornography out of their homes. Cable companies should not be allowed to transmit pornography to non-subscribers. We urge Congress to require cable television companies to completely block the video and audio on pornography channels to non-subscribers. 3. Amending the federal child pornography law to make illegal the possession of any child pornography Sexual exploitation of children though child pornography continues to be a major problem in society. Possession of child pornography should be a crime. President Reagan proposed such a law in 1988, hoping that those with collections of child pornography would destroy them for fear of federal prosecution. In an 11th hour compromise on the bill, however, a conference committee of House and Senate members changed the Reagan bill to criminalize only the possession of "three or more" items of child pornography, videos, magazines, etc. Thus, federal low sanctions the possession of some child pornography -- less than three pieces. A person with two hour-long videotapes depicting the rape of a child cannot be charged with a federal crime, yet a person with three photos depicting a child in a lascivious pose can. Christian Coalition urges that the federal child pornography law should be amended to make illegal possession of any child pornography.

Last year, the magazine PC Computing published an April Fool's parody saying that I had introduced a bill, number 040194-- for April 1, 1994---to ban drinking on the Information Superhighway. According to the article, the imagined bill would prohibit anyone from using a public computer network while intoxicated. The article also noted that a rider was added onto this imagined bill to make "it a felony to discuss sexual matters on any public-access network, including the Internet, American Online, and CompuServe." Senators were chided for thinking there is a physical highway and that a permit was required to "drive" a modem on the Information Highway. The article noted that complaints about the imagined bill are "getting nowhere" because "Who wants to come out and support drunkenness and computer sex?" The parody concludes on a gloomy note, with the following words: "there is nothing to stop this bill from becoming law. You can register your protests with your congressperson or Mr. Lirpa Sloof in the Senate Legislative Analysts Office. Her name spelled backward says it all." The name spelled backwards is "April Fools." But many readers could not spell backwards, and thought this was a real article. Unfortunately for my staff, many of those readers called my office outraged at the intrusiveness of the bill. Unfortunately for all Internet users, the debate taking place in the telecommunications conference about imposing far-reaching new federal crimes for indecent speech over the Internet is not a parody but very real. The Telecommunications Conference has been meeting over the past few weeks with the enormous task of changing our communications laws to allow new competition among phone companies, broadcasters, cable operators and the wireless systems while also protecting universal service and other appropriate consumer protections. You would think they would have their hands full with just that task. Yet, they are also looking at new federal crimes, despite the absence of any Senate Judiciary Committee Members on the conference. As part of the telecommunications bill, the Senate passed the Exon-Coats "Communication Decency Act," which would punish with two-year jail terms any Internet user who posted a message with indecent language or used a four-letter word in a message to a minor. Service providers would also risk criminal language, unless the provider adheres to a federally-mandated blocking technology. The Christian Coalition has complained that these provisions do not go far enough, and is urging the conferees to make the proposed crimes even tougher. We should not underestimate the effect that the heavy-hand of government regulation will have on the future growth of the Internet. The legislation has not even passed and we are seeing that just the threat of it is already having a chilling effect on the Internet. Last week, a Vermonter from Underhill, Vermont found that her personal profile on America Online had been deleted because she used vulgar words. In fact, she used AOL to communicate with other breast cancer survivors. what was the vulgar word she had used? BREAST. After many angry complaints, AOL apologized and again allowed the word to be used by its subscribers when "appropriate." One wonders if, in the future, recipes for Chicken Cacciatore sent online will only call for dark meat to avoid using the dreaded "B-" word. I understand that proposals are being made to the telecommunications conference that would impose even more draconian restrictions for online speech than those passed in the Exon-Coats "Communications Decency Act." Make no mistake, we already have crimes on the books that apply to the Internet, by banning obscenity, child pornography, and threats from being distributed over computers. Unlike these current laws, which do not regulate constitutionally protected speech, certain proposals being considered by the telecommunications conference do. One proposal would impose criminal penalties on anyone who transmits indecency--which is protected by the First Amendment--on the Internet. While the proponents of the proposals claim that they do not "ban" indecency--only prohibit making it available to minors--the practical result of such a restriction on the Internet is the complete criminalization of all indecent speech. Because indecency means very different things to different people, an unimaginable amount of valuable political, artistic, scientific and other speech will disappear in this new medium. What about, for example, the university health service that posts information online about birth control and protections against the spread of AIDS? With many students in college under 18, this information would likely disappear under threat of prosecution. In bookstores and on library shelves the protection of indecent speech is clear, and the courts are unwavering. Why are some of our colleagues trying to alter the protection of the Fist Amendment here and cripple this new mode of communication? In addition to effectively banning indecent speech, the conference is considering proposals to impose criminal liability on both the "speakers" of indecent content as well as online service providers. The result would be to draft the service providers into the role of "Net police." Service providers like America Online and Prodigy, telephone companies providing modem connections, and libraries and schools hooking our nation's children up to this brilliant new medium would face the risk of being fined and even jailed. To avoid liability, service providers, libraries and schools would bear the onus of asserting complicated defenses to prosecution. The implications of being hauled into court in the first place--especially for schools and libraries--should not go unnoticed. Many providers will seek to avoid the risk of litigation altogether by censoring all online speech to that appropriate for Kindergarten children, or refusing to serve children at all. These extreme proposals on the table in the telecommunications conference would leave online communications in a severely disadvantaged position in our society. While Newsweek magazine's recent cover story trumpeted the vision of the computer mogul Bill Gates, the U.S. Congress is simultaneously poised to shut down this new medium and vastly change the landscape of the "information age." We must stop being paternalistic luddites and embrace our new communications potential. I understand that Representative White will make an alternative proposal to the telecommunications conference tomorrow. His proposal avoids regulating constitutionally protected speech, and limits any regulation to materials "harmful to minors." This is a bit of a step in the right direction, but still leaves Internet users guessing at what may be considered harmful to minors in different areas of this diverse country. The Internet and other computer networks hold enormous promise for enhancing our lives in ways that would have been unthinkable only a brief decade ago. But the growth of this network will no doubt be chilled if users fear that they risk criminal liability by using particular words that might, in some jurisdictions, be considered indecent. Or, if service providers simply refuse to provide Internet access to children under 18 years of age, due to the risk of criminal liability. I have written, along with several other Members, to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee urging the conferees to appreciate the implications that these proposals will have for the Internet. They should not rush consideration of these weighty issues. This is a great new communications medium and the conference should deliberate carefully before it gives its blessing to new crimes, for saying things that some people, some where in this country, may deem to be indecent for children. We should all be concerned lest the parody becomes a reality.

Worthley Unit Chief Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit (TILU) Federal Bureau of Investigation 14800 Conference Center Drive, Suite 300 Chantilly, VA 22021 January 16, 1996 Re: Comments on CALEA Capacity Notice, 60 Fed. Reg. 53643 (Oct. 16, 1995) Dear Mr. Worthley: We hereby submit the following comments in response to the referenced notice. I. Overview The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, Public Law 103-414) granted the FBI an unprecedented new role in the design of our Nation's telecommunications networks to accommodate electronic surveillance. In order to protect against abuse, and in order to ensure that the privacy and security of the networks are not compromised, Congress balanced this authority with a detailed public process to ensure oversight and accountability. The FBI's October 16, 1995 Notice of Proposed Surveillance Capacity Requirements fails to meet the public oversight and accountability requirements of the statute. We urge the FBI to issue a revised notice to include essential information necessary to comply with the public accountability requirements of CALEA and allow interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's proposal. A basic question posed by the FBI's October 1995 notice is whether the amount of capacity being proposed is justified in terms of law enforcement's projected needs. So far, given the ambiguities in the proposal and the FBI's failure to disclose its supporting data, it is impossible to answer that question -- it is impossible to say whether or not the capacity requirements proposed in the notice are justified. Therefore, we must conclude that the FBI's notice is deficient. The FBI has not yet made available to the public the information necessary for substantive comment on this capacity proposal. Although the Bureau indicated that such information would be publicly available in advance of the January 16, 1996 comments deadline, the FBI has yet not disclosed: The factual basis for its proposal, consisting of the historical baseline of surveillance activity, and projections therefrom; Certain details of the proposal that CALEA itself requires to be published, namely, the actual number of expected future surveillances and the geographic locations affected; nor, The definition of a key term, "engineered capacity." The FBI must make public the basis for, and the details of, its request, as Congress intended, before implementation of CALEA can proceed. No funds should be appropriated for compliance, nor should carriers be obligated to build increased capacity, until: The government has disclosed full information about its proposal; and, Interested parties have been afforded a meaningful opportunity to assess the reasonableness of the capacity proposal. A notice of capacity requirements without the above information does not conform to the statute as Congress intended, nor does it well serve the goal of ensuring public confidence in law enforcement surveillance practices. II. Public Oversight and Accountability Are a Central Element of CALEA  CALEA is a carefully crafted statute, intended to balance the needs of law enforcement with public concerns over privacy and security of the nation's telephone system, while not impeding innovation 2. This process was intended to allow privacy advocates and other concerned individuals to have a substantive voice in the compliance process. The public accountability provisions of CALEA are essential to ensuring that law enforcement and the industry do not take actions that expand surveillance authority or jeopardize the privacy and security of communications not authorized to be intercepted. As Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), co-author of CALEA, emphasized during the August 11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing: "To allay public concern over the breadth of wiretapping in America, the entire [compliance] process remains subject to public scrutiny, oversight, and accountability. This bill accomplishes this by requiring any standards or technical requirements that industry adopts to ensure wiretap capability be publicly available." (S. HRG. 103-1022, page 111) Public accountability is so important to the legislative scheme embodied in CALEA because the statute granted law enforcement a substantial, unprecedented role in the design of new telecommunications systems, equipment and features. Under CALEA, for the first time ever, telephone companies were required to ensure that their systems satisfied certain law enforcement requirements. While the development of solutions to maintain traditional interception capabilities was left to industry, it was expected that there would be close consultation between law enforcement and the telecommunications carriers and their suppliers to determine compliance with the requirements. CALEA also requires the companies to ensure that their systems have a certain capacity to accommodate simultaneous law enforcement interception requests (CALEA, Section 104 (a)(1)(A). 3. In terms of capacity, the statute requires even greater specificity on the part of law enforcement to specify precisely what its capacity needs are 4. III. The FBI's Notice Does Not Satisfy the Public Accountability Objectives of CALEA A fundamental principle of CALEA was that it would merely preserve -- and not expand -- traditional law enforcement surveillance capabilities as they existed before the introduction of digital telephony and other advanced features 5. CALEA requirements were to be based on past levels of surveillance and projections from those levels. The Deputy Attorney General has recently reconfirmed that the government intends CALEA to produce no increase in surveillance activity. Accordingly, the first step in implementation of the law is to determine the past and current needs of law enforcement, as a basis for projecting future needs. The FBI clearly has accepted this proposition, for its notice states that the proposed capacity requirements are based on a "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity," derived from reports from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement agencies, and other government entities. This data has never been collected before. In the view of the FBI, it provided the starting point for determining what law enforcement's future needs would be. Likewise, this baseline data provides a critical basis for the public to evaluate the proposed requirements. Yet the notice does not disclose either the baseline data or the projections from it. A full exposition of the factual basis for the proposed capacity requirements is necessary to implement another component of accountability in CALEA: government reimbursement of capacity costs. While CALEA authorized funds for implementation, Congress required the FBI to seek yearly appropriations of those funds. That process allows Congress to have an on-going role in CALEA implementation. Congress, with public participation, must determine if law enforcement's requests are reasonable, and provide funds accordingly. The appropriations process also: ensures that the public is aware of the actual costs of government surveillance capacity; and, offers another opportunity for interested parties to challenge law enforcement's surveillance capacity requests. This process will be hampered if the public does not have available the factual information and details making clear what the proposal means. IV. The FBI's Notice Does Not Satisfy the Express Requirements of CALEA Under CALEA, the FBI is required to determine capacity requirements through a notice and comment procedure (Section 104 (a)). Congress was very specific in requiring how that process should be conducted 6. Congress required the FBI to consult with state and local law enforcement agencies. The FBI has done this. Congress required the FBI to consult with telecommunications carriers, providers of support services, and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment. The FBI is doing this. But there are two further requirements that the FBI is not complying with. Congress required the FBI to set forth in its notice "the actual number of communications interceptions, pen registers and trap and trace devices . . . that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies . . . may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years after the dateof enactment." (CALEA, Section 104(a)(1)(B)). The notice does not include these projected numbers. Congress also required that the notice "identify, to the maximum extent possible, the capacity required at specific geographic locations, including carrier office locations." (CALEA, Section 104 (a)(2)(B)). Again, the notice does not include this statutorily-mandated information. Private Negotiations With Individual Carriers Cannot Substitute for the Explicit Requirements of CALEA. The FBI's apparent intent to negotiate directly with individual carriers, as described in the October 16 Notice, is directly contrary to the intent of the CALEA and directly violates the public accountability requirements of the statute 7. The Notice is Ambiguous The notice also fails to clearly define a key term, "engineered capacity." A precise definition of this term is critical to enable the public to accurately assess the scope of the FBI's request. The notice itself defines "engineered capacity as the "maximum number of subscribers that can be served" by a particular switch or other facility. Subsequent to the issuance of the notice, the FBI has indicated informally that it actually intended "engineered capacity" to refer to the maximum number of subscribers that can be served "simultaneously" by a particular switch or system. Because the FBI has proposed to require carriers to reserve a portion of the "engineered capacity" of particular facilities and features for use by law enforcement, the precise definition of "engineered capacity" greatly influences the scope of the FBI's proposed surveillance capacity. This term must be clearly defined in order to allow interested parties to assess the FBI's request. V. Conclusion The October 16, 1995 Federal Register notice of proposed capacity requirements does not contain critical information necessary for interested parties to assess the reasonableness of the proposal: The notice does not disclose the historical baseline data that provide a crucial predicate to the proposal. The notice does not describe how the proposed capacity levels correspond to historical surveillance activity. It is clear that the FBI made some projection from past activity, but, lacking the historical baseline and the methodology for extrapolation to the future, there is no way to determine whether the projection is reasonable. The notice does not specify the "actual number "of expected future intercepts, as required by the statute. The notice does not designate the geographic areas to which the capacity requirements apply, again in contravention of CALEA's requirements. The notice does not clearly define a key term, "engineered capacity." For these reasons, we believe that the proposed notice does not conform to the statutory requirements of CALEA. We recommend that the FBI issue a revised notice with the requested additions, or issue a supplemental notice. Until the FBI complies with the public accountability provisions of the statute and provides interested parties with the information necessary to assess the reasonableness of the FBI's capacity request, Congress should not authorize any funding to cover capacity modifications and telecommunications carriers should not be obligated to comply with the proposed capacity requirements. Sincerely, /sig/ Jerry Berman Executive Director Center for Democracy and Technology /sig/ James X. Dempsey Deputy Director Center for National Security Studies January 16, 1996 Footnotes 1. This point is detailed in the legislative history of CALEA: "Therefore, the bill seeks to balance three key policies: (1) to preserve a narrowly focused capability for law enforcement agencies to carry out properly authorized intercepts; (2) to protect privacy in the face of increasingly powerful and personally revealing technologies; and (3) to avoid impeding the development of new communications services and technologies". House Comm. on the Judiciary, Report to Accompany HR 4922, H.R. Doc. No. 827, 103d Cong., 2nd Sess. 13 (1994). 2. Congress detailed the public accountability provisions of CALEA in the Judiciary Committee Report: "Finally, the bill has a number of mechanisms that will allow for Congressional and public oversight. The bill requires that the government estimate its capacity needs and publish them in the Federal Register. The bill requires the government, with funds appropriated by Congress in the normal appropriations process, to pay all reasonable costs incurred by industry in retrofitting facilities to correct existing problems. It requires the Attorney General to file yearly reports on these expenditures for the first six years after date of enactment, and requires reports from the General Accounting Office in 1996 and 1998 estimating future costs of compliance. It requires that the government to reimburse carriers, with publicly appropriated funds, in perpetuity for the costs of expanding capacity to meet law enforcement needs. Furthermore, all proceedings before the FCC will be subject to public scrutiny, as well as Congressional oversight and judicial review." Id. at 19 - 20. 3 The Attorney General, within 1 year from the date of enactment, must publish in the Federal Register "notice of the actual number of communications interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices" that government agencies will conduct 4 years from the date of enactment. CALEA, Section 104 (a)(1)(A) 4 FBI Director Louis Freeh emphasized this point during an August 11, 1994 joint House/Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on CALEA: " Because telecommunications industry representatives have expressed a concern that administration's proposal did not specifically address the capacities requirements that would be placed on each carrier, we developed, and this legislation includes, provisions which clearly place the affirmative responsibility on the Attorney General to advise carriers of law enforcement's specific capacity requirements within the first year after enactment of the legislation. These provisions will furnish carriers both with our short-term needs and our longer range capacity requirements such that the required capacity will not be needlessly undersized or oversized." Digital Telephony and Law Enforcement Access to Advanced Telecommunications Technologies and Services: Joint Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Technology and the Law of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary ,103d Cong., 2nd Sess. 116 (1994) 5 From the Committee Report on CALEA: "The FBI Director testified that the legislation was intended to preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in the past. The Committee urges against overbroad interpretation of the requirements." (ibid., page 22). 6 "The Attorney General is given flexibility in determining the form of the notice. For example, the notices may be in the form of a specific number for a particular geographic area, or generally applicable formula based on the number of subscribers served by a carrier. However, the notices must identify, to the maximum extent possible, the capacity required at specific geographic locations, including carrier office locations. (emphasis added)" (ibid., page 25) 7 Section 104 of the statute requires the Attorney General to publish law enforcement's capacity requirements in the Federal Register. Nowhere in this section is the FBI authorized to publish those requirements and then negotiate separate compliance arrangements with individual companies.

Click here to skip to the sections about the Communications Decency Act.  				        Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy        on Passage of        Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act        Conference Report        February 1, 1996          Mr. LEAHY.  Mr. President, I thank my good friend from South     Carolina, a man whom I have been privileged to serve with in my whole     Senate career.  He was already a senior Member of the Senate when I     came here.  I appreciate all the help he has given me.  I appreciate     the fact that he and the chairman were able to protect the     Breaux-Leahy amendment on 1-plus dialing parity as part of the     conference report to permit intraLATA toll dialing parity requirements     to stand in States that already ordered it by December 19, 1995, and     in single-LATA States like Vermont.  Preserving this amendment, which     Senator Breaux and I worked out on this floor, has helped my State.          There are so many things I like about this bill. For example, the     conference agreement places restrictions on buyouts between phone     companies and cable. The conference agreement also includes a very     strong savings clause to make clear that mergers between companies in     the media and communications markets are subject to a thorough     antitrust review.        Competition, not concentration, is the surest way to assure lower     prices and greater choices for consumers. So, while there are some     improvements in this legislation that I support, I will not be voting     in favor.          I have expressed my concern on the lack of a stronger Department     of Justice role in evaluating the anticompetitive effect of a Bell     Operating Company's entry into the long-distance market, as well as my     concern that this legislation is placing censorship restrictions on     the Internet.  As a user of the Internet and as one who communicates     electronically with constituents and others around the country, I am     concerned this legislation places restrictions on the Internet that     will come back to haunt us.          I know these provisions were done with the best of intentions.     All of us, 100 Members of the United States Senate, oppose the idea of     child pornography.  All of us abhor child pornographers and child     abusers.  I am one person who has prosecuted, convicted, and sent to     prison child abusers.  We do not have to demonstrate our adherence to     that principle.  But I am concerned we have not upheld our adherence     to the First Amendment with the proposed restrictions on the Internet.      That creates an overwhelming barrier for me.          I am also concerned that after passing the 1992 Cable Act over a     Presidential veto, that we are now taking the lid off all cable rates     in 3 years, whether or not there is competition in cable service.     Before the 1992 Cable Act was passed, cable rates were rising three     times faster than inflation rates.  I do not think you can name a     consumer in this country who did not feel that he or she was being     gouged.        But the law worked.  Since passage of the law, consumers have saved     an estimated $3.5 billion in their monthly bills.  And, as the rates     have gone down, more people have signed up.  In 1994 alone, nearly 2.5     million new customers have signed up for cable service.        I do not want to see a repeat of the skyrocketing cable rates that     prompted passage of that law.  It is too easy to see what might happen     if the cable companies are not restrained, either by competition or by     laws.          I do not have cable in my home in Vermont.  I live out in the     country where we get 1  channels. I think sometimes I am blessed by     that because I actually get to read, which is a good way of obtaining     the news.  You can make up your own mind.  You can read in detail or     not, and not be limited by the photographs selected by     multimillion-dollar news media.          But I digress.        With the cable company I subscribe to here, you get these $2 remote     controls but they charge you $3 a month, or something like that.  They     can give you antiquated equipment and charge as though you were     getting good equipment and even make it impossible to watch one show     and tape another one.  All the things that sound great are not     available because there is no competition.  We are about to make that     even worse.  We had some restrictions in the cable bill, but I am     afraid we are going to let them go before we have the protections     provided by effective competition.          I must admit, having said all that, I do not envy the managers of     this bill.  This is probably the most complex piece of legislation I     think I have seen in 21 years.  It has probably had more conflicting     interests that had to be reconciled than I have seen in 21 years.          I commend the Senators who had the ability to stick it out and     bring it this far.  Senators still have to determine whether they will     vote for or it or not, but whether you like or dislike different     parts, we can all appreciate the hard work and long hours it took.        The telecommunications legislation that has emerged from the     conference will have an enormous impact on multi-billion dollar cable,     phone and broadcast industries and, most importantly, on the American     consumer. This legislation will affect how much we pay and from whom     we can obtain cable, TV, phone, fax, and information services. It will     also, unfortunately, affect what we can say online.        We have heard a lot about the support for this legislation by the     Bell phone companies, AT&T and other long-distance phone companies,     the giant cable companies and other media interests. But while they     have been arguing over business advantages, who have been advocates     for American consumers and fundamental American values, like First     Amendment free speech rights?        Most of us have no choice who gives us cable TV service or our     local phone service.  Whether or not the service is good, we're stuck     with our local phone or cable company. And, if the price is too high,     our only choice is to drop the service altogether. The goal of this     telecommunications legislation must be to foster competition, not just     for the short term, but over the long haul. Competition will give     consumers lower prices and more choices than simply dropping a     service.        I raised a number of questions about the Senate-passed bill, and     fought for several amendments that in my view would have made the bill     more consumer-friendly, pro-competitive and constitutional.  I commend     the conferees for the progress they made in several of these areas,     which I detail below.        First, the bill proposed by the Commerce Committee would have     permitted our local phone monopoly to buy out our local cable monopoly     so that consumers have even less choice rather than more. Senator     Thurmond, the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's     Antitrust Subcommittee, and I raised concerns that allowing such     unlimited buyouts between monopoly phone companies and cable companies     could result in giant monopolies providing both phone and video     programming services.        The conference agreement makes a significant improvement in these     provisions by limiting buy-outs between cable and phone companies to     rural areas where fewer than 35,000 people live.  The conference     agreement also limits a phone company's purchase of cable systems to     less than ten percent of the households in its service area. This will     insure that a single large phone company cannot simply buy up all the     small cable systems serving the small towns in its service area. This     part of the conference agreement helps fulfill the promise of the bill     to maximize competition between local phone companies and cable     companies.         The conference agreement also contains a very strong "savings     clause" to make clear that mergers between cable and telephone     companies, or between independent telephone companies or between any     companies in the media and communications markets are subject to a     thorough antitrust review under the normal Hart-Scott-Rodino process.     Nothing in this conference agreement even impliedly preempts our     Federal antitrust laws. Mega-mergers between telecommunications     giants, such as the rumored merger between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, or     the gigantic network mergers now underway, raise obvious concerns     about concentrating control in a few gigantic companies of both the     content and means of distributing the information and entertainment     American consumers receive.  Competition, not concentration, is the     surest way to assure lower prices and greater choices for consumers.     Rigorous oversight and enforcement by our antitrust agencies is more     important than ever to insure that such mega-mergers do not harm     consumers.        I have been particularly concerned about how well the     telecommunications legislation protects universal service. Vermont is     among the most rural States in the country, but those of us who live     there do not want to be denied access to the advanced     telecommunications services our urban neighbors enjoy.     I, therefore, commend the conference report for including the     Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-Kerry provision requiring preferential rates     for telecommunications services provided to schools, libraries and     hospitals in rural areas, which I supported. This requirement provides     an important building block to ensure universal access to advanced     telecommunications services. Students whose families cannot afford     sophisticated hi-tech services at home will be able to use those     services at school or at their neighborhood public library. Rural     hospitals will be able to use advanced technology to provide better     treatment at lower costs to their patients. This provision assures the     broadest possible access to advanced telecommunications services.        I am also pleased to see that the conference report includes the     addition of a State-appointed consumer advocate to the newly created     Federal-State Joint Board. This board will have the critical task of     preserving and expanding universal service, and I agree with the     conference that a consumer advocate will bring a necessary and     important perspective to that task.        The conference agreement also adopts a provision designed to make     cable equipment cheaper and easier to use for all consumers, who are     tired of paying rent for cable converter boxes and struggling with     multiple clickers for the TV, set-top box and their video machines.     This provision is one that Senator Thurmond and I urged to be included     as part of the telecommunications legislation in the last Congress.     Under the conference agreement, the FCC is directed to assure the     competitive availability to consumers of converter boxes and other     electronic equipment used to access cable video programming services.        As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I remain ready to address     the copyright issues that will arise as a result of this legislation.     There was no consideration of copyright matters during the debate over     this legislation and I commend the conferees for not prejudging these     matters.        The bill proposed by the Commerce Committee would have     unnecessarily preempted State efforts to promote the development of     competition in local phone service. Richard Cowart, the Chairman of     the Vermont Public Service Board, provided invaluable testimony to the     Antitrust Subcommittee last year about the detrimental preemption     provisions in the bill.        For example, this bill rolled-back State requirements to implement     "1+" dialing parity for short-haul toll calls. A number of States     already require dialing parity. Without "1+" dialing parity, consumers     must dial lengthy access codes to use carriers other than the local     phone company for in-state toll calls. IntraLATA "1+" dialing parity     encourages competition in the in-state toll market and helps     consumers.         As I noted before, I am pleased that the Breaux-Leahy amendment on     "1+" dialing parity is part of the conference report.  The report     permits dialing parity requirements to stand in the States that     already ordered it by December 19, 1995, and in single-LATA States,     including Vermont.  The prohibition against "1+" dialing parity for     intraLATA calls in "non-grandfathered" States expires at a date     certain three years after enactment.        In addition, the Commerce Committee bill would have prohibited     State regulators from using rate-of-return regulation for large phone     companies.  As Chairman Cowart of the Vermont Public Service Board     made clear when he testified, this prohibition would have tied the     hands of State regulators trying to adopt different forms of pricing     regulation to stimulate local phone service competition. The     conference agreement took a constructive step by dropping the     prohibition on rate-of-return regulation. On the Exon CDA sections         Despite this significant progress, the conference agreement still     suffers from such serious flaws that I cannot support it.        First, and foremost, the conference agreement contains     unconstitutional provisions that would impose far-reaching new federal     crimes for so-called "indecent" speech. I do not often agree with     Speaker Gingrich, but I share his view that this legislation violates     free speech rights.        Apparently, the conferees also have serious doubts about its     constitutionality. They added a section to speed up judicial review to     see if the legislation passes constitutional muster. In my view, this     legislation will not pass that test.          You would think the telecommunications conference would have     their hands full with just the task of changing our     communications laws to allow new competition among phone     companies, broadcasters, cable operators and wireless systems     while also protecting universal service and other appropriate     consumer protections. Yet, they also decided to add new federal     crimes, despite the absence of any hearings on these provisions,  or     any Senate Judiciary Committee members on the conference. I called for     an in-depth, fast-track study of these issues before we took     precipitous action in legislation. That study was included in the     House-passed bill but dropped by the conference, in favor of     provisions that will ban constitutionally protected speech on the     Internet.        I note that the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Conference     Report refers to a July 24, 1995 hearing, at which I participated,     before the Senate Judiciary Committee on "online indecency, obscenity     and child endangerment." This hearing did not address the     constitutionality of the indecency standard adopted by the Conference     Report, nor the least restrictive means by which to implement such a     standard, particularly in an electronic environment like the Internet.     The hearing referred to in the statement of the Conference Committee     dealt with stalking, obscenity and indecency with regard to an     entirely different bill, S. 892.  No witnesses at the hearing defended     the constitutionality of the indecency standard in the     telecommunications bill.  Nor did any witness testifying in support of     S. 892 examine in detail whether the indecency standard as applied to     online communications complies with the least restrictive means test.     On the contrary, several witnesses questioned whether any indecency     standard could be constitutional as applied to online communications.     Thus, Congress has opted to appear "tough on pornography" without     examining the constitutional implications of this unprecedented     restriction on freedom of expression.        Let us make no mistake about what these provisions in the     conference agreement will do and how it could affect you.        o  The bill will make it a felony crime to send a private e-mail     message with an indecent or filthy word that you hope will annoy     another person, even if you were responding in kind to an e-mail     message you received. Who knows when you might annoy another person     with your e-mail message? To avoid liability under this legislation,     users of e-mail will have to ban curse words and other expressions     that might be characterized as offensive  from their online     vocabulary.        o  The bill will punish with two-year jail terms any Internet user     who uses one of the "seven dirty words" in a message to a minor. You     will risk criminal liability by using a computer to share with a child     any material containing "indecent" passages. In some areas of the     country, a copy of Seventeen magazine, could be viewed as indecent     because it contains information on sex and sexuality. Indeed, this     magazine is among the 10 most frequently challenged school library     materials in the country.        This legislation sweeps more broadly than just regulating e-mail     messages sent to children.  It will impose felony penalties for using     an indecent four-letter word, or discussing material deemed to be     indecent, on electronic bulletin boards or Internet chat areas     accessible to children.        Once this bill becomes law, no longer will Internet users be able     to engage in free-wheeling discussions in news groups and other areas     on the Internet accessible to minors. They will have to limit all     language used and topics discussed to that appropriate for     kindergartners, just in case a minor clicks onto the discussion. No     literary quotes from racy parts of Catcher in the Rye or Ulysses will     be allowed. Certainly online discussions of safe sex practices, of     birth control methods, and of AIDS prevention methods will be suspect.     Any user who crosses the vague and undefined line of "indecency" will     be subject to two years in jail and fines.        Imagine if the Whitney Museum, which currently operates a Web page,     were dragged into court for permitting representations of     Michelangelo's David to be looked by kids.        The conferees call this a "display" prohibition and explain that it     "applies to content providers who post indecent material for online     display without taking precautions that shield that material from     minors."        What precautions are the conferees talking about?  What precautions     will Internet users have to take to avoid criminal liability? These     users, after all, are the ones who provide the "content" read in news     groups and on electronic bulletin boards. The legislation gives the     FCC authority to describe the precautions that can be taken to avoid     criminal liability.     The legislation gives the FCC authority to describe the precautions     that can be taken to avoid criminal liability. All Internet users will     have to wait and look to the FCC for what they must do to protect     themselves from criminal liability.        We have already seen the chilling effect that even the prospect of     this legislation has had on online service providers. A few weeks ago,     America Online deleted the profile of a Vermonter who communicated     with fellow breast cancer survivors online. Why? Because, according to     AOL, she used the "vulgar" word "breast".  AOL later apologized and     indicated it would permit the use of that word where "appropriate."        Complaints by German prosecutors prompted another online service     provider to cut off subscriber access to over 200 Internet news groups     with the words "sex", "gay" or "erotica" in the name. They censored     such groups as "clarinet.news.gays," which is an online newspaper     focused on gay issues, and "gay-net.coming-out", which is a support     group for gay men and women dealing with going public with their     sexual orientation.        What is next? The Washington Post reports today that one software     program used to protect children from offensive material blocked the     White House home page because it showed pictures of two couples     together. Those two couples happened to be the President and Mrs.     Clinton and the Vice-President and Mrs. Gore. Will federal government     censors do any better when they dictate blocking technologies?        The Communications Decency Act is the United States government's     answer to the problem that China is dealing with by creating an     "intranet". According to news reports, this censored version of the     Internet allows Chinese users online access to each other, but an     official censor controls all outside access to the world-wide     Internet.        We already have crimes on the books that apply to the Internet, by     banning obscenity, child pornography, and threats from being     distributed over computers. In fact, just before Christmas, the     President signed a new law we passed last year sharply increasing     penalties for child pornography and sexual exploitation crimes.        Unlike these current laws, which do not regulate constitutionally     protected speech, this legislation would censor indecent speech. While     the proponents of the proposals claim that they do not "ban" indecency     -- only prohibit making it available to minors -- the practical result     of such a restriction on the Internet is the criminalization of all     indecent speech.          Because indecency means very different things to different     people, an unimaginable amount of valuable political, artistic,     scientific and other speech will disappear in this new medium.     What about, for example, the university health service that posts     information online about birth control and protections against     the spread of AIDS?  With many students in college under 18, this     information would likely disappear under threat of prosecution.     In bookstores and on library shelves the protection of indecent     speech is clear, and the courts are unwavering. Altering the     protections of the First Amendment for online communications could     cripple this new mode of communication.        The Internet is a great new communications medium. We should not     underestimate the effect that the heavy-hand of government regulation     will have on its future growth both here and abroad. With the passage     of this bill the U.S. Government is paving the way for the censorship     of Internet speech. Apparently, China already censors weather     predictions from foreigners. What do we think the Iranian government     will make illegal? What could Libya ban and criminalize?        Also, as I alluded earlier, I continue to have grave concerns about     letting the Bell Operating Companies, with their monopoly control over     the phone wires going into our homes, enter the long-distance market     even when the Department of Justice finds an anticompetitive impact. I     supported efforts to amend the bill and give the Justice Department     the authority to review the Bell Companies' long-distance entry in     advance.  These efforts were unsuccessful.        The conference report requires the FCC to consult with the Justice     Department and "give substantial weight" to the Justice Department's     opinion, in determining whether to permit entry of a Bell company into     long-distance service. Although this provision strengthens the     Senate-passed bill, it does not go far enough.  It fails to achieve     the balance proposed by the Commerce Committee in 1994. In the end,     the FCC is the final decision maker and can decide to disregard the     Justice Department's evaluation of the anticompetitive effect of     letting the Bell Companies offer long-distance service.        The conference agreement would permit a Bell Company to offer long     distance service in its own region, upon approval by the FCC and after     satisfying an "in-region" checklist. This checklist could be satisfied     by the presence of a competitor with its own networking facilities.     Despite recognition by the conferees that building local telephone     network facilities will require a significant investment in time and     money, the bill allows only 10 months after enactment for     facilities-based competitors to get established and apply for     interconnection and access to the Bell Company's network. Absent a     facilities-based competitor in those 10 months, I fear that the     language of this bill could be interpreted broadly to allow the Bell     Operating Company to seek approval to enter long-distance service, and     authorize the FCC to grant that approval, even without any actual     competition in local phone service. The short time-frame provided in     the bill to establish a facilities-based competitor, compounded by the     lack of a dispositive Justice Department role in the approval process,     could provide the incumbent Bell Company with the ability to use its     stranglehold monopoly on local service to leverage its new     long-distance service, to the detriment of consumers. Regulators will     have to be vigilant to this potential consequence.        As I noted, the conference agreement takes the lid off all cable     rates in three years, whether or not there is any competition in cable     service.        We passed the 1992 Cable Act over a Presidential veto because     consumers were being gouged by cable company monopolists.  Cable rates     were rising three times faster than the inflation rate.  Consumers     demanded action to stop the rising cable rates. This law worked. Since     passage of that law, consumers have saved an estimated $3.5 billion in     their monthly rates.  As rates have gone down, more people have signed     up.        Congress has already responded once to complaints of cable     subscribers in the 1992 Cable Act.  I, for one, do not want to see a     repeat of the sky-rocketing cable rates that prompted passage of that     law. The conferees must be predicting that, in three years, cable     companies will face plenty of competition from satellite systems and     phone companies offering video services. But if their prediction is     accurate, and the cable companies faced effective competition, they     would be deregulated under the 1992 Cable Act anyway.  This is a     precipitous action to sunset a law that worked to reduce cable rates     on the hope that effective competition will grow over the next three     years.        Finally, the conference report requires the FCC to preempt State or     local rules that may have the effect of barring any entity from     providing telecommunications services. Although the report says this     is not supposed to affect local management of public rights-of-way or     local safeguards for the rights of consumers, in Vermont, citizens are     rightly concerned that rules designed to protect our environment and     health may be preempted by bureaucrats at the FCC who are focused on     helping entrants in the telecommunications business.        I recognize the need for an over-haul of our communications laws.     We have not kept up with the dramatic technological changes that are     fueling the Information Age. But I cannot support this bill, which     threatens fundamental constitutional rights of free speech over the     Internet and provides insufficient consumer protection from     monopolistic pricing for cable and telephone service.WT02-B07-121IA095-001027-B030-358http://www.cdt.org:80/policy/terrorism/Feinstein_s735_amdt.html 205.177.10.31 19970215005918 text/html 1928HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 00:58:03 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/html Feinstein S. 735 Amendment From the Congressional Record - June 5, 1995: FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 1209 (Senate - June 05, 1995) [Page: S7705] Mrs. FEINSTEIN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1199, proposed by Mr. Hatch, to the bill, S. 735, supra; as follows: At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the following new section: SEC.   .

The Center for Democracy and Technology strongly opposes the Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act for the following reasons: Unconstitutional ban on "indecent" material in most parts of the internet:  The Act imposes criminal penalties of $100,000 fines or up to two years in prison on anyone who "knowingly ... makes or makes available any indecent communications ... to any person under 18 years of age."  This restriction on indecency (a legal term which includes the "seven dirty words" as well as any sexually-explicit material) amounts to a total ban on all "indecent" information in public areas of the Internet, since all users of the Internet know that public areas are accessible to minors.  The United States Supreme Court has held over and over again that indecent material is protected by the First Amendment and may only be regulated with narrowly tailored means that leave adults free to communicate.  Senator Exon's bill has failed to identify Constitutionally-appropriate means of regulation.  As Senator Leahy pointed out during the Senate debate,  the Exon bill would force everyone on the Internet to behave as if there were in "Sunday school." Second-class free speech rights for all interactive media:  The Exon/Coats amendment diminishes the First Amendment rights of those who use interactive media as opposed to those who communicate through print.  The indecency ban in Exon/Coats creates the paradoxical result that speech which would be fully-protected in books, magazines, newspapers, or other print-based publications, would be subject to criminal sanction if made available over the Internet. In other words, what is legal in all of the nation's bookstores would become illegal in cyberspace.  Criminalization of "annoying" messages:  Annoying someone using harsh (but not obscene) language over interactive media would become a crime, also punishable by $100,000 fines and two year jail terms.  Federal and many state laws already criminalize harassment, no matter what the medium, but prohibiting mere annoyance is clearly unconstitutional and a wasteful abuse of federal power. Federal communications commission jurisdiction over content and technical standards on the internet:  Enforcement of the Exon/Coats bill will require extensive an ongoing FCC proceedings to determine what exactly constitutes "indecency" in various interactive media, and how the "safe harbor" defenses in the bill will function.  Such regulation will mean that the FCC intrude on the development of all current and future Internet standards for services such as the World Wide Web, electronic mail, and Usenet newsgroups.  CDT believes that such an FCC role will lead to unnecessary confusion and delay in the growth of the Internet, as well as cast a continual chill over all speech on the Internet and other interactive media. Provisions designed to protect online service providers from liability are ineffective: The "defenses" to prosecution that are intended to protect online services and Internet access providers from liability will create significant risk of criminal liability for all services that provide access to the Internet.  Though Senator Exon may originally promised to exempt these providers from liability, his last-minute compromise with Senator Coats, and failure to understand the basic operation of Internet services, left all  Internet access providers at risk of criminal liability for providing access to Usenet newsgroups and other public information services. "good faith defense" for service providers may encourage violations of user privacy:  Section (f)(4) of Act insulates online service providers from any contractual liability that may arise from their efforts to restrict minors' access to indecent material.  Because of the vaguaries of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act regarding service provider access to subscriber email for "system maintenance purposes," this provision may imunize online service providers who read private messages of their users in circumstances where the provider is acting within the bounds of the Exon/Coats bill. Undue burden on individual users, content providers, and small system operators:  Although Senator Exon claims that his bill is only an extension of the dial-a-porn law, it is actually far broader.  The dial-a-porn law applied only to commercial providers of 900 number services, not every telephone customer in the country.  Given the fact that every Internet user is both a publisher and a receiver of information, Exon's new law, if enacted, would create new regulations on the speech of all those who use interactive media. In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in statute a sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, one would not be able to access the identical information over the Internet.  Both the interactive media and the print media are arenas in which individuals and organizations exercise core First Amendment free speech rights.  Before Congress elects to diminish the First Amendment protections available in this new medium, we believe that careful, public consideration is required. A.	Unconstitutional Restrictions On Indecent Speech Online:  Banning The "Seven Dirty Words" On The Net. 	If this new proposal became law, the level of discourse on the Internet as a whole would have to be reduced to that which is considered appropriate for children.  A newly added section (e) effectively makes it illegal to use any of the "seven dirty word" in public forums on the Internet.  This new subsection makes in a crime to "knowingly" make and transmit an indecent message to anyone under 18 years old.  This provision covers both private messages between two individuals and public postings to newsgroups that may well reach hundreds of thousands of people around the world.  Though the drafters may want to limit this crime to situations where material is provided directly to minors, that is simply impossible on the net.  Anyone who participates in public discussion groups knows that there may well be kids reading the group as well.  Thus, they would be violating the law simply by posting a hotly-worded message. Examples of Prohibited items under the new subsection (e) Rap music lyrics (both the text and the sound files) Lady Chatterly's Lover Public declaration that you're "pissed off" or that someone is a "shit." Calvin Klein advertisements (the ones with naked bodies) 	The constitutional flaw in this section lies in the critical distinction between "obscenity," that which is truly hard-core pornography, and "indecency," sexually-explicit material which may be offensive to some or may be considered by some to be inappropriate for children, but which is protected by the First Amendment.  Under the First Amendment, Congress has broad power to ban obscenity, but can only regulate indecency in very narrow circumstances, such as in the broadcast media where there is a captive audience.  Pacifica Foundation v. FCC (1978) .  Even in these narrow circumstances, such regulation may be the "least intrusive means" for accomplishing the government's goal of protecting children.  Sable Communications v. FCC.  Given the existence of software and hardware that enable parents to block children's access to indecent material the regulation here does not constitute the "least restrictive means" requirement set out by the Supreme Court.  	CDT believes that the Act as drafted would not survive a First Amendment challenge under the law of Sable because the Senate has altogether failed to investigate less restrictive alternatives to meeting its goal of protecting children.  The Senate has held no hearings and made no legislative findings which support its decision.  During the debate on the Senate floor, both Senator Leahy and Senator Feingold offered evidence that there are less restrictive alternatives available.  Neither Senator Exon, Senator Coats, no any other Senator rebutted or responded to these assertions.  In light of the overwhelming evidence that users and parents can exercise control over what they and their children receive over the Internet, a court reviewing the constitutionality of the bill, would, we believe, be forced to return the matter to Congress for further consideration. 	Furthermore, the government may not regulation indecent material in a way that would deny adults access to such material.  Butler v. Michigan (1957).  This is precisely the result that is produced by this new statutory proposal.  Such as result would be both unwise and unconstitutional.  The highly restrictive treatment proposed here for interactive media creates a situation in the future whereby material that is legally available to people of all ages in bookshops and libraries will be banned from the Internet.  During the Senate debate, Senator Feingold also pointed out that there are many kinds valuable information on the Internet that might be considered indecent under FCC definitions, such as AIDS education information, various works of art, etc. B.	Intrusion Of The Federal Communications Commission On Content And Standards In Interactive Media 	There are "defenses to prosecution" under this statute which are designed to limit the liability of service providers and, possibly, users and content creators.  (See subsection (f))  To avoid being prosecuted under this statute an entity can take "good faith steps" to restrict access to the possibly infringing communications and then hope that if charged with violating the Act, that the court believes you took sufficient steps.  A more prudent person, or a corporation with money and reputation at risk, would more likely wait to see what the FCC says are sufficient steps to restrict access and follow those regulations.  Until the FCC acts, the defenses applicable to the dial-a-porn law are available, but it is not clear how they would apply to interactive media. If this provision were to become law, an FCC rulemaking will be required to decide two issues: 1) what is indecent in interactive media?      This could include the "seven dirty words", frontal nudity, sound files with heavy breathing, or many other examples. However, granting the Federal Communications Commission the authority to answer to this question would bring the Internet under a similar content regime as broadcast television and radio. 2) what steps must be taken to restrict access to indecent material?      The FCC will also have to decide what techniques must be used to restrict access sufficiently to enable users and providers to avoid criminal liability. FCC intrusion in the rapidly evolving interactive media market promises to delay the development of new technologies, squelch the entrepreneurial spirit which has helped the Internet to grow, and chill the speech of all users and content creators.  The FCC took 8 years to get blocking rules settled just for 900# services, and that was one relatively simple technology.  Giving the FCC authority to set child-access standards for every piece of the Net, and all new Net services that develop is a disaster for the medium and will have a sweeping chilling effect on both the technology and free expression online. 	As Senator Leahy noted during debate on the bill, "the Internet has become the tremendous success it is because it did not have Big Brother, the Federal Government, trying to micromanage what it does and trying to tell users what it could do.  If the Government had been in charge of figuring out how to expand the Internet or make it more available and so on, I guarantee it would not be one-tenth the success it is today." (Cong. Rec. 8344) C.	A New Crime Of Online Annoyance Senator Exon proposes criminal sanctions for anyone who uses "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications "with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person."  Federal and state laws already punish criminal harassment, regardless of the medium used  to perpetrate the crime.  (See 18 USC 875(c)).  CDT believes that additional laws in this area are simply unnecessary.  Moreover, the Department has Justice has said that it has adequate prosecutorial powers in this new environment. (See DoJ letter June 14, 1995). D.	Limitations On Service Provider Liability Are Weak And Threaten To Radically Reduce The Decentralized Nature Of The Internet 	Some provisions of the Exon/Coats bill attempt to limit the liability of service providers where they act only as passive transmitters of content.  However, these provisions have been significantly weakened as a result of pressure from anti-pornography groups, and are subject to interpretation which creates great risk for both users and service providers.  Anti-pornography groups have been pressing to hold online providers responsible for all of the information accessible to minors on the Internet.  The earlier version of the Exon bill excused from criminal liability anyone who had no editorial control over the content of the message.  However, the bill passed by the Senate removed the "editorial control" defense.  Instead, service providers could limit their liability only if they "ha[ve] no control" over the service, or if they take steps to restrict access for minors.  The degree of nature or degree of control which could leave a provider open to liability is, however, not specified.  CDT believes that these weakened "defenses" leave access providers, and thus Internet users, in a state of great uncertainty as to their responsibility under this bill.  	One of the major criticisms of the original legislation introduced by Senator Exon in February 1995 was that it placed criminal liability on online service providers and Internet access providers for any content that traveled across their networks.  In response to these criticisms, Senator Exon altered his bill to assure that service providers would not be held responsible for content on their network unless they exercised editorial control.  However, in the final days before Senate action on the bill, Senator Exon changed the provisions again at the request of Senator Coats.  Now, the presumption of liability has been reversed and a service provider would have to show that it has no control over the service which carried indecent content to a particular minor.  o THE END OF USENET NEWSGROUPS? 	The major uncertainty of the defenses centers on what it means for a service provider to have control over indecent or obscene content.  The uncertainty of this defense is revealed in an analysis of an Internet access providers relationship and potential criminal liability for providing access to Internet newsgroups such as Usenet.  Most Internet service providers provide access to Usenet, and, generally make choices about which newsgroups they carry.  Some carry all newsgroups, others carry only some groups.  The architecture of the Internet newsgroup system is such that a particular Internet access provide can chose to exclude the "alt.sex" newsgroups, or not.  Does this ability to exercise control mean that the service provider is criminally liable under the statute?  Or, does a carrier have to actually exercise control over the content of individual messages?  These definitional questions are legal fine points, but create substantial uncertainty over the meaning of the Act and are likely to lead to litigation and instability in the Internet environment.  Until these issues are resolved, there will likely be a substantial chilling effect on all speech on such services. 	The bill and associated legislative history leave some doubt as to the meaning of control, since it is never explicitly defined.  Debate on the Senate floor, which is often used by courts to divine the legislative intent of the drafters where a statute is unclear, gives seemingly contradictory signals on the question of service provider liability for services such as Usenet newsgroups.  One the one hand Senator Exon says in the Congressional Record of the debate that an online provider merely providing access, navigational tools and incidental services "is not aware of the contents of the  communications and should not be responsible" for violation of the obscenity, indecency or harassment crimes in the Act.  (Cong. Rec., S8345).  On the other hand, Senator Coats, the co-sponsor of the bill, says that the Act "does not create a defense for someone who has some level of control over the material of the provision of the material."  (Cong. Rec. S8345).  Senator Exon also says in the course of this "colloquy" with Senator Coats that those "engaging in pornography and indecency should install 'electronic bouncers' at their electronic doors" to keep minors out. (Id.) 	CDT believes that defenses to prosecution for online service providers are critical in the context of this legislation, but is concerned that the defenses no longer serve the function for which they were originally designed.  As written in the Senate-passed bill, the defenses appear to require Internet service providers to interfere with the content of messages on their networks if they have any ability to do so.  o CREATION OF NEW GATEKEEPERS 	Forcing online services providers to exercise control as the new Exon/Coats bill seems to require would spell the end of the open, decentralized communications environment which has characterized the Internet until now.  As we have argued elsewhere, users and parents have a great degree of control over what they and their children receive in interactive media.  Federal policy should encourage the development of this user control potential, rather than return to the centralized control regulatory models which characterized the mass media.  As an open, decentralized medium, the Internet promotes the free flow of information and serves as a valuable political and cultural forum. If we rely on user control technology we can protect children without involving federal regulators in the censorship of constitutionally-protected speech. E.	Unfair Treatment Of Individual Users, Educational Institutions And Other Non-Commercial Services: Pre-Emption Against Restrictive State Laws Only For Commercial Services 	If enacted, this proposal would protect commercial service providers from additional censorship by state legislatures, but leave all non-commercial users, including libraries, schools, community groups, and individuals subject to additional regulation and censorship under state law.  The proposal pre-empts state statutes that might censor commercial services beyond the scope of federal law, but leaves all other net users and groups exposed to any censorship that states may choose to enact.  We find no valid public policy argument which would accord greater protection to commercial speech than is granted to non-commercial users of the net. Conclusion: Failure To Take Full Advantage Of User And Parental Control Features Inherent In Interactive Media 	Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice over the information that they and their children have access to.  In sharp contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply not necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate information.  Any legislative action in this are must identify ways to promote greater parental and user control.  As drafted, the proposal before us suggests possible FCC rulemaking on this issue, but is no guaranty that the Commission would take this course.  Instead of just passing this critical question off to a regulatory body, Congress must identify both legal and voluntary means to encourage the development of more and more flexible and accessible user control techniques. 	Interactive media such as the Internet, commercial online services, and interactive television networks, are, by nature, distinctly different from traditional broadcast and television mass media.  Interactive media does not suffer from a scarcity of capacity, nor does it assault an audiance of captive viewers. Most importantly, interactive media offers users tremendous control over the content that they and their children receive.  The Exon/Coats proposal completely fails to account for these unique aspects of interactive media. As House of Representatives begins to consider this and other proposals to regulate content on the Internet, CDT will continue to fight the Exon/Coats proposal, and will work to find alternative prolicy solutions which preserve the First Amendment an the free flow of information in cyberspace.

We must find ways to do this that do not invite invasions of privacy, lead to censorship of private online communications, and undercut important constitutional protections. Before legislating to impose government regulation on the content of communications in this enormously complex area, I feel we need more information from law enforcement and telecommunications experts. My bill calls for just such a fast-track study of this issue. There is no question that we are not living through a revolution in telecommunications with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to communicate electronically with people within our own homes and communities, and around the globe. A byproduct of this technical revolution is that supervising our children takes on a new dimension of responsibility. Very young children are so adept with computers that they can sit at a keypad in front of a computer screen at home or at school and connect to the outside world through the Internet or some other on-line service. Many of us are, thus, justifiably concerned about the accessibility of obscene and indecent materials on-line and the ability of parents to monitor and control the materials to which their children are exposed. But government regulation of the content of all computer and telephone communications, even private communications, in violation of the First Amendment is not the answer -- it is merely a knee-jerk response. Heavy-handed efforts by government to regulate obscenity on interactive information services will only stifle the free flow of information, discourage the robust development of new information services, and make users avoid using the system. The problem of policing the Internet is complex and involves many important issues. We need to protect copyrighted materials from illegal copying. We need to protect privacy. And we need to help parents protect their children. Penalties imposed after the harm is done is not enough. We need to find technical means from stopping the harm done before it happens. My bill calls for a study to address the legal and technical issues for empowering users to control the information they receive over electronic interactive services. Instead of rushing to regulate the content of information services, we should encourage the development of technology that gives parents and other consumers the ability to control the information that can be access over a modem. Empowering parents to manage what their kids access over the Internet with technology under their control is far preferable to some of the bills pending in Congress that would criminalize users or deputize information service providers as smut police. Let's see what this study reveals before we start legislating in ways that could severely damage electronic communications systems, sweep away important constitutional rights, and undercut law enforcement at the same time. I ask unanimous consent, to have printed in the record at this pint, the "Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free Expression in Interactive Media Study" bill.

Following six at-sea tests with the SeaBat 9001, Triton delivered Isis with the Multibeam interface to both the Detroit and Louisville Districts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for shallow water survey operations. Both systems were delivered in conjunction with the Reson SeaBat 9001. Richard Lear, General Manager of Reson UK said, Isis complements the SeaBat by its ability to display and combine both the bathymetry and imagery from the profiler. Isis can overlay a backscatter intensity value for each of the 60 beams or the actual sidescan information on top of the 3-D bathymetry display. Isis selected as topside for NOAA's Focused Multibeam Sidescan Systems NOAA recently awarded a contract to Klein Associates for a high-speed, high-resolution, focused multibeam side scan sonar. Triton�s Isis was selected as the topside processor for the system. NOAA expects to order up to eleven systems over five years. The first delivery is scheduled for June 96. Isis was selected for its ability to acquire, digitize, process, display in real-time, and store high-resolution imagery. Isis leads the industry with state-of-the-art features that include: virtual resolution; Windows 95 and NT operating systems; and high-speed hardware that allows data to be played back as fast as the eye can see. Other outstanding Isis features include: signal/pixel processing with selectable downsampling methods to fit the application; image analysis with logging to disk; and user interface with comprehensive On-Line Help. New Isis Modules and Features TriPort data converter TriPort Ver.1.0, was released in January, 1995, enabling Isis and Q-MIPS Users to convert imagery stored as .DAT files to a format compatible with most popular GIS and word processing packages. TriPort runs under Windows 3.1, 95 and NT. Digital SLS Interfaces Triton has added digital interfaces for several more digital sidescan systems. Current digital interfaces include the Klein System-2000, EG&G DF-1000 and the Datasonics SIS-1000 systems. Other digital interfaces require only that a digital server and hardware interface be developed. Contact the Sales department for pricing information. Auto Freespan Detection A new module for automatically detecting and logging pipeline freespans has been developed and implemented in Isis for offshore pipeline survey operations. The new module was developed by Triton and tested by Stolt Comex Seaway in Haugesund, Norway. Using imagery from a sidescan sonar, the new module will display and log a freespan�s start and stop location. The new package is also capable of tracking up to four pipelines simultaneously in both real- and post-time as well as displaying the span information and a maximum span length and height detected. Graph Triton has added the new graphing capability to Isis as standard (provided free to Users with current EMA or warranty). The graph feature allows the User to graph all attitude, navigation, CTD and most any other sensor data as a function of time. The advantage of the graph feature is the ability to monitor data quality in real-time and to aid in the calibration of various sensors. The User controls the time intervals for the display windows and Isis displays an average value for each display (e.g. trim, list, etc.). 32-bit version of Isis Triton has just released a 32-bit version of Isis capable of running under both Windows 95 and NT. The 32-bit upgrade was included with the latest 16-bit upgrade version that all Isis Users under EMA received in early December. Users interested in upgrading to 32-bit Isis are required to purchase a copy of either Windows 95 or NT. Triton currently recommends Windows 95 because of the better User interface and 2K x 2K virtual resolution. Interface to Seatex MRU For Isis users incorporating a motion reference unit in their system, Triton has developed a two-way interface to the Seatex range of MRU's. The new interface requires only that a serial connection be made between Isis and the MRU and Isis will automatically configure itself to extract only the required attitude information. Contact Clark Friesen at Seatex, Inc. at (206) 836-8021. Technical Trends at Triton Technology, Inc. Happy New Year! In keeping with the new year, Triton's technical manuals are �turning over a new leaf� and taking on a cleaner look. As a taste of things to come, Triton's newest manuals now feature: More graphics Chapter-driven tables of contents Chapter-driven indexes The new format will make it easier and faster for you to find help in the manuals. Soon you will be able to access more of our documentation on-line. We are experimenting with a product called FrameViewer, which lets you browse our manuals on-line. With it you can read and print information that interests you. One of the main benefits of the on-line version of the new manuals is that when you click on a table of contents or index entry, the on-line system takes you directly to the subject in the manual. We hope this on-line approach will cut down on the time it takes you to find the information you need most. New users' manuals for Isis and Vista for Windows 95 and NT are now available. For those of you who still prefer technical information from traditional hardcopy, Triton will continue to offer it to you that way. Extra manuals in the form of hardcopy are available at $25/copy. Isis Demonstrations Coastal Oceanographics and the US Army Corps of Engineers Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) are co-hosting the Advanced Hydrographic Surveying Workshop in Mobile, Alabama. The conference is scheduled for the week of March 18-22, 1996. The Isis system will be demonstrated on the US Army Corps of Engineers vessel supplied by the Mobile District. In addition to the Isis system, a SeaBat 9001, Seatex MRU-6, and Coastal Oceanographics HYPACK will be integrated as a complete system. Triton will also have an exhibit booth at the conference. Please stop by our display to pick up brochures and technical information on our products. We are also available to discuss system integration if you plan to purchase a multibeam system or if you want to discuss leasing a system. To receive a package of information now, contact John Tamplin at Tel: 408-722-7373 or Fax: 408-722-1405, or by email. For additional information on the Survey Workshop contact Dave Clarke of Coastal Oceanographics at Tel: 201-666-6969. If you are planning the purchase of a sonar (sidescan, multibeam, subbottom, etc.) and would be interested in a demonstration of the Isis system, contact the sales department. Oceanology International 96 We will be exhibiting Isis, VISTA, and all of the other modules for Isis at the Oceanology International 96 conference being held in Brighton, England during the week of 4-8 March, 1996. The Isis will be displayed on the joint exhibit of EIVA A/S - Scantron Ltd., our Scandinavian and UK representatives. Please stop by Triton's booth #303 to chat or to get a personal demonstration of Isis and our other product. Isis F.A.Q.'s Q. How can an Isis User tell if the sonar is triggering? A. There is an LED light located on the front of the Signal Interface Unit (SIU-4) that should be blinking in time with the received trigger. Q. How can I troubleshoot the cause of no imagery displayed in Isis after a recording session has been initiated? A. Open a voltage window under the main menu item WINDOW, VOLTAGE, SIGNAL. If there is a signal coming across, imagery will be generated. Make sure that the Threshold setting is appropriate for the signal that is being received. If the signal is low, adjust the THRESHOLD slide bar so that imagery is visible. If you do not see a signal in the Isis voltage window, make sure that the SIU4 unit has a blinking light. If so, check the 5BNC connectors coming from the sonar into the SIU4 and the DB-37 connector that plugs into the back of Isis. Restart Isis after all connections have been checked. If recording is still unsuccessful, hook up an oscilloscope to the sonar's outputs to check the signal. If the signal from the sonar is correct, hook the scope to the output channels of the SIU4 to verify that signals are being output. Q. What are the most common causes of failure of the Magneto-Optical drives? A. Overheating and dirt. To maintain the proper temperature inside the Isis chassis, the User should clean the filters located on the front and back of Isis. Keeping these filters clean allows for proper air circulation. M-O drives put out a great amount of heat and require clean filters to maintain the needed air flow. Q. What should be done if an optical drive in Isis suddenly stops working? A. Shut down Isis and let it cool. Allow enough time so the M-O drive cools down completely. Check and clean your air filters while Isis is off. Restart the computer and, while it is booting, look at the M-O drive. A light on the far left should blink 5 to 7 times (depending on the operating system). If the light on the right goes on, and stays on, your drive needs to be returned for repair. Q. Before I go out on my survey, I need to estimate the amount of disk space (or magneto-optical space) I should reserve for my data in Isis or Q-MIPS. How do I do that? A. The key variable to measure is the number of bytes per ping that will be �used� during your survey. Bytes per ping depend on the following factors: How many samples per channel are specified to be stored for each ping Whether each pixel captured by a ping will represent 16 bits or 8 bits of data Whether you will be saving both raw and corrected imagery, or just one or the other (Q-MIPS only) How many channels will be operating during the data survey The operational length of time of your data survey Refer to page B-2 and the equations on page B-3 of the Isis User's Manual for a comprehensive discussion on this issue. Q. When do you plan to release the Windows version of VISTA Mosaic? A. An advance version of Vista for Windows 95 and NT will be released to selected Users and Triton Distributors and Reps in January 1996. The Beta program for VISTA for Windows was a success over the last year and we expect to iron out any remaining issues over the next month. The first release of the program will be February 1, 1996. Please contact the sales department to get more information or to get a preliminary copy of VISTA. Triton adds New Distributors & Reps.

ETHANOL: FUELING AN ECONOMICENGINE.MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL IMPACTS OF ETHANOL PRODUCTIONUNDER THE 1996 FARM BILL APRIL 19, 1996 Prepared by: John M. Urbanchuk Executive President, Industry Analysis AUS Consultants 155 Gaither Drive Moorestown, NJ 08057 Tel: 609-234-9200 FAX: 609-234-0733 SUMMARY Ethanol is a grain-derived alcohol fuelthat provides significant net positive economic and environmentalbenefits to the American economy and the economies of the stateswhere it is produced. The existence and operation of the Americanethanol industry will provide a net saving to the FederalTreasury and taxpayers of almost $4 billion over thenext seven years. In addition to the fiscal impacts, the economiccontribution of the ethanol industry includes: Creation of almost $60 billion (1996$) of final demand for the entire economy. Generation of $12.5 billion in additionalhousehold income over the next seven years. The creation of over 55,500 jobs annuallythroughout the entire economy. The generation of $15.6 billion ofnet farm income. Previous analyses of the ethanol industryhave focused on the costs to the Federal Treasury of the partialexemption for alcohol fuels from the excise tax on motor fuels. Few have examined the macroeconomic contribution made by theethanol industry. One such study was conducted in September 1995by the General Accounting Office. This analysis concluded thatelimination of the ethanol tax exemption would result in net lossesto the U.S. Treasury over the five year period 1996-2000 becauseincreases in farm program payments would outweigh the $2.5 billionincrease in gasoline tax revenues. GAO recognized that ethanol productionwould fall substantially if the excise tax exemption were removedand that this would have a negative impact on grain prices andfarm income. The new farm bill which was signed into law in April1996 virtually eliminates the impact of the excise tax on governmentoutlays to farmers since payments are now de-linked from production. However, since farm income will now be increasingly tied to returnsfrom the marketplace, the 1996 Farm Bill actually increases theimportance of the ethanol industry since ethanol is a large andgrowing element of grain demand. However, that is only part of the story. GAO failed to extend their analysis past outlays for commodityprograms to the broader implications of the ethanol industry foraggregate output, job creation, household and business income,and tax revenues. This study focuses on these benefits. BACKGROUND Ethanol is an alcohol fuel which canbe produced from almost any raw material containing sugar orcarbohydrates. Most ethanol produced in the United States is madefrom grain, with corn the most prevalent feed stock. About 60percent of the ethanol produced from corn is made in wet millingplants that also produce sweeteners, starches, and corn oil. The remaining 40 percent is produced by corn dry milling plantsthat also make distillers grains (a medium protein animal feedsupplement), corn meal and other food ingredients. In 1995 nearly 1.4 billion gallons ofethanol were produced from 553 million bushels of corn. As shownin Figure 1, ethanol production in the United States has increaseddramatically over the last decade and a half. This expansion occurredlargely as a result of incentives provided by federal and stategovernments which were intended to reduce dependence on importedoil and create new markets for domestically grown grain. Under current law alcohol blends, typically90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol, are exempted from5.4 cents of the 18.4 cents per gallon federal excise tax on gasoline. ETBE, an oxygenate made from ethanol is also eligible for the partial exemption from the federal excise tax on motor fuels,while MTBE, which is made from methanol and usually produced frompetroleum products, is not. It is important to note that theexcise tax exemption is claimed by gasoline refiners and blenderswho use ethanol and ETBE andnot the producers of ethanol or farmers who grow the grainused to make ethanol. The impact of the excise tax exemptionon ethanol producers is one of simple economics. At existingtechnology and current scales of production, ethanol made fromgrain is more expensive to produce than is MTBE from methanol. Ethanol competes with gasoline and gasoline blending agents includingnon-renewable oxygenates such as MTBE. The prices of gasolineand blending agents have been closely tied to the price of crudeoil on world markets. The largest element of variability in thecost of producing ethanol is the price of corn and the value ofthe by-product credits associated with wet and dry corn milling,which are based on the values of the other products produced alongwith ethanol. Ethanol is competitive with the excisetax exemption. Without the exemption, refiners and blenders woulduse alternative oxygenates that are less expensive in part becauseof domestic and foreign subsidies, and the market for ethanolwould collapse. In the absence of the exemption, blenders andsome refiners will shift to lower-cost MTBE as their oxygenateof choice. As a result, total corn demand over the next sevenyears period would be reduced by nearly 3.4 billion bushels. The solid line in Figure 2 depicts theprojected path of ethanol demand based on current market conditionsand environmental regulations. This baseline suggests very modestgrowth in ethanol demand through 2002. The dotted line depictsthe impact elimination of the excise tax exemption is expectedto have on ethanol production. Without a market ethanol producersindicate that they would be forced to sharply curtail operationsand abandon new investment. The impact on the industry wouldbe felt within months of a repeal decision, and the impact onthe economy would follow directly. According to the Renewable Fuels Association,the national trade association representing the ethanol industry,ethanol will be produced in over 50 plants in 17 states in 1996. Over 90 percent of ethanol production capacity is concentratedin the major Mid-western corn producing states of Illinois, Iowa,Nebraska, Minnesota., Indiana, and Kansas. Despite the geographicconcentration of the industry, ethanol is produced in all regionsof the country. The partial exemption from the excisetax on motor fuels was originally enacted to achieve several objectives.The first of these was to enhance national security by reducingdependence on imported oil through replacement with a domesticallyproduced alternative. The United States has an insatiable appetitefor energy, particularly energy derived from oil and other petrochemicals.While success in conservation and improved efficiency has slowedgrowth in energy use over the past several decades, dependenceon imported oil has increased significantly. Ethanol is used as an oxygenate andis virtually equivalent on a one-to-one basis with MTBE whichis produced from petrochemical feedstocks. If domestically producedethanol was not available, an additional 1.6 billion gallons ofMTBE would be required to meet existing environmental requirements. Virtually all of this additional MTBE would have to be imported. This would reduce the U.S. merchandise trade balance by $1.3billion annually. A second objective of the excise taxexemption was to create an additional market for agriculturalcommodities that would provide market-based support for pricesand lessen the dependence of farmers on government subsidies. The ethanol industry has been an unqualified success in creatingan important domestic market for grain. Ethanol currently accountsfor 6.2 percent of total corn utilization and is the third largestindividual use of corn. Ethanol accounts for about 14 cents ofthe value of every bushel of corn marketed by American farmers. The 553 million bushels of corn purchasedto manufacture ethanol last year directly provided $1.3 billionof cash receipts for U.S. corn growers. This amounted to sixpercent of the total gross income for corn growers. Ethanol also provides significant netpositive environmental benefits. Ethanol adds oxygen to gasolinewhich reduces exhaust emissions of ozone-forming VOC's and carbonmonoxide. It is widely used in reformulated gasolines currentlybeing sold in ozone non-attainment areas across the country. Because ethanol adds octane to gasoline, it also reduces the useof other highly toxic petroleum-derived octane enhancers suchas benzene, toluene, and xylene. And because it is produced fromagricultural feedstocks, ethanol is the only transportation motorfuel which helps to reduce global warming. Ethanol's environmentalpromise was summarized by EPA Administrator Carol Browner at arecent Senate hearing, "expanding the use of renewable fuelscan help clean up our air and lower emissions of harmful greenhousegasses." The ethanol industry has successfullyaccomplished each of these objectives. ANALYSIS The ethanol industry makes a significantcontribution to the overall U.S. economy and the economies ofthe states where production is concentrated. This contributioncan be measured in terms of increased final demand for goods andservices from other industries; jobs provided by the ethanol industryas well as other industries that supply ethanol producers; andadditional household income for all Americans. Finally, the federalgovernment and states receive tax revenue from personal, business, and corporateincome taxes paid on wages and additional income generated asa result of the operation of the ethanol industry. Estimation of the benefits of the ethanolindustry to the American economy involved a multi-stage process. The first steps involved collectinginformation about current ethanol production by state and outliningthe growth in ethanol demand over the next seven years. Much ofthis information was provided by the ethanol industry throughthe Renewable Fuels Association. Projected growth in ethanol demandis described in Figure 2 above and summarized in Appendix Table1. The value of output of the ethanolindustry in constant 1996 dollars was estimated by multiplyingannual production by the 1996 average price of ethanol estimatedat $1.32 per gallon. This provided annual estimates of the valueof final demand delivered by the food processing sector. Thefood processing sector contains corn milling firms that produceethanol. These estimates are summarized in Appendix Table 2. Since the major input for the ethanolindustry is grain, we estimated the contribution of the corn usedfor ethanol production on agricultural output, prices, and farmincome. This was accomplished by performinga simulation of an econometric model of the agricultural sector. The baseline agricultural forecast incorporates the major provisionsof the 1996 Farm Bill and a continuation of the excise tax exemptionfor ethanol. The simulation to determine the "value added"by ethanol was triggered by reducing the amount of corn used forethanol production from an average of 645 million bushels to162 million bushels annually. This reduction is consistent withthe impact on ethanol production the industry anticipates in theabsence of the incentives provided by the excise tax exemption. The annual economic contribution ofthe ethanol industry was estimated by applying output, earnings,and employment multipliers to the value of industry output, wages,and industry employment of ethanol producers for each producingstate and the United States as a whole. The state and nationallevel multipliers used in this analysis were taken from the RegionalInput-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) of the U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. BENEFITS OF ETHANOL The ethanol industry makes a significantcontribution to the American economy. Ethanol will add almost $51 billion(1996$) of final demand to the entire American economy. Thegoods and services purchased by ethanol producers represent purchasesof final demand of other industries. These include purchasesof corn and other grain from farmers (agriculture), natural gas,electricity, water and sewer, and telephone (utilities), and accountingand legal services (business services). Each of these supplierindustries in turn purchases inputs from other industries. Ifethanol producers were no longer in business these supplier firmswould have to find alternative markets for their output. Farm income for crop producerswill be $2.2 billion, or nearly 3 percent, higher each year becauseof ethanol production. Increased demand for grain grown byAmerican farmers provides market support for prices and incomes. If the market for ethanol did not exist, corn stocks would rise,prices would fall, profitability would decline and farmers wouldbe encouraged to plant other crops. Since payments to farmersunder the 1996 farm bill are fixed and cannot vary with stocksand prices, price declines associated with a collapse of demandwill directly affect cash farm income. When all crop shifts causedby changes in relative crop profitability are accounted for, netincome for American grain farmers is $15.6 billion higher overthe next seven years than would be the case without an ethanolincentive. Ethanol supports 55,500 jobs eachyear: Ethanol production directly accounts for over 5,800jobs in the food processing industry in 17 states. As demandfor ethanol grows, the number of people directly employed by theindustry will also increase. Additionally, the spending of ethanolmanufacturers on goods and services, which represents the creationof final demand, will indirectly support an average of 48,900jobs annually throughout all other industries in the entire economy. These jobs would be lost if ethanol production ceased due toloss of the excise tax exemption. Ethanol generates income for allAmericans as the wages paid to the workers who produce ethanolare spent and re-spent throughout the entire economy. The ethanol industry directly pays $277 million in wages to employees.These employees and their families spend this income thereby creatingdemand. The indirect impact adds another $1.8 billion to householdincome annually. Over the seven-year period 1996-2002, ethanolproduction will increase total household income by $12.5 billion. Ethanol contributes over $2 billionannually to the U.S. trade balance. By displacing imported MTBE ethanol reduces the U.S. merchandise trade deficit by about$1.3 billion annually. But the trade implications of ethanoldon't stop with MTBE. The majority of the by-products of ethanolproduction -- corn gluten feed and gluten meal -- are exported. This further reduces the trade deficit by earning over $800 millionannually. Ethanol generates $555 millionof net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury annually through personaland business income tax receipts. The excise tax exemption for alcohol fuels represents a cost to the U.S. Treasury through foregonerevenue. The Joint Tax Committee estimated that the exemptionwould cost $2.5 billion in revenues over the five-year 1996-2000period. Extrapolation through 2002 based on ethanol productionestimates discussed earlier suggests that the cost of the exemptionover the seven-year period would total $3.5 billion. However,this "cost" must be offset by the additional revenuesthat will be provided by taxes on household and farm income thatare generated and supported by the ethanol industry. The ethanolindustry will generate $7.4 billion in additional income taxesover the next seven years, nearly $3.9 billion more than the estimatedcost of the partial excise tax exemption in forgone tax revenues.Whilethese economic impacts are concentrated in the major ethanol producingstates, nearly all states benefit from the existence of the industry. This reflects the fact that goods and services freely flow acrossstate borders and no individual state is self sufficient in everythingneeded for manufacturing. For example, while an Iowa ethanolproducer may purchase corn from an Iowa corn farmer, the machineryhe uses to process the corn may have been made in Illinois orPennsylvania; his advertising and public relations may be providedby a firm in Chicago or New York; and his business insurance underwrittenby a New Jersey or Connecticut insurer. Implications of the 1996 Farm Bill for ethanol The 1996 Farm Bill provides the firstmajor redesign of federal agricultural support programs sincethey were developed in the 1930s. Chief among these changes isformally breaking the link between eligibility for farm programpayments and production, and removal of ARP authority. Prior to 1996 government payments tofarmers were determined by a confluence of legislatively-set targetprices and market prices. In order to qualify for program paymentseligibility farmers had to agree to set aside, or not plant, acertain percentage of their acreage base annually and comply withconservation provisions. Farmers were discouraged from plantingnon-program crops such as soybeans on their acreage bases sincethey would lose program eligibility on that land. The Secretary of Agriculture used theAcreage Reduction Program (ARP), or set-aside, provisions of thefarm bill to manage supply and government budget exposure. Thebasic parameters for ARPs for the major program crops were establishedin the five-year farm bills. The legislation gave the Secretarydiscretion to establish annual set-asides subject to the ratioof ending stocks to total demand. A high ratio signaled a surpluscondition which generally depressed market prices. Since government payments were determinedby a deficiency payment rate which was the difference betweenthe legislated target price and the higher of the market priceor the loan rate, large supplies and low prices generally resultedin increased government payments. Under the new farm bill, deficiencypayments are replaced by declining fixed payments over a seven-yearcontract period. Farmers know in advance how much they can expectfrom government payments each year through 2002. They also knowthat these payments will be unchanged by market conditions. The 1996 Farm Bill removes the ARP asa supply management tool and gives farmers virtually completeflexibility to plant whatever crops they choose based on signalsfrom the marketplace. Therefore, a shock to demand such as asharp decline in ethanol production, would increase stocks andreduce prices and, therefore, profitability. Under the new farmbill farmers are free to shift as much of their corn acreage asthey desire to whatever crop they think will be more profitableduring the next season. If corn profitability declines, growerswould shift acreage to other crops such as soybeans, wheat, andcotton (in the South). Production of these crops would increase,their prices would fall, and the planting decision process wouldbe reevaluated in the following spring. Since annual government payments tofarmers are fixed, net income will be more fully exposed to adecline in market prices than has been the case for the past fiftyyears. This means a shock to demand that reduces prices will bedirectly absorbed by farmers through reduced farm income. The ethanol industry also benefits farmersthrough ownership of manufacturing plants. According to the RenewableFuels Association 8 of the 50 operating ethanol plants in 1996are farmer-owned cooperatives. These plants account for over200 million gallons, or about 20 percent, of ethanol production. Removal of the excise tax exemption would force these plants toclose and would remove another important source of income forthe farmer-owners. Our analysis suggests that ethanolmakes the following contribution to the agricultural economy: Corn plantings would average 81.8million acres over the 1996-2002 period, 3.4 million acres higherthan would be the case without ethanol. Ending stocks of cornstocks would total one billion bushels by August 31, 2002 providingan average stocks to use ratio (a measure of the adequacy of suppliesto meet demand) of 11 percent over the seven-year period. Inthe absence of ethanol demand stocks would be 20 percent higher. The demand for corn represented by the ethanol industry willprovide an average farm level price for corn of $2.65 over the1996-2002 period. This is 4.6 percent higher than would be thecase without the ethanol industry. The benefits provided by theethanol industry are summarized in Table 1 and the fiscal impactsare presented in Table 2.

Increases in ethanol production offer enormous potential for overall economic growth and additional employment in these smaller communities. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has concluded that a 100 million gallon ethanol facility could create 2,250 local jobs for a single community. An economic outlook of the U.S. ethanol industry over the seven year period, 1996 to 2002, concluded: Ethanol will add $51 billion (1996$) to the entire U.S. economy. The goods and services purchased by ethanol producers represent increased final demand for other industries. These include purchases of grain, natural gas, electricity, water and sewer, telephone, and accounting and legal services. Each of these supplier industries in turn purchase inputs from other industries. Farm income for crop producers will be $2.2 billion, or nearly 3%, higher each year because of ethanol production. Increased demand for grain grown by American farmers provides market support for prices and incomes. Ethanol supports 55,000 jobs. Ethanol production directly accounts for over 5,800 jobs in the food/fuel processing industry in 17 states. Additionally, the spending of ethanol manufacturers on goods and services indirectly supports an average of 48,900 jobs annually throughout all other industries in the entire economy. Increases in ethanol production offer enormous potential for overall economic growth and additional employment in smaller communities where ethanol production is often based. Ethanol production will increase total household income by $12.5 billion over the next seven years. The ethanol industry directly pays $277 million in wages to employees. These employees and their families spend this income, thereby creating demand. The indirect impact of ethanol production adds another $1.8 billion to household income annually. Ethanol generates $555 million of net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury annually through personal and business income tax receipts. Additional revenues provided by taxes on household and farm income that are generated and supported by the ethanol industry offset the cost of the partial ethanol excise tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasolines. Trade Ethanol contributes over $2 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance. By displacing imported MTBE, ethanol reduces the U.S. merchandise trade deficit by about $1.3 billion annually. But the trade implications of ethanol do not stop with MTBE. The majority of the by-products of ethanol production - corn gluten feed and gluten meal - are exported. This further reduces the trade deficit by earning over $800 million annually. Budget Impact Past analyses of the ethanol industry have concluded that the production of ethanol actually saves the federal government money in reduced farm program costs and increased rural income. The General Accounting Office concluded in 1995 that the reductions in farm program costs attributable to the increased demand for corn created by the ethanol industry more than offset the cost of the ethanol tax incentive. The historic farm bill passed in 1996 detaches farm program payments from production, a fundamental change in federal farm policy. An economic analysis by AUS Consultants found that while the ethanol industry can no longer point to the budgetary savings of reduced farm program costs, the ethanol program will continue to save the government money because the industry generates considerable household and farm income that results in increased federal tax revenue.

While ethanol's original use was as a gasoline extender, today ethanol is marketed as a high quality octane booster and oxygenate capable of reducing emissions and improving automobile performance. Ethanol-blended fuel sales represent over 11% of all automotive fuels sold in the United States. Ethanol is a versatile fuel, used as a blend component, a feedstock for ethers and as a replacement or alternative fuel. Major Automakers Recommend Ethanol Ethanol blends are approved under the warranties of all domestic and foreign automobile manufacturers marketing vehicles in the United States. In fact, the nation's top three auto-makers, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, recommend the use of oxygenated fuels, such as ethanol, because of their clean air benefits. ETBE Clean Air Act requirements to make cleaner burning, reformulated gasoline (RFG) with lower volatility and fewer toxins have created an increased interest in ethanol-based ethers such as ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether). ETBE is a chemical compound produced by reacting ethanol and isobutylene (a petroleum-derived by-product of the refining process). Relative to other oxygenates, ethanol-based ethers provide refiners with greater flexibility and economic advantages in making reformulated gasoline. ETBE has characteristics superior to other ethers including: low volatility low water solubility high octane value excellent distillation curve response large reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions superior drive-ability ETBE also enhances energy security by displacing more gasoline produced from imported crude, and reduces our dependency on imported methanol and MTBE sources for reformulated gasoline production. These combined characteristics establish ETBE as one of the most cost-effective means for refiners to reduce gasoline volatility. As federal and state air quality programs continue to require reductions in fuel volatility, the marketplace opportunities for ETBE will continue to grow. RFG Production Easier with ETBE Oxygen RVP Aromatics Benzene 1990 Industry Avg. --- 7.8 33% 1.6% +12.8 Vol%ETBE 2.0% 7.3 24% 1.4% +17.2 Vol% ETBE 2.7% 7.0 22% 1.3% RFG Target 2.0% 7.2 25% 1.0% ETBE reduces "RFG" investment requirements for refiners Allows refiners to focus strategy for 1997 Complex Model E-85/E-90/E-100 Fleets Provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990 and the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 created significant new market opportunities for alternative fuels, by phasing in requirements for fleet vehicles to operate on cleaner fuels. In the United States, state governments are recognizing the economic, energy and environmental benefits of fuel ethanol. A number of Midwestern States operate as many E-85 vehicles (blend of 85% ethanol/15% conventional gasoline) as the federal government. Heavy duty vehicles are also being operated on blends of 90% ethanol (E-90) and 100% ethanol (E-100) in successful demonstration programs. In ten years as many as 5 million vehicles may be running on non-petroleum motor fuels. In Brazil, where ethanol has been used in blends with gasoline since 1939, the government mandated the production of neat-ethanol fueled vehicles in order to reduce its dependence on imported energy while providing value added markets for its sugar cane producers. Today, there are more than 4.2 million ethanol-powered vehicles (approximately 40% of the total fleet of passenger vehicles) operating in Brazil. Biodiesel Animal fats and vegetable oils are reacted with methyl or ethyl alcohol and sodium hydroxide (esterfication) to produce biodiesel (methyl or ethyl ester). Alcohol ester can be made from many vegetable oils including soybeans, sunflowers, corn or palm. Biodiesel can be used as a substitute for or blended with diesel fuel. The benefits of biodiesel fuels include: Biodiesel is organic and biodegradable. Biodiesel mileage and power performance are comparable to conventional diesel. Biodiesel is safer because it has a high flash point and does not produce combustible air mixtures under normal conditions. Biodiesel mixes easily and completely with conventional diesel fuel and requires no modifications to fuel systems. Biodiesel contains no sulfur so it does not create sulfur dioxide, a major source of acid rain, when combusted. Biodiesel burns clean because it contains oxygenates. Smoke is reduced by 70% when biodiesel is burned as a pure fuel and 25% when burned as an 80/20 diesel/alcohol ester blend. Biodiesel is widely used in Europe and in some U.S. cities to meet air emission standards. The city of St. Louis, Missouri, operates a fleet of 164 buses on a biodiesel blend of 30% biodiesel and 70% diesel. Several research programs are underway on the growth and processing of safflower and rapeseed oils into biodiesel.

Ethanol has been present since the dawn of the automobile. In 1908, Henry Ford designed his Model T to run on alcohol, proclaiming it the fuel of the future. More recently, ethanol-blended fuels have won wide consumer acceptance. Since 1980, over two trillion miles have been driven on ethanol-blended fuels. Ethanol Production Today, there are approximately 50 commercial facilities producing fuel ethanol in more than 20 different states across the country. Domestic ethanol producers have invested over $4 billion in private sector resources to construct modern and efficient ethanol production facilities. Alcohol fuel can be produced in all regions of the country, from a wide variety of feedstocks, including grains, forest residues, citrus and urban wastes, and special energy crops. Ethanol production is labor intensive, and results in balanced and dispersed job creation. Farmer-Owned Cooperatives As the domestic ethanol industry continues to grow, the industry is witnessing a surge in the construction of farmer-owned ethanol production facilities. American farmers are realizing added benefits attributable to the ethanol industry through ownership of manufacturing plants. Value-Added Agriculture Today, the majority of ethanol produced in the U.S. is made from corn. Almost 60 percent of the ethanol made from corn is manufactured in wet milling plants that also produce sweeteners, starches and corn oil. The remaining 40 percent is produced by corn dry milling plants that also make distillers grains, corn meal and other food ingredients. Future Ethanol Production From Biomass While most ethanol today is made from corn, the Renewable Fuels Association is enthusiastic about the potential for making ethanol from biomass, including waste products like corn fiber, rice straw, sawdust, pulp and paper sludge and yard clippings; or from energy crops such as switch grass, prairie grasses and fast-growing trees. These sources offer tremendous opportunities for new jobs for the rural economy, as well as environmental benefits through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Fuel ethanol is derived from a diversity of renewable feedstocks including grain, cheese whey, citrus wastes and forestry residues. With corn being the predominant feedstock used, fuel ethanol represents an important and major domestic "value-added" market for U.S. corn farmers. Ethanol's important agricultural benefits include: Ethanol creates value-added markets for America's farmers, stimulating rural economies by increasing corn prices and rural income. Each 100 million bushel increase in the demand for corn results in a corn price increase of 8 to 10 cents per bushel. Ethanol accounts for 14 cents of the value of every bushel of corn marketed by American farmers. Ethanol accounts for 6.2 percent of total corn utilization in the U.S. and is the third largest individual use of corn, behind only feed use and exports. For each 100 million bushels of corn used in increased ethanol production, the ripple effects on the price of other commodities adds 2 cents per bushel to the price of wheat and 10 to 13 cents to the price of soy beans. Total direct and indirect benefits to farmers and ranchers who produce corn, wheat and other grains exceeded $3 billion in 1995. The production of ethanol does NOT mean less corn available for food. Instead, ethanol production actually produces many valuable high protein food and feed co-products. An acre of corn (125 bushels) produces 313 gallons of ethanol, 1,362 pounds of 21% distillers grains (protein feed for livestock), 325 pounds of 60% gluten meal, and 189 pounds of corn oil. Distillers Grains Distillers grains are a byproduct of the production of ethanol from grain and can be used for feed in most every type of animal system. Approximately 1.4 billion tons of distillers grains are produced annually, and the value derived from this market is critical to the economic viability of ethanol production. Distillers grains are rich in protein, energy, fat, minerals and vitamins with readily available sugars, lactic acid and other short chain fatty acids. Distillers grains are widely recognized as a cost-efficient, nutritional, digestible and highly palatable protein feed for dairy and beef cattle, sheep and swine. The high bypass protein and low starch content are ideally suited to keep animals healthy and profitable.

Considering the fact that Saudi Arabia is the world�s largest producer of oil on a daily basis, on an annual basis, that interest for our economy and the economy of allies in Europe and Japan is a vital, national interest. It has been declared to be so and has been deemed to be so by every American Administration back into the late 1940s. It's indisputable, and we will protect those national interests." State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns July 1, 1996, following fatal bombing of U.S. military residence in Saudi Arabia he U.S. enjoys the lowest cost energy of anywhere in the world. But the price for that low cost energy is high. Two-thirds of the world's known oil reserves are located in the Persian Gulf. By the year 2010, analysts believe that more than 75% of the world's petroleum needs will be met by Arab nations. Our growing reliance on imported crude oil from the world's most politically volatile region most certainly jeopardizes our nation's economic and national security. The price Americans pay for oil at the gasoline pump does not reflect this huge national security cost. To encourage regional geo-political stability and preserve the flow of oil, the federal government provides naval protection for the sea lanes; foreign aid to friendly regimes; and, as demonstrated by the Persian Gulf war, a commitment to use our own military forces when necessary. In addition, the U.S. maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help us weather any temporary supply disruptions. Real Price of Foreign Oil The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates the military costs associated with preserving our energy security to be $35 billion per year. That means for every $20 barrel of oil, U.S. taxpayers are paying an additional $12 to preserve and protect Mideast oil supplies. Other estimates of the real price of a barrel of oil range much higher. According to the Economic Strategy Institute, a barrel of foreign oil costs $80. The Rocky Mountain Institute estimates the cost at $106 a barrel. The U.S. General Accounting Office calculates the cost of a barrel of foreign oil as high as $126. Our military watch is very costly not just in taxpayer dollars for military expenditures in the volatile region, but also in terms of American lives. In addition to the lives lost in the Persian Gulf war, many view the increasing terrorist activity around the world as just the beginning of an organized resistance to the U.S. presence in the Middle East. Monopoly Pricing of Oil Far more threatening to the U.S. economy than the military costs to assure stability in the Mideast is the growing potential for monopoly pricing as the world moves back toward dependence on Persian Gulf oil. According to the DOE, worldwide oil reserves are becoming more concentrated and the world oil market share accounted for by a small number of countries continues to rise. DOE estimates that losses to the U.S. economy from monopoly pricing of oil ranged from $100-$470 billion per year between 1974 and 1990. Strategic Petroleum Reserve The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), of up to one billion barrels of petroleum products, to assure continued supplies of oil during a national emergency as well as reduce the impacts of a severe energy supply disruption. The federal government spends $300 million per year to operate and manage the reserve. A Comparison of Energy Programs, 1975 - 1995 Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ethanol Excise Tax Exemption Amount of Energy Secured 587 million bbls of crude oil - enough for 11.1 billion gallons of gasoline 1.5 billion gallons annually - a total of 12.3 billion gallons since 1975 U.S. Investment to Date $21 billion $6 billion Annual Fiscal Impact $212 million for maintenance plus procurement costs of $25/bbl A net savings of $528 million annually due to increased household and business income tax revenue Cost/Gallon of Energy $0.87/gal of crude oil or $1.89/gal of gasoline $0.54/gal of ethanol, a savings of $0.35/gal when budget savings are considered Jobs 67 55,000 Trade Impact Each barrel of oil purchased for the SPR adds to the trade deficit, of which oil counts for 40% Reduces MTBE imports by more than 1.2 billion annually, and increases exports of ethanol by-products by $800 million annually Gross Domestic Output -0- $5.7 billion annually The U.S.' $21 billion investment in the SPR has generated 67 jobs and contributed to the U.S. trade deficit. In contrast, the $6 billion invested by the U.S. in the ethanol program has generated over 55,000 jobs and a net savings to the Treasury of $528 million a year. Clearly, American taxpayers would be better served by increasing the development and production of alternatives to imported oil, such as ethanol. Promoting domestic, renewable energy sources will increase energy security while ensuring that limited federal resources are spent in the U.S. and not exported offshore in the form of jobs, military protection and American lives. The expanded use of alternatives to petroleum, including renewable ethanol, biodiesel, wind, solar, geothermal, hydro-power, as well as increased domestic oil and gas exploration and production, can fill a market need currently met with imports.

By 1973, U.S. oil imports grew to 35%. Today, we import over 54% of our oil. The Department of Energy's independent Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects this import share will increase to over 60% by 2010. U.S. consumers spend an average of $50 billion annually on oil imports. The transportation sector is a key contributor to our oil dependence. Ninety-seven percent of U.S. transportation energy is petroleum-based in the form of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Over 61% of U.S. oil demand for transportation is imported. The growth in the use of oil, mostly for gasoline, combined with declining U.S. oil production and limited use of alternative fuels are driving the growth in oil imports. "Growing dependence on oil imports from insecure sources...threatens energy security, undermines the U.S. economy, and costs American jobs. Heavy dependence also contributes to the already massive U.S. trade deficit. In 1990, payments for foreign oil amounted to $61.3 billion - about 60% of the total trade deficit." Charles J. DiBona, President American Petroleum Institute March 11, 1991 Future World Oil Demand It is generally agreed that global demand for oil, mainly from developing nations, will grow by 22-34% over the next 15 years. The EIA projects that the world will consume another 20 million barrels of oil a day (MMBD) by the year 2010, up from 69 MMBD in 1995. The use of ethanol-blended fuel can play a significant role in meeting the growing energy demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, "ethanol is the most energy efficient of all liquid transportation fuels, yielding 125% of the energy used in growing the corn, harvesting it, and distilling it into ethanol." In comparison, gasoline production is only 75-80 percent efficient. OPEC's Share of the World Oil Market Reflecting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) control over a majority of the world's oil reserves and increasing world demand, OPEC's share of the world oil market has steadily increased since the mid-1980s. OPEC's control of 66% of the world's proven oil reserves and 55% of the crude oil ultimate resources increases the likelihood of an oil shock. According to projections in the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 1996 "reference case," crude oil imports "are expected to increase by about 2 million barrels per day by 2000" and that by the year 2000, "OPEC will account for more than half of all U.S. petroleum imports." MTBE Imports Also on the Rise Imports of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a methanol-based chemical additive manufactured by the major international oil companies, are rising steadily. MTBE imports have risen from 30 million gallons in 1990 to more than 750 million gallons in 1995, a 24-fold increase in just 5 years. Moreover, the majority of MTBE imports are from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. In 1995, 70% of U.S. imports of MTBE came from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. Saudi Arabia supplied 47%, with the other OPEC nations supplying 23%. While MTBE imports have been growing rapidly over the past several years, this is the first time that the dependence on OPEC countries for the oxygenate has been so apparent. The trend is clearly toward greater MTBE imports, and a greater dependence on OPEC. Ethanol Displaces Energy Imports According to a recent poll conducted by Research Strategy Management for the Sustainable Energy Budget Coalition, 75% of American voters believe the country needs to do something to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. Of these voters, 90% support efforts to develop renewable energy alternatives to oil. Using ethanol, a renewable, clean-burning, domestic fuel, displaces imported oil and will aid the U.S. in meeting its energy demand. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that the same amount of crude oil needed to produce a British thermal unit (Btu) of gasoline can produce over eight Btus of ethanol. Thus, ethanol can be used to leverage domestic crude oil supplies by a factor of 8.

Ethanol reduces pollution through the volumetric displacement of gasoline, and by adding oxygen to the combustion process which helps to greatly reduce exhaust emissions. In fact, the use of ethanol results in reductions in every pollutant regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including ozone, air toxics, carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The EPA considers ozone to be the most widespread air pollution problem. Ethanol provides the following environmental benefits: Reduced CO Emissions Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas that reduces the flow of oxygen in the bloodstream. It is formed by the incomplete combustion of petroleum fuels, which contain no oxygen. The EPA attributes two-thirds of CO emissions to transportation sources. Ethanol, since it contains oxygen, contributes to a cleaner, more efficient burn of gasoline which results in lower CO exhaust emissions. The EPA recognizes that the use of ethanol-blended fuels can reduce CO emissions from vehicle exhaust by as much as 30%. In addition to being a deadly poison, CO has been recognized as an ozone precursor since 1976. Reduced Exhaust VOC Emissions/Ozone Formation Ethanol reduces VOC emissions from automobile exhaust by adding oxygen to the gasoline, which results in more complete (cleaner) combustion. Reductions in exhaust VOCs are very important because exhaust emissions are very reactive, and therefore tend to form ozone more quickly and readily. Several studies have shown that by reducing exhaust VOC emissions and CO emissions, ethanol can help to reduce urban ozone more than any other fuel. Reduced NOx Emissions Another contributor to the formation of urban ozone is NOx. Several components of gasoline will greatly impact NOx emissions, including sulfur, olefins and aromatics. By displacing these components, ethanol can also help to reduce NOx emissions from motor fuels. Reduced Air Toxics Emissions A large fraction of the octane needed for today�s gasolines comes from toxic aromatic components such as benzene, toluene, xylene and tri-methyl benzenes. Ethanol provides an alternative to these octane enhancers, allowing significant reductions in toxic air emissions without sacrificing fuel performance. Reduced Particulate Matter (PM10) Emissions Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers (PM10) is emitted from a variety of stationary and mobile sources. PM10 is regulated by the EPA because these small airborne particles can reach the lower regions of the respiratory tract and cause serious health problems, including damage to lung tissue, cancer and premature death. The use of ethanol significantly reduces tailpipe emissions of PM10 from gasoline, and thus contributes to improved public health. Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions Unlike virtually all other liquid fuels which come from fossil hydrocarbons, such as gasoline and natural gas, ethanol is produced from renewable feedstocks, including agricultural crops and forest residues, citrus and urban wastes and special energy crops. Fossil fuels essentially release carbon trapped in the soil into the atmosphere, where it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that traps the earth's heat, contributing to global warming. Plants, on the other hand, 'breathe' CO2 and give off oxygen, thereby maintaining the balance of CO2 in the atmosphere. The increased use of renewable biomass fuels like ethanol will partially offset the global warming effect of burning gasoline. A U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) analysis concludes that the use of ethanol reduces CO2 emissions 27% more than gasoline, as well as reducing other greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2). Ethanol-blended fuels are the only commercially available fuels which have a CO2 benefit. Ethanol - The Clean Air Solution Because of their environmental benefits, the Clean Air Act requires the addition of oxygenates such as ethanol to gasoline in areas that exceed public health standards for ozone and CO, known as nonattainment areas. Today, approximately 35% of the nation�s gasoline contains some level of oxygenate in order to reduce harmful emissions and improve our nation's air quality.

Highlights of the conference were keynote policy addresses by Senator Dick Durbin(D-IL), American Farm Bureau Federation(AFBF) President Dean Kleckner, and Rep. Denny Hastert(R-IL). Senator Durbin, while mindful of the legislative battle that looms in the 105th Congress regarding elimination of the ethanol tax incentive, expressed optimism that the tax incentive would be maintained. A leading advocate of the domestic ethanol industry, Senator Durbin also stated that he plans to introduce legislation this year to extend the ethanol tax incentive beyond the year 2000, when it is currently slated to expire. AFBF President Dean Kleckner spoke about the importance of ethanol production to American agriculture and rural economies. Rep. Denny Hastert(R-IL) expressed his strong support for the ethanol industry and the importance of maintaining the ethanol tax incentive (See p. 3). Tom Winninger of the Winninger Institute gave a dynamic and thought-provoking presentation to ethanol marketers and blenders, admonishing the industry to be more creative and aggressive in marketing their product. Watch for exerpts from feature presentations at the National Conference on Ethanol Policy & Marketing in future issues of the Ethanol Report. MAYOR DALEY PROCLAIMS ETHANOL WEEK IN CHICAGO With ethanol industry advocates converging in Chicago to participate in the National Conference on Ethanol Policy & Marketing, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley proclaimed February 3-9, 1997, "Ethanol Week in Chicago". An ozone nonattainment area, Chicago participates in the federal reformulated gasoline program, and currently represents the largest U.S. ethanol market. PROCLAMATION "Whereas, automobile pollution in our nation's cities is a continuing drain on our economy in lost productivity and health care costs that must be addressed; Whereas, ethanol fuels help to reduce harmful air pollutants emitted from vehicles, including carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, air toxics and particulates; Whereas, ethanol is an important and growing value-added agricultural product that increases farm income, creates jobs for Americans and stimulates the economy; Whereas, domestic oil production has dramatically declined since 1980, and today the U.S. imports more than 50% of our total energy use, threatening our energy security and harming our economy; Whereas, the availability of ethanol in the market allows independent gasoline marketers choices that enable them to price-compete with major oil companies, reducing the price of gasoline to consumers; Whereas, Chicago is the largest ethanol market in the U.S., with 205 million gallons of ethanol-blended fuel sold each month or 2.4 billion gallons per year; Now, therefore, I, Richard Daley, Mayor of the City of Chicago, do hereby proclaim February 3-9, 1997, Ethanol Week in the City of Chicago." GAO CONCLUDES IMPORTING LOW-COST OIL PROVIDES LARGE ECONOMIC BENEFITS The General Accounting Office(GAO) has issued a report stating that the U.S. economy benefits to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars annually by using low-cost imported oil rather than relying on "more expensive" domestic energy sources. The report, "Energy Security: Evaluating U.S. Vulnerability to Oil Supply Disruptions and Options for Mitigating Their Effects," was requested by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich. "I find it utterly irresponsible for the GAO to go on record extolling the virtues of importedoil to our economy." According to the GAO, compared with alternative domestic sources of energy, "imported oil represents a relatively low-cost source of fuel to the U.S. economy." The report concludes that "U.S. consumers and businesses gain hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits annually from access to relatively low-cost foreign oil. These benefits accrue from avoiding the expenses of relying more extensively on higher-cost domestic energy. By most estimates, the day-to-day benefits for the United States of relying on low-cost fuel oil substantially exceed the occasional, but severe, costs of disruptions to the world oil supply." "I find it utterly irresponsible for the GAO to go on record extolling the virtues of imported oil to our economy," said Eric Vaughn, President of the RFA. "While major oil companies continue to export jobs overseas and gasoline-powered vehicles emit harmful pollutants, the GAO would rather see us continue down the road to increased oil imports rather than increase the production and use of cleaner-burning, domestically-produced fuels. This is nonsense." The Department of Energy was equally critical of the GAO's analysis. According to the DOE, "the attempted comparison between the economic benefits of imported oil and the potential economic costs of vulnerability to oil shocks yields no insight into the overall consequences of oil imports." FEED CO-PRODUCT HANDBOOKS HIGHLIGHT VALUE OF ETHANOL BYPRODUCTS Reflecting the growing importance of byproducts to the economic viability of ethanol production, the domestic ethanol industry and the nation's corn growers have produced two corn co-product reference handbooks describing the high quality corn co-products available to the feed industry. The guides, "Feed Co-Products of the Corn Wet Milling Process" and "Feed Co-Products of the Corn Dry Milling Process," provide valuable information for the feeding industry on the nutritional, economic, production and use value of corn co-products. Each handbook contains a description of the manufacturing of ethanol process, nutrient composition, livestock feeding trials, recommended feeding levels and references. The RFA and the Iowa Corn Growers Association(ICGA) spearheaded the project. "As corn growers work to increase the volume of value-added processing, the marketing of livestock co-products is critical to the success of the entire corn industry," said Tim Burrack, president, ICGA. "Increased use of high-protein, economical feed ingredients from corn could boost profitability for the state's livestock producers." The processes of producing ethanol for fuel and beverage alcohol utilize only the starch portion of the grain, leaving behind high-value, high-protein, high-vitamin content feed products called distillers dried grains or corn gluten feed. These feeds can provide a nourishing supplement to livestock and poultry diets. "The books will be a valuable resource tool for dairy producers, cattle feeders, the poultry industry, nutritionists, feed consultants, veterinarians and feed sales personnel," said Jerry Weigel, Director of Nutrition and Regulatory Affairs at ExSeed Genetics, L.L.C., and chief author of the handbooks.

Hastert Sends Strong Message to Archer The Illinois Republican Congressional delegation, led by Rep. Denny Hastert, Chief Deputy Whip, voiced its opposition to eliminating the partial excise tax exemption in a letter to Rep. Bill Archer, Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee. The Members wrote, "Recent reports have quoted you as saying the ethanol tax credit is anachronistic and needs to be updated. While we share the strong conviction that sacrifices must be made to balance the budget, we do not believe our nation's farmers should be singled out." "Ethanol and its tax treatment is not 'anachronistic.' Rather, they are an integral part of American agriculture -- especially as we are continuing to reduce farm subsidies and ask farmers to seek more of their income through the marketplace. It simply is not fair to ask farmers to look to the marketplace for their income and then, take a sizeable portion of the market away." "New plants, as well as the expansion of existing facilities, are currently underway based on the fact that the excise tax exemption will remain until the year 2000. These entrepreneurs count on the government keeping their word, not changing the rules in the middle of the game." Signers of Letter to Rep. Archer Denny Hastert Tom Ewing Ray LaHood Jerry Weller John Shimkus John Porter Donald Manzullo Harris Fawell Rep. Hastert Addresses Ethanol Conference Rep. Hastert also shared his outlook for the ethanol industry with attendees of the National Conference on Ethanol Policy & Marketing. Rep. Hastert acknowledged that there is a tough battle ahead for the industry, but expressed confidence that any attempt to retreat from the government's committment to the ethanol industry would be soundly defeated. Rep. Minge Challenges Anti-Ethanol Bill In response to a "Dear Colleague" from Rep. Phil English (R-PA) inviting co-sponsors of H.R. 161, legislation that would eliminate the ethanol tax incentive, Rep. David Minge (D-MN) invited Rep. English to "take a tour on any one of the four farmer-owned cooperative ethanol plants in my district. You can talk face to face with any one of the 500-odd farmer-owners of any of these plants or folks who are concerned about the environment. They can tell you the impact the ethanol tax exemption has had on them." In his letter, Rep. Minge attempted to correct the several misstatements made in the Dear Colleague. In response to the claim that ethanol does not provide environmental benefits, Rep. Minge countered, "according to the EPA, the use of ethanol-blended fuels reduces carbon monoxide emissions by 30% as well as reducing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides(NOx), ozone, air toxics and particulate matter... I am sure your constituents in the Erie area would benefit from reductions of these pollutants by using ethanol blended fuel." Rep. Minge noted, "If one subtracts the costs of the explicit and implicit subsidies that benefit the oil industry, you would quickly find that the subsidies we provide to the oil industry to make it competitive are far more expensive than this tax incentive." In response to the statement that the ethanol incentive does not help farmers but rather one corporation, Rep. Minge replied, "I am proud to say that the second largest producer of ethanol is Minnesota Corn Processors, a 5000 strong farmer-owned cooperative in my district. In fact, cooperatively-owned ethanol plants represent the future of the industry and have experienced the most growth in ethanol production during the last five years." Rep. Minge plans to reintroduce legislation introduced in the last Congress(H.R. 2232) which would amend the Small Producers Tax Credit, a ten cents per gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of ethanol produced. As currently written, farmer cooperatives are the only business entity that cannot take advantage of the credit. The following article is the second in a series that will address some of the questions raised by Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, in his effort to undermine political support for the federal ethanol program: What environmental benefits, if any, have the incentive produced? Ethanol has the highest oxygen content of any fuel additive available today. As such, ethanol will reduce exhaust or tailpipe emissions from vehicles more effectively than any other oxygenate. Thus, ethanol and its ether derivative ETBE will provide significant reductions in carbon monoxide and ozone pollution, will displace toxics such as benzene, and will reduce NOx and particulate emissions. Finally, because ethanol is produced from renewable agricultural feedstocks, ethanol is the only transportation fuel available today that will help to reduce greenhouse gases. EPA Administrator Carol Browner testified before the Senate Agricultural Committee: "renewable fuels are a vital part of the clean gasoline programs that are proving so successful in reducing air pollution in our nation's largest cities. In addition to reducing dangerous smog and carbon monoxide, EPA believes renewable fuels can also help to combat the unhealthy heating of the Earth's atmosphere known as global warming." The environmental benefits of ethanol include: 1. Clean Volume": A large fraction of the octane needed for today's gasolines comes from toxic aromatic components such as benzene, touene, xylene and tri-methyl benzenes. Ethanol provides an alternative to such octane enhancers, and allows significant reductions in toxic emissions, without sacrificing fuel performance. It would not be possible for most refiners to meet the year-round 15% reduction in toxic emissions required by the Clean Air Act in a cost-effective fashion without the dilution effect of oxygenates, such as ethanol. 2. Reduced Carbon Monoxide Emissions: Because ethanol has the highest oxygen content of any fuel additive, it provides the greatest reductions in carbon monoxide(CO). EPA data demonstrates that a 10% ethanol blend will reduce CO as much as 30%. As a result, the use of ethanol in the oxy-fuel program for CO nonattainment areas has been critically important to the success of that program. Since 1992, when the oxy-fuel program began, more than a third of the CO nonattainment areas have been redesignated as in compliance. In addition to being a deadly poison itself, CO is a recognized ozone precursor. Recently, the National Academy of Science noted the role of CO in the formation of urban ozone in its report, Rethinking the Ozone Problem in Urban and Regional Air Pollution. By dramatically reducing CO emissions, even in the summer months when CO pollution itself may not present a health hazard, ethanol helps to reduce urban ozone. 3. Reduced Exhaust VOC Emissions: Unlike low-RVP gasoline which only reduces evaporative VOC emissions, oxygenates reduce exhaust VOC emissions. Reductions in exhaust VOC's are particularly important because exhaust emissions are higher in reactivity (a measure of ozone-forming potential) than evaporative emissions. Moreover, as a percentage of total VOC emissions, it is now generally accepted that exhaust VOC's contribute greater mass than evaporative VOC's, and are more important in terms of reducing ozone. 4. Lower Reactivity: Oxygenates displace other more reactive components currently used in gasoline. For example, certain aromatics, such as xylene, and olefins are highly reactive and will greatly exacerbate urban ozone. Oxygenates are far less reactive and contribute very little to the formation of ozone. By displacing such components through the reformulation of gasoline, oxygenates help to reduce ozone even more than the reductions in mass VOC exhaust emissions attributable to oxygen content would suggest. 5. Reduced NOx Emissions: NOx is also necessary for the formation of urban ozone. EPA's complex model demonstrates that for some fuel formulations the NOx reduction from oxygenates is quite significant. The benefit is largely attributable to the dilution effect of oxygenates. Ethanol displaces other components of gasoline, such as sulfur, that increase NOx emissions.

As a nation we spend millions, if not billions, of federal tax dollars each year assuring access to imported oil for a handful of multi-national corporations. Nonetheless, as the 105th Congress reconvenes, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the powerful House Ways & Means Committee, is calling for the elimination of the federal excise tax exemption and the blenders tax incentive on reformulated fuels, such as ethanol blended fuels. In addition, many state legislatures are talking about the elimination or reduction of state excise tax exemptions on reformulated fuels. National Farmers Union supports expansion of current national energy programs that have improved air quality in U.S. cities, provided economic opportunities and reduced U.S. dependence on foreign oil. American consumers also recognize the social, environmental and economic value of renewable fuels and are committed to encouraging the development and use of renewable fuels with tax dollars. In a poll conducted following the November 1996 elections by the Republican polling firm, Research/Strategy/Management, Inc., 82 percent of Americans said they prefer directing current federal tax policies to encourage the use of domestically produced renewable fuels. In fact, 71 percent said they support continuing the federal 5.4 cent-per-gallon excise tax exemption for ethanol-blended fuels. The overwhelming support of U.S. renewable fuels policy varied little among Republicans, Democrats and Independents. Ethanol has played a major part in reducing pollution in the nation's major cities. The 1996 fiscal year annual report of the Environmental Protection Agency recognized the Reformulated Gasoline Program as a major element in improving the nation's air quality. The EPA report showed significant reductions in concentrations of toxic air pollutants. Benzene was reduced approximately 38 percent between 1994 and 1995. Carbon monoxide fell by 15 percent, and volatile organic compounds were reduced by 15 percent. With results like these, it is clear why three in four Americans say they are willing to continue tax incentives to ethanol blenders. Ethanol production creates American jobs. The ethanol industry is currently responsible for over 40,000 direct and indirect American jobs, contributing more than $5.6 billion annually to the U.S. economy. Ethanol production utilizes more than 5 percent of the nation's corn crop. The corn demand for ethanol production increased corn producers' incomes by more than $1.2 billion--or about 11 percent--in 1994. "World oil demand will grow by 11 billion barrels per day over the next five years, while currently producing fields reduce production by 8 billion barrels per day." Ethanol industry development reduces our dependence on foreign oil. Simmons & Co., a Houston-based oil consulting firm, predicts that world oil demand will grow by 11 billion barrels per day over the next five years, while currently producing fields reduce production by 8 billion barrels per day. Meeting this additional 19 billion barrel-per-day demand won't come cheaply. Already, refiners in the U.S., Europe and Japan that a decade ago produced at 75 percent of maximum capacity, are being worked at nearly 95 percent capacity. Wouldn't it be wise for the U.S. to secure its energy needs before a worldwide shortage occurs? We as citizens need to let our elected representatives know of our commitment to renewable sources for America's energy needs in the 21st century. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO ELIMINATING ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE Rep. Bill Archer's (R-TX) stated intention to eliminate the ethanol tax incentive in the 105th Congress has evoked a strong negative reaction on Capitol Hill. Last week, Rep. Lane Evans (D-IL) circulated a letter signed by 12 key Members of Congress representing 8 different states expressing opposition to Archer's "intention to propose cuts to the federal tax incentive for ethanol." The letter, which was also sent to members of the Transportation Tax Task Force established by Archer, states, "Ethanol has proven to be an important economic investment in domestic renewable energy. It has reduced our nation's dependence on imported energy, created thousands of jobs throughout rural America, reduced air pollution, and increased energy security." "At a time when rural America is in need of our help, we believe that cutting the tax incentive would be untimely and detrimental to the U.S. economy. The ethanol tax incentive enjoys strong, bi-partisan support in Congress and is considered essential by American agricultural and financial leaders." Ethanol Letter to Archer Lane Evans (D-IL) David Minge (D-MN) Glenn Poshard (D-IL) Jim Traficant (D-OH) Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) Bill Lipinski (D-IL) Jim Leach (R-IA) Jerry Costello (D-IL) Tom Ewing (R-IL) Jim Walsh (R-NY) Scott Klug (R-WI) Bill Barrett (R-NE) REP. ENGLISH INTRODUCES BILL TO ELIMINATE ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE As he did during the last Congress, Representative Phil English (R-PA) has again introduced legislation to eliminate the federal ethanol program. The legislation, H.R. 161, would eliminate all the applicable tax incentives for ethanol-blends, E-85, and ETBE in 1998, two years earlier than currently slated to expire. To date, Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) are co-sponsors of H.R. 161. Rep. English has characterized his legislation as eliminating the tax incentive for large ethanol producers only. In fact, the bill eliminates the tax incentives for all gasoline marketers, regardless of size. While Rep. English has left in place a small producer tax credit (an income tax credit of 10 cents per gallon), the fact is this tax credit cannot be widely used by any ethanol producer. In order to take advantage of the income tax credit, a producer must have significant income to offset liabilities. In the highly competitive ethanol production industry, no producer can generate enough tax liability to take advantage of the credit. Moreover, because many of the small producers are owned by farmer cooperatives, they cannot pass the benefit along to their members. Rep. David Minge (D-MN) sponsored legislation in the 104th Congress to correct the anomalies in the small producer tax credit that prevent it from being utilized by ethanol producers. Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, has stated his intention to eliminate the ethanol tax incentive in the 105th Congress. The following article is the first in a series that will address some of the questions he has raised in his effort to undermine political support for the federal ethanol program: Who do the tax incentives for ethanol benefit and disadvantage economically? The direct beneficiaries of the tax incentives for ethanol use are the oil companies that blend and market ethanol fuels. In fact, only oil companies are allowed to claim the excise and income tax benefits provided by law. Specifically, I.R.C. �4081 provides gasoline refiners and marketers selling ethanol-blended gasolines a 5.4� per gallon excise tax benefit (assuming a 10% blend is used, a lesser excise tax exemption is available for lower level blends of ethanol) from the 18.1� excise tax on gasoline. As an alternative, I.R.C. �40 allows oil companies using ethanol to claim a 54� per gallon income tax credit. The existence of the tax incentive allows refiners and marketers to purchase ethanol for octane or oxygen content at competitive prices. The tax incentive has been a pro-competitive influence on the nation's transportation fuel markets. This point is reinforced by the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America in a recent letter to the Senate Finance Committee: "the federal benefits afforded ethanol-blended fuels have been an important, pro-competitive influence on the nation's gasoline markets. By enhancing the ability of independent marketers to price-compete with their integrated oil company competitors, this program has increased independent marketers' economic viability and reduced consumers' costs of gasoline." The indirect beneficiaries of the federal ethanol program are numerous, and include consumers, farmers and, of course, ethanol producers. As noted above, the ethanol incentive benefits consumers by helping reduce the consumer price of gasoline by providing independent gasoline marketers with octane and oxygenate choices that enable them to price-compete with their major oil company competitors. As a result, the nation's largest consumer organization in the country, Citizen Action, strongly supports the increased use of ethanol. According to Ed Rothschild, Energy Director for Citizen Action, "The use of ethanol, a domestically-produced, cleaner-burning renewable fuel helps American consumers use less polluting oil and reduces dependence on costly oil imports, which are in part subsidized by huge foreign tax credits." By creating important additional value-added markets for grain, the ethanol tax incentive also helps farmers. According to one recent report, the ethanol industry supports 55,000 jobs, creates $7 billion in economic activity including $2.2 billion in increased farm income annually, and generates more than $555 million in net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury each year. It is for this reason that farm organizations across the country enthusiastically support the federal ethanol program. As noted in one recent letter to the Congress from national agricultural groups: "Perhaps more than anyone, farmers recognize the need for and are committed to balancing the budget and eliminating unnecessary federal spending. The 1996 Farm Bill clearly reflects that commitment. But the federal ethanol program is not an example of unnecessary spending. The tax incentives for ethanol production have helped build this important value-added industry, just as federal incentives have helped support the domestic oil and gas industry. The ethanol program is sound public policy that deserves to be maintained." Finally, because the ethanol tax incentive allows ethanol producers to successfully market their product, they also benefit from the tax incentive. The federal ethanol program has built a domestic ethanol industry that today has a capacity of more than 1.5 billion gallons at 52 plants across the country, utilizes more than 600 million bushels of grain, and supports more than 55,000 jobs. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INCREASES E-85 PURCHASES The General Services Administration (GSA) has agreed to increase its total purchases of E-85 Ford Tauruses to 1,029, up from 702, according to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition. Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), a percentage of the federal government's new vehicle purchases must be alternative fueled vehicles (AFV). The percentages are 33% in 1997, 50% in 1998, and 75% thereafter. President Clinton signed an Executive Order in December recommitting the federal government to these purchase requirements. In order to meet the 1997 requirement, the federal government would need to purchase 11,000 AFVs. "The 1,029 E-85 vehicles still fall short of the mark. This is disappointing since state governments are meeting or exceeding the new standards established by the federal government," said LaMoine Smith, Nebraska Corn Board. CHRYSLER UNVEILS ETHANOL-BASED FUEL CELL VEHICLE Chrysler Corporation introduced a fuel-cell vehicle that is capable of reforming ethanol into hydrogen on board the vehicle at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, January 11-20. The technology to reform ethanol was developed in cooperation with Arthur D. Little, the Illinois Corn Marketing Board, and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs. The fuel-cell vehicles use reformer technology to store fuel-such as ethanol-as a liquid, converting it to hydrogen on an as-needed basis. It is not feasible to store hydrogen on-board a vehicle as the gas takes up 3,000 times more space than liquid fuel. "Fuel cells are twice as efficient as conventional internal combustion engines, cutting fuel costs to consumers in half and decreasing the U.S. reliance on imported energy sources," said Bill Mitchell, Program Manager for the Arthur D. Little hydrogen technology unit. "The fuel cell story is generating excitement nationwide, but people are missing an important part of the story. This technology was designed to run on ethanol, which means it will run best on a domestically produced fuel," said Illinois Corn Marketing Board Research Committee Chairman John Phipps.

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), ethanol production exceeded 78,000 barrels per day (bb/d) in October and November, and is estimated to exceed 82,000 bb/d in December. This compares with a 4th quarter average in 1995 of 85,000 bb/d. Earlier this year, ethanol production fell to just under 40,000 bb/d, a record low in recent years, as corn prices topped $5/bushel because of historically low stockpiles and high export demand. At the same time, gasoline prices fell over the summer, greatly reducing octane margins. "The ethanol industry has weathered the storm, and the outlook is good for 1997 following a 9.3 billion bushel 1996 corn crop," said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association. Ethanol Production Competitive with Other Oxygenates Rising ethanol production, combined with rising methanol prices and thus reduced domestic MTBE production, has brought the U.S. oxygenate market into competitive balance once again. At more than 80 M bb/d, ethanol production now represents 82% of domestic MTBE production at merchant facilities. However, MTBE imports also continue to rise, taking a larger percentage of the U.S. oxygenate market. DeWitt & Company estimates that MTBE imports now exceed 61 M bb/d, or approximately 64% of domestic merchant MTBE production. 1996 MTBE imports are expected to exceed 935,000 gallons, only slightly less than total ethanol production for the year. As noted by Jack Huggins, President of Pekin Energy, during testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee this past fall, such a level of imported MTBE is an additional threat to U.S. energy security and "represents imports for product that could be met with domestic production." AG GROUPS REITERATE SUPPORT FOR ETHANOL Sending a strong message of support for the federal ethanol program, the nation's leading agricultural organizations joined in writing a letter to each member of the Transportation Tax Task Force reiterating agriculture's support for the ethanol tax incentive. The Transportation Tax Task Force is an informal task force created by House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) to review transportation-related taxes in anticipation of the reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund later this year. Chairman Archer has stated his intention to eliminate the ethanol tax exemption during the 105th Congress. "The ethanol program is sound public policy... we hope that you will keep the views of farmers in mind, and preserve this vital domestic energy, environmental and agricultural program." Citing their support for ethanol, the agricultural groups note that "in 1995 alone, more than 560 million bushels of grain were processed into ethanol, increasing farm income by more than $2.2 billion and adding more than $7 billion to the national economy." Ethanol also "helps to reduce our balance of trade by increasing exports of ethanol coproducts, including corn gluten, and lowering imports of oil and petroleum products." Ethanol "is also a critical component of cleaner reformulated gasolines that are helping many U.S. cities meet air quality standards." The authors note that "perhaps more than anyone, farmers recognize the need for and are committed to balancing the budget and eliminating unnecessary federal spending." "The 1996 Farm Bill clearly reflects that commitment." However, "the federal ethanol program is not an example of unnecessary spending. The tax incentives for ethanol production have helped to build this important value-added industry, just as federal incentives have helped support the domestic oil and gas industry." The letter concludes, "The ethanol program is sound public policy that deserves to be maintained. As you begin your review of transportation tax issues, we hope that you will keep the views of farmers in mind, and preserve this vital domestic energy, environmental and agricultural program." The letter was signed by the following organizations: American Farm Bureau Federation American Soybean Association CENEX Corn Refiners Association Nat'l Association of State Departments of Agriculture National Association of Wheat Growers National Corn Growers Association National Council of Farmer Cooperatives National Farmers Union National Grain and Feed Association National Grange National Pork Producers Council Renewable Fuels Association Transportation Tax Task Force Mac Collins (R-GA) Ben Cardin (D-MD) John Lewis (D-GA) Jim McCrery (R-LA) Jennifer Dunn (R-WA) Wally Herger (R-CA) Jon Christensen (R-NE) Richard Neal (D-MA) EIA RELEASES SECOND SURVEY RESULTS OF AFV INDUSTRY More than 385,000 vehicles in the U.S. will be powered by fuels other than gasoline and diesel in 1997, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Of these vehicles, 70 percent will operate on propane, 20 percent on natural gas, and the remaining alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) will be alcohol-fueled and electric vehicles. The EIA estimates that by 1997, alternative and replacement fuels, including oxygenates such as ethanol, will account for 2.7 percent of the fuel used by on-road vehicles (on a gasoline-equivalent gallon basis), up from 1.6 percent in 1992. Consumption of alternative and replacement fuels is expected to increase about 5 percent from 1995 to 1997, to 4 billion gasoline equivalent gallons. DENVER PROVES OXYFUEL EFFICACY;CITY REPORTS NO CO EXCEEDANCES IN 1996 For the first time since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, Denver did not have a single violation of federal air quality standards in 1996. Denver has a history of exceedingly high carbon monoxide pollution, and with passage of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, was designated a serious carbon monoxide (CO) non-attainment area. Since the introduction of the mandatory oxygenated fuels program in 1991, Denver has experienced a significant decline in carbon monoxide emissions. There were two carbon monoxide violations in 1995, one in 1994, and six in 1992, compared with 125 in 1972. In order to be redesignated by the Environmental Protection Agency as in attainment, Denver must have three consecutive years with no federal air quality standards violations. "We believe that this clean air success story is being used by opponents to threaten the program... Colorado is the fifth fastest growing state in the nation. We continue to need all the help that oxyfuels provide." In light of the effectiveness of oxygenated fuels in reducing CO emissions in Denver, a number of environmental and health related organizations have asked the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission to maintain Denver's oxyfuel program. The American Lung Association, Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Colorado Environmental Coalition, and Coloradans for Clean Air are opposed to the shortening or weakening of Colorado's oxygenated gasoline program. "We believe that this clean air success story is being used by opponents to threaten the program," said Barbara Charnes, Executive Director of Coloradans for Clean Air. "Colorado is the fifth fastest growing state in the nation. We continue to need all the help that oxyfuels provide." According to the organizations, "the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for CO significantly underestimates vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Any shortening or weakening of the program would be a serious public health concern in light of the underestimated and rapidly increasing VMT. They note that health researchers have found a consistent link between increasing levels of ambient CO and increasing hospital admissions for congestive heart failure for the elderly. In Colorado, 134,500 people are at risk for CO pollution. "The oxygenated gasoline program is a very cost-effective strategy to reduce carbon monoxide pollution. Furthermore, as the program provides significant air quality and public health benefits, we should not shorten or weaken the program in light of Colorado's growth and increasing vehicle miles traveled," concluded the statement. The effectiveness of oxyfuels in substantially reducing CO concentrations was demonstrated in a comprehensive analysis recently completed by Systems Applications International (SAI). The study found that when wintertime oxyfuel is used, the corresponding ambient CO concentrations are reduced by approximately 14 percent. EPA CREDITS RFG WITH REDUCING POLLUTION According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) annual report on air quality trends, the nation's air is about 30 percent cleaner today than it was 25 years ago. According to the National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, emissions of the nation's six major pollutants. According to the report, carbon monoxide, ozone, NOx, PM10, sulfur dioxide and lead have decreased by 29 percent over the last 25 years, even though the gross domestic product, total population and vehicle miles traveled rose considerably. Reformulated gasoline (RFG) was credited with a significant decline in the concentration of toxic air pollutants, including ambient benzene levels, which decreased 38 percent from 1994 to 1995. Carbon monoxide pollution, which is primarily caused by vehicle exhaust, fell 10 percent between 1994 and 1995. "Reformulated gasoline has proven to be the most cost-effective means of reducing harmful levels of air pollutants," said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association. FTC FUEL AND VEHICLE LABELING GUIDES AVAILABLE The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prepared two business guides -- Labeling Fuels and Labeling Alternative Fueled Vehicles -- to answer questions about the FTC's Labeling Requirements for Alternative Fuels and Alternative Fueled Vehicles Rule. The Rule was issued in May, 1995 in compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Rule applies to manufacturers and retailers of new alternative fueled vehicles, dealers of used alternative fueled vehicles, and certain conversion companies; producers, refiners, distributors and retailers of non-liquid alternative vehicle fuels; and makers of electric vehicle fuel dispensing systems. These guides explain the Rule, address commonly asked questions, and include sample labels as well as a copy of the Rule for reference. Labeling Fuels also explains the provisions of the Automotive Fuel Ratings, Certification and Posting Rule, which deals with liquid automotive fuels (except diesel), including liquid alternative fuels. The FTC has also completed a consumer-oriented brochure entitled Consider the Alternatives: Alternative Fueled Vehicles and Alternative Vehicle Fuels. The brochure explains the labels that consumers see on alternative fuel dispensers and on AFVs. For copies of these brochures, contact the FTC, Public Reference Branch, Room 130, Washington, DC 20580; (202) 326-2222. The full text is also available on the Internet at http://www.ftc.gov.

According to the poll released by the Sustainable Energy Coalition, American voters strongly favor federal research funding and tax incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency over fossil fuels and nuclear power. The national public opinion survey, "America Speaks Out on Energy: A Survey of 1996 Post-Election Views," was conducted by the Republican polling firm R/S/M, Inc. It is the latest in a series of annual surveys on energy and the environment that began in 1988. Which Program Should Receive Highest Funding Priority? For a third year in a row, voters give the highest priority for funding for the U.S. Department of Energy's research budget to renewable energy (34%) and energy efficiency (22%). Nearly a third of respondents (31%) feel nuclear power is the energy source that should be subject to budget cuts, followed by fossil fuels (21%). The Sustainable Energy Coalition is a coalition of more than 40 national environmental, business, government and utility organizations that favor shifting federal energy funding priorities from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewable energy and energy efficiency. Copies of the survey can be obtained by calling Ken Bossong, (301) 270-2258. VOTERS SUPPORT CONTINUING ETHANOL TAX INCENTIVE As part of the Sustainable Energy Coalition post-election survey, voters were asked whether the government should continue the federal tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasoline, and 7 out of 10 (71%) voters responded that they support continuing the ethanol tax incentive. Only 19.8% of those surveyed oppose the exemption. Party affiliation does not appear to have any impact on the level of support, with 70.1% of Republicans, 72.8% of Democrats, 68% of Independents, and 72.7% of Reform Party members supporting the exemption. "Support for the ethanol tax incentive is both strong and bi-partisan," said Vaughn. "Voters realize that this is a program which creates jobs and stimulates investment here at home, while reducing our nation's trade deficit and improving the economy." Position on Continuing the Tax Exemption for Ethanol-Blended Gasoline This survey validates our belief that House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Archer's misguided intention to repeal the ethanol incentive is not supported by voters. Voters were also asked whether the government should continue to give tax breaks or subsidies to oil companies to ensure a steady supply of oil, and 8 out of 10 responded that they prefer redirecting current federal tax policies to encourage the use of domestically produced fuels. Who Should Receive Tax Breaks? DECLINING PRODUCTION, RISING CONSUMPTION INCREASING RELIANCE ON OIL IMPORTS According to the early release of its Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 1997, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects crude oil production in the U.S. will decline to 5.2 million barrels a day in 2015 as a result of lower projected oil prices. This compares with the projection of 5.8 million barrels per day in the 1996 AEO. On average, U.S. oil production declines by 1.1 percent a year between 1995 and 2015, consistent with long-term historical trends. The EIA does not anticipate advances in oil discovery technologies will be sufficient to offset declining resources. Average world crude oil prices are projected to be about $21/bbl (�95$) in 2015, $5 lower than the $26/bbl projection from 1996. The EIA notes that lower prices reflect expectations that oil production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will expand and that technology advances will sustain non-OPEC production. The lower energy prices predicted in the 1997 AEO result in higher total consumption projections for 2015. In fact, the EIA assumes that increases in light-duty vehicle miles traveled more than offset the increases in vehicle efficiency throughout the projection period. Oil Import Share to Rise from 44 to 61% Declining production and rising consumption lead to growing reliance on petroleum imports through 2015. The EIA projects the share of petroleum consumption met by imports to rise from 44% in 1995 (measured in barrels per day) to 61% by 2015. U.S. Trade Deficit Reaches Record $48 Bln The U.S. trade deficit soared to $48 bln from July-September, the worst quarter ever, as American exports fell for the first time in three years. Historically, oil imports are the single largest component of the U.S. trade deficit. Domestic ethanol production displaces over 43.5 mln barrels of imported oil per year, decreasing our trade deficit by $645 mln. RESEARCHERS STRIVE TO INCREASE ETHANOL YIELD FROM CORN The following is excerpted from an article written by Ben Hardin, ARS, that appeared in Agricultural Research, October 1996 Ethanol to fuel cars early in the 21st century may come from fiber-laden crop residues - instead of feed grains - if a vision of agricultural researchers at Peoria, Illinois, pans out. But before that vision is fully realized, science and technology will most likely enable ethanol producers to squeeze a bit more ethanol from corn - the main source at present. Through fermentation of starches and sugars found inside the grain, modern ethanol plants now produce 2.5 gallons of ethyl alcohol - ethanol - from each bushel of corn. [Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (NCAUR)] have their sights set on making fiber in the grain's outer layer yield nearly 0.3 additional gallons per bushel. The wet-milling process involves soaking, or steeping, the corn in water, grinding it, and separating high-protein germ, oil, and fiber from the starchy endosperm that is fermented to produce ethanol. The current practice is to mix the fiber fraction with fermentation solubles before drying it and forming animal feeds. "We estimate that if the fiber were also processed into ethanol, a corn wet-milling facility that produces 100 million gallons of ethanol per year could generate an additional $4 to $8 million of annual income," says microbiologist Robert Hespell. The research strategy for economically converting fiber to ethanol is three pronged. They hope to: find better ways to physically and chemically treat the fiber to expedite its conversion to sugars, find enzymes that better convert the fiber to sugars, and custom engineer suitable microbes to ferment the sugars D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-arabinose. At College Station, Texas A&M University, researchers applied a pretreatment called ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) to corn fiber to unlock its potential for fermentation. With it, NCAUR scientists found they could convert some 50 to 60 percent of the pretreated fiber's components - cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch - into fermentable sugars called monosaccharides, while converting an additional 20 to 30 percent of the fiber into short sugar polymers. In the AFEX process, a slurry of water and corn fiber is mixed with highly pressurized liquid ammonia. Quickly releasing the pressure splits the fiber's bundles of carbohydrate components that are normally rather inaccessible to chemicals or microbes because they are so tightly glued together by lignin. Researchers treated the lignin-freed polymers with mixtures of commercial enzymes. Some enzymes called amylases and cellulases thoroughly hydrolyzed, or split apart, chains of starch and cellulose into links of simple fermentable sugars such as glucose, each with a backbone of six carbon atoms. Today's ethanol plants typically use bakers' yeast - Saccharomyces cerevisiae - to produce ethanol only from these 6-carbon sugars called hexoses. From the corn hemicellulose, or arabinoxylan, xylanase enzymes clipped off at least 25 percent of the component pentoses or 5-carbon sugars - monosaccharides such as arabinose and xylose. That success was enough to spur a search for xylanases that might be recruited to enhance ethanol production. "If we can find bacteria that produce more active xylanases, this ethanol research might also lead to improving the efficiency with which ruminant livestock such as cattle and sheep digest hemicellulosic crop residues," says Hespell. AGRICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS By Steve Wentworth In the late 1980s and the early �90s, the years when I was involved in the leadership of the National Corn Growers Association, most agriculturists would respond to any challenge from the environmental community with predictable arguments: "Farmers are the original environmentalists." Or "Our children drink this well water," implying that farmers wouldn't intentionally expose their family or factory to pollution. Those statements were fine for starters, but they often failed to convince critics concerned about trace levels of nitrates or pesticides. To retain society's trust we need to demonstrate and quantify how we are making environmental progress, not just complain that we are misunderstood. When I spoke to an audience of 500 consumers and environmentalists recently, I stressed how technology has allowed me - and the rest of American agriculture - to continually improve the relationship between farming and the environment. Just compare an 80-acre corn field I cropped in 1974, the year I started farming, to the same field 20 years later. It is testimony that high yields and environmentally friendly farming can co-exist: In 1974 the field across the road from my home produced 11,200 bushels of corn or 140 bushels per acre. [In 1994], the same field yielded 226 bushels per acre or a total production of over 18,000 bushels. Obviously, good weather plays a role, but it was still a 60% increase. I applied 190 lb. of supplemental nitrogen to the corn in 1974. Twenty years later I raise a bigger crop on 40 lb. less nitrogen, a 20% reduction. All 150 units of nitrogen came from ammonium sulfate, a byproduct of lysine production at a local corn processing plant, and was recycled on that field. While U.S. consumers have increased their reliance on foreign oil since the Arab embargo, I have cut my consumption more than 80%. Back in 1974 it took 113 machinery hours and 865 gal. of fuel to farm that 80 acres. Through reduced tillage and larger equipment, I was able to plant, raise and harvest the crop with just 23 hours of equipment time and 147 gallons of fuel. Upshot: While U.S. consumers have increased their reliance on foreign oil since the Arab embargo, I have cut my consumption more than 80%. For weed control in 1974, I applied 8 lb. of herbicides per acre. By planting a seed corn variety bred to be imazethapyr-tolerant today, I had virtually no weeds while using 4 oz. of Pursuit per acre or only 2.5 gal. on the whole field. Roughly 50% of all Illinois farmland exceeded the tolerable limits for soil loss in 1974. Now due to the rapid adoption of no-till and conservation tillage, less than 25% exceeds the standard. Just a year ago, I and several other farmers helped start a new organization: Foundation EARTH (Environment, Agriculture, Research and Technology in Harmony). Foundation EARTH recognizes that farmers everywhere place great value on conserving the richness and integrity of the environment in which we farm. Last year we asked farmers to make a Pledge to Earth. Dozens of producers around the country already are putting those plans in action. Some are building wildlife habitats, adding filter strips, expanding no-till acreage, and adopting precision farming practices that allow them to apply the most appropriate levels of fertilizers and other inputs. Our goal is to educate both farmers and consumers on technologies that boost profits yet protect the earth's limited resources. Steve Wentworth, former president of the National Corn Growers Association, raises corn and soybeans in Illinois. The above article appeared in the October/November 1996 issue of TOP PRODUCER.

"These handbooks are the most comprehensivecompilation to date of technical data regarding corn co-products,"said Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association. "They will be an instrumental tool in marketing the 1.4billion tons of byproducts that are produced each year to livestockproducers." The guides, "Feed Co-Products of the CornWet Milling Process" and "Feed Co-Products ofthe Corn Dry Milling Process," provide valuable informationfor the feeding industry on the nutritional, economic, productionand use value of corn co-products. Each handbook contains a descriptionof the manufacturing of ethanol process, nutrient composition,livestock feeding trials, recommended feeding levels and references. The processes of producing ethanol for fuel and beveragealcohol utilize only the starch portion of the grain, leavingbehind high-value, high-protein, high-vitamin content feed productscalled distillers dried grains or corn gluten feed. These feedscan provide a nourishing supplement to livestock and poultry diets. "Co-products from the milling of corn have importantnutritional properties that add value to feeding rations and livestockprograms," said Jerry Weigel, Director of Nutrition and RegulatoryAffairs at ExSeed Genetics, L.L.C., and chief author of the handbooks. "The books will be a valuable resource tool for dairy producers,cattle feeders, the poultry industry, nutritionists, feed consultants,veterinarians and feed sales personnel." "The availability of corn co-products providesa cost-competitive feed on a per-head basis," said Lucy Norton,Domestic Market Development Director of the Iowa Corn GrowersAssociation. "Corn co-products compete with other feed ingredients,helping to reduce overall feed grain costs to the producer." ### For copies of the handbooks, please contact theRFA at (202) 289-3835.
